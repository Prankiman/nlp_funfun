1
00:00:37,255 --> 00:00:39,316
All right, kids, assembly is starting.

2
00:00:39,317 --> 00:00:43,381
Now please take your seats for the
following presentation by the U.S. Army.

3
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:52,506
- What's up, y'all? I'm Sergeant Extreme!
- And I'm Major Awesome!

4
00:00:52,507 --> 00:00:57,018
We're here to tell you how much
the army kicks ass! Check this out!

5
00:01:24,727 --> 00:01:26,691
The army sounds awesome!

6
00:01:26,692 --> 00:01:28,433
And the recruiter said with any luck,

7
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:31,690
I could get the clap from
a 12-year-old Chinese prostitute.

8
00:01:31,702 --> 00:01:32,952
Wow, that's great.

9
00:01:32,966 --> 00:01:36,496
You'll be serving your country, just like
American film legend Mickey Rooney.

10
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:39,561
Hi. I'm former biggest star
in the world, Mickey Rooney.

11
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:43,132
And as you may know, I am
totally and completely insane.

12
00:01:43,135 --> 00:01:45,421
I like to yell at mice with my shirt off.

13
00:01:48,365 --> 00:01:51,002
Sometimes I like
to steal other people's scabs.

14
00:01:54,496 --> 00:01:56,192
How do I stay so crazy?

15
00:01:56,195 --> 00:01:58,092
Mickey Rooney's Crazy Pills!

16
00:01:58,098 --> 00:02:00,023
Take one with breakfast, one with lunch,

17
00:02:00,027 --> 00:02:03,712
and before you know it, you'll be up
on your roof; pooping in the chimney.

18
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:05,802
Hold out your stockings, kids!

19
00:02:06,098 --> 00:02:09,102
Chris, you can't join the army,
you're too young.

20
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:10,892
Besides, the army is weak.

21
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,951
Now, the marines,
those are the men you want to.

22
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,202
Are you kidding, Lois? The army's great!

23
00:02:16,205 --> 00:02:19,142
You get to save money for college,
there's free food,

24
00:02:19,145 --> 00:02:21,621
and all the brown people you can rape.

25
00:02:21,626 --> 00:02:24,051
I am sorry, but he is not joining the army.

26
00:02:24,057 --> 00:02:25,322
Case closed.

27
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:28,952
I can't believe they're brainwashing
kids like Chris to serve in the military.

28
00:02:28,956 --> 00:02:31,590
Ah, yes, the bottom ten percent
of our high school class

29
00:02:31,596 --> 00:02:33,162
is off to fight another battle.

30
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:34,781
- You stole that from The Onion.
- What?

31
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:37,342
I read that in The Onion.
About the war in Iraq.

32
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:40,680
Well, if that's true, then I'd say they've
got some sharp cookies over at the, uh...

33
00:02:40,698 --> 00:02:42,310
Wh-What is it again? The Onion?

34
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:44,020
So if I go up to your room right now,

35
00:02:44,028 --> 00:02:45,820
I'm not gonna find
a copy of The Onion, right?

36
00:02:45,827 --> 00:02:46,530
No.

37
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,051
- Ow! Damn it!
- That's what I thought.

38
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,131
<i>Coming this fall,</i>

39
00:02:54,135 --> 00:02:56,092
<i>if you loved
Everybody Loves Raymond,</i>

40
00:02:56,127 --> 00:02:59,813
<i>then you'll love his brother,
Robert, even more, in Robert.</i>

41
00:02:59,815 --> 00:03:02,530
I bet you Debra really gave it
to Ray today.

42
00:03:02,538 --> 00:03:06,232
I bet you she made a sandwich that
wasn't very good, but he ate it anyway.

43
00:03:06,378 --> 00:03:09,351
And then she got mad at him
'cause he gave her a funny look.

44
00:03:09,578 --> 00:03:11,023
I miss Ray.

45
00:03:13,887 --> 00:03:17,631
I can't believe Chris would just buy into
that army recruiter's sales pitch.

46
00:03:17,636 --> 00:03:19,381
We can't let him enlist.

47
00:03:19,388 --> 00:03:21,530
Don't worry, Lois,
all he needs is an after-school

48
00:03:21,547 --> 00:03:24,601
activity to get his mind off the army.
Just something to distract him.

49
00:03:24,607 --> 00:03:28,402
You know, like all of America gets
distracted whenever a cute white girl dies.

50
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:32,193
We regret to report that not all the
children onboard the school bus survived.

51
00:03:32,196 --> 00:03:34,570
We have identified the body of one victim,

52
00:03:34,576 --> 00:03:36,663
nine-year-old Becky Gunderson.

53
00:03:37,335 --> 00:03:40,023
No, wait, that's, uh, Becky Gutierrez.

54
00:03:40,528 --> 00:03:41,680
That's not news.

55
00:03:44,136 --> 00:03:46,342
B- Brian, wha... what are you doing?

56
00:03:46,456 --> 00:03:48,042
Gymboree is that way.

57
00:03:48,048 --> 00:03:49,981
Brian, it's parachute day!

58
00:03:49,985 --> 00:03:52,063
I just want to swing by
the army recruiting center

59
00:03:52,068 --> 00:03:55,012
and give a piece of my mind to that
jerk who tried to brainwash Chris.

60
00:03:55,016 --> 00:03:57,890
We are gonna be so late.
I'm not gonna have a partner.

61
00:03:57,898 --> 00:03:59,711
I'm gonna have to be partners
with the teacher.

62
00:03:59,718 --> 00:04:02,370
It's just wrong for the military
to mess with kids' minds.

63
00:04:02,385 --> 00:04:04,660
They're all gonna wind up in therapy,
like Peter was.

64
00:04:04,675 --> 00:04:06,303
Every time my daughter opens her mouth,

65
00:04:06,316 --> 00:04:08,721
I just want to punch her in the face.
She's really annoying.

66
00:04:08,728 --> 00:04:10,312
Uh-huh. All right, let's explore that.

67
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:12,220
What the hell's wrong with you?
Your skin's, like,

68
00:04:12,227 --> 00:04:13,413
moving around or something.

69
00:04:13,425 --> 00:04:15,341
I believe
I'm having some sort of seizure.

70
00:04:18,218 --> 00:04:21,082
What kind of after-school activity
should I do, Dad?

71
00:04:21,088 --> 00:04:23,370
Well, Chris, there's a lot
of fun activities out there.

72
00:04:23,377 --> 00:04:25,662
For example,
I used to be a horse whisperer.

73
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:32,692
Pfft, maybe if she spent some time
on the treadmill and I was drunk.

74
00:04:33,758 --> 00:04:35,202
I wouldn't, either.

75
00:04:35,236 --> 00:04:38,332
I don't think any of this stuff
is right for me, Dad.

76
00:04:38,355 --> 00:04:40,740
Let's just face it... I suck!

77
00:04:43,475 --> 00:04:46,120
Sounds like you guys
could use some fresh blood.

78
00:04:46,137 --> 00:04:47,410
This is my son, Chris.

79
00:04:47,436 --> 00:04:49,952
You should hear his voice.
It's absolutely gorgeous.

80
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:52,300
Like Laura Dern if
she didn't look like a banana.

81
00:04:52,307 --> 00:04:53,463
He can sing?

82
00:04:53,466 --> 00:04:55,522
Yeah, runs in the family.
See, look.

83
00:04:55,557 --> 00:04:58,783
<i>I am Peter Griffin, I like fancy food</i>

84
00:04:58,816 --> 00:05:01,980
<i>I like reading comic books
and dressing like a dude.</i>

85
00:05:01,987 --> 00:05:03,280
Yeah, rock and roll!

86
00:05:06,738 --> 00:05:07,813
Did you hear that?

87
00:05:07,818 --> 00:05:10,262
Guys, I think we just found
our new lead singer.

88
00:05:10,267 --> 00:05:11,262
Awesome!

89
00:05:11,266 --> 00:05:14,672
I'm gonna be a famous music star,
like Muddy Waters!

90
00:05:14,696 --> 00:05:17,590
Muddy? Baby?
Everything all right in there?

91
00:05:17,595 --> 00:05:20,420
<i>Oh, I think I'm about to pass
a kidney stone.</i>

92
00:05:37,316 --> 00:05:39,500
Boy, I can't wait to lay into
that recruiter.

93
00:05:39,508 --> 00:05:41,592
Yes, you'll be about as effective
as the Wizard of Oz

94
00:05:41,597 --> 00:05:43,250
was at granting wishes.

95
00:05:43,258 --> 00:05:45,330
And, Dorothy, you wanted herpes,

96
00:05:45,338 --> 00:05:47,940
but little did you know,
you've had herpes all along.

97
00:05:47,946 --> 00:05:49,721
I didn't want herpes!

98
00:05:51,235 --> 00:05:52,050
Well...

99
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,763
you've got it.

100
00:05:53,765 --> 00:05:55,792
Yes, uh, I'd like to see
the army recruiter.

101
00:05:55,797 --> 00:05:58,303
Oh, you'll have to have a seat.
There's a 25-minute wait.

102
00:05:58,308 --> 00:05:59,810
25 minutes?

103
00:05:59,815 --> 00:06:02,700
Oh, God. All right, I better go put more
money in the meter.

104
00:06:05,808 --> 00:06:08,871
Peggy, would you send in the next...
Oh, you're already here.

105
00:06:08,888 --> 00:06:11,142
Say, aren't you a little young
to join the army?

106
00:06:11,145 --> 00:06:14,453
No, I have that, uh... Webster disease.

107
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,812
Hey, is that the M9 double-action pistol?

108
00:06:16,818 --> 00:06:19,012
Sure is. Standard issue in the army.

109
00:06:19,015 --> 00:06:20,680
- Where do I sign?
- Right here.

110
00:06:20,688 --> 00:06:23,400
Did I mention there's a hundred-dollar
bonus if you sign up a buddy?

111
00:06:23,406 --> 00:06:27,020
Really? Well, I think I have a surprise
for somebody.

112
00:06:28,577 --> 00:06:30,160
There you are.

113
00:06:30,168 --> 00:06:32,970
Congratulations,
you are both in the army.

114
00:06:32,978 --> 00:06:35,471
We're bothin... What?
That's ridiculous.

115
00:06:35,477 --> 00:06:37,283
I'll tell you what's ridiculous:
the Kaiser.

116
00:06:37,288 --> 00:06:38,763
Somebody should put him on a roll.

117
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:40,850
<i>Over, we're comin' over</i>

118
00:06:40,855 --> 00:06:43,291
<i>And we won't come back
till it's over over there.</i>

119
00:06:43,295 --> 00:06:44,160
C ommercial!

120
00:06:44,185 --> 00:06:45,860
Damn!
Play me some filler, Johnny.

121
00:06:53,577 --> 00:06:55,153
Okay, they're dead, all right?

122
00:06:55,158 --> 00:06:56,781
We're not gonna be seeing them again.

123
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,663
My God!

124
00:07:00,695 --> 00:07:03,970
You are the sorriest bunch of rejects
I ever seen.

125
00:07:03,977 --> 00:07:06,120
And I've seen the Bangles in concert.

126
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,021
You! Where are you from, boy?

127
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:10,823
- Quahog.
- They only got two things in Quahog:

128
00:07:10,826 --> 00:07:12,393
steers and queers.

129
00:07:12,397 --> 00:07:15,941
I don't see no horns on you.
What does that make you, boy?

130
00:07:15,957 --> 00:07:17,061
- Queer?
- Right!

131
00:07:17,065 --> 00:07:18,283
- Oh, I got it?
- Yeah.

132
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:21,440
You find something funny, Private Dancer?

133
00:07:21,446 --> 00:07:24,402
Dancer for money?!
Any old music will do?!

134
00:07:24,405 --> 00:07:27,542
Well, actually, yeah, your last little,
uh, back-and-forth there with Stewie,

135
00:07:27,545 --> 00:07:30,190
that whole queer thing,
that was actually pretty funny.

136
00:07:30,415 --> 00:07:31,492
Oh, God!

137
00:07:31,497 --> 00:07:34,462
Ooh, that's got to hurt worse
than getting a birthday telegram from

138
00:07:34,468 --> 00:07:36,122
Zinedine Zidane.

139
00:07:37,197 --> 00:07:38,411
Yes?

140
00:07:39,516 --> 00:07:41,290
Bon anniversaire.

141
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:49,302
Yo, yo, what's up, James Woods High?!

142
00:07:49,306 --> 00:07:51,866
I'm Chris, and this is our band,

143
00:07:51,901 --> 00:07:53,371
Splash Log!

144
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:56,150
And we are gonna rock this place until...

145
00:07:56,225 --> 00:08:00,270
un... well, until about 9:30,
'cause that's when the dance is over!

146
00:08:02,275 --> 00:08:05,482
<i>Evil monkey holds the key</i>

147
00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:08,553
<i>Evil Monkey's gonna get me</i>

148
00:08:08,577 --> 00:08:13,003
<i>I'm hiding underneath my seat for fear
he'll point and show his teeth!</i>

149
00:08:13,385 --> 00:08:16,341
<i>Evil, evil monkey!</i>

150
00:08:16,556 --> 00:08:19,423
<i>Evil, evil monkey!</i>

151
00:08:19,606 --> 00:08:22,373
<i>Evil, evil monkey!</i>

152
00:08:26,855 --> 00:08:28,203
Mayor West?

153
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,290
Quiet, young man. Can't you see
we're having a poker game?

154
00:08:31,347 --> 00:08:33,290
Now, I'll ask again.

155
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:36,550
If I order a pizza,
will anyone else have some?

156
00:08:36,556 --> 00:08:37,893
I might have a slice.

157
00:08:37,895 --> 00:08:41,212
Well, you know, I'm gonna need more
of a commitment than that, Mark.

158
00:08:42,775 --> 00:08:45,110
West Side Story, Anything Goes.

159
00:08:45,116 --> 00:08:47,190
<i>West Side Story, Anything Goes.</i>

160
00:08:47,196 --> 00:08:49,320
Two of my favorite Broadway shows.

161
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:51,533
<i>Two of my favorite Broadway shows.</i>

162
00:08:51,535 --> 00:08:53,581
Miss Saigon and Cabaret.

163
00:08:53,586 --> 00:08:55,781
<i>Miss Saigon and Cabaret.</i>

164
00:08:55,796 --> 00:08:57,880
Overrated, I should say.

165
00:08:57,885 --> 00:08:59,910
<i>Overrated, I should say.</i>

166
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,063
One, two, three, four.

167
00:09:07,408 --> 00:09:08,630
<i>Mambo!</i>

168
00:09:17,528 --> 00:09:20,803
Griffin! You got four legs there!
You better start using them!

169
00:09:20,806 --> 00:09:21,830
I'm trying, sir.

170
00:09:21,845 --> 00:09:24,102
You got five seconds
to get to the head of the pack,

171
00:09:24,108 --> 00:09:28,230
or this entire platoon is gonna scrub
the latrines with their toothbrushes.

172
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,183
- Aw, come on, Brian!
- Don't screw us, Griffin!

173
00:09:30,187 --> 00:09:32,392
- Yeah, come on,
- don't screw us, Brian Griffin!

174
00:09:32,397 --> 00:09:35,282
Bill, how about thinking up
your own jeers for a change, huh?

175
00:09:40,116 --> 00:09:42,603
Four! Three! Two!

176
00:09:42,606 --> 00:09:45,050
- Oh, come on, Brian, get up!
- Time's up!

177
00:09:45,056 --> 00:09:47,702
You're pathetic, Griffin!
Pathetic!

178
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,861
Whose half-eaten dead bird
is in this footlocker?

179
00:09:55,868 --> 00:09:58,673
Let's say hypothetically that it
does belong to someone in here.

180
00:09:58,676 --> 00:10:01,001
Would admission of that allow
that person to keep it?

181
00:10:01,008 --> 00:10:04,651
Private Griffin, just for that,
you have to listen to one track

182
00:10:04,676 --> 00:10:06,302
from this Chris Gaines album.

183
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,523
- Don't you think that's a little extreme?
- Two tracks!

184
00:10:08,545 --> 00:10:10,840
It's so stupid,
it's just Garth Brooks in a wig.

185
00:10:10,846 --> 00:10:12,340
- Three tracks!
- Come on!

186
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:14,283
- We can go all day with this!
- Yeah, but...

187
00:10:14,288 --> 00:10:16,091
That's it! Every single track,

188
00:10:16,096 --> 00:10:17,870
plus the hidden bonus track!

189
00:10:17,876 --> 00:10:19,370
There's a hidden bonus track?

190
00:10:19,376 --> 00:10:21,403
Oh, I hope it's a ballad.

191
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:27,702
Huh. Should I follow
the knight into the dungeon

192
00:10:27,707 --> 00:10:29,853
or should I go back the way I came?

193
00:10:29,857 --> 00:10:31,093
Eh, I'll follow the knight.

194
00:10:31,096 --> 00:10:33,123
Page 37, page 37.

195
00:10:33,126 --> 00:10:36,560
Aah! Aah! I mean, go back the way I came.
I didn't take my hand off the page.

196
00:10:36,566 --> 00:10:39,112
You seen it, Lois, right?
You seen my hand on the page.

197
00:10:39,116 --> 00:10:40,863
Yeah, Peter, I seen it.

198
00:10:41,518 --> 00:10:43,431
Oh, no, not again.

199
00:10:43,446 --> 00:10:45,843
You know, I'm glad
Chris found an activity he likes,

200
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:47,951
but why do they have to use our garage?

201
00:10:47,956 --> 00:10:50,630
Come on, Lois, sometimes kids
can be a handful.

202
00:10:50,636 --> 00:10:52,640
Look at Gregory Peck's kids.

203
00:10:52,675 --> 00:10:55,483
- Are we there yet?
- It's crowded back here.

204
00:10:55,498 --> 00:10:59,172
- Stop touching me.
- Your leg is rubbing up against mine.

205
00:10:59,175 --> 00:11:01,490
Hey! Quiet down or I'm pulling over.

206
00:11:01,497 --> 00:11:03,962
- Stop breathing on the window.
- You idiot.

207
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:06,613
That's condensation. It's on the outside.

208
00:11:06,657 --> 00:11:09,562
That's it! I will come back there
and, so help me God,

209
00:11:09,565 --> 00:11:11,713
I will hit you with my ring hand.

210
00:11:19,837 --> 00:11:21,143
What the hell are you doing?

211
00:11:21,145 --> 00:11:22,823
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm leaving.

212
00:11:22,828 --> 00:11:24,851
You can't leave, man. That's desertion.

213
00:11:24,868 --> 00:11:27,722
They'll come after you like
Peter went after that hockey coach.

214
00:11:28,298 --> 00:11:30,312
Oh, no clip?
Oh, thought we had a clip.

215
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:32,950
Nope. Okay.
Uh, you can't leave, Brian.

216
00:11:32,955 --> 00:11:35,513
- You'll get life in prison.
- I'll take my chances.

217
00:11:35,515 --> 00:11:36,461
Let me ask you this:

218
00:11:36,465 --> 00:11:39,083
when was the last time you saw
something through to the end?

219
00:11:39,087 --> 00:11:40,893
- Well, I, uh...
- Never, that's when!

220
00:11:40,898 --> 00:11:42,000
You need this, Brian.

221
00:11:42,008 --> 00:11:44,512
You dropped out of college.
You still haven't finished your novel.

222
00:11:44,518 --> 00:11:46,372
Do you know what you lack?
Discipline!

223
00:11:46,377 --> 00:11:48,883
And so you know where you'll get it?
Right here in the army!

224
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:51,011
Boy, you know what, you're right.

225
00:11:51,018 --> 00:11:54,020
Everything I've ever done
I've crapped out on halfway through.

226
00:11:54,025 --> 00:11:57,072
Well, not this time.
I am going to finish what I started.

227
00:11:57,076 --> 00:11:59,980
That's the spirit!
You can do anything you put your mind to.

228
00:12:00,008 --> 00:12:03,173
<i>You know, it's really hard to
masturbate with you guys talking.</i>

229
00:12:03,185 --> 00:12:04,712
<i>Not for me!</i>

230
00:12:04,795 --> 00:12:08,303
<i>Evil, evil monkey! Ow!</i>

231
00:12:08,305 --> 00:12:12,193
Chris, will you knock that off
for 2 minutes? We want to talk to you.

232
00:12:12,195 --> 00:12:13,531
Take five, guys.

233
00:12:13,535 --> 00:12:15,242
What do you buttheads want?

234
00:12:15,248 --> 00:12:17,170
You've been playing with your friends
long enough.

235
00:12:17,175 --> 00:12:19,721
Now it's time for you to come inside
and do your homework.

236
00:12:19,725 --> 00:12:21,891
It's time for you to piss off, redhead.

237
00:12:21,896 --> 00:12:22,473
What?!

238
00:12:22,477 --> 00:12:24,751
Hey, hey, Chris,
don't talk to your mother that way.

239
00:12:24,765 --> 00:12:27,741
Oh, way to stand up
for your woman there, fatty.

240
00:12:27,745 --> 00:12:30,443
Chris, what the hell
is going on with you lately?

241
00:12:30,447 --> 00:12:33,643
Ever since you hooked up with this band,
you're like a completely different person,

242
00:12:33,647 --> 00:12:35,251
and I don't like it one bit.

243
00:12:35,257 --> 00:12:37,581
I am expressing myself!

244
00:12:37,587 --> 00:12:40,900
Now, get out of my way!
I'm going to the park to loiter.

245
00:12:44,385 --> 00:12:47,123
- What the hell is his problem?
- I don't know.

246
00:12:47,136 --> 00:12:50,600
He's acting worse than you did when
you tried to cover your farts by coughing.

247
00:12:50,606 --> 00:12:52,813
Okay, welcome to the PTA meeting.

248
00:12:52,836 --> 00:12:56,520
On the subject of school lunches, I know
there's been some concern about nutrition...

249
00:12:56,825 --> 00:12:59,361
We've had complaints
about the soda machines...

250
00:12:59,668 --> 00:13:02,002
And I have spoken with the school board...

251
00:13:03,295 --> 00:13:05,463
Is there something you'd like to say,
Mr. Griffin?

252
00:13:05,468 --> 00:13:06,341
Uh...

253
00:13:06,738 --> 00:13:09,032
Noooo...

254
00:13:10,017 --> 00:13:10,880
No.

255
00:13:11,255 --> 00:13:12,341
No, I'm good.

256
00:13:15,025 --> 00:13:16,392
All right, men.

257
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:19,402
This obstacle course represents
the final test of your training.

258
00:13:19,408 --> 00:13:22,223
Almost all of you have completed it
in the allotted time.

259
00:13:22,226 --> 00:13:25,851
But as you know, as a unit,
you either all graduate,

260
00:13:25,856 --> 00:13:28,972
or none of you graduate.
Griffin, it's up to you.

261
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,711
All right, you can do this, Brian.
Come on, pray with me.

262
00:13:31,746 --> 00:13:33,020
Dear Lord...

263
00:13:33,236 --> 00:13:35,540
just stay out of our way.

264
00:13:35,576 --> 00:13:36,760
Okay, good luck.

265
00:13:36,785 --> 00:13:38,230
And... go!

266
00:13:58,228 --> 00:13:59,691
There's Waldo.

267
00:14:02,027 --> 00:14:04,481
- Fresh pepper?
- Yes, thank you.

268
00:14:05,165 --> 00:14:07,891
- Oh, that's plenty, thanks.
- None for me, thanks.

269
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,352
My boyfriend just dumped me.

270
00:14:10,356 --> 00:14:12,761
There's a lot of fish in the sea.
It's always darkest before the dawn.

271
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:14,590
If it's not meant to be, it's not meant to be.

272
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:15,540
Thanks!

273
00:14:17,507 --> 00:14:19,001
You did it, Brian! You did it!

274
00:14:19,007 --> 00:14:21,470
Oh, I say, this is an even bigger
accomplishment than

275
00:14:21,476 --> 00:14:24,130
getting Minnie Driver's head
to fit on screen.

276
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:25,270
Okay, back up.

277
00:14:25,696 --> 00:14:26,561
Further.

278
00:14:27,105 --> 00:14:28,891
- Move back some more.
- What?!

279
00:14:28,898 --> 00:14:30,360
Back up some more.

280
00:14:30,385 --> 00:14:32,371
I'm as far away as I can get.

281
00:14:32,395 --> 00:14:34,390
Okay, have her enter.
Action!

282
00:14:35,315 --> 00:14:36,572
Damn it. Cut!

283
00:14:39,168 --> 00:14:40,961
Congratulations, men.

284
00:14:40,978 --> 00:14:42,920
You've all passed basic training.

285
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:44,700
I'm proud to call you soldiers.

286
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,230
I'm sure you'll do your country proud
tomorrow morning,

287
00:14:47,236 --> 00:14:49,461
when you're all shipped off to Iraq.

288
00:14:49,465 --> 00:14:50,341
What?

289
00:14:50,345 --> 00:14:52,852
Oh, don't worry.
I'm sure he means Fraggle Iraq.

290
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:01,041
- Well, this isn't so bad.
- Yes, the people are friendly.

291
00:15:01,045 --> 00:15:04,423
I say, the media has totally blown
this whole thing out of proportion.

292
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,852
Okay, I go in store, I throw backpack.
Big boom.

293
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:10,700
No, no, no, you are big boom.
Big hero.

294
00:15:10,737 --> 00:15:13,061
Okay, right, so I throw backpack,

295
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,770
come back and have big hero party
with many virgins.

296
00:15:15,807 --> 00:15:18,191
No, no, no, no, no. You: boom.

297
00:15:18,205 --> 00:15:20,952
Oh, okay, okay. I put on backpack, boom.

298
00:15:20,976 --> 00:15:23,233
Then I come back, big hero, virgins.

299
00:15:23,818 --> 00:15:26,341
Okay, yeah.
See you in a few minutes, big hero.

300
00:15:26,387 --> 00:15:28,533
<i>Unit 17, this is base. Please report.</i>

301
00:15:28,537 --> 00:15:30,630
Ten-four, everything's Charlie 40-60.

302
00:15:30,635 --> 00:15:31,503
What does that mean?

303
00:15:31,505 --> 00:15:33,781
I don't know. I just thought you're
supposed to say names and numbers.

304
00:15:33,788 --> 00:15:35,430
Nobody's corrected me so far.

305
00:15:35,926 --> 00:15:37,311
What the hell was that?!

306
00:15:38,585 --> 00:15:40,123
Uh, help! Help!

307
00:15:40,138 --> 00:15:42,582
Uh, uh, I mean, ah, ah,
Charlie, Tango, Cash,

308
00:15:42,587 --> 00:15:45,431
uh, 47, Victor, Charlie,
Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman!

309
00:15:45,436 --> 00:15:47,580
Roger that.
We're moving to your position.

310
00:15:50,518 --> 00:15:54,461
Chris, your father and I are very upset
by this new attitude of yours.

311
00:15:54,466 --> 00:15:56,782
I don't care what you think of me!

312
00:15:56,785 --> 00:15:58,022
Oh, God, I envy that.

313
00:15:58,025 --> 00:16:00,830
I am so self-conscious
about what people think of me.

314
00:16:00,837 --> 00:16:02,391
I am out of here!

315
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:06,310
You know, I think I may have an idea
what's causing this behavior, Peter.

316
00:16:06,316 --> 00:16:08,100
Look at all this stuff.

317
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:10,860
Listen to these lyrics.

318
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:14,442
"I rip it hardcore like
porno-flick bitches. "

319
00:16:14,446 --> 00:16:17,980
"I roll with groups of ghetto bastards
with biscuits. "

320
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,331
Oh, look, they've got a translation
for white people:

321
00:16:20,336 --> 00:16:24,161
"I give 110 percent when it
comes to helping my community,"

322
00:16:24,206 --> 00:16:28,380
"even though I occasionally associate
with some less than reputable characters. "

323
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,720
Peter, these lyrics are filthy.

324
00:16:30,726 --> 00:16:33,802
All this violent music is
what's screwing Chris up.

325
00:16:33,816 --> 00:16:35,352
What the hell?

326
00:16:35,366 --> 00:16:38,811
Marilyn Manson!
Is that who's causing all this?

327
00:16:38,815 --> 00:16:40,832
Yeah, it's all him or her's fault.

328
00:16:40,836 --> 00:16:43,100
Who does he or she think he or she is?

329
00:16:43,105 --> 00:16:45,210
Look, you can totally see
his or her nipples.

330
00:16:45,247 --> 00:16:48,291
- That's obscene, maybe.
- There's only one thing to do.

331
00:16:48,297 --> 00:16:49,133
You're right,

332
00:16:49,136 --> 00:16:50,920
we got to find this Marilyn Manson

333
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:54,562
and I got to give that bastard or bitch
a piece of my mind or penis.

334
00:16:56,518 --> 00:16:59,212
All right, it shouldn't be too hard
to get ourselves kicked out.

335
00:16:59,217 --> 00:17:02,311
Right. We're just got to convince them
we're not army material.

336
00:17:02,337 --> 00:17:03,870
- Ready?
- All right, let's do it.

337
00:17:05,218 --> 00:17:07,101
Wow, look at how gay we are.

338
00:17:07,105 --> 00:17:09,430
I am so gay, with my gayness.

339
00:17:09,437 --> 00:17:10,853
Me, too. I'm...

340
00:17:10,925 --> 00:17:12,261
I'm a homo.

341
00:17:12,327 --> 00:17:15,121
- Any room for one more?
- Hell yeah!

342
00:17:17,447 --> 00:17:18,761
All right, last resort.

343
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:20,861
We get injured and go home
with purple hearts.

344
00:17:20,866 --> 00:17:21,842
Shoot me in the foot.

345
00:17:21,848 --> 00:17:23,273
What?
Shoot yourself in the foot.

346
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:24,883
No, no, no, they can tell by the angle.

347
00:17:24,888 --> 00:17:26,272
Here, you shoot me and I'll shoot you.

348
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:27,541
I don't think this is gonna work.

349
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,413
Of course it'll work. Ready? One...

350
00:17:29,727 --> 00:17:30,521
two...

351
00:17:30,725 --> 00:17:31,451
three!

352
00:17:32,157 --> 00:17:34,420
Damn it! Oh, my God! That hurts!

353
00:17:34,857 --> 00:17:36,971
- I think you missed me.
- All right, I'll try again.

354
00:17:36,978 --> 00:17:39,153
Uh, no, no, no, hang, hang on.
That looks like it's painful.

355
00:17:39,157 --> 00:17:41,120
Of course it's painful!
There's a bullet in my foot!

356
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:42,063
Now get over here!

357
00:17:42,065 --> 00:17:43,400
No, no, no, no, no! I changed my mind!

358
00:17:43,405 --> 00:17:45,211
- I don't want to do it!
- Come on, we had a deal!

359
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,540
No, no, no, no, don't point that at me!

360
00:17:46,545 --> 00:17:49,701
No, no, no, oh, come on,
this is flat out just not safe!

361
00:17:51,045 --> 00:17:52,761
Oh, you got me.
Ow. Ow. Ow.

362
00:17:52,776 --> 00:17:54,142
- Let me see.
- No, no, it's gross.

363
00:17:54,146 --> 00:17:56,253
- Let me see it.
- No, no, I don't want to gross you out.

364
00:17:56,258 --> 00:17:59,431
Oh, ow, oh, we are in so much pain
right now, the two of us.

365
00:17:59,438 --> 00:18:00,310
Oh, ow...

366
00:18:00,587 --> 00:18:01,933
Okay, that was real!

367
00:18:03,046 --> 00:18:05,611
Hey, hi, um, I'm Private Stewie

368
00:18:05,616 --> 00:18:07,122
and this is Private Brian.

369
00:18:07,136 --> 00:18:09,052
Uh, we both got shot in the foot,

370
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:12,143
so, uh, we figured an honorable
discharge would be in order

371
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,410
and, uh, you could just send us
back to the States.

372
00:18:14,415 --> 00:18:16,551
Getting shot doesn't get you
out of here anymore.

373
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:17,260
What?

374
00:18:17,265 --> 00:18:18,631
Yeah, we take whatever we can get.

375
00:18:18,636 --> 00:18:21,483
I mean, we got two dead guys
guarding the ammunition.

376
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,032
Sorry, guys,
you are here until the job is done.

377
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:26,620
Great news, everybody.

378
00:18:26,627 --> 00:18:28,710
Democracy just kicked in!

379
00:18:49,846 --> 00:18:51,893
So it's over?
That seems unlikely.

380
00:18:51,895 --> 00:18:52,992
Amazing.

381
00:18:52,996 --> 00:18:56,980
There was only one man in the world with
the vision to predict something like this.

382
00:18:59,425 --> 00:19:00,401
Damn.

383
00:19:02,078 --> 00:19:03,712
Laura! Laura!

384
00:19:03,715 --> 00:19:04,841
Laura!

385
00:19:10,336 --> 00:19:13,703
And the Grammy
for Biggest Posse goes to...

386
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:15,050
Ja Rule.

387
00:19:15,055 --> 00:19:15,992
What?!

388
00:19:15,995 --> 00:19:17,991
No, Madonna. "Posse. "

389
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,111
"Posse. "

390
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:19,893
Oh.

391
00:19:22,877 --> 00:19:25,562
All right, Marilyn Manson
has to be here somewhere.

392
00:19:25,578 --> 00:19:27,860
Good thing we distracted the guard
with that riddle.

393
00:19:27,877 --> 00:19:30,641
What gets wetter as it dries...?

394
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,053
A towel.

395
00:19:32,057 --> 00:19:33,371
Hey, I've been had!

396
00:19:34,387 --> 00:19:36,031
Hey, look, right over there.

397
00:19:36,616 --> 00:19:37,772
Hey, Manson!

398
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:39,880
What in the world was that for?

399
00:19:39,886 --> 00:19:42,652
- Oh, it's a guy.
- That's for ruining our son.

400
00:19:42,657 --> 00:19:45,891
He used to be a sweet boy
until he heard your music.

401
00:19:46,196 --> 00:19:47,572
This old story.

402
00:19:47,577 --> 00:19:48,993
If I had a nickel...

403
00:19:48,996 --> 00:19:50,580
All right, where's your son?

404
00:19:50,587 --> 00:19:54,750
<i>I'm hiding underneath my seats for fear
he'll point and show his teeth!</i>

405
00:19:54,766 --> 00:19:57,791
Chris? We brought someone
you might like to meet.

406
00:19:58,436 --> 00:20:01,071
Oh, my God, Marilyn Manson!

407
00:20:01,077 --> 00:20:03,943
Hey there, Chris.
You working hard or hardly working?

408
00:20:05,857 --> 00:20:07,912
- So I see you're in a band.
- Yep.

409
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,432
Listen, your parents tell me
you've been acting out a little bit.

410
00:20:10,437 --> 00:20:13,931
And I just wanted to tell you,
rock n' roll music is cool,

411
00:20:13,938 --> 00:20:17,251
but respect for your elders
is a tune we can all dance to.

412
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:18,892
- Really?
- Sure.

413
00:20:18,906 --> 00:20:22,170
And the best way to start a fun-filled
day of being a good citizen

414
00:20:22,186 --> 00:20:25,212
is with a healthy breakfast
rich in breads and grains.

415
00:20:25,217 --> 00:20:26,862
And fruits are important, too.

416
00:20:26,868 --> 00:20:29,880
You mean like apples, oranges
and bananas?

417
00:20:29,887 --> 00:20:32,031
Any of 'em, Chris. You can't miss.

418
00:20:32,036 --> 00:20:34,412
And now, I think your parents
have something to say.

419
00:20:34,427 --> 00:20:38,232
Chris, you don't really believe all the
things in those song lyrics, do you?

420
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,241
No.

421
00:20:39,248 --> 00:20:41,440
Then why you been acting like
such a punk?

422
00:20:41,445 --> 00:20:43,351
I guess I don't really know.

423
00:20:43,358 --> 00:20:45,020
I think I have an idea.

424
00:20:45,025 --> 00:20:48,310
Peter, when was the last time you
and Chris here did something together?

425
00:20:48,318 --> 00:20:50,182
Boy, I guess it's been a while.

426
00:20:50,185 --> 00:20:51,820
Here's something you might not know:

427
00:20:51,827 --> 00:20:53,713
Children crave structure.

428
00:20:53,715 --> 00:20:56,012
They enjoy the fun of planned activities

429
00:20:56,016 --> 00:20:59,480
in which they and their parent or
guardian can share a common goal.

430
00:20:59,497 --> 00:21:01,081
Maybe you could take Chris fishing.

431
00:21:01,088 --> 00:21:04,413
What do you say, Chris?
You want to go fishing with your old man?

432
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:05,811
Do I?

433
00:21:05,818 --> 00:21:07,921
Can't go without these.
