2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,800
It seems today that all you see

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,800
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,400
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,300
On which we used to rely?

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,500
Lucky there's a family guy

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,200
Lucky there's a man who positively
can do all the things that make us

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,900
Laugh and cry

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,900
He's a family guy

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,100
Dad, can you help me with my math?

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,600
Mr Shackleford says if I don't learn it
I won't be able to function in the real world.

12
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,000
OK, you gotta go down the road
past the old Johnson place.

13
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,500
You're gonna find two roads,
one parallel and one perpendicular.

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,600
Keep goin' until you come to a highway
that bisects it at a 45-degree angle.

15
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,700
Solve for X.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,500
Maths. Huh!

17
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,800
Math, my dear boy, is nothing more
than the lesbian sister of biology.

18
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,800
- Hello, sir.
- Enough foreplay. What you sellin'?

19
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,900
Well, I was gonna try to sell you
some Handsome Cream,

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
but I can see you already
bought out the store.

21
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,100
- Go on.
- So perhaps you'd be interested

22
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,300
in something every homeowner
cannot be without: volcano insurance.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
- Go on.
- According to my uncle,

24
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,500
who's a real whiz with volcanos,
a volcano is coming this way.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,500
Hm. I too have an uncle.

26
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,300
Come in.

27
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,900
- How much is this volcano insurance?
- I-I don't know. Let's say $200.

28
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,000
$200?! That's more than I spent on
all that Handsome Cream. I don't have it.

29
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,400
- What about that jar of money?
- No way. That's Lois's rainy-day fund.

30
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:49,500
- Come on. It never rains in Rhode Island.
- Yeah, but we've never had a volcano either.

31
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,100
Well, don't you think we're overdue for one?

32
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,900
Touché, salesman.

33
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,100
- Agh! What the hell are you doing?!
- Watching you sleep, cutie-pie.

34
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,800
Why, you sick, sick little moo-cow!

35
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,200
You shall watch no more!

36
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,800
- Stewie!
- My glasses! I can't see a thing!

37
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,600
- Why won't you let me get laser surgery?
- I just don't think it's safe.

38
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,300
OK, just a quick incision here
and we should be all done, Mrs Wilson.

39
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,300
- Luke, use the Force.
- Really? Cos I was just gonna...

40
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,200
- Use the Force.
- OK.

41
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,200
- Are you happy?
- I've never been happy.

42
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,500
Oh, don't worry, honey.
We'll get you a new pair tomorrow.

43
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,100
And in the meantime here's a vision test.

44
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,300
What is this? A poopy or a Toblerone?

45
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,100
We now return
to "Girlfriends" on Lifetime.

46
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,800
- Barry was over last night, and...
- Don't tell me.

47
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,300
He left the toilet seat up.

48
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,400
Oh, I ran into Frank. It's funny -

49
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,000
he fought in Vietnam, he's an exorcist,
but there is one thing that terrifies him.

50
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,100
Commitment!

51
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,000
Oh, Midge. You're my third best friend
in the whole world.

52
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,100
- Third? Who are the first two?
- Ben and Jerry.

53
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,500
Peter, did you take the money
from the family jar?

54
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,800
Who, me? Yes, me.
Couldn't be. Then who?

55
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,100
Yeah, I did it. I bought volcano insurance.

56
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,700
Volcano insurance? That's ridiculous.

57
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,700
That's what you said when you
talked me out of getting cloud insurance.

58
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,600
Look at them up there.
Just plottin'. Picking their moment.

59
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,600
So, Bill, we attack tomorrow?

60
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,700
Yes. Tomorrow.

61
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,900
- I mean it this time.
- I do too.

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,200
Peter, that was our emergency money. And
your daughter needs a new pair of glasses.

63
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,500
- Lois, no one really needs glasses.
- You wear glasses.

64
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,600
That's only to fool the man
from the draft board.

65
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,100
I can't believe you squandered that money.

66
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,300
I swear, sometimes I feel
like I'm married to a child.

67
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,200
What can I say about my beautiful bride?

68
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,300
Except "Milk, milk, lemonade,
around the corner fudge is made. "

69
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,800
Watch who you're calling a child, because if
I'm a child, you know what that makes you?

70
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,100
A paedophile. And I'll be damned if I'm gonna
stand here and be lectured by a pervert.

71
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,100
Can you believe it?
Lois thinks I'm bad with money.

72
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,600
She's got a point. You're the white version of
a black guy who's not good with his money.

73
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,400
Hey-hey, guys and dolls.
Drinks are on doh-ray-mi.

74
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,900
- Where'd you get that?
- This is from my stockbroker Ian Greenstein.

75
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,700
He made some smart investments
that really paid off.

76
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,700
That guy is to money
what Miss Ann-Margret is to...

77
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
Let me buy the drinks, Quagmire.

78
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,200
My accountant Larry Rosenblat
just got me a huge tax refund.

79
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,400
And tickets to Bring In 'Da Noise,
Bring In 'Da Funk.

80
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,400
The noise was good, but I thought
they phoned in a lot of the funk.

81
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,300
Wait. Rosenblat? Greenstein? You're saying
I need a Jewish guy to handle my money.

82
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,100
Peter, not every Jewish person
is good with money.

83
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,700
Well, yeah, not the retarded ones,
but why would you even say that?

84
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,700
For shock value? Jeez, Cleveland, there's
edgy and there's offensive. Good day, sir!

85
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,200
Mother, you know how
I hate asking for money, but...

86
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,600
Mother, Peter's an excellent provider.

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,600
No, Mother, I do not think I'd be
better off married to a chimp.

88
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,600
I don't care how well that chimp
across the street is doing.

89
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,400
Really? Well, yeah, OK,

90
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,900
I guess you can tell him I said hi.
But don't make me sound desperate.

91
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,900
I gotta get a Greenstein or
a Rosenblat of my very own.

92
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,600
Nothing else has worked so far

93
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:55,100
So I'll wish upon a star

94
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,600
Wondrous dancing speck of light

95
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:05,300
I need a Jew

96
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,700
Lois makes me take the rap

97
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,700
Cos our chequebook looks like crap

98
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:20,400
Since I can't give her a slap

99
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,700
I need a Jew

100
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,400
Where to find

101
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,500
A baum or stein or stin

102
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
To teach me how to whine

103
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:43,500
And do my taxes?

104
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,000
Though by many they're abhorred

105
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,100
Hebrew people I've adored

106
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,300
Even though they killed my Lord

107
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,700
I need...

108
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,200
A...

109
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,100
Jew

110
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,800
Hi. My name's Max Weinstein. My car
just broke down. May I use your phone?

111
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,900
Now my troubles are all through

112
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,600
I have...

113
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,600
A...

114
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,500
Jew

115
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,300
Hey!

116
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,300
I prayed for you, Max Weinstein.
And here you are!

117
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,000
OK... Listen, uh, thanks for
letting me use the phone.

118
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,900
Thanks for Spaceballs.

119
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,100
- Well, if there's anything I can do for you...
- You can't leave!

120
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,200
Aaargh!

121
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,300
- What do you want?!
- Financial advice.

122
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,000
How the hell did you know
I'm an accountant?

123
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,300
Hello?! Max Weinstein?

124
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,700
I'll try, but I don't know why you
think I can get your money back.

125
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,400
Max, Max, Max, let's not deny our heritages.
You're Jewish; you're good with money.

126
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:01,600
I'm Irish; I drink and I ban homosexuals from
marching in my parade. Now get my money.

127
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,500
Oh. It's you. Um...

128
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,600
I'm not in right now.
Please leave a message. Beep!

129
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:17,300
Man, I hate these things. Uh, yeah, hi,
this is Peter Griffin. Sorry I missed you...

130
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,700
Peter, play with this. Sir, I reviewed
this contract and it offers no cover at all.

131
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,000
It just says "volcano insurance"
over and over again.

132
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,700
And down here in small print it says "He's
signing it, he's signing it, I can't believe it. "

133
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,800
So?

134
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,900
Refund this man's money and we'll go.

135
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,100
- I don't have your money!
- How about that money?

136
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,900
No way! That's Lois's rainy-day fund!
Ah, dammit.

137
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,200
- You didn't date her cos she was a tickler?
- Tickler!

138
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,900
- You're not a stickler for a tickler?
- Not a stickler.

139
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Not a tickler stickler?

140
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,500
- Tickler stickler ickler...
- Ickler tickler...

141
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,500
- Where the hell is the remote?
- Hey, honey, guess what?

142
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,400
- I got back the money for Meg's glasses.
- Really?

143
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,100
Oh, honey! Oh, hello.

144
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,600
This is my special friend
Max Weinstein. He's Jewish.

145
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,900
- Ooh, my. How exotic.
- Thank you...?

146
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,100
See, here's your rainy-day money,
and I balanced our chequebook too.

147
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,600
- You balanced our chequebook?
- Yep. Isn't that right, Max?

148
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,500
Mm? Oh, yeah, sure. He did it.

149
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,100
I'm gonna call my mother right now and
tell her to tell that chimp across the street...

150
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,400
Look how low I've sunk. Taking credit
for something a smart Jewish person did.

151
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,800
- That's OK, Peter.
- People have done that for too damn long!

152
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,500
It is the white devil that has propagated,

153
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,200
exacerbated, instigated...

154
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,400
Instigated... Line?

155
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,000
Instigated our hatred like a Buick.

156
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,700
God, what was I thinking
when I agreed to this?

157
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,700
This is so degrading. This is worse
than the time I was at the Friars Club

158
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,000
and Soon-Yi's retainer fell out of my pants.

159
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,300
Lois, I appreciate
the marshmallow and fish casserole,

160
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,100
but I'm sorry, I can't eat this.

161
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,500
Oh, because it's not kosher?

162
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,500
- Yeah, let's go with that.
- Can Stewie and me be excused?

163
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,200
- He's gonna help with my math homework.
- Chris, he's just a baby.

164
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,600
Oh, and you're a regular Rhodes scholar

165
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:20,100
Where was it you graduated from again?
Hm? The University of Duhhhh?

166
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,100
- I can help you with your homework, son.
- God! Is there nothing you people can't do?

167
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,700
- I mean, other than manual labour.
- Peter! What a ridiculous thing to say.

168
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,900
They built the pyramids. You'll have to
excuse Peter. He can be tactless sometimes.

169
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,500
Like when he soiled himself
at that dinner party.

170
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,400
I was so sorry to hear
that your father passed away.

171
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,500
Yes. It spread through his body so fast,
but he's at peace now, and the whole thing...

172
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,300
Uh-oh!

173
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:53,100
Well, there's only one thing that'll top
a great dinner like that... Operation!

174
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,200
- May I play?
- Mom!

175
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,800
Thank you, but I can't stay.
It's Friday. I've gotta go to Temple.

176
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,100
Temple? Like Indiana Jones?

177
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,000
Will you just pick it up already?!

178
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,100
They better not be expecting money. I gave at
church and I'm sure it goes to the same god.

179
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,900
Peter! Max, it was nice of you
to invite us along.

180
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,700
Your husband's got a good heart
but his views on Judaism are misguided.

181
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,900
I'd consider it a mitzvah to educate him.

182
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,800
No, no! No, no, I don't think so.

183
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,600
It's not that I have ideological differences,
I'm just not a hat person.

184
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,800
Hey, I didn't know the principal
of Meg's school was Jewish.

185
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,000
Hey, there's Bill Nye the Science Guy.
And half of Lenny Kravitz.

186
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,300
Optimus Prime? He's Jewish?!

187
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:04,800
Jeez, Max, I don't know about this. I went to
Catholic school. I'm not sure this is allowed.

188
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,700
Ah, what the hell.

189
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,400
Oh dear. Sister Mary Joseph, it appears
Peter Griffin has entered a synagogue.

190
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,500
Lock and load, Brides of Christ!

191
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,100
Excellent, excellent.

192
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,800
- Hello.
- Oh, we're not Jewish.

193
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,000
But I hear you people
have such lovely services.

194
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,300
Oh, my God, I didn't mean "you people", I...

195
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,000
I-I didn't mean "Oh, my God" either.

196
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,800
I know he's your God too.

197
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,100
Shh.

198
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,500
And on this day, the Sabbath,
we gather here to...

199
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,400
Uh-oh!

200
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,200
Well, that was so nice.
A good sermon and such beautiful songs.

201
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,700
Yeah, just like that other
Jewish musical we saw.

202
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,700
A fiddler on the roof. Sounds crazy, no?

203
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:10,700
But here in our little village of Anatevka,
you might say each one of us...

204
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,900
Khan!

205
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,500
Kha-a-a-an!

206
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,700
- There's my cab. It was nice meeting you.
- Thanks for everything, buddy.

207
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,000
Mr Weinstein, I thought you were gonna
help me with my homework.

208
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,200
Sorry, son, I have to go.
But I'm sure you'll do just fine.

209
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,000
I dunno, Max. The kid's not exactly
an honour-roll student. Watch.

210
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,900
- Hey.
- He did it.

211
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,600
See?

212
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:39,300
Peter, you took me in, fed me dinner, came
to Temple with me. You're a nice family.

213
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,400
I have faith that Chris will
grow up to be a real mensch.

214
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,400
Lois, I just figured out how to make sure
Chris becomes a big success.

215
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,200
Tell me this has nothing
to do with Tony Robbins.

216
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,800
No, I learned my lesson.

217
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:58,800
- Could you sign this book, please?
- Tony Robbins hungry!

218
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,200
No, Lois. I'm gonna make Chris Jewish.

219
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,100
- What are you talkin' about?
- He thinks Chris will become smart.

220
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,900
You can't convert someone
because you think it'll help their grades.

221
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,800
I don't wanna hear another word about this.

222
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,800
- Where are we going?
- Son, it's too late for me, and Meg's a girl.

223
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:33,700
But for you the sky's the limit. We're gonna
go to that synagogue and turn you Jewish!

224
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,900
OK!

225
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Chris, duck.

226
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,700
Mr Griffin, I still don't understand.

227
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,000
Why exactly does your son
want to join the Jewish faith?

228
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,100
I dunno, he's bicurious.

229
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,800
I appreciate your interest,
but Judaism takes a serious commitment.

230
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,600
Elliot here has spent years preparing
for his Bar Mitzvah this Saturday.

231
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,300
A Bar Mitzvah! Perfect!
How much for one of those?

232
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,300
You can't just buy a Bar Mitzvah.
It requires a lot of study.

233
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:15,000
Can't we skip it? I mean, if Chris could study
he wouldn't need to become Jewish, right?

234
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,100
Right?

235
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,100
Right?

236
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,300
Don't worry, Dad. I don't need a Bar Mitzvah.
I'm OK just the way I...

237
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,800
Ow! Ow! Ow!

238
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,600
Now, we got no time to lose.
There's gotta be some place in America

239
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,600
where you can take a spiritual ceremony
that begins a lifetime commitment

240
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,700
and blow through it in about 20 minutes.

241
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,600
All right, Dad!

242
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,900
So, how do I look in my new glasses?

243
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:02,400
How shall I put this? In an attic somewhere
there's a portrait of you getting prettier.

244
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,500
Wow, someone needs a nap.
After lunch it's straight to bed, Stewie.

245
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,200
This isn't the first time
my wit has gone unappreciated.

246
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:15,600
And in the comedy competition,
Stewie Griffin receives three and a half stars.

247
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,900
Challenger Sinbad receives... four stars!

248
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
We have a new champion - Sinbad!

249
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,700
Stewie, any parting words?

250
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,800
Um, you know, I got beat, pure and simple.

251
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,900
You-you are a very funny man.

252
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,900
"Men be acting all like zombies at the mall. "

253
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,200
God, ain't that the truth?

254
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,000
Where's your father and Chris?
It's not like them to be late for lunch.

255
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,300
I think they left a note.

256
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,700
- What do you know about this?
- Nothing.

257
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:01,300
- I know when you're lying to me, Brian.
- No, no, I swear.

258
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,800
Meg, take Stewie upstairs.

259
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,900
- What-what-what are you doing?
- Oh, you don't know that either?

260
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,000
Last chance, Brian.

261
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,900
Agh! They're in Vegas
gettin' a quickie Bar Mitzvah.

262
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,800
What?!

263
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,500
Well, hel-Lois! Forgive me for pointing.

264
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,800
Quick, I need to borrow your car.
I've got a Bar Mitzvah to stop.

265
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,300
No problem. Let me grab my keys.

266
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,900
Ah. Here they are.

267
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,800
Aw, Chris. In a few minutes you'll become
a smart, successful Jewish man.

268
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,800
I could make a foreskin joke
but this is a solemn occasion.

269
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,000
Besides, there'll be plenty of time
for that on the ride back.

270
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,300
Oh, I got so many of 'em, too.
I know, I know. "Shh. " But later...

271
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,800
Chris!

272
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,100
Chris!

273
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:46,000
- Stop this travesty right now.
- So Bar Mitzvahs are travesties, huh?

274
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,200
No. My son getting
Bar Mitzvahed is a travesty.

275
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,300
He's doin' it for all the wrong reasons.

276
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,600
Well, lookee here, Herschel.

277
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,600
We got us one o' them self-hatin' Jews.

278
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,600
Nothin' I hate worse than a Jew who
doesn't appreciate her own rich heritage.

279
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,900
Come on, Mordecai, let's get her.

280
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:25,100
I'm sorry, Lois. I just wanted our son
to be Jewish so he'd be smarter.

281
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,700
Then his wife wouldn't be sorry
she didn't marry the chimp next door.

282
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,700
Peter, just because Steven makes more
money than you doesn't mean he's smarter.

283
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,600
- And I think Chris will do just fine.
- How do you know?

284
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,500
Because I have faith in him,
the way I have faith in you.

285
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,700
Besides, a person's religion
is no guarantee of success.

286
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,400
I see what you're saying. The Jewish
are just like us. No better, no worse.

287
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,900
Yeah, and as they say, "zo Zion met grec".

288
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,600
- What?
- I think what he's trying to say is

289
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,000
everything's gonna be OK.

290
