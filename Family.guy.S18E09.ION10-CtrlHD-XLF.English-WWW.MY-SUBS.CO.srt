I see those looks.

25
00:01:16,533 --> 00:01:19,036
Yes, the movie was
originally released in summer,

26
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,622
but it took place on Christmas Eve,

27
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,289
which makes it a Christmas film.

28
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,419

Chris and Meg alert.

36
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,834
Oh. We have to go, uh,
call our congressman.

37
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,919
- What are they...?
- Hey, Mr. Quagmire.

38
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,368
Getting ready for the birth of Christ?

39
00:02:11,369 --> 00:02:13,120
Which happened!

40
00:02:13,121 --> 00:02:14,685
Chris. Megan.

41
00:02:14,686 --> 00:02:16,761
- Gross.
- So, how did you like the show?

42
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,179
I-I didn't love it.

43
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,972
H-Hey, have you guys seen that mom

44
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,474
who wears a swimsuit for a bra?

45
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:22,850
She can't come to these.

46
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,811
Her ex-husband has a
restraining order against her.

47
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,802
Boy, her stock just keeps going up.

48
00:02:27,803 --> 00:02:29,025
So, Christmas, huh?

49
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:31,942
- You guys must be excited.
- Ugh, not at all.

50
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,750
It's always disappointing.

51
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:35,988
Just a reminder
of how truly lonely I am.

52
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,075
- Hey-hey! Seamus, my man!
- Oh, hello.

53
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:41,240
Allow me to introduce you
to my son, Woody.

54
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:42,495
- Hey, Woody.
- Hey.

55
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,538
He's gonna be a new character
on the show.

56
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,457
You're barely a character on the show.

57
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,834
More than Woody!

58
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,881
Meg, there's a lot I have
to get done here,

59
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,509
so I need you to take Stewie
to the mall to meet Santa.

60
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,177
- Okay. Sure.
- Great.

61
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,306
Now, why don't you go warm up
the car for your little brother?

62
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,809
She's gone. Quick!

63
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,770
Let's take the picture
for the Christmas card.

64
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,403
I sent the wrong picture to Walgreens.

65
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,993
Oh, look, there's all the Jewish kids

66
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,495
sitting on the rabbi's lap,

67
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,789
where<i> he</i> asks<i> them</i> for something.

68
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,000
I want a new TV,
and it can't be a Vizio.

69
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,002
Sony or Samsung only.

70
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:35,181
And I need it all set up
before I turn it on.

71
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:38,676
I don't want to have to do
any of the things!

72
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,387
Okay, little guy. You're up.

73
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:54,403
So, little boy, what would you
like for Christmas?

74
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,702
What's wrong, little boy?

75
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,745
Don't be scared of Santa.

76
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,289
Come on, Stewie. It's okay.

77
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,207
Just sit on Santa's lap.

78
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,667
Ugh. Some people push their kids
to do stuff way too soon.

79
00:04:13,668 --> 00:04:15,629
Do you agree, Doctor Baby-Violin?

80
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,922
I really do.

81
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,094
Is it okay if I just hold
him for the picture?

82
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,638
Ho, ho, ho. Of course.

83
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,224
Sit right here, young lady.

84
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:31,061
Here you go, Stewie.
Santa's no one to be scared of.

85
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:34,815
He's kind and warm.
He loves unconditionally,

86
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,443
and... and he makes...

87
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:40,654
everyone feel so... so...

88
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,156
Meg, what are you doing?

89
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,867
You look like Mom when she sits
on the washing machine.

90
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,953
Now, what would you like
for Christmas, little boy?

91
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,955
Shut up, everyone! Shut up! Shut up!

92
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,332

I'll have what she's having.

98
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,522
Okay. She had six
well-done hamburger patties

99
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,524
jammed into a hard taco shell.

Oh. I just want to feel like that.

101

Okay. I mean, I can get it
for you, but it's a weird order.

102
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,032
The chef was not happy about it.

103
00:05:45,677 --> 00:05:47,973
Are you ready for me, Meg?

104
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,822
- Are you ready to get up?
- Huh?

105
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,950
I said it's time to get up.

106
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,326
It's 2:00.

I've never seen you sleep so soundly.

108
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,038
What's going on?

109
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,665
Mom, I think I met someone.

110
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,500
Oh, Meg, that's amazing.

111
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,085
I want to know all about him.

What's his name?

00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,714
Let's just call him "Beard Boy."

114
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:25,717
Oh! It's like I'm in <i>Sex with the City.</i>

115
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,762
It all happened so quick,
but I really feel something.

116
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:32,182
- Am I crazy?
- No. Trust your instincts.

117
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,681
You've got to chase this feeling.

118
00:06:33,682 --> 00:06:35,480
Go find Beard Boy.

119
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:37,981
I will, Mom. I will!

120

121
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,693

122
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,821

Hey. What's going on in here?

124
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,450
We're making the bread, sir.

125
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,869
Good. Now get back to making sandwiches

126

I mean, Santa Claus
was bouncing us on his knee.

142
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,330
And it got a little faster,

143
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,332
then faster, and the more he bounced,

144
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,954
the bigger Meg's eyes got.

145
00:07:39,955 --> 00:07:42,712
It was... it was...
Just look at the picture!

146

Wow. Okay.

147
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,842
Uh, Stewie,
I think I know what happened.

148
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,345
I can't tell you explicitly,
since we're owned by Disney,

149
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,430
but let me just say that

150
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:56,141
Santa made her "Little Mermaid" "Moana."

151
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,769
- Oh.
- Exactly.

152
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,232
Brian, would you hand me
the Fat Man's fancy puking hat?

153
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,951
God, this hat is deep.

154
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:18,623
Now, there's my hat.
Kids, I'm off to the opera.

155
00:08:19,901 --> 00:08:22,210
This opera stinks.

156
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,840
It was awful, Rupert.

157
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,342
And worst of all,
I didn't even get to ask Santa

158
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,825
for the Vitamix.

159
00:08:31,826 --> 00:08:34,805
Blender? It's more than a blender.

160
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:37,224
Stewie. I'm gonna
take you back to the mall

161
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,642
to sit on Santa's lap.

162
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,103
Oh, my God, I've got to hide!

163
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,695
How did she find me?
That's my best hiding spot. No!

164
00:08:46,696 --> 00:08:49,229
Oh, and by the way, Rupert,
after what I saw,

165
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,697
I know you've been faking it
this whole time.

166
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,669
Meg, please don't.

167
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,718
Listen, I've got seven dollars
in my piggy bank.

168
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:11,364
It's yours. No?
All right, uh, I'll kill Chris.

169
00:09:11,365 --> 00:09:12,637
You want me to kill Chris?

170
00:09:12,638 --> 00:09:14,678
Who do you want me to kill? Chris? No?

171
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,846
Okay. I got it.

172
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:18,265
Next road show, Stewie and Meg. Promise.

173
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:21,560
♪ <i>We're off on the road to Ohio.</i> ♪

174
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,854
High in the middle
and round at both ends!

175
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,439
Meg, I love our road show.

176
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,066
- Next.
- No!

177
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,278
Huh. Something's different.

178
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,176
Hey, uh, Meg? Uh, can you cut that out?

179
00:09:34,177 --> 00:09:35,290
Dad?!

180
00:09:35,292 --> 00:09:36,909
Please don't tell your
mother about this.

181
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,577
I took an extra job.

182
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,538
I don't make much money,
and Christmas is very expensive.

183
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:45,000
Dad? I'm gonna ask you one question,

184
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:48,378
and how you answer it will
determine the rest of my life.

185
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:51,423
Were you the Santa
at this mall yesterday?

186
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,217
- No.
- Oh, thank God.

187
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,427
Now, Meg, I got a question for you:

188
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,763
Is there really a weight limit
for the escalator,

189
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,473
or did I just meet some mean kids?

190
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,391
Hey, Peter, let's keep it moving.

191
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,393
Some stockbrokers are gonna
throw me into a gong later.

192
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,480
Excuse me. Do you remember
the Santa from yesterday?

193
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,649
Lady, I've been thrown
head first into so many gongs,

194
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,400
I don't remember my own name.

195
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,077
I think he was just a temp.
I'd try the Warwick Mall.

196
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:14,901
Thanks. Stewie, come on.

197
00:10:14,902 --> 00:10:16,582
We're going to the Warwick Mall.

198
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,077
Stewie?

199
00:10:20,744 --> 00:10:22,580
Chocolate sample.

200
00:10:24,438 --> 00:10:26,274
Again.

201
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:31,089
Just leave the carton.

202
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:33,169
- Santa's the best.
- I'm gonna ask for a bike.

203
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,592
I'm also enthusiastic about Santa.

204
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,512
All hail the great Santa Claus.

205
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:41,472
Yeah. This guy gets it.

206
00:10:41,473 --> 00:10:44,092
Wait a minute.
That noise seems negative.

207
00:10:44,093 --> 00:10:46,854
Santa's a good guy
'cause he keeps a list?

208
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,948
You know who else kept a list? Hitler.

209
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:51,483
My uncle who moved
to the Idaho wilderness

210
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,778
says Hitler was a great man.

211
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:54,788
There you are. Come on.

212
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:57,197
We've got to visit Santa
at another mall.

213
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,406
I can't go back to Santa, man! I can't!

214
00:10:59,407 --> 00:11:01,826
- Hello again.
- Hi.

215
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:05,082
That's the guy that was peeing
in the women's bathroom.

216
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:15,132
Stewie, when this is over,
I'm buying you a new toy.

217
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,509
Meg, when this is over,
I'm putting rocks in my pockets

218
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,909
and walking into the mall fountain.

219
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,847
How much longer is this gonna take?

220
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,807
I don't know. 400 minutes?

221
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,851
One reason I work as a seasonal elf

222
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,519
is I'm not great at time estimates.

223
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,813
- Next.
- See? 400 minutes.

224
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:33,398
Even a broken clock
is right six times a day.

225
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,442
He's very scared,
so I have to sit here with him.

226
00:11:35,443 --> 00:11:36,961
Would you mind bouncing me a little?

227
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:39,230
Um, okay. I guess I can do that.

228
00:11:40,243 --> 00:11:42,743
Hey, come on, a little harder than that.

229
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,372
- Look, I don't feel comf...
- Please! It's Christmas. Please!

230
00:11:45,373 --> 00:11:46,890
What does... what does
that have to do with...

231
00:11:46,892 --> 00:11:48,740
Just do it!

232
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,919
♪ <i>The itsy-bitsy spider</i> ♪

233
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,171
♪ <i>Went up the water spout...</i> ♪

234
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,006
Wait, wait, th-this isn't working.

235
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,082
Were you at the Quahog Mall last night?

236
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:01,845
No. L-Last night, I was weeping
outside my ex-wife's apartment.

237
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,719
I drank too much
and went over to yell at her.

238
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,179
Yeah, he's not your guy, Meg.

239
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,018
They said my Santa would
be here, and you're not him.

240
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,970
I'm sorry. Story of my life.

241
00:12:09,971 --> 00:12:12,105
I live to disappoint women, apparently.

242
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:15,071
Well, where is he? Where's my Santa?

243
00:12:15,072 --> 00:12:17,306
- I don't know!
- I need to find him.

244
00:12:17,307 --> 00:12:19,169
He made me a woman!

245
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,865
Where is he?

246
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,725
He's a phony!

247
00:12:24,726 --> 00:12:26,937
A great, big phony!

248
00:12:26,938 --> 00:12:29,706
Excuse me, ma'am, I'm gonna
give you just 600 minutes

249
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,415
- to get out of here.
- But you don't understand.

250
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,758
One, two, 600 minutes.

251
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:35,945
That's it. Security!

252
00:12:35,946 --> 00:12:37,699
What took you so long?

253
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,965
Let me go.

254
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:42,135
Lady, by the power vested in me
by Paul Blart,

255
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,096
you are now banned from this mall

256
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,961
and every mall in this county.

257
00:12:45,962 --> 00:12:50,060
W-Wait. I need my little brother.

258
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,771
Stewie!

259
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,527
Time to sleep in heavenly peace.

260
00:13:00,723 --> 00:13:03,391
Wow, looks like that baby is all wet.

261
00:13:05,747 --> 00:13:07,494
Classic Woody.

262
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,205
This is Woody.

263
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,838
So, you want to tell me
why you were assaulting Santa

264
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,423
in front of the whole mall?

265
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,216
What about Beard Boy?

266
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,510
Santa is Beard Boy.

267
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,470
You're in love with Santa?

268
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,847
Maybe.

269
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:29,641
He gave me my first... you know.

270
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,394
He just bounced me on his lap,
and the next thing you know,

271
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,187
- I saw Jimmy Connors.
- You saw Jimmy Connors.

272
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,690
It happens to every girl
their first time.

273
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,358
You'll never see him again, by the way.

274
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,152
I won't? Why not?

275
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,113
I don't know.
That's God's trick on women.

276
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:45,365
It's your first time,
followed by a lifetime

277
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,784
of diminishing returns.

278
00:13:52,705 --> 00:13:55,793
I wonder what I'll see on my first time.

279
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:16,518
I can't let Stewie grow up
scared of Santa Claus.

280
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,150
Ho, ho, ho.

281
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,022
Santa? Is that really you?

282
00:14:22,023 --> 00:14:24,237
- Sure is.
- Well, how'd you get in?

283
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,406
- Through the window.
- It was just unlocked?

284
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,101
Like, anybody can just come
through my window at any time?

285
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:31,079
- I really don't like...
- Forget about that.

286
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,414
I know you're having a tough time.

287
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,417
I just wanted to tell you
that everything is fine.

288
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,921
Meg is entering probably
the most horny part of her life.

289
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:43,006
This could just as easily have happened

290
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,800
while she was riding a horse
or something.

291
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,551
I'm just sorry you had to see it.

292
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,721
Okay. Don't want people
just coming in whenever.

293
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,183
Stewie, that Christmas magic
you think you lost,

294
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,102
it can't just disappear.

295
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:57,896
I'm still the same guy
you've always loved.

296
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,814
Thanks, Santa. I feel better.

297
00:15:00,815 --> 00:15:03,110
Just try to have a good Christmas.

298
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,237
Uh, speaking of that, I want a new dog.

299
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,114
What's wrong with the dog you have?

300
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:10,033
Eh, he's okay.
I just... I just want a new one.

301
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,661
Maybe you can spend more time
with the old one

302
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:15,330
- before you make any decisions.
- Nah. Want a new one.

303
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,457
Thanks, Santa.
Can you leave from the door?

304
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,004
I'm kind of freaking
over the window thing.

305
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:20,586
Sure.

306
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,297
Oh, my God. Santa?

307
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,970
- I want a new dog.
- Oh, come on!

308
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,848
There you are.

309
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,891
I had a hell of a time
finding your room.

310
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,603
Can I come in?

311
00:15:36,604 --> 00:15:38,904
- Cigarette?
- No.

312
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,494
Mind if I have one?

313
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:46,653
So, you want to talk about
this whole Santa's lap thing?

314
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:50,490
Dad, this stuff, I-I think it's
gonna be hard for you to hear.

315
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,200
Oh, don't worry, Meg.
I brought this handkerchief

316
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,000
to dab my forehead whenever
you say something sexual.

317
00:15:55,001 --> 00:15:57,330
- So, I'm-I'm sitting on Santa's lap...
- Oh, dear.

318
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,332
And it's like my whole body
starts to tingle.

319
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,342
Oh, my stars.

320
00:16:00,344 --> 00:16:01,751
And-and then there's, like, a-a deep...

321
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,170
I better loudly drop an Alka-Seltzer

322
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:04,921
in this glass of water.

323
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,549
Very loud fizzing.

324
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,426
I-I may need to widen my eyes

325
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,386
until they look like
a young girl's Snapchat filter.

326
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,180
Like, sort of a-a warm steam iron?

327
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:15,345
Okay. It's okay, Meg.

328
00:16:15,346 --> 00:16:19,186
Look, this Santa person
clearly made you very happy.

329
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,515
And I want my daughter to be happy.

330
00:16:21,516 --> 00:16:24,564
Go find your mall Santa, wherever he is.

331
00:16:24,565 --> 00:16:26,568
I love you, Dad.

332
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,361
And thanks for the pep talk.

333
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,238
Hey, I learned from the best.

334
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,579
You know, I played football for
Coach Joe Paterno at Penn State.

335
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,244
All right, team,
remember everything you learned

336
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,954
in practice this week

337
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,713
and forget everything
after practice this week.

338
00:16:40,714 --> 00:16:42,960
Break.

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I've got to get in there.

354
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,187
Sorry, sweetie. It's Christmas Eve.

355
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:47,938
Mall Quiet on the Western Front
closed 900 minutes ago.

356
00:17:47,939 --> 00:17:49,693
Oh, no.

357
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:52,454
Do you have a big cup
I can pee in for my ride home?

358
00:17:52,455 --> 00:17:54,614
Take my mostly done Jamba Juice.

359
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,617
And merry Christmas.

360
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,874
Wow. There was more in there
than I thought.

361
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,294
- Meg?
- Santa?

362
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:10,877
Yes, Meg. It's me, Santa.

363
00:18:10,878 --> 00:18:12,865
Oh, my God, there's a bench
right over there.

364
00:18:12,866 --> 00:18:14,509
Quick, let me sit on your leg.

365
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,219
No, that's not what I'm here for.

366
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,554
Yes, it is. Now, sit down.

367
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:20,307
Meg, no. Meg, no. Get off.

368
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,517
Geez, I'm trying to give you
a heartwarming message

369
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,935
of Christmas joy.

370
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,646
You know, the same feeling
you got when you were five

371
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,440
and I gave you that Malibu Barbie?

372
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,899
How did you know that?

373
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,110
I told you. I'm the real Santa.

374
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,405
I try to visit every mall
at least once during Christmas.

375
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,240
Except Long Island malls.

376
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,533
Those people are a little much.

377
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,493
Oh, no.

378
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,872
I can't believe I, you know,
grew up all over you.

379
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,166
It's okay, Meg. You see, I know

380
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:49,169
what each and every person
needs for Christmas.

381
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,839
For you, it was your first
time seeing Jimmy Connors.

382
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,884
But the truth is,
it had nothing to do with me.

383
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,511
The Christmas magic lives in there.

384
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:02,182
And as long as you believe,
it'll always be with you.

385
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:03,558
Deep inside.

386
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,226
- Inside my...
- Wherever you find it, yes.

387
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,145
Thanks, Santa.

388
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,863
You're welcome, Meg.

389
00:19:08,864 --> 00:19:10,857
Well, I'm off to distribute presents

390
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,234
to boys and girls all over the world.

391
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:16,071
All right, I'm gonna
put my leg up on this back tire

392
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:17,529
and take a she-wee.

393
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:22,035
You know, you don't have to say
everything out loud, Meg.

394
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,746
Wait, are you sure
you're the real Santa Claus?

395
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,081
Yes, I'm the real Santa Claus.

396
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,124
I'm totally real,
so don't tell anyone about this

397
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,626
and don't say anything to anyone.

398
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,544
Merry Chris...

399
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,713
Damn it.

400
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,021
Come on.

401
00:19:35,022 --> 00:19:38,466
I... I-I really got to go
behind the car.

402
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,391
Whoa!

403
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,118
Meg?

404
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:08,748
Hi. Merry Christmas.

405
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,750
I'm tennis bad boy Jimmy Connors.

406
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,043
How did you get in here?

407
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,545
I came in through your baby's window.

408
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:14,963
You can just open it.

409
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:17,257
Men are now just coming in at will!

410
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:20,009
I heard you had
a pretty confusing Christmas.

411
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,970
Yeah, it's tough being a teenager,

412
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:24,889
dealing with all these
new emotions and feelings

413
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,266
and streaming platforms.

414
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:29,436
I remember when I was your age,
I was confused, too.

415
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:32,897
Then I got a haircut
that I'd keep for 50 years.

416
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,525
You've just got to find
your one thing that works.

417
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:38,679
You mean a haircut like this?

418
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,621
Meg, I think you're gonna be just fine.

419
00:20:41,622 --> 00:20:45,076
But just in case, here.
I want you to have these.

420
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,186
- Your balls?
- That's right.

421
00:20:47,187 --> 00:20:48,413
Whenever you need me,

422
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,915
just rub my balls, and I'll come.

423
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,501
♪ <i>O come, ye</i> ♪

424
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:57,298
♪ <i>O come, ye, to Bethlehem.</i> ♪

425
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,968
Good night.
