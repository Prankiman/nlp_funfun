1
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,139
Oh, Joe, thank you so much
for  inviting us to your barbeque.

2
00:00:38,152 --> 00:00:39,726
Well, it's my pleasure, Lois.

3
00:00:39,856 --> 00:00:41,751
Hey, can one of you
weathermen come over here

4
00:00:41,752 --> 00:00:43,730
and comment on the
meat while I'm cookin' it?

5
00:00:43,731 --> 00:00:45,231
Yeah, I got it.

6
00:00:45,653 --> 00:00:48,150
Oh, yeah. Oh,
those are lookin' good.

7
00:00:48,562 --> 00:00:50,165
Yeah, that's
what I'm talkin' about.

8
00:00:50,386 --> 00:00:53,040
Yeah, don't flip 'em
too often, now. You
don't wanna lose the juices.

9
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:55,867
Yeah, yeah. Comin' along nicely.

10
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,804
Oh, those are cookin' just fine.

11
00:00:58,127 --> 00:01:00,789
Scoop that one up and put it
back down in the exact same spot.

12
00:01:01,002 --> 00:01:02,903
Alright, they're done! Time to eat!

13
00:01:02,904 --> 00:01:05,182
Oh boy! I'm so
hungry, I could eat a horse.

14
00:01:07,016 --> 00:01:09,868
I ... errr ... I mis-spoke.

15
00:01:12,158 --> 00:01:15,440
Wow, Bonnie, you really took
off the baby weight quickly.

16
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:16,687
Oh, thanks, Lois

17
00:01:16,688 --> 00:01:19,768
Hey, do mind rubbing some
of that sun-block on my back?

18
00:01:19,908 --> 00:01:21,408
Of course, Bonnie.

19
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:23,607
Ooh, but I don't
wanna get any on my shirt.

20
00:01:26,514 --> 00:01:29,029
Mmm ... that feels good.

21
00:01:31,345 --> 00:01:34,301
Um, you're going
a little low there, Lois

22
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,482
Ah-ha ha, ok, I'm sorry.

23
00:01:38,284 --> 00:01:39,123
Giggety!

24
00:01:41,891 --> 00:01:44,545
Ah, Joe, Susie's such a cute baby.

25
00:01:44,568 --> 00:01:46,284
Hey, whatever
happened to your son, Kevin?

26
00:01:46,285 --> 00:01:47,562
He died in Iraq.

27
00:01:47,563 --> 00:01:48,198
Sad.

28
00:01:48,499 --> 00:01:50,825
I won't let you walk out
of here without that dress.

29
00:01:50,826 --> 00:01:51,847
Oh, I don't know ...

30
00:01:51,848 --> 00:01:53,426
- Will I ever wear it?
- Yes you will.

31
00:01:53,427 --> 00:01:55,372
You've got that thing for the
opening of the library next week.

32
00:01:55,373 --> 00:01:56,873
It's perfect for that.

33
00:01:57,286 --> 00:01:58,301
Hey, everybody!

34
00:01:58,302 --> 00:01:59,802
Oh, look, it's Black Barbie!

35
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:01,003
And why are you all alone?

36
00:02:01,004 --> 00:02:03,208
Oh, they
discontinued my boyfriend.

37
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:07,242
Mom says I'm the one
who's hair it's OK to cut.

38
00:02:07,777 --> 00:02:09,543
Hey! I was playing with that!

39
00:02:09,903 --> 00:02:11,166
Hey, come back here!

40
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:12,867
Alright, you asked for it.

41
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:16,968
Holy crap!

42
00:02:17,755 --> 00:02:20,181
Alright, let's try that one again.

43
00:02:28,202 --> 00:02:29,511
Oh, my God, Stewie!

44
00:02:29,512 --> 00:02:32,531
Ha! Your kid got
beat up by a baby girl.

45
00:02:32,658 --> 00:02:37,383
Oh man, this is more painful
to watch than when Family Ties
does a Tina Yothers episode.

46
00:02:37,623 --> 00:02:39,607
Jennifer, What
happened in school today?

47
00:02:39,608 --> 00:02:40,886
I got my period!

48
00:02:40,887 --> 00:02:43,369
And I will see the
Keaton family next week.

49
00:02:48,015 --> 00:02:50,778
Ok, now, sweetie.
This isn't gonna hurt at all.

50
00:02:51,584 --> 00:02:54,388
Aaahh! Those lying bastards
at Johnson and Johnson!

51
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:57,016
We'll put "No More
Tears" on the label.

52
00:02:57,036 --> 00:02:59,744
- But, it does make you cry.
- I know.

53
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,216
Heh heh heh! Ah hah! Ha ha.
Ha-ha-ha-ha. Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

54
00:03:07,141 --> 00:03:09,294
Lois, you should just let
those wounds get infected.

55
00:03:09,295 --> 00:03:11,198
It'll teach him a
lesson about being tough.

56
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,753
Peter, he's just a baby.

57
00:03:12,754 --> 00:03:14,139
You gotta let this go.

58
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,490
My baby boy got beat up by a girl!

59
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:18,993
What was weird,
was that she was crying ...

60
00:03:19,107 --> 00:03:22,642
... but the way she
was standing over me,
made it look like I was crying.

61
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,107
Which was weird.

62
00:03:24,346 --> 00:03:27,220
Peter, what exactly are you worried
is gonna happen because of this?

63
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:28,625
World War 5!

64
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:29,918
Peter, we've been over this ...

65
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,699
There has to be a
World War 3 and 4 first.

66
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,313
Oh, no. Oh, no

67
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:34,753
That's the beauty
of World War 5, Lois.

68
00:03:34,754 --> 00:03:37,285
It's so intense, it
skips over the other two.

69
00:03:37,286 --> 00:03:38,139
Peter, it doesn't work ...

70
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,056
I have spoken!

71
00:03:43,978 --> 00:03:45,690
Huuh! There's Connie D'Amico

72
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:47,556
Chris, don't walk next to me.

73
00:03:48,594 --> 00:03:49,607
Hi, Connie.

74
00:03:49,608 --> 00:03:51,902
Uh, so, I heard you talking
in the hall the other day

75
00:03:51,903 --> 00:03:53,918
about how much you
liked High School Musical 2,

76
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:55,931
so I burned you the soundtrack.

77
00:03:56,137 --> 00:03:58,230
OK, prepare for itemised insults.

78
00:03:58,231 --> 00:04:00,385
A: Don't ever listen to me talk.

79
00:04:00,386 --> 00:04:01,699
You don't deserve my words.

80
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,083
B: When I said I enjoyed
it, I was speaking ironically.

81
00:04:05,084 --> 00:04:08,213
And ... C: You actually
liked High School Musical?

82
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:09,378
What are you, 8?

83
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:11,692
No, that's impossible,
because I've seen that big

84
00:04:11,693 --> 00:04:14,048
hairy mud flap arse of
yours in the locker room.

85
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:15,183
Questions?

86
00:04:15,184 --> 00:04:16,684
Hey, Meg, take that!

87
00:04:17,554 --> 00:04:18,877
Ha ha. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha.

88
00:04:18,973 --> 00:04:20,191
That was awesome!

89
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:22,097
The joke's kind of on us,
'cos we're smellin' it.

90
00:04:22,098 --> 00:04:23,785
- Yeah!
- Awesome!

91
00:04:23,786 --> 00:04:25,086
Oh, way to go, folks!

92
00:04:26,281 --> 00:04:28,047
Ugh! Scott is such an idiot!

93
00:04:28,048 --> 00:04:29,591
I'm totally breaking up with him.

94
00:04:29,592 --> 00:04:31,765
I'm gonna switch to one
of the other popular guys.

95
00:04:31,898 --> 00:04:34,889
But Connie, you've
gone out with, like, every
popular boy in this school.

96
00:04:34,938 --> 00:04:36,578
Ah, yeah, you're right!

97
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:38,222
God, they all suck so much!

98
00:04:38,223 --> 00:04:39,748
I need a new challenge.

99
00:04:40,127 --> 00:04:42,343
What if ... wait, now
bear with me on this ...

100
00:04:42,344 --> 00:04:45,918
What if I date a loser and make
him over into a popular guy?

101
00:04:45,972 --> 00:04:48,374
Wow, great idea!
I'm glad I hung in there.

102
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,036
Now, who are the
biggest losers in this school?

103
00:04:51,037 --> 00:04:52,597
Well, there's Smiley McGee.

104
00:04:52,766 --> 00:04:54,266
Hello!

105
00:04:54,313 --> 00:04:56,577
Nah. I hear he's a bed wetter.

106
00:04:57,001 --> 00:04:58,590
And ... Chris Griffin

107
00:04:58,628 --> 00:05:01,252
Oh, my God! I could
smell him from here.

108
00:05:01,253 --> 00:05:02,250
He's perfect.

109
00:05:02,251 --> 00:05:03,113
God, you're right!

110
00:05:03,114 --> 00:05:05,174
He smells like Fred Flinstone's arse!

111
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,311
Hey! No-one's askin' you to smell it.

112
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:14,577
Alright, Stewie, your dad's gonna
help you learn how to be a man.

113
00:05:14,751 --> 00:05:16,348
Real men have a couple of beers,

114
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,687
and then project their
inadequacies on their kids.

115
00:05:18,688 --> 00:05:19,627
- OK.
- What's that?

116
00:05:19,628 --> 00:05:20,874
You think you're better than me?

117
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,316
What? No, I didn't say that.

118
00:05:22,317 --> 00:05:25,335
So I guess you
think you woulda been some
sort of big shot by my age, huh?

119
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,280
Done things differently?
Gotten that promotion?

120
00:05:27,315 --> 00:05:28,807
I don't even know what you do.

121
00:05:28,842 --> 00:05:30,265
Well, let me tell you somethin' ...

122
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,040
You're nothin'! And you're
never gonna be nothin'!!!

123
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,540
Now, let's sit here
and watch Spike TV.

124
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,525
<i>Spike TV </i>

125
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,200
<i>Full of stuff men like.</i>

126
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,810
<i>Yeah, that stuff.</i>

127
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,275
Wow, my favorite.

128
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,350
P B and J with the crust cut off.

129
00:05:57,385 --> 00:05:58,407
What'd you get?

130
00:05:58,442 --> 00:05:59,430
Your crusts.

131
00:05:59,465 --> 00:06:00,195
That's it?

132
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:04,350
No, I also got an
orange peel and a picture
of mom eating a turkey leg.

133
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,250
Oh my God, Connie's
coming over to talk to me!

134
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,515
Sit up straight!

135
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,000
Hey, Meg, nice posture. Get lost.

136
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,505
Thank you.

137
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,790
Chris Griffin,
you are undoubtedly the
most unpopular boy in school.

138
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,770
I am? What about
Smiley McGee over there?

139
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,790
Hello!

140
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,350
You and I are going
on a date Saturday night.

141
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,115
Um ... OK.

142
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,650
I'll see you then.

143
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,630
Why would she go out with me?

144
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,130
She must be more
drunk than  Santa Claus
when he got that D.U.I.

145
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,570
No, no, it wasn't my fault.

146
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,120
Some guy in a
Plymouth totally cut me off.

147
00:06:40,155 --> 00:06:41,960
Sir, they don't
make Plymouths anymore.

148
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,495
Are you Jewish?

149
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,640
Sir, I'm gonna need
you to step outta the sleigh.

150
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,640
Alright, Stewie, we're gonna
get you nice and pumped up.

151
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,060
Now, you see
that barbell over there?

152
00:06:54,095 --> 00:06:55,760
Go ahead and try and lift that.

153
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,060
Uh-oh, spadoody-O's!

154
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,040
I noticed your kid
is having some trouble.

155
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,125
You're tellin' me.

156
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,060
Oh, your kid just
needs a little help.

157
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,410
I got something
that'll get him going.

158
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,045
Well, if there's anyone I can trust

159
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,450
it's a stranger at the
gym holding a dirty needle.

160
00:07:15,485 --> 00:07:16,942
Here, Stewie, try this.

161
00:07:16,977 --> 00:07:18,400
Yaah! What the
hell are you do .... ?

162
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,240
Whoa! Oh my ...
suddenly I'm full of energy.

163
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,060
Alright, fat man, let's do this!

164
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,460
Wow, Stewie, you
look like a new man.

165
00:07:48,495 --> 00:07:53,430
Well, will you look at me.
I HAVE THE POWER!!

166
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,870
<i>We now return to "Lady and
the Tramp" and Michael Vick.</i>

167
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,100
Hello, family.

168
00:08:17,717 --> 00:08:18,790
Aaaaarrrr ... !!

169
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,500
Does anyone need the remote?

170
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,450
Oh, my God!

171
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,990
What the hell happened to Stewie?

172
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:25,425
Yeah, looks good, doesn't he?

173
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,810
Let's see that lesbo Susie

174
00:08:26,845 --> 00:08:28,160
Swanson beat him up now.

175
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,030
Wait a minute. How
do you know she's gay?

176
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,830
Short haircut, stubby legs,
doesn't respond to my advances.

177
00:08:32,865 --> 00:08:34,660
You haven't answered my question!

178
00:08:34,695 --> 00:08:36,810
Why the hell does
Stewie look like this?

179
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,045
Well, I took him to the gym and

180
00:08:38,128 --> 00:08:41,240
the colorful gent there advised
me that I put him on steroids.

181
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:42,505
And you listened to him?!

182
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,250
Yeah, I believe everything
everyone tells me, anywhere.

183
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,130
What's goin' on B minus?

184
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,605
What's the happs?

185
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,940
Stewie, you look gross.

186
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,670
You look like Lou Ferrigno's poop.

187
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,550
I look like a guy who's
been hittin' the gym.

188
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,675
It has nothing to do with
the gym. You're on drugs.

189
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,550
Doesn't matter how you find
the pot o' gold, B to the rian

190
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,880
All that matters is that
you beat the leprechauns.

191
00:09:02,915 --> 00:09:04,065
That doesn't make any sense.

192
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,830
Doesn't have to make
sense when you look like this.

193
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:06,699
Rrrrrr ... !!!

194
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,820
I am hotter than
phone sex with a blind girl.

195
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,165
You sound hot.

196
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,375
What are you wearing?

197
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,550
I dunno.

198
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,990
<i>Classic Rock 103.7 WHTT </i>

199
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:27,760
I hate this station.

200
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,120
They always make
promises they can't deliver.

201
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:33,830
<i>Playin' the greatest
Rock 'n' Roll hits of all time.</i>

202
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,390
<i>We built this city .....</i>

203
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:36,230
See?

204
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,405
Chris, turn that off.

205
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,680
We have a lot of work
to do before we go inside.

206
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,770
Alright, if I'm
gonna be seen with you

207
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,600
we have to do
something about that look.

208
00:09:43,635 --> 00:09:45,100
Now, take that hat off.

209
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,160
Oh, God. Your hair's all combed.

210
00:09:49,195 --> 00:09:50,670
Here, let me fix that.

211
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,735
Alright, good.

212
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,590
Now, let's give you a
pencil thin, douchebag beard.

213
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,385
Oh, heavens, I look like a rake.

214
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,800
No, you look like you
don't care, and that's good.

215
00:10:00,835 --> 00:10:01,975
Oh, OK.

216
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,910
Um, if we're dating, does
that mean when we go in there

217
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,120
I can hold your hand?

218
00:10:06,155 --> 00:10:07,025
Good idea.

219
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,815
Then everyone will
think you're popular.

220
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,570
Well, I don't really care about that.

221
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,240
I want to hold
your hand 'cos I like you.

222
00:10:13,275 --> 00:10:14,805
I don't understand

223
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,850
Well, I think you're nice ...
and I like spending time with you.

224
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:21,850
You're really pretty
and I hope I get to be
with you for a long time.

225
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,010
Wow, um...

226
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,910
No guy's ever said anything
that nice to me before.

227
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,510
Well, maybe you've been
hanging around with jerks.

228
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,010
Yeah, maybe I have.

229
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,160
Hey, forget the pep rally.

230
00:10:34,195 --> 00:10:35,605
You wanna go see a movie?

231
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:41,100
Cool! Maybe we could go
see that Chazz Palminteri/ Paul
Sorvino movie "Distracting Trumpet"

232
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,380
I wanna thank you
all for comin' out here today.

233
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,100
We got a serious
situation down in the Bronx.

234
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,130
Our friend needs
to get a message to
the short man in the hat.

235
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:55,700
He needs to deliver this
message before the construction
site contracts are handed down.

236
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:00,540
It's of vital importance that
these matters be attended to.

237
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,150
So we may have to bring
in our friend from Yonkers!

238
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,080
What?

239
00:11:05,084 --> 00:11:09,188
I said "we may have to bring
in our friend from Yonkers!"

240
00:11:14,185 --> 00:11:15,262
Hey, what the hell?

241
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,326
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa, whoa,
whoa. Is there a problem? Huh?

242
00:11:17,327 --> 00:11:18,042
You wanna go?

243
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:18,858
You wanna go?

244
00:11:18,859 --> 00:11:21,140
- "Go?" What are talkin' about?
- I'm talkin' about "go"

245
00:11:21,141 --> 00:11:22,561
That's what I'm talkin' about.

246
00:11:22,562 --> 00:11:23,637
First one's on the house.

247
00:11:23,638 --> 00:11:24,577
I got things to do.

248
00:11:24,578 --> 00:11:25,624
Uh, where you think you're going?

249
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:26,607
I'm going downstairs.

250
00:11:26,608 --> 00:11:28,296
Oh, there's a toll in the hall now.

251
00:11:28,297 --> 00:11:28,929
10 bucks.

252
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,247
Look, can I ...

253
00:11:30,248 --> 00:11:31,748
Just ....

254
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,467
Stewie ...

255
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:34,908
Look ...

256
00:11:34,909 --> 00:11:36,278
Come on ...

257
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,655
I ...

258
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:38,956
Just ...

259
00:11:38,957 --> 00:11:40,207
You ...

260
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,582
This is ...

261
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:42,987
Can I ...

262
00:11:42,988 --> 00:11:45,082
Ah, just messin' with you, man.

263
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,322
You can do whatever you want.

264
00:11:46,323 --> 00:11:47,572
I was just kiddin' you.

265
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,128
Why're you so serious?

266
00:11:52,841 --> 00:11:54,727
Alright, Chrissy, here we go.

267
00:11:56,618 --> 00:11:57,525
Oooh! Aaaah!

268
00:11:57,526 --> 00:11:58,575
Oh, my God!

269
00:11:58,576 --> 00:12:00,216
Is that Chris Griffin
with Connie D'Amico?

270
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:01,267
I think it is!

271
00:12:01,268 --> 00:12:02,828
Wow, that makes him popular!

272
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:04,181
Hey, Griffin!

273
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,180
Griff-a!

274
00:12:05,181 --> 00:12:06,681
Griff-a-mano!

275
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:12,743
Wow, the jocks have
never said hello to me before.

276
00:12:12,744 --> 00:12:14,025
Er, hi, you guys.

277
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:15,579
Wow, you did it, Connie.

278
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,412
Chris Griffin is popular.

279
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:18,609
So, you gonna dump him now?

280
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,008
No, Gina, I'm not.

281
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:21,617
- You're not?
- No.

282
00:12:21,618 --> 00:12:22,931
There's something about him.

283
00:12:22,932 --> 00:12:24,415
He's not like the other guys.

284
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,241
I actually really like him.

285
00:12:26,242 --> 00:12:27,327
You do?

286
00:12:27,328 --> 00:12:30,054
Yeah. In fact, I'm going to
his house for dinner tonight

287
00:12:30,055 --> 00:12:31,555
so I can meet his parents.

288
00:12:34,698 --> 00:12:38,038
Wow, Connie D'Amico's coming
to my house for dinner!

289
00:12:38,344 --> 00:12:40,249
I just hope dad
doesn't embarrass us,

290
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,888
like he did when that
one legged guy came over.

291
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:45,007
Alright, well, if
you like movie trivia,

292
00:12:45,114 --> 00:12:46,614
I got one that'll stump you ...

293
00:12:46,405 --> 00:12:47,405
Aaaaaaah ...

294
00:12:47,406 --> 00:12:50,216
... course, you're probably
not really into tibia ... trivia

295
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:53,613
Aaaaah ...
Boy, that global warming, huh?

296
00:12:53,787 --> 00:12:56,716
They say we lost a
foot of snow last winter ...

297
00:12:57,632 --> 00:12:58,985
Hey, how 'bout another beer, huh?

298
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:01,438
I bet you like the taste of hops
... Aaaah ....

299
00:13:02,256 --> 00:13:03,968
You only have one leg, sir.

300
00:13:08,362 --> 00:13:10,902
Oh, Connie, it's so nice to meet you.

301
00:13:10,939 --> 00:13:14,485
We're so excited that
Chris is finally bringing
a girl home for dinner.

302
00:13:14,486 --> 00:13:16,625
It's really nice to
meet you too, Mrs Griffin.

303
00:13:16,736 --> 00:13:19,626
Um, do you mind if I ask
what's up with your baby?

304
00:13:19,892 --> 00:13:21,197
I'm gonna go work out.

305
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:23,234
Again? It's like
the eighth time today.

306
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:26,926
I'm not satisfied until every
vein is forced up against my skin.

307
00:13:26,946 --> 00:13:28,803
Look how vascular I am, Brian.

308
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,864
If there's one thing women
 love, it's a vascular man.

309
00:13:32,536 --> 00:13:39,717
<i>I've got veins. They carry 
blood all over my bahdy.</i>

310
00:13:39,863 --> 00:13:41,335
That's how John Mayer would say it.

311
00:13:41,336 --> 00:13:42,609
"Bahdy"

312
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:43,786
I'm really into him now.

313
00:13:43,787 --> 00:13:44,971
You better be OK with it!

314
00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:47,017
Well, to answer
your question, Connie,

315
00:13:47,018 --> 00:13:49,192
apparently I'm married to a man

316
00:13:49,193 --> 00:13:52,011
who thinks it's OK to
inject an infant with steroids.

317
00:13:52,112 --> 00:13:53,468
Wait, Lois,
knock it off for a sec.

318
00:13:53,469 --> 00:13:55,162
Connie, you are really pretty.

319
00:13:55,163 --> 00:13:57,748
I mean, you have
filled out something wacky.

320
00:13:57,846 --> 00:14:00,112
Oh. Thanks, Mr Griffin.

321
00:14:00,113 --> 00:14:01,726
I like what you're
doin' with your boobs.

322
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,640
Dad!

323
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,517
So, Connie, now that
you're dating my brother,

324
00:14:04,518 --> 00:14:06,361
maybe we can hang out, y'know?

325
00:14:06,362 --> 00:14:07,577
Hey, after dinner,

326
00:14:07,578 --> 00:14:10,391
you wanna come up to my room
and give each other makeovers?

327
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,162
I don't use makeup, Meg.

328
00:14:12,163 --> 00:14:14,174
Course you don't. You're all natural.

329
00:14:14,175 --> 00:14:16,113
Man, your dad must be proud.

330
00:14:16,114 --> 00:14:18,989
Actually, my dad
passed away 4 years ago.

331
00:14:19,077 --> 00:14:20,954
Yeah, yeah, he did.

332
00:14:20,955 --> 00:14:22,378
He sure did.

333
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:24,362
You gonna shower before dessert?

334
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:28,813
Greggy! Fitzy!

335
00:14:28,814 --> 00:14:31,343
T-bone! Gagaboo!

336
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:32,827
Nazi guy!

337
00:14:33,028 --> 00:14:34,421
Griffa!

338
00:14:34,422 --> 00:14:37,452
Hey, we're totally stoked
for your party this weekend!

339
00:14:37,454 --> 00:14:39,171
Ho ho. You know it, brother.

340
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:40,647
It's gonna be awesome.

341
00:14:40,648 --> 00:14:44,319
But keep it on the down low,
so the spazoids don't catch wind.

342
00:14:44,392 --> 00:14:45,210
Ha-haaaah!

343
00:14:45,245 --> 00:14:47,146
Agh! Speaking of spazoids ...

344
00:14:47,415 --> 00:14:49,460
Wow, can you believe it, Connie?

345
00:14:49,461 --> 00:14:52,179
You and I are gonna be
at the same party this weekend.

346
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,774
Oh, this is so cool!

347
00:14:53,775 --> 00:14:56,849
Hey, what are you
wearing, so I make sure I
don't wear the same thing.

348
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,726
Um, you're not invited, Meg.

349
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:00,025
What?

350
00:15:00,026 --> 00:15:02,210
But ... it's at my house.

351
00:15:02,211 --> 00:15:03,648
Uh, Connie, let me handle this.

352
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:05,428
I'm sorry, Meg. You can't come.

353
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:08,684
There's an arse to boob
ratio that you're way off of.

354
00:15:09,444 --> 00:15:12,020
Hey, Chris! C'mon,
let's corner the nerds

355
00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:14,362
and call them gay and make
them show us their penises.

356
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,130
Ah ha ha! Won't
that be gay of them?

357
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,415
Ha ha. Yeah! That is grotacular!

358
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,810
- Way to go, man.
- Awesome, bro.

359
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,600
Man, our boy Chris,
partying with the cool kids.

360
00:15:34,635 --> 00:15:37,020
I am a very proud dad right now.

361
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:40,780
Look at that Connie.
So young and lithe.

362
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,450
Look at the shape of that body.

363
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,420
Look at the shape of that body!

364
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,745
That's it, Brian!

365
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,760
That's where one-eyed
Willy buried his gold!

366
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,955
Oh, Meg, sweetheart

367
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,310
why don't you just go
downstairs and join the party?

368
00:15:58,345 --> 00:15:59,980
I wasn't invited!

369
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:03,090
I hate Chris! He's such a jerk!

370
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,570
Oh, look, honey, he's
just a little confused
about who he is right now.

371
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,940
I'm sure, deep down,
he still loves his big sister.

372
00:16:09,975 --> 00:16:11,400
I hate my school!

373
00:16:11,435 --> 00:16:12,930
I hate everyone!

374
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,700
I hate my life!

375
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,270
OK, look, Meg, I've
been at this for 45 minutes

376
00:16:17,305 --> 00:16:18,770
I don't know what else I can say.

377
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,300
Here's a Sylvia Plath
book and a bottle of Ambien.

378
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,375
I'm gonna look the other way,

379
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,040
and whatever happens, happens.

380
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,470
Gina, have you seen Chris?

381
00:16:33,505 --> 00:16:34,970
Yeah, he's over there.

382
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,695
Uh, Chris, what are you doing?!

383
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:42,080
Getting scraped
to death by my zipper.

384
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,360
You bastard!

385
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,235
How the hell can
you be cheating on me?

386
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,065
I'm the one who made you popular!

387
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,860
No, Connie, beating up that
Jewish kid made me popular.

388
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,750
Come on, girls! Let's
go upstairs and make out.

389
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,680
Oh, no, Connie's been hurt!

390
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:00,020
I guess I should lie on
top of her to keep her warm.

391
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,650
What are you lookin' at?
It's a cartoon!

392
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,070
Chris, I can't believe you
dissed Connie at your party.

393
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,015
That was awesome!

394
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:15,130
Yeah, I heard about
it when I was making
that gay nerd spoon with me.

395
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,075
Hey, guys ...

396
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,180
Room for one more?

397
00:17:17,215 --> 00:17:18,755
I don't think so.

398
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,130
- Loser!
- Reject!

399
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:21,470
Everyone's gay but me.

400
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,270
My God, he's practically ruined me.

401
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,595
I've created a monster.

402
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,380
Meg, we've gotta do something.

403
00:17:31,415 --> 00:17:33,440
"We"? Are you kidding?

404
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,425
Do you really think
I would help you out

405
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,570
in any way, after
everything you've done to me?

406
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,010
What are you talking about?

407
00:17:39,045 --> 00:17:40,365
You see this, Connie?

408
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,970
This is from when you called me
"sticky arse cow" in 6th grade.

409
00:17:44,005 --> 00:17:47,540
This one is from when
you made a plaster cast of
my vagina, freshman year.

410
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,975
You want my help?

411
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,400
You can go #@!% yourself!!

412
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,760
Hey, Meg! Think fast!

413
00:17:51,795 --> 00:17:54,320
Ha-ha! Loser!

414
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,680
Alright, let's do it.

415
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,925
When we're done with him,

416
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,050
he'll be more of an outcast than
a seagull at an Adam Sandler movie.

417
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:07,190
This is my old bicycle that
I had from when I was ten.

418
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:12,980
Sometimes the
banana seat hurts my hynie.

419
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:15,525
Will you shut up?

420
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,135
You shut up, man! It's a comedy!

421
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:20,590
When I ring the bell, it
makes my pants feel funny.

422
00:18:20,619 --> 00:18:22,240
Ring, ring, ring!

423
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,630
Ah, another day of being huge.

424
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:34,090
Good morning, Guns of Navaro ...

425
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,390
Oh, no!

426
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,310
What's happening?!

427
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,625
I'll tell you what's happening.

428
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,250
Your steroids have worn off.

429
00:18:41,285 --> 00:18:42,750
You're weak like everyone else.

430
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,715
And guess what?

431
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,670
There's a toll in the hall, now.

432
00:18:45,705 --> 00:18:47,590
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me!

433
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,220
Stewie, no!

434
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,550
And now ... here's something
we hope you'll really like.

435
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,255
Settle down, everyone.

436
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,580
OK, let's get this assembly started.

437
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,025
Is everything set, Meg?

438
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,910
Once Chris gets up there, my
friend in the AV department
will take care of everything.

439
00:19:11,945 --> 00:19:14,132
OK, Meg, remember our deal.

440
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:16,285
I do this for you,
and I have your permission

441
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,140
to think about you later
tonight when I'm in the tub.

442
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,095
Fine, Neil

443
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,730
Awesome! I might
even go lefty tonight.

444
00:19:22,765 --> 00:19:25,260
Stranger in the tub.

445
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:28,840
Before we begin, Chris Griffin has
an announcement for the cool kids.

446
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,080
Yeah, hey, guys.

447
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:34,080
The meeting of the
Cool Kids Club will be at 3:15

448
00:19:34,115 --> 00:19:37,600
leaning up against Tim
Breckner's SUV in the parking lot.

449
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:52,650
<i>Would you do me? I'd do me.</i>

450
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,900
<i>I'd do me so hard.</i>

451
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,730
Hey, Chris. What's that?
Did you sit on something?

452
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,660
Chris Griffin's a freak!

453
00:20:18,695 --> 00:20:19,605
What a loser!

454
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,280
I'm gay, alright?

455
00:20:21,315 --> 00:20:22,920
Ah, c'mon, it's me!

456
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:23,865
Griffa!

457
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,900
You don't get to
talk like that anymore!

458
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,790
Connie, the person who humiliated
you has himself been humiliated.

459
00:20:29,825 --> 00:20:31,297
By the rules of high school,

460
00:20:31,332 --> 00:20:32,770
you are now popular again.

461
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,870
Well, we did it, Connie.

462
00:20:34,905 --> 00:20:36,135
Thanks for your help, Meg.

463
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:39,170
There no chance we're gonna
 be friends now, is there?

464
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:40,425
Absolutely not.

465
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,020
Can I at least think
about you in the tub later?

466
00:20:43,055 --> 00:20:44,520
No.

467
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,900
I'm still gonna.

468
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,650
Well, Chris, you must feel ridiculous.

469
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:52,895
I do, dad.

470
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,810
And Meg, I'm really
sorry I was such a douche.

471
00:20:55,845 --> 00:20:57,850
Well, there is a way
you can make it up to me.

472
00:20:57,885 --> 00:20:58,640
How?

and allows you to become
part of its everlasting glory.
