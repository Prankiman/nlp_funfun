12
00:00:35,895 --> 00:00:37,829
Welcome, all,
to James Woods High's

13
00:00:37,864 --> 00:00:39,097
annual college fair,

14
00:00:39,132 --> 00:00:41,266
where each year,
our seniors gather to decide

15
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,169
where they will go
in the fall to get HPV.

16
00:00:45,638 --> 00:00:48,073
Wow, Meg,
so many choices.

17
00:00:48,107 --> 00:00:49,875
Yeah.
There's a state college

18
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:52,778
with an incredibly offensive
Native American mascot.

19
00:00:52,812 --> 00:00:54,613
I'm Drunky!

20
00:00:54,647 --> 00:00:57,182
The Dakota University mascot!

21
00:00:57,216 --> 00:00:58,950
Look how drunk I am!

22
00:00:58,985 --> 00:01:01,853
This is important for sports!

23
00:01:01,888 --> 00:01:03,088
(gasps)
Oh, look,

24
00:01:03,122 --> 00:01:04,956
you can go to
Oral Roberts.

25
00:01:06,392 --> 00:01:08,760
PETER:
Oh, and there's Anal Roberts.

26
00:01:08,795 --> 00:01:11,963
Oh, boy, that is a tough,
tough place to get into, Lois.

27
00:01:11,998 --> 00:01:13,432
That is tough,
but once you're in there,

28
00:01:13,466 --> 00:01:15,467
you'd be surprised
how much you like it.

29
00:01:15,501 --> 00:01:16,668
Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Griffin.

30
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:17,803
So glad
you could make it.

31
00:01:17,837 --> 00:01:19,337
You know, Meg has
attracted interest

32
00:01:19,372 --> 00:01:20,705
from several colleges.

33
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,973
Meg going to college.

34
00:01:22,008 --> 00:01:24,109
I always thought she was
gonna be one of those ladies

35
00:01:24,143 --> 00:01:26,545
who wears a jean jacket
and hangs out at the bar

36
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:28,079
in a chain restaurant.

37
00:01:28,114 --> 00:01:30,982
Hey. You know you can get
a slice of pineapple

38
00:01:31,017 --> 00:01:33,385
on your burger here.

39
00:01:33,419 --> 00:01:34,920
Hey, Jimmy,
another water.

40
00:01:34,954 --> 00:01:36,455
I call Miller Lite "water."

41
00:01:36,489 --> 00:01:38,390
Jimmy knows me,
he knows that.

42
00:01:38,424 --> 00:01:39,958
Come on, hockey team!

43
00:01:39,992 --> 00:01:42,294
This one's on me.

44
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:44,162
Merry Christmas, Meg.

45
00:01:44,197 --> 00:01:46,331
You really think Meg
is college material,

46
00:01:46,365 --> 00:01:47,466
Principal Shepherd?

47
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,267
Yeah, she's
a solid B student

48
00:01:49,302 --> 00:01:50,702
and that's quite
an accomplishment,

49
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,904
considering none of her teachers
are willing to sleep with her.

50
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:54,840
Sophomore year,
she was molested by the janitor.

51
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:57,075
(laughs)
Mr. Griffin,

52
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:59,611
I believe they're
called "custodians."

53
00:01:59,645 --> 00:02:02,113
Anyway, I was able to get Meg
an interview this weekend

54
00:02:02,148 --> 00:02:04,282
at Green Mountain College
in Vermont.

55
00:02:04,317 --> 00:02:05,584
Green Mountain College?!

56
00:02:05,618 --> 00:02:07,853
Oh, my God!
That's my first choice!

57
00:02:07,887 --> 00:02:09,721
Can one of you guys
take me up there?

58
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,691
Meg, please excuse your mother
and I for a moment.

59
00:02:12,725 --> 00:02:14,192
We need to work out
our schedules.

60
00:02:15,728 --> 00:02:19,898
(Peter and Lois
punching, grunting)

61
00:02:21,534 --> 00:02:23,368
I'd be happy
to take you, Meg.

62
00:02:27,073 --> 00:02:28,406
ANNOUNCER:
We now return to

63
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:31,543
<i>Extreme Makeover:</i>
<i>Bethenny Frankel Edition.</i>

64
00:02:31,577 --> 00:02:34,379
CROWD:
Move! That! Bus!

65
00:02:36,082 --> 00:02:38,683
Put! That! Bus! Back!

66
00:02:38,718 --> 00:02:40,018
Hey, can you guys
turn that down?

67
00:02:40,052 --> 00:02:40,852
I'm trying to read.

68
00:02:40,887 --> 00:02:41,953
Oh, shut up, Brian.

69
00:02:41,988 --> 00:02:42,954
We were here first.

70
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:47,025
Yeah, Brian,
go read in your own room!

71
00:02:47,059 --> 00:02:48,793
Yes, you do.
You have that wicker basket

72
00:02:48,828 --> 00:02:49,694
in the laundry room

73
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:51,196
with the
frayed bath mat in it.

74
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,732
God, I can't get any
peace and quiet in this house.

75
00:02:53,766 --> 00:02:56,234
Well, now you know how
I felt at Mardi Gras.

76
00:02:56,269 --> 00:02:58,336
(applause, cheering)

77
00:02:58,371 --> 00:03:00,238
Hey! Keep it down!

78
00:03:00,273 --> 00:03:01,973
I'm trying to get
some sleep up here!

79
00:03:02,008 --> 00:03:03,909
MAN:
Show us your boobs...!

80
00:03:03,943 --> 00:03:05,243
My boobs?

81
00:03:05,278 --> 00:03:06,912
Wait, I-I don't think I...

82
00:03:08,414 --> 00:03:12,851
Oh, my! Jewelry!

83
00:03:12,885 --> 00:03:16,354
The rules of this city
are very unclear.

84
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:22,294
(sighs)
This is actually very pleasant.

85
00:03:22,328 --> 00:03:24,663
(crashing)

86
00:03:24,697 --> 00:03:27,165
Hey. Who the hell
knocked over the garbage ca--

87
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,800
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
Hey. Hey. Hey.

88
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:29,768
I-I don't want
any trouble.

89
00:03:29,802 --> 00:03:31,069
(laughs):
Well, you in the wrong place

90
00:03:31,103 --> 00:03:32,837
if you ain't looking for
trouble, boy.

91
00:03:32,872 --> 00:03:34,472
<i>Nothin'</i> but trouble
out here.

92
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:37,742
Big ol' hoot-owl come down,
scoop you up, take your eye out.

93
00:03:37,777 --> 00:03:39,144
All right.
Well, can you at least

94
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:40,745
clean this stuff up
when you're done?

95
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,447
It's... otherwise it's gonna
start to smell.

96
00:03:42,481 --> 00:03:44,783
Oh... you don't like
smell, huh?

97
00:03:44,817 --> 00:03:46,451
Well, sniff on this!

98
00:03:46,485 --> 00:03:47,485
(yells)

99
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,553
(laughs)

100
00:03:48,588 --> 00:03:51,423
Yeah! You got that stink
all up on you, now!

101
00:03:51,457 --> 00:03:52,891
(maniacally barking)

102
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:54,593
(screams)

103
00:03:54,627 --> 00:03:55,527
Oh, my God!

104
00:03:55,561 --> 00:03:56,761
What is that smell?!

105
00:03:56,796 --> 00:03:58,430
(barking continues)

106
00:03:58,464 --> 00:04:00,465
(yells)
It's like a burning tire dump

107
00:04:00,499 --> 00:04:01,733
right in my nose!

108
00:04:01,767 --> 00:04:03,068
(yelling)

109
00:04:03,102 --> 00:04:05,236
(hysterically crying):
Brian, why are you doing this?!

110
00:04:05,271 --> 00:04:07,172
We're sorry...!

111
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:08,106
(Stewie yells)

112
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,508
(Brian and Stewie
yelling, grunting)

113
00:04:10,543 --> 00:04:11,910
Ah! You bastard!

114
00:04:11,944 --> 00:04:13,645
(barking)

115
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:14,646
(Brian grunts)

116
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,481
I can't see!
I'm blind!

117
00:04:16,515 --> 00:04:17,349
(yells)

118
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:20,051
(grunting)

119
00:04:20,086 --> 00:04:22,287
Ah! What is that smell?

120
00:04:22,321 --> 00:04:23,388
(barking)

121
00:04:23,422 --> 00:04:24,356
Oh, my God!

122
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,524
Brian got sprayed
by a skunk!

123
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:27,859
No! Not against the wall.

124
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,928
You're gonna scare off
the cockroaches.

125
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,066
Oh, that's not good.

126
00:04:35,101 --> 00:04:39,004
They were 70% of the structure
of this house.

127
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:42,407
Peter, please tell me this is
covered by our insurance.

128
00:04:42,441 --> 00:04:43,341
Sorry, Lois,

129
00:04:43,376 --> 00:04:45,810
it doesn't cover
acts of "dog."

130
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:51,516
(plays rimshot)

131
00:04:57,289 --> 00:04:59,524
Hey, guys,
I-I think the tomato juice

132
00:04:59,558 --> 00:05:01,459
is really working. Don't you?

133
00:05:01,494 --> 00:05:05,030
No. You smell like
my six-foot-tall German girlfriend.

134
00:05:05,064 --> 00:05:08,233
Christopher, are you ready
to go to the Guttenschvartzen?

135
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:09,734
Hell, <i>da!</i>

136
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:12,771
She can swim across the pool
in two strokes.

137
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:16,207
Wh... I don't know
what else to do.

138
00:05:16,242 --> 00:05:17,575
I do.

139
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,713
Until the smell wears off,
you're staying outside!

140
00:05:21,747 --> 00:05:24,215
Outside? Lois,
I'm an inside dog!

141
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,785
I'm an inside dog!
I'm sorry, Brian,

142
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:29,421
but you stink.

143
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:31,456
(chuckles)
I'll take smelling good

144
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,458
over walking good any day.

145
00:05:33,492 --> 00:05:35,427
BONNIE: You don't
smell good, Joe.

146
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:38,063
I'm sorry,
I thought I was alone.

147
00:05:42,553 --> 00:05:44,654
(shivering)

148
00:05:44,688 --> 00:05:45,989
Morning, Brian.

149
00:05:46,023 --> 00:05:48,158
Ew! You still
really stink.

150
00:05:48,192 --> 00:05:50,160
Yeah, you smell like
the meatball sub

151
00:05:50,194 --> 00:05:51,995
I left under
the couch.

152
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:55,331
<i>Damn it, I just gave away my</i>
<i>hiding place for meatball subs!</i>

153
00:05:55,366 --> 00:05:59,269
I-I'll tell you where there
definitely <i>aren't</i> any meatball subs--

154
00:05:59,303 --> 00:06:01,838
the side pocket
of my golf bag.

155
00:06:01,872 --> 00:06:03,673
<i>Geez, Peter, shut up!</i>

156
00:06:03,707 --> 00:06:05,341
Did you sleep okay
out here, Brian?

157
00:06:05,376 --> 00:06:07,911
No! I was so cold.
And you have no idea

158
00:06:07,945 --> 00:06:10,747
how many terrifying things
there are out here in the dark.

159
00:06:10,781 --> 00:06:13,917
My nephew, Scrappy Brian,
didn't even make it through the night.

160
00:06:13,951 --> 00:06:15,418
(rustling)

161
00:06:15,452 --> 00:06:17,854
Hey, Uncle Brian, let's
go check out that noise.

162
00:06:17,888 --> 00:06:19,155
I don't know, Scrappy Brian.

163
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,024
It might be better
just to stay put.

164
00:06:21,058 --> 00:06:23,059
Aw, I'm not afraid!
Let me at 'em!

165
00:06:23,093 --> 00:06:24,561
Let me at 'em!

166
00:06:26,564 --> 00:06:28,064
(screeches)

167
00:06:28,098 --> 00:06:31,401
Damn it! I told my sister
this wasn't a good weekend.

168
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,310
Hey, Bri. How's
it going out there?

169
00:06:40,344 --> 00:06:42,312
Oh, boy, I need this cold air.

170
00:06:42,346 --> 00:06:44,981
They got the heat
cranked up so high in here,

171
00:06:45,015 --> 00:06:47,150
Lois is walking around
without a shirt.

172
00:06:47,184 --> 00:06:48,518
Oh, come on, Stewie.

173
00:06:48,552 --> 00:06:50,653
Hey, throw me a jacket
or something, huh?

174
00:06:50,688 --> 00:06:51,888
Nope. You'll stink it up.

175
00:06:51,922 --> 00:06:53,356
Also, since
you've been out there,

176
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,825
I've stopped sneezing,
so this might be permanent.

177
00:06:55,859 --> 00:06:58,094
Well, at least throw me down
some food or something.

178
00:06:58,128 --> 00:06:59,796
Well, I'm afraid
I finished my dinner.

179
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,432
All I have is a steak,
but that belongs to Rupert.

180
00:07:02,466 --> 00:07:03,088
Can I have it?

181
00:07:03,113 --> 00:07:04,821
I don't know, that's
a question for Rupert.

182
00:07:05,369 --> 00:07:07,437
You'll have to ask him.

183
00:07:07,471 --> 00:07:09,939
Uh... hey, Rupe.

184
00:07:09,974 --> 00:07:11,441
"Rupe"? Oh, no. No, no.

185
00:07:11,475 --> 00:07:12,842
No, this is already over.

186
00:07:12,876 --> 00:07:14,677
Come on, Stewie, I'm starving.

187
00:07:14,712 --> 00:07:16,446
Good Lord, Brian,
get a hold of yourself.

188
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,147
You're in a suburban yard.

189
00:07:18,182 --> 00:07:21,150
What kind of dog
can't live outside?

190
00:07:21,185 --> 00:07:22,785
God, he's right.

191
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,021
I'm a disgrace to my species.

192
00:07:25,055 --> 00:07:27,490
Like that gumball machine
traffic cop.

193
00:07:28,525 --> 00:07:30,960
(horns honking, alarms blaring)

194
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,331
Oh, my God, O'Connor's
a disaster out there.

195
00:07:35,366 --> 00:07:38,101
It's not his fault.
He was a great gumball machine--

196
00:07:38,135 --> 00:07:40,436
they just shouldn't
have promoted him.

197
00:07:43,907 --> 00:07:45,842
Oh, I think we're
getting close here.

198
00:07:45,876 --> 00:07:47,243
Meg, what are
you doing?

199
00:07:47,278 --> 00:07:48,978
Just letting the wind
wave my hand.

200
00:07:49,013 --> 00:07:50,980
Sometimes I like
to pretend that I'm flying.

201
00:07:51,015 --> 00:07:53,583
Plus, it tickles.
That's stupid.

202
00:07:56,787 --> 00:07:58,855
(laughing):
Hey-hey-hey...

203
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:00,923
The wind wants my
hand to go back,

204
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,425
but I'm not letting it.

205
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:05,295
I'm stronger than it.

206
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:07,664
Oh, my God, Dad,
you lost your hand!

207
00:08:07,698 --> 00:08:10,166
That's all right.
I can regenerate.

My name is Retep,

How would you even know
what that song is?

243
00:09:53,804 --> 00:09:55,571
From you. Dad,
I've been hearing that song

244
00:09:55,606 --> 00:09:58,341
in the backseat of your car
since I was a little kid.

Huh. I never knew
you were listening.

Never even knew
you were there.

Wait, were you that little
fat boy with the glasses?

Yes, Dad.
I know a <i>lot</i> about you.

It's the devil's vomit.

In the last election,
you voted for Mighty Mouse.

00:13:02,092 --> 00:13:03,759
out here in the wild.

316
00:13:03,794 --> 00:13:04,760
The wild?

317
00:13:04,795 --> 00:13:06,295
You're standing
on the driveway.

318
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,497
Come on.
Hey, hey! Let go of me!

319
00:13:08,532 --> 00:13:10,132
(growling)

320
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:12,468
I can't believe it.
You've become a wild animal.

321
00:13:12,502 --> 00:13:15,371
You're like that tiger
from Siegfried and Roy.

322
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,342
Um, I think we all know
the answer to this,

323
00:13:19,376 --> 00:13:21,777
but should I get tested?

324
00:13:26,216 --> 00:13:28,217
(Meg and Peter laughing)

325
00:13:29,753 --> 00:13:31,053
You guys are back!

326
00:13:31,088 --> 00:13:33,022
Meg, how was
your interview?

327
00:13:33,056 --> 00:13:34,357
Ah, we didn't go.

328
00:13:34,391 --> 00:13:36,025
I slept
right through it.

329
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:36,792
What?!

330
00:13:36,827 --> 00:13:37,793
Yeah, it was awesome.

331
00:13:37,828 --> 00:13:39,061
We stayed up all night partying.

332
00:13:39,096 --> 00:13:40,930
By the way,
if a girl named Rachel calls,

333
00:13:40,964 --> 00:13:43,466
it's a wrong number,
but do tell me that she called.

334
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,134
Where's your
wedding ring?

335
00:13:45,168 --> 00:13:47,208
Yeah, so we missed the
interview, so that's a shame.

336
00:13:47,237 --> 00:13:49,138
Meg, how could you
miss your interview?

337
00:13:49,172 --> 00:13:51,140
That school was
your first choice.

338
00:13:51,174 --> 00:13:53,476
(phone rings inside house)
I'll get it!

339
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,810
It doesn't matter, Mom.

340
00:13:54,845 --> 00:13:56,345
Dad and I had
a great time.

341
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,747
We went to a party!

342
00:13:57,781 --> 00:14:00,349
We bonded for the first time
in our lives.

343
00:14:00,384 --> 00:14:01,884
It was just Joe.

344
00:14:01,918 --> 00:14:03,419
Meg, how could you blow
your chance

345
00:14:03,453 --> 00:14:05,221
to go
to your first-choice college?

346
00:14:05,255 --> 00:14:07,990
I can't believe
you would be so irresponsible.

347
00:14:08,025 --> 00:14:10,326
Hey, Meg, you want to huck
some water balloons at nerds?

348
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,061
Sure!

349
00:14:12,095 --> 00:14:13,462
What the hell?!

350
00:14:13,497 --> 00:14:15,464
(giggles)
(mimics giggle poorly)

351
00:14:15,499 --> 00:14:17,967
We'll work on the laugh,
but you'll get there.

352
00:14:18,001 --> 00:14:20,002
To the Meg-copter!

353
00:14:23,106 --> 00:14:24,674
Huh, look down there.

354
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,609
That looks like me
with a green shirt.

355
00:14:26,643 --> 00:14:28,344
He's murdering a lady.

356
00:14:28,378 --> 00:14:30,780
(Retep laughs sinisterly)

357
00:14:36,617 --> 00:14:37,878
Dinner's getting cold.

358
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:39,480
I wonder where your father
and Meg are.

359
00:14:39,514 --> 00:14:42,516
They left for the movies
five hours ago.

360
00:14:44,252 --> 00:14:47,221
God, look at Lois picking food
from her teeth with her nail.

361
00:14:47,255 --> 00:14:48,822
Someone should tell her
she's a pig.

362
00:14:48,857 --> 00:14:50,023
Mom, you're a pig!

363
00:14:50,058 --> 00:14:51,558
No, you're not supposed
to actually do it!

364
00:14:51,593 --> 00:14:52,893
We were
just talking here!

365
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,962
Oh, now she's crying.
That's not what I wanted.

366
00:14:54,996 --> 00:14:56,997
Stop crying, you bitch!

367
00:14:57,031 --> 00:14:59,066
(groans) I got to get Brian back
in the house.

368
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,834
It's just not the same
without him here.

369
00:15:00,869 --> 00:15:04,138
It's like Arnold Schwarzenegger
without an accent.

370
00:15:04,172 --> 00:15:05,472
It might be a tumor.

371
00:15:05,507 --> 00:15:07,407
(American accent):
It's not a tumor.

372
00:15:11,913 --> 00:15:14,148
Where are you two
going now?

373
00:15:14,182 --> 00:15:17,384
We're going two places:
none of yo and beeswax.

374
00:15:17,386 --> 00:15:19,153
Clean slam! Come on, Meg!

375
00:15:19,187 --> 00:15:22,222
Meg, I'm glad you're having
a good time with your father,

376
00:15:22,257 --> 00:15:24,892
but don't let him distract you
from your priorities.

377
00:15:24,926 --> 00:15:27,761
Remember, you still have
a chance to get into college.

378
00:15:27,796 --> 00:15:29,429
Mom, we're just having fun.

379
00:15:29,464 --> 00:15:31,765
I've never had a good
time with Dad before.

380
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,634
I'm just saying,
it's not easy

381
00:15:33,668 --> 00:15:35,636
dealing with
your father's craziness.

382
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,304
Believe me,
this is no job

383
00:15:37,338 --> 00:15:39,573
for the family's
designated <i>schmendrick.</i>

384
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:41,842
Trust me, Mom.
I know what I'm doing.

385
00:15:41,876 --> 00:15:43,177
That's what
your father said

386
00:15:43,211 --> 00:15:46,013
before he took that walking tour
of Providence.

387
00:15:46,047 --> 00:15:47,815
This is where a homeless
man ate the finger

388
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:49,216
of another
homeless man.

389
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,718
This is where some teenagers
beat a gay guy to death.

390
00:15:51,753 --> 00:15:54,655
This building used to be
Irish. Now it's Cambodian.

391
00:15:54,689 --> 00:15:56,924
And this is where fake
tour guides throw rocks

392
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,525
and steal
tourists' wallets.

393
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,727
Oh, yeah, I read
about this part on Yelp.

394
00:16:09,571 --> 00:16:11,572
PETER (quietly):
Meg.

395
00:16:12,941 --> 00:16:14,942
Meg.

396
00:16:16,311 --> 00:16:18,312
Come on.

397
00:16:19,314 --> 00:16:21,315
(ostrich squawking)

398
00:16:23,585 --> 00:16:25,652
Come on, it'll be fun.

399
00:16:29,657 --> 00:16:31,291
(giggles)
Isn't this great, Meg?

400
00:16:31,326 --> 00:16:32,559
(panting)

401
00:16:32,594 --> 00:16:35,462
Sorry I forgot
to get you an ostrich.

402
00:16:39,467 --> 00:16:40,667
All right, Meg, you and me

403
00:16:40,702 --> 00:16:42,269
are gonna get
something pierced together.

404
00:16:42,303 --> 00:16:43,871
I'll get my ear done.
How about you?

405
00:16:43,905 --> 00:16:46,406
Um, I guess my ears
would be okay.

406
00:16:46,441 --> 00:16:47,881
Oh, come on, Meg,
you're my daughter.

407
00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:49,209
Nothing but the best for you.

408
00:16:49,244 --> 00:16:50,277
You're getting the works!

409
00:16:50,311 --> 00:16:51,812
Here, I want everything you got.

410
00:16:51,846 --> 00:16:53,914
Only the best
for my daughter Meg.

411
00:16:53,948 --> 00:16:55,182
Ah, look at that.

412
00:16:55,216 --> 00:16:56,850
You look like one of them
beautiful, troubled

413
00:16:56,885 --> 00:16:59,386
Scandinavian youths I've
seen on the porn sites.

414
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,988
You like it?
(muffled): Mm-hmm.

415
00:17:01,022 --> 00:17:02,656
Awesome. Come on,
let's go next door

416
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,259
and get your mom a funny
refrigerator magnet.

417
00:17:09,931 --> 00:17:12,532
I got a piercing, too.

418
00:17:16,771 --> 00:17:19,206
Hey, Lois, guess who made
15 baskets in a row

419
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,741
at the county fair.

420
00:17:20,775 --> 00:17:21,942
Some kid we beat up.

421
00:17:21,976 --> 00:17:23,644
Oh, what a great day!

422
00:17:23,678 --> 00:17:25,245
Had enough yet?
Yes!

423
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,580
I don't know
how you do it.

424
00:17:26,614 --> 00:17:28,515
Everything he does
is exhausting.

425
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:31,485
Even something as simple
as going to the bank.

426
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:33,360
Meg, you've probably wondered
from time to time

427
00:17:33,388 --> 00:17:35,422
how on earth I pay
for all my shenanigans.

428
00:17:35,456 --> 00:17:36,757
Well, I'm gonna show you.

429
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:39,559
This is a robbery! Everybody
get on the (bleep) ground!

430
00:17:39,594 --> 00:17:41,628
If this bitch moves,
shoot him in the eye!

431
00:17:41,663 --> 00:17:43,297
Dad, I don't want
to do this!

432
00:17:43,331 --> 00:17:45,432
You have to! Next week,
we're buying a zebra!

433
00:17:45,466 --> 00:17:47,434
But, Dad...
There's no time to argue!

434
00:17:47,468 --> 00:17:48,769
We got 150 seconds

435
00:17:48,803 --> 00:17:50,837
before the police respond
to the silent alarm!

436
00:17:50,872 --> 00:17:52,506
Now check those
bags for dye packs!

437
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,174
(crying)

438
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,509
Who's the manager here?!

439
00:17:55,543 --> 00:17:56,576
I-I am.

440
00:17:56,611 --> 00:17:58,045
(wailing)

441
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:59,179
What are you doing?!

442
00:17:59,213 --> 00:18:00,847
You said if he moves,
shoot him!

443
00:18:00,882 --> 00:18:03,050
He's the only one with the
combination to the safe!

444
00:18:03,084 --> 00:18:05,385
It's blown! It's blown!
This whole operation is blown!

445
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,654
I'll get the car.
Kill everyone else.

446
00:18:07,689 --> 00:18:08,855
You've got
to help me, Mom.

447
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,057
What do you want me to do?

448
00:18:10,091 --> 00:18:12,225
Please, take him back.

449
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,827
I suppose I could, Meg.

450
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:16,096
But a part of growing up
is learning how to handle

451
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:19,032
a tough situation on your own,
like getting into college

452
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:21,068
or breaking up
with your father.

453
00:18:23,071 --> 00:18:26,206
I guess,
but it's not gonna be easy.

454
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,008
Well, life's not
always easy, Meg.

455
00:18:28,042 --> 00:18:30,377
Just ask an
ugly Boy Scout.

456
00:18:30,411 --> 00:18:33,647
Scoutmaster Davenport, you want
to share a tent with me tonight?

457
00:18:33,681 --> 00:18:37,517
Oh, Billy, I like
you as a friend.

458
00:18:42,824 --> 00:18:44,658
Brian, you got
to get in here, man.

459
00:18:44,692 --> 00:18:46,893
I've been taking a break
from Lois's breast milk,

460
00:18:46,928 --> 00:18:49,029
and her boobs
are enormous.

461
00:18:49,063 --> 00:18:51,231
They're like Jiffy Pop
just before the foil breaks.

462
00:18:51,265 --> 00:18:53,700
You should come check 'em out
before they get infected.

463
00:18:53,735 --> 00:18:56,169
Yeah, nice try, Stewie,
but I'm still not coming inside.

464
00:18:56,204 --> 00:18:58,338
But, Brian,
I need you inside.

465
00:18:58,373 --> 00:19:00,407
I'm going crazy in here
without you.

466
00:19:00,441 --> 00:19:02,609
Please, I need
my friend back.

467
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:04,745
Look, Stewie,
I've learned something out here.

468
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:07,080
You see, living in the wild,
I-I've realized

469
00:19:07,115 --> 00:19:09,149
that all the pain
I've ever had in my life

470
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:12,352
has-has come from me always
trying to be something I'm not.

471
00:19:12,387 --> 00:19:15,155
I mean, I'm not a writer,
I'm not an artist,

472
00:19:15,189 --> 00:19:17,024
I'm not an intellectual.

473
00:19:17,058 --> 00:19:19,426
What I am... is a dog.

474
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:23,296
And as a dog,
my place is outside.

475
00:19:23,331 --> 00:19:24,631
I'm sorry, Stewie,

476
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:27,634
but nothing will ever
make me come back inside.

477
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:29,669
(thunder crashing)

478
00:19:31,706 --> 00:19:34,875
Stewie, get the
hell in here!

479
00:19:34,909 --> 00:19:36,176
(chuckles)

480
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,579
That dog sure changed
his mind quick.

481
00:19:44,152 --> 00:19:45,619
Oh, Meg, there you are!

482
00:19:45,653 --> 00:19:46,787
Hey, let's put on
fake eyelashes

483
00:19:46,821 --> 00:19:48,321
and flirt with
people on the bus.

484
00:19:48,356 --> 00:19:51,191
Dad, I'm sorry,
but I can't go with you.

485
00:19:51,225 --> 00:19:53,860
Mmm, are you sure?

486
00:19:53,895 --> 00:19:55,395
I called Green Mountain College.

487
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,930
They let me reschedule
my interview,

488
00:19:56,964 --> 00:19:58,799
so I'm gonna drive
back up there.

489
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,001
It's time for me
to get serious about my life

490
00:20:01,035 --> 00:20:02,702
and take some responsibility.

491
00:20:02,737 --> 00:20:04,571
I don't like this Meg.

492
00:20:04,605 --> 00:20:06,039
I like the fun Meg!

493
00:20:06,074 --> 00:20:07,774
I thought we were friends.

494
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:09,976
Dad, I don't need you
to be my friend.

495
00:20:10,011 --> 00:20:12,345
I need you to be my father.

496
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,147
Well, that is too much
to ask, Meg.

497
00:20:14,182 --> 00:20:16,149
It's hard being a father.

498
00:20:16,184 --> 00:20:18,952
This is why that woman in Texas
drowned all her kids.

499
00:20:18,986 --> 00:20:21,021
I hate the passage of time!

500
00:20:21,055 --> 00:20:23,490
(sobbing):
My little girl's growing up!

501
00:20:23,524 --> 00:20:25,725
(crying)

502
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,727
Yes, she is, Dad.

503
00:20:27,762 --> 00:20:29,262
Yes, she is.

504
00:20:29,297 --> 00:20:31,298
("Night Moves" begins)

505
00:20:38,272 --> 00:20:40,273
MEG: <i>I did get</i>
<i>into Green Mountain College,</i>

506
00:20:40,308 --> 00:20:42,642
<i>and contracted HPV</i>
<i>my first night there.</i>

507
00:20:42,677 --> 00:20:44,311
<i>I got nicknamed the Warthog,</i>

508
00:20:44,345 --> 00:20:47,814
<i>and, like the HPV,</i>
<i>it stuck for life.</i>

509
