2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:10,210
I don't wanna go on a rant here, but America's
foreign policy makes about as much sense

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:14,500
as Beowulf havin' sex with Robert Fulton
at the first battle of Antietam.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,880
When a neo-conservative defenestrates,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,840
it's like Raskolnikov filibustered
dioxin monohydroxanate.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,710
What the hell does "rant" mean?

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,590
"It seems today that all you see

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,800
"Is violence in movies and sex on TV

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,550
"But where are those
good old-fashioned values

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,760
"On which we used to rely?

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,930
"Lucky there's a family guy

12
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,800
"Lucky there's a man who positively
can do all the things that make us

13
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,470
"Laugh and cry

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,890
"He's a family guy

15
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,850
Go, Dust Mites!

16
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,150
- I wish they'd put Chris in already.
- Relax. It's his first game.

17
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,770
Griffin, get in there.

18
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,440
- They're sending him in. Yay, Chris!
- Attaboy, Chris!

19
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,150
That's my son out there.
I taught him how to wipe.

20
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,950
- Why won't you teach me how to wipe, Dad?
- Because you don't have a bottom, son.

21
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,700
- Man, you and that towel are representin'.
- Yo, that's what's just fightin', G!

22
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,120
The Buddy Cianci
Junior High cheerleaders!

23
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,950
Is everybody pumped up?

24
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,120
Give me a D-U-S-T!

25
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,990
D-U-S-T!

26
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,580
M-I-T-E-S!

27
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,450
M-I-T-E-S!

28
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,620
- What does that spell?
- Dust Mites!

29
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,580
- Who's gonna win this game?
- Dust Mites!

30
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,210
My God, what... what just happened to me?

31
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:54,960
It's those sirens. They had us all
completely under their spell.

32
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,330
Like that hypnotist at the airport Hilton.

33
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,960
And... three!

34
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,460
- Wow. Were we just hypnotised?
- That's incredible. I don't remember a thing.

35
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,210
Why do I taste crotch?

36
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,920
I must unlock the secret to
their mind-control powers.

37
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,130
- Can we go now? I'm starvin'.
- The game's almost over.

38
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,380
Try to think about somethin' else.

39
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,360
Ahhhhh...!

40
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,570
- Peter!
- Sorry.

41
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,190
Nice job tonight, Chris.
You wiped the floor with that towel.

42
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,650
Yo, did y'all check me when
that hottie was all up in my Kool-Aid?

43
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,950
I was lookin' to break off somethin',

44
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,910
but my crew gave me the 411 on that skank
and she's all about the bling-bling.

45
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,780
- What's wrong?
- He's speaking in tongues. He's possessed.

46
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,780
Meg, start at Psalm 41. Don't stop readin' till
I tell you. The power of Christ compels you!

47
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,870
- Agh! Agh! Agh!
- The power of Christ compels you!

48
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,040
Stop. He's not possessed.

49
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,660
He's just talking street. Lots of kids do it.

50
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,040
Oh. Well, that's kinda weird.

51
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,500
It's just a phase.
You've gone through a few yourself.

52
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,420
Like those two weeks
you spent narrating your life.

53
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,210
I walked into the kitchen and sat at the table.

54
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:47,290
I grimaced at the questionable meal
Lois had placed in front of me.

55
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:52,710
I'd never tell her how disgusted I was with
her cooking, but somehow I think she knew.

56
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,340
Lois had always been full of energy and life,
but lately I had grown aware of her ageing.

57
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,130
The bright, exuberant eyes
I had fallen in love with

58
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,090
were growing dull and listless
with the long fatigue of a weary life.

59
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,930
I awoke several hours later in a daze.

60
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,140
"I was brought up on the streets,
no moms and dads

61
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,850
"I had to fend for myself
with my own two hands

62
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,060
"But today I'm hurtin', and I'll tell you why

63
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,980
"I got a hangnail
hangin' from my cuticle

64
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,480
"A hangnail
It ain't beautiful

65
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,770
"It hurts like a bitch that I did last night

66
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,770
- Hey, what ya doin'?
- Just layin' back in the cot,

67
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,900
peepin' at this here homey.
Yo, Pops, gimme some cheddar.

68
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,860
Some player-haters be throwin' salt
in my game, grillin' me over my gear.

69
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,780
And I needs to be mackin' style.

70
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:46,280
Well, uh, the important thing is you tried,
son.

71
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,860
There they are. And now to infiltrate this
coven and learn their mind-control secrets.

72
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,950
- I just need to get their attention.
- OK. That was much better.

73
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,990
But it still sucked worse than ever.
What's wrong with you guys?

74
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,210
- Look how cute he is!
- He must be one of the teachers' babies.

75
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,500
He wants to be a cheerleader too.

76
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,130
My! So it's that easy to win you over.

77
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,760
Consider yourselves lucky
I'm not after your gully holes.

78
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,630
Chris starts with all this "Yo, yo, yo" stuff,
and I don't know what he's talkin' about.

79
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,720
So I started beatin' him with a hose.
Then my arm got tired, so I came here.

80
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,260
Perhaps Chris has adopted
another culture's mannerisms

81
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,850
because he doesn't know
enough about his own.

82
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:02,020
I never thought of that. I should
teach Chris about his Irish roots.

83
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,350
We haven't spent time together
since we played Operation.

84
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:10,140
- I'm going for the funny bone, Dad.
- Oh! You touched the sides!

85
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,770
He's wakin' up. Get him
back to the bus station.

86
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,270
Dad, I don't wanna be here.
I wanna be chillin' with my homeys.

87
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,190
Now, Chris, it's important
you learn about your Irish heritage.

88
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:45,780
Archaeological evidence shows Ireland was
very different before the discovery of alcohol.

89
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,620
Most experts believe
it was something like this.

90
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,580
Gentlemen, today we, Ireland's top scientists,

91
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,120
have found a way to convert our
entire population to pure energy.

92
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,410
- It's a glorious day.
- Absolutely.

93
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,370
Hey, Michael McCloud's just
invented a new kind of beverage.

94
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,670
Hm. "Whiskey. "

95
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,510
You were right, Dad. Bein' Irish rocks!

96
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:25,090
That's more like it, son. Today we're gonna
learn about the Griffin family history.

97
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,760
What's a library, Dad?

98
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,550
It's just a place where homeless people
come to shave and go BM. Let's go inside.

99
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,220
Look, Dad. I found
this book on our genealogy.

100
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:41,970
Way to go, son. Here's a picture of
your great-great-granddad, Osias Griffin.

101
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,020
He owned one of the first dozen telephones.

102
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,890
- Hello?
- Hello, Jonathan?

103
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,180
- No. What number are you callin'?
- Seven.

104
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,180
- This is three.
- Oh. Sorry.

105
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:56,350
And his great-grandpa was
Thomas Griffin, a great philosopher.

106
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,900
Thomas, would you please go look for a job?

107
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,650
Why?

108
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,480
Wow! That's cool! Go back even further, Dad.

109
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,360
OK. Settle down, spaz.

110
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:11,570
In 1840, Nathaniel "Nate" Griffin
used to groom horses. What the hell...?

111
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,780
Holy crap, I'm black!

112
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,700
But I-I can't be black.

113
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,450
I gotta say, the man in this book
does look an awful lot like you.

114
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,870
The Diary of Nate Griffin.

115
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,240
"May 7th, 1836."

116
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:36,660
"I was brushing down Lucy, the new colt,
when she let out a fart right near my face. "

117
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:42,000
"So I took her head and stuck it by my butt
and blew a huge fart right back at her. "

118
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,460
That laugh's in here, too. See?

119
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,250
Wow. Then it's true.

120
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,830
Cool! I get to be black and Irish.

121
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,500
Now I can wear clothes that
actually show off my big butt.

122
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,630
I gotta tell Bonnie
I'm sleeping with a black man!

123
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:03,760
Oh, my God! Update! Exclam!
Scott Martin just asked me out again!

124
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,720
Oh, my God. This is date three.
Are you gonna let him get to second base?

125
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,430
I think that would be a bad idea.
And I know something about bad ideas.

126
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:17,010
I'm telling you, Juice,
she's screwin' around behind your back.

127
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,760
And if I were in your Bruno Maglis,
I wouldn't stand for it.

128
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,930
Another mai tai. Thanks.

129
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,220
So, listen...

130
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,180
- Here comes Scott!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

131
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,060
Have yet to discover the secret
of their mind-control powers.

132
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:40,560
Also trying to comprehend their obsession
with the homosexuals from *NS YNC.

133
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,270
Cleveland, you got a minute?
I really need to talk to you.

134
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:50,020
Sure. I was just goin' for a ride. Hop on.

135
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:57,110
- I've found out I have a black ancestor.
- Is that right? That's fantastic, Peter.

136
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:00,570
Yeah, but the problem is,
I got no idea how to be black.

137
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,700
Except for not smilin'
when I get my picture taken.

138
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:09,410
Well, you should go out and commingle
amongst your newly found brethren.

139
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,820
You know, absorb the culture.

140
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:15,370
- Wheelie time! Yee-hah!
- Aaargh!

141
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:21,080
You're right. I should be hangin' around
more black people like myself. Thanks.

142
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,290
- Hey! Peter, what the...?
- It's the vibration.

143
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,420
Who here used to wear a lot of Jheri Curl?

144
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,210
Yeah, that's right. Y'all know that Exxon
Valdez thing? That ain't how it happened.

145
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:39,000
Some brother just fell in the ocean!

146
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,840
God, I remember that. All those seals died.

147
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,710
It was... it was all over the news.

148
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:50,470
The... the Channel Two news with Dan Rather.

149
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:56,090
Although I think Connie Chung might've
been substituting for him that night.

150
00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:01,090
Well, 'bout time for me to be
hittin' the old dusty trail.

151
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,220
I like your hat.

152
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,760
Can't get out that way.

153
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,220
Oh. Found the emergency exit.

154
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,520
1967 was the year that Thurgood Marshall
was named to the Supreme Court of the US.

155
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,270
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

156
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:31,110
Well, I should probably be saddlin' up now.

157
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,530
Oh. Found the fire door.

158
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,110
Urgh! Look at how fat you are.

159
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,360
You disgust me. Oink, oink, fatty.

160
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,360
You'll take butter on that
English muffin, won't you?

161
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,070
You're the cheerleading squad's token blimp!

162
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,910
You don't deserve to eat!

163
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,830
Thanks for bringin' me here.

164
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:03,200
Welcome. For our first order of business,
Cleveland has an announcement.

165
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,540
Yesterday I received reparations

166
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,460
from the family that enslaved my ancestors.

167
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,910
Amen!

168
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,460
The family has become poor white trash since
then, so they only gave what they could.

169
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,790
This tray of scrumptious Rice Krispie treats.

170
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:25,420
I share them with all of you in the hopes that
one day your wounds may be healed as well.

171
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,090
- Amen!
- Right on!

172
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:31,050
- Hey, why is he taking one?
- This is my friend Peter Griffin.

173
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,420
He recently discovered he was black.

174
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,720
He doesn't look very black to me.

175
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,090
Gentlemen, please. Please.
Judge me not by the colour of my skin.

176
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,640
For I have always been there with you.

177
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,970
I was there when George and Weezy
moved on up to the East Side.

178
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,140
Oh! Oh! Hallelujah! Those were happy times!

179
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:55,020
But... but... but I was also
there for the bad times.

180
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:00,310
When Florida lost James to that
tragic auto accident. Oh! Oh!

181
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:05,100
And I was there when Tootie got
those terribly painful braces. Oh, yes.

182
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:09,480
And when Arnold Jackson got
beat up by the Gooch, I was there.

183
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,230
So before you decide that I don't belong here,
remember this: I was there!

184
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,150
Way to go, Peter! You tell it like it is!

185
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:31,070
Now, Chris, what's the secret to happiness?

186
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,860
- Money!
- Very good. Babs, give him a caramel.

187
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,870
Hey. Hey, Lois, what are
your parents doin' here?

188
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,240
They surprised us with a visit after
I told them about your recent discovery.

189
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,160
Yes. Peter, we hear you're a Negro now.

190
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:56,920
Yep. I even got my own posse. Big Dog,
T-Bone, Shades, go make some sandwiches.

191
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,870
- We'll hook up later.
- My jacket's in there. Please don't write on it.

192
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:05,340
I think Chris and Meg should know
the Pewterschmidt side of their ancestry too.

193
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,090
Did you know the Pewterschmidts
were among the first colonists?

194
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:13,050
Now, kids, don't be taken in
by the man. Stay black and proud.

195
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:17,010
Here's Silas Pewterschmidt
bartering with some local Indians.

196
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,010
- Cool!
- Here's a picture of...

197
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,380
- Oh. Never mind that one.
- What was that?

198
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:25,970
Nothing. Just some fellow we fed and took
care of in exchange for doing a few chores.

199
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,890
You mean a slave! Let me see that!

200
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,890
Oh, my God!

201
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,390
It's Nate Griffin!

202
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:38,260
Well... 'bout time for me to be
hittin' the old dusty trail.

203
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,770
Lois, your family owned my family!

204
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:46,730
- Daddy, is that true?
- It appears so. Boy, this is embarrassing.

205
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:50,900
- Yes, it is. And don't call me "boy"!
- Peter! Please, calm down.

206
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,310
Babs, it's time we went to bed.
Things'll look better tomorrow.

207
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,610
Come here, kids. Give Grandma
and Grandpa a kiss good night.

208
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,270
Whoa!

209
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,320
Argh!

210
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,690
You can whip me all you like, white devil,
but you'll never break my spirit!

211
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:17,240
There must be some clue to the source
of their mental manipulation techniques.

212
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,240
Your Body and You.

213
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,410
"Every four weeks, it's entirely normal
for every young woman to... "

214
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:27,990
Oh, my God! Oh! That's the most
disgusting thing I've ever heard in my life!

215
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,790
Ugh!

216
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:35,160
That totally sucked! You guys
call yourselves cheerleaders?

217
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,660
Well, I call you cheer-losers!

218
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,290
Cindi is definitely the alpha of the group.

219
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,620
And what happened with the pyramid?
I almost broke my neck!

220
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:47,880
The pyramid. Of course!
That must be the key to their power.

221
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Mission objective: Eliminate Cindi and take
her place at the top of the pyramid.

222
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:57,260
They're getting nude! I mustn't watch.
It's not the proper thing... Whoa!

223
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,550
I say! Nice ones, Jeanine.

224
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:02,800
And look at Lisa in all of
her curvaceous glory.

225
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,130
It appears my wee-wee has been
stricken with rigor mortis.

226
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,180
- Good mornin'.
- Peter, what on earth are you wearing?

227
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:18,010
It's a dashiki. And don't call me Peter. That's
my slave name. Call me Kichwa Tembo.

228
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,810
Cool! And I'll be Mambuto O'Malley.

229
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,390
- Peter...
- Kichwa!

230
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:25,100
I'd like to have a word with you.

231
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,850
- Peter, I think...
- Kichwa!

232
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,350
Kichwa, we're both sensible men.

233
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,060
There must be something
I can do to make it right.

234
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,810
Actually there is. I want reparations,
just like Cleveland got.

235
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:40,110
- What are you talking about?
- I want an apology and Rice Krispie treats.

236
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,270
I will not give you an apology,

237
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,650
and I assume "Rice Krispie treats" is
black slang for money, so here's $10,000.

238
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,780
I expect you never to mention
this ugly business again.

239
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,240
$10,000?

240
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,070
Not enough? Make it 20.
How do you spell "Kichwa"?

241
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:57,900
Screw the "Kichwa".
Make it out to "Peter", P-E-T-E...

242
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:02,610
This just in: Slave-owner descendant
Carter Pewterschmidt has paid $20,000,

243
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,370
or two million pennies,
in reparations to a local black man.

244
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,450
We now go live to the local black man.

245
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:13,330
Well, the money helps, but I'll
always feel my ancestor's pain.

246
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:18,040
Hey, from down there, does it look like
I'm talking into a bunch of robot penises?

247
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,250
Lois, come and see what I did
with the money your dad gave me.

248
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:28,040
Oh, my God! You turned the den
into Pee-wee's Playhouse?

249
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,500
"Come on, get up

250
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,000
"Knock off your nappin'

251
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,040
"It's a crazy, messed-up place
where anything can happen

252
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:38,340
"There's a chair that freakin' talks

253
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,960
"There's some fish that give advice
Holy crap!

254
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:45,550
"It's screwy in Peter's Playhouse

255
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:49,800
- Peter...
- Watch this. Watch this. Hey, Jambi!

256
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,590
- OK, say it.
- Mekka lekka hi... God, I hate you so much.

257
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,050
That reparation money
should be going to a black charity.

258
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,310
The king of cartoons will be here in five
minutes, and I won't have you embarrass me.

259
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,220
You're acting ridiculous.

260
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,220
You said the secret word!

261
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,060
Uh-oh.

262
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:16,890
- Hey, you're that black guy I saw on the
news. - Uh, yeah, that's me.

263
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,850
- I need backup. I've got a stolen vehicle here.
- But this is my car.

264
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,980
Suspect's getting belligerent. Officer down.

265
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:32,860
So it's agreed: We'll keep on pretending to
like pigs' feet just to confound the white man.

266
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,650
Uh, sorry I'm late, you guys.
The white man was makin' me his bitch.

267
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,360
What? Oh, sorry. His be-atch.

268
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:44,740
Peter, we know about your selfish
squandering of your reparation money.

269
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:49,200
I shared mine. You, however, have
given nothin' back to the community.

270
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,280
But... that's not true.

271
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,990
I've brought you the greatest gift of all.

272
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,290
A child's laughter.

273
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,950
- Peter, I think you should go.
- Yeah, I'm going.

274
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,620
Hi, guys.

275
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,040
Uh, hey, how's it goin'?

276
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:15,580
No one wants to sit with me.
It's like I'm a freakin' leper.

277
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:19,000
- Hey, can we sit there?
- No, these are saved.

278
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:23,170
- Where is Cindi?
- She'd better show up. It's almost half-time.

279
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:29,550
Cindi, I'd feel worse about this if you didn't
spell your name with that insufferable i.

280
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:33,590
Oh, and that cockadoodie smiley face
you use to dot it. You sicken me!

281
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,010
I'm not gonna hurt you.

282
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,640
- Agh!
- Hello, Peter.

283
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,520
Nate Griffin. Oh, my God, you're haunting me
because I've been a terrible black man.

284
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,560
You gotta stop puttin'
so much importance on race.

285
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,310
- I didn't.
- You didn't?

286
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:00,810
No. If I had, would I have slept with
your white great-great-great-great-granny?

287
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:04,560
- I guess not.
- I wouldn't have slept with her sister, neither.

288
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:09,440
You see, Peter, the most important thing is
how a man acts. You see what I'm gettin' at?

289
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,190
You think I should do something good
with that reparation money.

290
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,530
- That'd be mighty fine, Peter.
- I guess you're right.

291
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:20,690
For what it's worth, I'm sorry my wife's
ancestors made you suffer so much.

292
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:26,860
Don't worry about me. If it makes you feel
better, I peed in their cereal every morning.

293
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:31,660
- Well, so long, Peter.
- Wait. Before you go, what's heaven like?

294
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,990
Oh, it's fine. There's a shortage of chairs.

295
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,080
Oh.

296
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,200
Yeah.

297
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,700
Take it easy, Peter.

298
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,000
Look, we're just going to
have to go on without her.

299
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,960
- Give me a D!
- D!

300
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:02,790
That's enough of that. There's a hunting knife
under your seats. On my command... Argh!

301
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:08,760
Argh! You idiots! I had them!
Cindi was right. We need a lot more work.

302
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,880
Uh, excuse me. Yeah.

303
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,050
Uh, hi. I'm Peter Griffin.

304
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:18,970
Listen, uh, as many of you may know,
I recently came into some money.

305
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,550
Well, I don't really deserve it.

306
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:25,430
So I've decided to share it with my brothers!

307
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,180
Uh... Actually, I just meant the black guys.

308
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:35,850
That was very generous.
Look how happy you've made everyone.

309
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:40,230
It just goes to show you, Lois,
it doesn't matter if you're black or white.

310
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:44,190
- The only colour that really matters is green.
- Oh, Peter!

311
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,810
I wonder what happened to Cindi.

00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,820
