12
00:00:34,824 --> 00:00:36,038
Peter, we got to talk.

13
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:36,634
Ugh.

14
00:00:36,635 --> 00:00:39,260
I'm concerned about
Stewie's preschool.

15
00:00:39,261 --> 00:00:41,395
Look what they're serving
at snack time.

16
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:42,895
Is-is that...?

17
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:44,130
It's dog milk.

18
00:00:44,165 --> 00:00:46,132
They're serving dog
milk to our children.

19
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:48,067
Aw, sweet, dilk.

20
00:00:48,102 --> 00:00:50,169
I don't want Stewie
in that school anymore.

21
00:00:50,205 --> 00:00:52,205
It seems like it's
really gone downhill.

22
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,773
She's not wrong to worry.

23
00:00:53,808 --> 00:00:55,308
There's a sign
in the bathroom that says,

24
00:00:55,343 --> 00:00:57,343
"If it's brown, let it mellow."

25
00:00:57,378 --> 00:00:59,312
Sometimes it crests
the toilet lid.

26
00:00:59,347 --> 00:01:01,781
Peter, I think we should
send Stewie to Corridors.

27
00:01:01,816 --> 00:01:03,015
I know it's
a little pricey,

28
00:01:03,051 --> 00:01:04,650
but it's the best
preschool in the area.

29
00:01:04,686 --> 00:01:06,819
Really? Is that the one
where they make 'em dress

30
00:01:06,855 --> 00:01:09,388
in the little shorts and hats
like the guy in AC/DC?

31
00:01:09,424 --> 00:01:10,890
Yeah, why does he
wear that outfit?

32
00:01:10,925 --> 00:01:12,391
'Cause he rocks.

33
00:01:12,427 --> 00:01:14,560
♪ ♪

34
00:01:14,596 --> 00:01:15,962
When I picked this,

35
00:01:15,997 --> 00:01:19,532
I didn't know I'd have
to wear it when I'm 60!

36
00:01:19,567 --> 00:01:21,734
I'm very cold!

37
00:01:26,474 --> 00:01:28,641
You know what seems
like a lie to me?

38
00:01:28,676 --> 00:01:31,210
A Forever stamp that says
"Love" on it.

39
00:01:31,246 --> 00:01:33,312
Oh, you want to
go ahead of me?

40
00:01:33,348 --> 00:01:34,413
Hey, how are you?

41
00:01:34,449 --> 00:01:36,949
You know what seems
like a lie to me?

42
00:01:36,985 --> 00:01:39,352
I can help the fourth
person in line.

43
00:01:39,387 --> 00:01:41,721
One, two, three... yes!

44
00:01:41,756 --> 00:01:44,056
Cleveland,
you work here?

45
00:01:44,092 --> 00:01:46,359
Yup, finally landed
myself a job.

46
00:01:46,394 --> 00:01:48,995
Hey, what can
Brown do for you?

47
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,062
(laughs)

48
00:01:50,098 --> 00:01:51,397
That's our
competitor, though.

49
00:01:51,432 --> 00:01:52,899
I'm not supposed
to say that.

50
00:01:52,934 --> 00:01:55,735
It's grounds for dismissal
if anyone ever got fired here,

51
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:56,736
but they don't.

52
00:01:56,771 --> 00:01:58,204
Well, good for you.

53
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,972
Oh, could I get a
return receipt for this?

54
00:02:00,008 --> 00:02:02,808
It's Stewie's registration
form for his new school.

55
00:02:02,844 --> 00:02:04,610
Lil' Papa Stew-Stew's
off to college?

56
00:02:04,646 --> 00:02:05,878
No, just preschool.

57
00:02:05,914 --> 00:02:07,013
He's very young.

58
00:02:07,048 --> 00:02:09,448
Can you just charge me
my weirdly uneven price

59
00:02:09,484 --> 00:02:10,650
so I can be done?

60
00:02:10,685 --> 00:02:13,185
All right, that's $2.16.

61
00:02:13,221 --> 00:02:16,923
$4.37 if you want to
send it the priority.

62
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:19,058
Oh, no, we got to start
saving our pennies

63
00:02:19,093 --> 00:02:21,193
now that we're sending
Stewie to a new school.

64
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:23,396
I'm actually doing some
job hunting after this.

65
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:24,564
SEAMUS:
Let's go up there!

66
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,699
You know, Lois,
the post office is hiring.

67
00:02:26,734 --> 00:02:27,700
Really?

68
00:02:27,735 --> 00:02:29,435
Oh, wow, that'd be great.

69
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,671
Yeah, I'd be happy to
get you an interview,

70
00:02:31,706 --> 00:02:34,173
and as a white woman,
you'd be a minority here,

71
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,409
unless you're an alcoholic.

72
00:02:47,021 --> 00:02:49,522
Wow, this place
is really fancy.

73
00:02:49,557 --> 00:02:52,191
Their Flat Stanley is
actually award-winning actor

74
00:02:52,226 --> 00:02:53,426
Stanley Tucci.

75
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:57,263
Sometimes I wear glasses
and sometimes I don't.

76
00:02:57,298 --> 00:02:58,864
Hi, I'm Chadley.

77
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,199
I've been kidnapped
three times

78
00:03:00,234 --> 00:03:01,467
because I come
from money.

79
00:03:01,502 --> 00:03:03,269
Oh, yes, I've heard
about your family.

80
00:03:03,304 --> 00:03:05,404
You've had two older
brothers die of drugs?

81
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,405
That's right.

82
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:07,607
Stewie, what would you say

83
00:03:07,642 --> 00:03:09,308
to a playdate at
my house tomorrow?

84
00:03:09,344 --> 00:03:11,444
That sounds delightful.

85
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:14,647
My word, it feels so good
to finally be where I belong.

86
00:03:14,682 --> 00:03:17,783
Like Judd Hirsch at
the gigantic sweater store.

87
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,620
Hi, uh, all five of us
are Judd Hirsch.

88
00:03:20,655 --> 00:03:22,989
Do you have a sweater big
enough to fit all of us?

89
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:26,325
Okay, everybody climb in.

90
00:03:27,495 --> 00:03:30,596
Ah, I can't wait
to spill soup on this.

91
00:03:30,632 --> 00:03:33,466
Okay, Judds, shamble away.

92
00:03:38,373 --> 00:03:39,939
Good having
you aboard, Lois.

93
00:03:39,974 --> 00:03:41,707
Let me show you around.

94
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:42,875
That guy right there?

95
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,876
Larry.

96
00:03:43,911 --> 00:03:45,011
Okay, got it.

97
00:03:45,046 --> 00:03:46,012
A-And what's this giant,

98
00:03:46,047 --> 00:03:47,013
(echoing):
empty,

99
00:03:47,048 --> 00:03:48,914
football-stadium-sized room?

100
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,883
Oh, the post office
anticipates

101
00:03:50,918 --> 00:03:52,551
that within the
next five years

102
00:03:52,587 --> 00:03:55,354
at least 200 million men
in this country will be

103
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,723
ordering and
receiving RealDolls.

104
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:00,559
Every man will have seven
to nine RealDolls.

105
00:04:00,595 --> 00:04:02,662
Asians, blonde
Southern girls,

106
00:04:02,697 --> 00:04:04,830
blonde Asians
capable of performing

107
00:04:04,866 --> 00:04:06,799
every possible sexual act,

108
00:04:06,834 --> 00:04:08,868
or at least
incapable of refusing.

109
00:04:08,903 --> 00:04:10,302
You can put one
in your car

110
00:04:10,338 --> 00:04:12,805
and drive in the car pool
lane with it and then

111
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,508
maybe you push her head down,
thus defeating the purpose

112
00:04:15,543 --> 00:04:17,877
of the car pool lane while
fulfilling the purpose

113
00:04:17,912 --> 00:04:19,145
of the RealDoll.

114
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,546
Maybe a trucker goes by.

115
00:04:20,581 --> 00:04:23,215
You say, "Hey, Janine,
give him a show."

116
00:04:23,251 --> 00:04:25,985
Maybe later you ask yourself
some tough questions, like,

117
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,687
"Why is it so
important to you

118
00:04:27,722 --> 00:04:29,455
to impress and
excite truckers?"

119
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,257
Anyhoo, grab that
letter opener.

120
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:34,160
I'm gonna show you why you
should never mail cash.

121
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:39,565
Another good postal tip is,

122
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,500
if you wait to deliver
your mail at night,

123
00:04:41,536 --> 00:04:44,203
you can smell a lot
of really nice dinners.

124
00:04:44,238 --> 00:04:46,972
Oh, no, it's that
Amazon drone.

125
00:04:47,008 --> 00:04:48,240
Try to ignore it.

126
00:04:48,276 --> 00:04:49,842
Hey, Cleveland,
what are you doing?

127
00:04:49,877 --> 00:04:50,910
Taking a walk?

128
00:04:50,945 --> 00:04:52,545
No, I'm delivering mail.

129
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,546
By foot?

130
00:04:53,581 --> 00:04:55,214
Yeah, that won't take too long.

131
00:04:55,249 --> 00:04:56,382
Well, got to go.

132
00:04:56,417 --> 00:05:00,219
Got to deliver these fat pants
to your fat son.

133
00:05:00,254 --> 00:05:02,488
He was harsh but
not untruthful.

134
00:05:02,523 --> 00:05:04,590
We got to special-order
Cleveland Jr.'s pants

135
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,893
from a company that
manufactures grill covers.

136
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,366
Thanks for coming
over, Stewie.

137
00:05:14,402 --> 00:05:15,534
Oh, thanks
for having me.

138
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:16,969
Quite a place
you've got here.

139
00:05:17,004 --> 00:05:18,304
Your mother seemed nice.

140
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:21,107
Yeah, I've only met her
a couple of times, but yeah.

141
00:05:21,142 --> 00:05:22,341
This is my bedroom.

142
00:05:26,647 --> 00:05:29,215
Is that car bed
a Bentley?

143
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,649
And is that guy
the driver?

144
00:05:30,685 --> 00:05:33,452
Ready for this evening's
trip to Snoozetown, sir?

145
00:05:33,488 --> 00:05:34,453
Not yet.

146
00:05:34,489 --> 00:05:35,489
Sad story.

147
00:05:35,523 --> 00:05:36,889
He used to drive the bed

148
00:05:36,924 --> 00:05:38,224
for Michael
Jackson's monkey.

149
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:40,326
CHAUFFEUR: I've seen some
terrible things.

150
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:41,794
This is extraordinary.

151
00:05:41,829 --> 00:05:43,195
Oh, it's fine,
I suppose,

152
00:05:43,231 --> 00:05:44,463
but you probably have

153
00:05:44,499 --> 00:05:46,232
even nicer things
at your mansion.

154
00:05:46,267 --> 00:05:47,900
I'd love to come
see it sometime.

155
00:05:47,935 --> 00:05:50,136
Oh, um, y-yes,
yes, my mansion.

156
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:52,338
Y-Yes, you-you should
come see my mansion,

157
00:05:52,373 --> 00:05:53,472
b-by all means.

158
00:05:53,508 --> 00:05:54,740
I mean, not-not
right this minute.

159
00:05:54,776 --> 00:05:57,076
I-I have the U.S.
men's wrestling team there--

160
00:05:57,111 --> 00:05:58,210
I'm gonna kill a wrestler--

161
00:05:58,246 --> 00:05:59,445
but then after that,
you should.

162
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,780
I can't wait.

163
00:06:00,815 --> 00:06:02,848
Come on, let's go see if
the maid brought her son,

164
00:06:02,884 --> 00:06:05,484
so we can push him and
he can't do anything.

165
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,020
God, I like it here,
but what am I doing?

166
00:06:08,055 --> 00:06:09,522
I don't have a fancy house.

167
00:06:09,557 --> 00:06:12,258
I'm living a lie, like FDR.

168
00:06:12,293 --> 00:06:17,062
And so I say to you, America,
we are going to win this war,

169
00:06:17,098 --> 00:06:19,098
we're going to end
this depression,

170
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:22,535
and there's no reason
to suspect that I cannot walk.

171
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,537
God bless America!

172
00:06:24,572 --> 00:06:28,507
("Hail to the Chief" plays)

173
00:06:28,543 --> 00:06:29,575
And cut.

174
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:30,610
The newsreel's over.

175
00:06:30,645 --> 00:06:32,411
Thank you, Mr. President.

176
00:06:32,446 --> 00:06:33,913
You're welcome, gentlemen.

177
00:06:33,948 --> 00:06:37,449
Now, if you'd kindly kick me
into the closet with the mops.

178
00:06:40,922 --> 00:06:43,422
Ah, must be a Yale man.

179
00:06:43,457 --> 00:06:44,723
Shut up.

180
00:06:48,429 --> 00:06:50,429
Hello, loyal mailwoman.

181
00:06:50,464 --> 00:06:52,164
This is a letter
to Hollywood,

182
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,000
saying, "Keep it up!
Movies are great!"

183
00:06:56,037 --> 00:06:58,003
Cleveland, what should
I do with this?

184
00:06:58,039 --> 00:06:59,972
I-It just says
"Hollywood, U.S.A.,"

185
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:01,340
and this isn't a stamp,

186
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,008
it's the little
sticker from an apple.

187
00:07:03,044 --> 00:07:04,677
Oh, I can't never
get those off.

188
00:07:04,712 --> 00:07:05,712
I just eat them.

189
00:07:05,746 --> 00:07:07,346
Anyway, just put
it in here.

190
00:07:07,381 --> 00:07:08,414
But what's that?

191
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:09,748
It's the dead letter bin.

192
00:07:09,784 --> 00:07:12,518
It's all the stale mail
what never got delivered

193
00:07:12,553 --> 00:07:15,754
for one reason or the other:
incomplete addresses,

194
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:18,858
house at the top of a hill,
anyone who uses one of those

195
00:07:18,893 --> 00:07:21,093
French sevens with
a slash in it.

196
00:07:21,128 --> 00:07:22,428
Well, this is horrible.

197
00:07:22,463 --> 00:07:23,729
I'm going to organize these.

198
00:07:23,764 --> 00:07:25,264
There might be some
we could resend.

199
00:07:25,299 --> 00:07:26,999
That's above
and beyond, Lois.

200
00:07:27,034 --> 00:07:29,201
You know, you do
the uniform proud,

201
00:07:29,237 --> 00:07:30,636
like I like to think I--

202
00:07:30,671 --> 00:07:32,938
oh, chili dog got me.

203
00:07:32,974 --> 00:07:33,939
Look at all these.

204
00:07:33,975 --> 00:07:35,007
This is a mess.

205
00:07:35,042 --> 00:07:37,610
Here's two that
are stuck together.

206
00:07:37,645 --> 00:07:39,011
What the hell?

207
00:07:39,046 --> 00:07:40,179
This is from Peter.

208
00:07:43,484 --> 00:07:45,818
Who the hell is Gretchen Mercer?

209
00:07:45,853 --> 00:07:49,255
And this is postmarked
a week before our wedding!

210
00:07:54,328 --> 00:07:56,962
Aw, there was a time
when the president

211
00:07:56,998 --> 00:08:00,266
of the Jonathan Taylor Thomas
Fan Club got a lot of mail.

212
00:08:06,187 --> 00:08:08,081
I don't know
what to do, Bonnie.

213
00:08:08,082 --> 00:08:09,548
Why would Peter
write a letter

214
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:12,151
to another woman
just before our wedding?

215
00:08:12,186 --> 00:08:14,019
Why don't you just
open it and read it?

216
00:08:14,055 --> 00:08:15,055
What?!

217
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:16,422
Th-That's a
federal offense.

218
00:08:16,457 --> 00:08:17,756
I can't do that.

219
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:19,491
Don't you realize,
as a postal employee,

220
00:08:19,527 --> 00:08:22,294
I'm 6,004th in line
for the presidency?

221
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:24,129
Well, then why don't you
just deliver the letter

222
00:08:24,165 --> 00:08:27,066
and see for yourself
who this Gretchen Mercer is?

223
00:08:27,101 --> 00:08:29,001
Bonnie,
that's a great idea.

224
00:08:29,036 --> 00:08:31,036
Although it could be
a little awkward.

225
00:08:31,072 --> 00:08:33,338
You could always just
ask Peter about it.

226
00:08:33,374 --> 00:08:35,507
No, he won't talk
about anything serious

227
00:08:35,543 --> 00:08:37,042
unless there's
a crackling fire

228
00:08:37,078 --> 00:08:40,012
to punctuate uncomfortable
family revelations.

229
00:08:40,047 --> 00:08:42,481
(fire crackling)

230
00:08:42,516 --> 00:08:44,116
I didn't fall
off the roof.

231
00:08:44,151 --> 00:08:45,651
I jumped.

232
00:08:45,686 --> 00:08:47,119
(fire crackling)

233
00:08:47,154 --> 00:08:48,887
I never found
you attractive,

234
00:08:48,923 --> 00:08:51,190
and what's more,
I never respected you.

235
00:08:51,225 --> 00:08:52,724
(fire crackling)

236
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,726
I know about Maurice.

237
00:08:54,762 --> 00:08:57,196
(fire crackling)

238
00:08:57,231 --> 00:08:59,598
Which Maurice?

239
00:09:03,471 --> 00:09:05,437
Oh, Brian,
I need your help!

240
00:09:05,473 --> 00:09:07,272
Chadley wants to
have a playdate,

241
00:09:07,308 --> 00:09:08,373
here at my house!

242
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:10,142
Well, that's great.
No, it's not!

243
00:09:10,177 --> 00:09:11,543
I can't let him
see this dump.

244
00:09:11,579 --> 00:09:14,480
Come on, Stewie, Chadley should
like you for who are.

245
00:09:14,515 --> 00:09:16,081
Besides, this place
isn't so bad.

246
00:09:16,117 --> 00:09:19,284
Brian, Chadley's parents
each have their own bathroom.

247
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,854
I've seen the fat man
pee through Lois' legs

248
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:23,388
while she's sitting
on the toilet.

249
00:09:23,424 --> 00:09:25,524
What I've got to do
is find a spectacular house

250
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:28,026
that I can pretend is mine
to impress Chadley.

251
00:09:28,062 --> 00:09:29,828
Oh, why don't you just
use Babs and Carter's?

252
00:09:29,864 --> 00:09:30,996
I can't, they're having

253
00:09:31,031 --> 00:09:33,098
an<i> Eyes Wide Shut</i>
party all weekend.

254
00:09:33,134 --> 00:09:35,567
I can't find my wiener
with this mask.

255
00:09:35,603 --> 00:09:36,568
All right, time-out.

256
00:09:36,604 --> 00:09:38,036
Let's-let's all just find

257
00:09:38,072 --> 00:09:40,439
our wieners and then
put the masks back on.

258
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:48,881
Okay, 940,
this is the house.

259
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,016
(doorbell rings)

260
00:09:51,051 --> 00:09:53,152
Hi, are you
Gretchen Mercer?

261
00:09:53,187 --> 00:09:54,553
Yes, may I help you?

262
00:09:54,588 --> 00:09:59,224
Oh, yeah, we found an old
letter addressed to you.

263
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,792
Peter Griffin?

264
00:10:00,828 --> 00:10:02,961
Wow, this is from
an old boyfriend.

265
00:10:02,997 --> 00:10:04,029
What?

266
00:10:04,064 --> 00:10:05,330
(laughs nervously)

267
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:07,366
Wow, well, um,
here-here's the nutty thing:

268
00:10:07,401 --> 00:10:08,567
believe it or not,

269
00:10:08,602 --> 00:10:11,470
I'm actually married
to Peter Griffin right now.

270
00:10:11,505 --> 00:10:14,006
Huh, that is quite
a coincidence.

271
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,108
I wonder why he
was writing me.

272
00:10:18,145 --> 00:10:19,444
I see you move
your finger along

273
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,445
as you read.

274
00:10:20,481 --> 00:10:22,114
That's what
little kids do.

275
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:23,348
Oh, it was nothing.

276
00:10:23,384 --> 00:10:25,517
He was just writing
to say that he was excited

277
00:10:25,553 --> 00:10:27,753
about getting married
and that he finally had enough

278
00:10:27,788 --> 00:10:30,789
Camel Cash to get a leather
jacket and a pool floatie.

279
00:10:30,824 --> 00:10:32,591
Huh, well,
thank you, Gretchen.

280
00:10:32,626 --> 00:10:34,059
I am very relieved.

281
00:10:34,094 --> 00:10:35,360
I was thinking the worst.

282
00:10:35,396 --> 00:10:36,662
Oh, I understand,

283
00:10:36,697 --> 00:10:38,830
but you have nothing
to worry about.

284
00:10:38,866 --> 00:10:39,831
You're right.

285
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:41,934
I guess jealousy's
my weak spot.

286
00:10:41,969 --> 00:10:43,435
(chuckling):
Everyone has one.

287
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,870
Even Achilles.

288
00:10:44,905 --> 00:10:47,439
So, you can only be injured
on your Achilles' tendon?

289
00:10:47,474 --> 00:10:48,474
That's right.

290
00:10:48,509 --> 00:10:50,075
My mother dipped me
into the River Styx

291
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,577
and she held me by my heels,

292
00:10:51,612 --> 00:10:53,612
so that's the only part
that can be injured.

293
00:10:53,647 --> 00:10:55,047
How about you, Testiclies?

294
00:10:55,082 --> 00:10:57,849
It's the same--
it's-it's-it's similar.

295
00:10:57,885 --> 00:11:01,887
(piano music playing)

296
00:11:05,726 --> 00:11:07,659
So, what do you think
of the house, Brian?

297
00:11:07,695 --> 00:11:09,861
As far as Chadley knows,
this is where I live.

298
00:11:09,897 --> 00:11:11,230
Stewie, who owns
this place?

299
00:11:11,265 --> 00:11:13,198
Oh, just some rich
idiot I saw bragging

300
00:11:13,234 --> 00:11:15,067
about his vacation
on Instagram.

301
00:11:15,102 --> 00:11:17,469
He posted a picture
of his feet in sand.

302
00:11:17,504 --> 00:11:19,104
You're a guy,
don't do that.

303
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:20,239
What a dick.

304
00:11:20,274 --> 00:11:21,974
Hey, I'll swallow
his dental floss.

305
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:22,975
You pull it out of me

306
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:23,976
and put it back
on the roll.

307
00:11:24,011 --> 00:11:24,977
Good call.

308
00:11:25,012 --> 00:11:25,978
(doorbell rings)

309
00:11:26,013 --> 00:11:27,246
Ah, that must be Chadley.

310
00:11:28,616 --> 00:11:29,581
Hi, Stewie.

311
00:11:29,617 --> 00:11:30,749
I love your house.

312
00:11:30,784 --> 00:11:31,850
Where are your servants?

313
00:11:31,885 --> 00:11:33,418
Oh, probably
cooking bananas

314
00:11:33,454 --> 00:11:34,820
and doing the
cha-cha-cha.

315
00:11:34,855 --> 00:11:37,189
You know, this is a
great house for a party.

316
00:11:37,224 --> 00:11:38,890
You could invite
the whole class.

317
00:11:38,926 --> 00:11:40,892
I-I say,
that's a brilliant idea!

318
00:11:40,928 --> 00:11:42,127
What the hell
are you doing?

319
00:11:42,162 --> 00:11:44,263
Relax, these people
are gone for a few more days.

320
00:11:44,298 --> 00:11:45,330
I'll invite everyone over

321
00:11:45,366 --> 00:11:47,599
and impress the whole
class in one shot.

322
00:11:47,635 --> 00:11:49,735
That'll cover my
playdates for a year.

323
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:50,902
You really think
that'll work?

324
00:11:50,938 --> 00:11:52,004
Absolutely.

325
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:54,072
And when it does,
I'll be as popular

326
00:11:54,108 --> 00:11:55,240
as the first kid in school

327
00:11:55,276 --> 00:11:56,742
to get his driver's license.

328
00:11:56,777 --> 00:11:59,311
Hey, heard you
got your license.

329
00:11:59,346 --> 00:12:00,445
(seductively):
Maybe after school,

330
00:12:00,481 --> 00:12:02,547
you could take me
to get some groceries?

331
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:05,284
(seductively): Yeah, or maybe you and me
hop in that car of yours

332
00:12:05,319 --> 00:12:07,252
and do some
grocery shopping?

333
00:12:07,288 --> 00:12:09,788
(seductively): Looks like you have
a roomy backseat.

334
00:12:09,823 --> 00:12:13,091
I'd love to fill that
with groceries after school.

335
00:12:13,127 --> 00:12:14,593
Hey, it's Stewie.

336
00:12:14,628 --> 00:12:17,729
All I know about cars
is what my mom does.

337
00:12:20,768 --> 00:12:22,567
(knocking at door)

338
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:25,771
Gretchen?!

339
00:12:25,806 --> 00:12:27,105
Wow, you look great!

340
00:12:27,141 --> 00:12:28,640
Yeah, I didn't have kids.

341
00:12:28,676 --> 00:12:30,008
Oh, yeah, of course,

342
00:12:30,044 --> 00:12:31,443
but what the hell
are you doing here?!

343
00:12:31,478 --> 00:12:33,145
I haven't seen
you in 20 years!

344
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,314
Peter, I finally got
your letter.

345
00:12:35,349 --> 00:12:37,849
You know, the one where you said
that you were having doubts

346
00:12:37,885 --> 00:12:40,152
about marrying Lois
and you still had thoughts

347
00:12:40,187 --> 00:12:41,320
about marrying me.

348
00:12:41,355 --> 00:12:44,423
Gretchen, I wrote
that a long time ago.

349
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,224
Well, my answer
is yes, Peter.

350
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,593
Yes, I will marry you!

351
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:50,429
Gretchen,
I am already happily--

352
00:12:50,464 --> 00:12:52,197
moderately hap--
relative-- I am--

353
00:12:52,232 --> 00:12:53,465
I am married.

354
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,101
Oh, then I suppose your wife
is entitled to know

355
00:12:56,136 --> 00:12:57,736
that you were still
in love with me

356
00:12:57,771 --> 00:12:59,471
just days before your wedding.

357
00:12:59,506 --> 00:13:00,439
(Peter gasps)

358
00:13:00,474 --> 00:13:01,540
Blackmail!

359
00:13:01,575 --> 00:13:02,641
Thank you, Cleveland.

360
00:13:02,676 --> 00:13:04,309
And I don't know
what to call the thing

361
00:13:04,345 --> 00:13:05,477
you're doing to me, lady.

362
00:13:10,846 --> 00:13:12,913
Look, Gretchen,
I-I know I wrote you

363
00:13:12,948 --> 00:13:15,549
that letter, and-and-and
I meant it at the time, but...

364
00:13:15,584 --> 00:13:17,517
it was 20 years ago!

365
00:13:17,553 --> 00:13:19,820
I may have had some
doubts before my wedding,

366
00:13:19,855 --> 00:13:21,354
but what guy doesn't?

367
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,522
And now I know

368
00:13:22,558 --> 00:13:24,791
I made the right choice
marrying Lois.

369
00:13:24,828 --> 00:13:27,161
(sighs)
Well, she's a lucky woman,

370
00:13:27,196 --> 00:13:28,795
and I'm sorry for what I said.

371
00:13:28,831 --> 00:13:31,431
I certainly don't want
to cause any trouble for you.

372
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:33,400
It's just that when I got
this letter, it reminded me

373
00:13:33,435 --> 00:13:35,368
how sweet and funny
you always were.

374
00:13:35,404 --> 00:13:37,637
That's nice,
but I-I should go.

375
00:13:37,673 --> 00:13:39,339
Thanks for not making
fun of me for ordering

376
00:13:39,374 --> 00:13:40,407
a hot chocolate,

377
00:13:40,442 --> 00:13:42,075
and go ahead
and look into Facebook

378
00:13:42,111 --> 00:13:44,244
'cause this is kind of
what it's for.

379
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,847
Wait, before we say
our final good-bye,

380
00:13:46,882 --> 00:13:49,316
what do you say we
have one last hurrah?

381
00:13:49,351 --> 00:13:50,517
I've got two tickets

382
00:13:50,552 --> 00:13:52,652
to a Ray LaMontagne
concert tonight.

383
00:13:52,688 --> 00:13:55,355
Oh, I-I'm not sure
that's a good idea.

384
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,691
It feels a little weird
going out with another lady.

385
00:13:57,726 --> 00:14:00,827
Oh, come on, Peter,
I drove all this way.

386
00:14:00,863 --> 00:14:03,063
Let me go home
with one last good memory,

387
00:14:03,098 --> 00:14:05,132
and then I promise,
you have heard

388
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:06,600
the last of Gretchen Mercer.

389
00:14:06,635 --> 00:14:08,668
Well, I should
probably say no,

390
00:14:08,704 --> 00:14:10,871
but I've never been
known for my good judgment.

391
00:14:10,906 --> 00:14:12,472
I mean, that's how
I got into trouble

392
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:13,674
with the Peter Catcher.

393
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:16,877
(bells ring)

394
00:14:16,912 --> 00:14:18,879
(singsongy):
Oh, Peter!

395
00:14:18,914 --> 00:14:20,947
Come and get your lollipops!

396
00:14:20,983 --> 00:14:22,048
Lollipops!

397
00:14:22,084 --> 00:14:24,117
Come along, Peter!

398
00:14:24,153 --> 00:14:25,719
(whispering):
Peter, you mustn't.

399
00:14:25,754 --> 00:14:28,088
I've got cream pies.

400
00:14:28,123 --> 00:14:29,723
Trinkle tarts.

401
00:14:29,758 --> 00:14:30,957
Trinkle tarts!

402
00:14:30,993 --> 00:14:34,161
(laughing)

403
00:14:34,196 --> 00:14:36,897
(laughs evilly)

404
00:14:36,932 --> 00:14:39,533
I'm gonna get so molested.

405
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:49,042
Oh, Peter, you can take
off your hat and jacket.

406
00:14:49,077 --> 00:14:52,012
It's not illegal for two old
friends to go to a concert.

407
00:14:52,047 --> 00:14:53,213
Yeah, I guess you're right.

408
00:14:53,248 --> 00:14:54,981
I mean it's not like
anybody I know would be

409
00:14:55,017 --> 00:14:57,083
at a Ray LaMontagne concert.

410
00:14:57,119 --> 00:14:58,385
MAN:
Peter!

411
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,420
Where'd he go?

412
00:14:59,454 --> 00:15:00,821
I'm-I'm gonna
keep the hat on.

413
00:15:00,856 --> 00:15:01,856
I'm sorry, Gretchen.

414
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:02,989
This-this was a mistake.

415
00:15:03,025 --> 00:15:04,391
I just feel too guilty

416
00:15:04,426 --> 00:15:05,759
being out with another woman.

417
00:15:05,794 --> 00:15:07,260
I can't do this to Lois.

418
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:09,262
Ah, I understand.

419
00:15:09,298 --> 00:15:10,263
(chuckles)

420
00:15:10,299 --> 00:15:11,865
Well, I guess there's no shame

421
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,233
in coming in second, huh?

422
00:15:13,268 --> 00:15:14,234
That's right.

423
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:16,369
Except in, like, wars.

424
00:15:16,405 --> 00:15:19,539
Aw, you are still
funny, sweet Peter.

425
00:15:19,575 --> 00:15:20,674
Yeah, I guess so.

426
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:21,908
All right, I got to go.

427
00:15:21,944 --> 00:15:23,777
The beard inspector's
coming, anyway.

428
00:15:23,812 --> 00:15:25,512
Uh, sir, where's
your beard?

429
00:15:25,547 --> 00:15:26,747
I'm leaving.
I'm on my way out.

430
00:15:27,783 --> 00:15:29,983
That's my Peter.

431
00:15:30,018 --> 00:15:32,152
That's<i> my</i> Peter.

432
00:15:36,725 --> 00:15:38,725
(dance music plays)

433
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,796
Wow, looks like
you're actually gonna

434
00:15:42,831 --> 00:15:43,930
get away with this, Stewie.

435
00:15:43,966 --> 00:15:45,899
(laughing):
And you threw a good party.

436
00:15:45,934 --> 00:15:47,467
Yeah, it's getting
pretty wild.

437
00:15:47,502 --> 00:15:48,535
Over in the guest bedroom

438
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,303
there's a girl
pulling a train.

439
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:52,472
This'll show my dad.

440
00:15:52,507 --> 00:15:54,341
Hey, by the way,
how'd you pay for all this?

441
00:15:54,376 --> 00:15:56,643
I dated Donald Sterling
for two weeks.

442
00:15:56,678 --> 00:15:58,211
He's a good man!

443
00:15:58,247 --> 00:16:00,780
You don't know him
like I know him!

444
00:16:00,816 --> 00:16:02,148
(children chattering)

445
00:16:02,184 --> 00:16:03,550
People.
People?

446
00:16:03,585 --> 00:16:06,786
As your rich host, I would
like to say a word if I may.

447
00:16:06,822 --> 00:16:10,223
I cannot tell you how pleased
I am to have finally found

448
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:11,491
a group of peers with whom

449
00:16:11,526 --> 00:16:13,393
I share so many common
interests...

450
00:16:13,428 --> 00:16:15,528
and here come the people
who live here.

451
00:16:17,966 --> 00:16:19,332
Please let me explain!

452
00:16:19,368 --> 00:16:21,001
I was just worried
you wouldn't accept me

453
00:16:21,036 --> 00:16:22,235
because...

454
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,170
I'm not wealthy
like you are.

455
00:16:24,206 --> 00:16:26,072
Stewie, it's not
that you're poor.

456
00:16:26,108 --> 00:16:28,875
It's that you lied
to us and you're poor.

457
00:16:28,911 --> 00:16:30,911
♪ ♪

458
00:16:34,249 --> 00:16:37,017
I'm sorry you lost your
rich friends, Stewie.

459
00:16:37,052 --> 00:16:39,252
Well, that's all right,
I don't need money.

460
00:16:39,288 --> 00:16:41,388
I already have
everything I need.

461
00:16:41,423 --> 00:16:44,090
Excuse me, is one
of you Chadley?

462
00:16:44,126 --> 00:16:45,992
You left your
wallet inside.

463
00:16:46,028 --> 00:16:47,994
Chicka-chickaw!

464
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,729
Well, that "chicka-chickaw"

465
00:16:49,765 --> 00:16:51,865
makes me think
you're not Chadley.

466
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,866
Oh, no!

467
00:16:52,901 --> 00:16:54,601
I chicka-chickawed
too early!

468
00:16:59,741 --> 00:17:01,875
Hey, Lois, you mind if
I cut out of here?

469
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,176
Not at all.
Thanks.

470
00:17:03,211 --> 00:17:04,411
Not to be too intimate,

471
00:17:04,446 --> 00:17:06,046
but I need to have
a bowel movement

472
00:17:06,081 --> 00:17:07,414
and I can't go here.

473
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:10,951
I can only go at home
or at the Koo Koo Roo.

474
00:17:10,986 --> 00:17:13,853
(door creaks)

475
00:17:13,889 --> 00:17:15,055
Hello?

476
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,723
I-Is someone there?

477
00:17:16,758 --> 00:17:20,560
I thought I heard something
over the roar of my tinnitus.

478
00:17:20,595 --> 00:17:22,896
Oh, I'm-I'm sure it's nothing.

479
00:17:30,172 --> 00:17:31,972
(phone chimes)
Ooh, a text.

480
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:34,441
"I'm taking care of our problem.

481
00:17:34,476 --> 00:17:35,842
"We'll be together soon.

482
00:17:35,877 --> 00:17:37,210
Love, Gretchen."

483
00:17:37,245 --> 00:17:38,445
Huh.

484
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,280
Meg, you're kind of
a loner psychopath.

485
00:17:40,315 --> 00:17:42,148
What does this mean?

486
00:17:42,184 --> 00:17:44,584
Oh, this woman is
clearly a spurned lover

487
00:17:44,619 --> 00:17:45,852
who's planning to kill Mom.

488
00:17:45,887 --> 00:17:47,821
Ah, thank you.

489
00:17:47,856 --> 00:17:48,856
(whines nervously)

490
00:17:49,992 --> 00:17:51,291
You're a good dog, Meg.

491
00:17:51,326 --> 00:17:52,826
(whines nervously)

492
00:17:55,864 --> 00:17:58,565
Well, well, well...

493
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,568
if it isn't the first
Mrs. Griffin.

494
00:18:01,603 --> 00:18:02,702
Gretchen?

495
00:18:02,738 --> 00:18:04,137
What are you doing here?

496
00:18:04,172 --> 00:18:06,206
Making sure Peter can
finally be with me,

497
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:08,675
which is what
he's always wanted.

498
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,844
Gretchen, it's 3:15
on a workday.

499
00:18:10,879 --> 00:18:12,278
The post office is closed.

500
00:18:12,314 --> 00:18:13,279
Lois!

501
00:18:13,315 --> 00:18:14,481
Gretchen wants to kill you,

502
00:18:14,516 --> 00:18:16,750
and I have a slip that
says we've got a package?

503
00:18:16,785 --> 00:18:18,952
Peter, I'm glad
you're here to see this.

504
00:18:18,987 --> 00:18:21,421
You and I can
finally be together.

505
00:18:23,191 --> 00:18:25,158
Peter, what's going on?!

506
00:18:25,193 --> 00:18:26,826
She's nuts is
what's going on!

507
00:18:26,862 --> 00:18:28,261
I don't want
to be with her!

508
00:18:28,296 --> 00:18:29,262
Oh, yeah?

509
00:18:29,297 --> 00:18:30,630
That's not
what you wrote.

510
00:18:30,665 --> 00:18:31,798
That's right.

511
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,967
I lied about what
was in that letter.

512
00:18:34,002 --> 00:18:35,835
Lois, Lois,
before you read that,

513
00:18:35,871 --> 00:18:37,137
you need to know one thing:

514
00:18:37,172 --> 00:18:40,073
I'm the one throwing out
all your beige bras.

515
00:18:40,108 --> 00:18:42,375
Guys don't
like beige bras.

516
00:18:43,545 --> 00:18:44,644
You told an ex-girlfriend

517
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:46,613
a week before our wedding

518
00:18:46,648 --> 00:18:48,014
you were having doubts?!

519
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,215
Lois, Lois, listen to me.

520
00:18:49,251 --> 00:18:52,085
Yes, it is true,
just before we got married,

521
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,686
I was having some doubts.

522
00:18:53,722 --> 00:18:55,955
I mean, your family hated me.

523
00:18:55,991 --> 00:18:58,091
I-I didn't think I was good
enough for you.

524
00:18:58,126 --> 00:19:00,160
We were kids, I was scared.

525
00:19:00,195 --> 00:19:01,361
Weren't you?

526
00:19:01,396 --> 00:19:02,896
No, I was in love,

527
00:19:02,931 --> 00:19:05,198
which is what I thought
you were, too.

528
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:07,233
I was in love, Lois....

529
00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:08,468
and I still am.

530
00:19:08,503 --> 00:19:09,969
Not a day goes by where I don't

531
00:19:10,005 --> 00:19:11,871
thank my lucky stars
for picking you.

532
00:19:11,907 --> 00:19:13,773
It was the best choice
I ever made.

533
00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:15,675
Now, put that gun down,
Gretchen.

534
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,043
You don't have to do this.

535
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:18,878
That's right, you don't...

536
00:19:18,914 --> 00:19:20,380
because you can have him.

537
00:19:20,415 --> 00:19:21,481
What?!

538
00:19:21,516 --> 00:19:23,116
I'll never forgive you
for this, Peter.

539
00:19:23,151 --> 00:19:24,151
We're through!

540
00:19:25,253 --> 00:19:26,253
Oh, Peter!

541
00:19:26,288 --> 00:19:27,420
I can't wait
for you to meet

542
00:19:27,456 --> 00:19:29,656
the dogs and
the squirrels.

543
00:19:29,691 --> 00:19:31,191
LOIS:
Hey, Gretchen?

544
00:19:31,226 --> 00:19:32,592
(grunting)

545
00:19:33,795 --> 00:19:35,562
Get away from my husband.

546
00:19:35,597 --> 00:19:36,597
(grunts)

547
00:19:39,668 --> 00:19:41,568
Wait, so you're not mad?

548
00:19:41,603 --> 00:19:44,604
No, Peter, I was lying so
she'd let her guard down.

549
00:19:44,639 --> 00:19:46,339
But what about the letter?

550
00:19:46,374 --> 00:19:49,109
Peter, do you remember me
crying at our wedding?

551
00:19:49,144 --> 00:19:50,477
Sure, it's in
all our pictures.

552
00:19:50,512 --> 00:19:51,945
That's doubt.

553
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,847
But there's no doubt anymore.

554
00:19:53,882 --> 00:19:56,549
You're the only man for me,
Peter Griffin.

555
00:19:56,585 --> 00:19:59,450
(sighing):
I love you, Lois.

556
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:02,869
Oh, Peter.

557
00:20:02,893 --> 00:20:06,235
Now come on, let's get it
on thru a P.O. box.

558
00:20:06,753 --> 00:20:08,214
Peter, this isn't working.

559
00:20:08,238 --> 00:20:09,284
Well I'm at full go.

560
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:10,694
Are you sure
you're in the right box.

561
00:20:10,718 --> 00:20:11,300
Yes.

562
00:20:11,324 --> 00:20:12,236
Box 528.

563
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,891
Yes, 528.

564
00:20:13,915 --> 00:20:15,395
Alright, just reach in
and grab it.

565
00:20:19,914 --> 00:20:23,466
Wow Mom, I can't believe you
got fired from the Post Office.

566
00:20:23,658 --> 00:20:25,755
Well, they didn't like me
beating up Gretchen

567
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,113
on federal property,

568
00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:29,516
and then after your father
plugged up that P.O. box,

569
00:20:29,551 --> 00:20:31,651
there was a mutual
parting of the ways.

570
00:20:31,686 --> 00:20:33,386
Well, Stewie, I guess
since Lois lost her job,

571
00:20:33,421 --> 00:20:34,587
you're not going
to be able to go

572
00:20:34,623 --> 00:20:36,222
to that fancy
preschool anymore.

573
00:20:36,258 --> 00:20:37,223
Eh, I don't need school.

574
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:38,224
I'll be fine.

575
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,559
I'll just become
a YouTube star

576
00:20:39,594 --> 00:20:40,594
like Jenna Marbles.

577
00:20:40,629 --> 00:20:41,629
Who's that?

578
00:20:41,663 --> 00:20:42,762
No one knows,
but she's rich,

579
00:20:42,797 --> 00:20:45,098
as rich as
Ray William Johnson.

580
00:20:45,133 --> 00:20:47,233
Who's that?
Nobody knows, but he's rich,

581
00:20:47,269 --> 00:20:49,002
as rich as Bethany Mota

582
00:20:49,037 --> 00:20:50,103
or Marcus Butler

583
00:20:50,138 --> 00:20:52,205
or Ingrid Nilsen.

584
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,773
This?
This is over.
