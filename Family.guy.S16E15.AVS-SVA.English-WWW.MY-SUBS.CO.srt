Stewie! Oh, my God, thank you.

484
00:19:58,621 --> 00:19:59,920
I'm so sorry, Stewie.

485
00:19:59,956 --> 00:20:02,022
I guess I just lost my head.

486
00:20:02,058 --> 00:20:03,691
Well, lesson learned, Brian.

487
00:20:03,726 --> 00:20:05,459
Money doesn't buy happiness.

488
00:20:05,494 --> 00:20:06,927

Wow, Stewie. I am so sorry
I became such a jerk.

496
00:20:32,507 --> 00:20:34,774
But I guess I learned my lesson
about the evils of Wall Street.

497
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,109
What are you talking about?

498
00:20:36,144 --> 00:20:37,610
This isn't about Wall Street,
this is about you.

499
00:20:37,646 --> 00:20:38,845
Me?

500
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,280
I've been investing
in the market forever,

501
00:20:40,315 --> 00:20:41,448
and doing just fine.

502
00:20:41,483 --> 00:20:42,682
You did it for one week,

503
00:20:42,718 --> 00:20:44,951
and were literally eating your own kind.

504
00:20:44,986 --> 00:20:46,286
This isn't about Wall Street.

505
00:20:46,321 --> 00:20:47,787
I cannot stress that enough.

506
00:20:47,823 --> 00:20:49,789
Well, money is the root of all evil.

507
00:20:49,825 --> 00:20:51,291
No, it's not. It's just you.

508
00:20:51,326 --> 00:20:53,360
Hello, others, I am the father.

509
00:20:53,395 --> 00:20:54,527
Where is the mother,

510
00:20:54,563 --> 00:20:57,630
and what kind of sex
does she like to have?
