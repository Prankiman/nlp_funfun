00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,900
It seems today that all you see

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,200
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,900
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,900
On which we used to rely?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,200
Lucky there's a family guy

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,200
Lucky there's a man who positively
can do all the things that make us

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,900
Laugh and cry

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,200
He's a family guy

9
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,900
Billiam, are you there?

10
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,600
Stewie!

11
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,100
- Wh-what the devil are you doing here?
- Billiam sent me.

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,000
He wanted me to tell you I killed him.

13
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,900
Now give me the other half of the amulet.
I don't think you'll be making it to Marrakech.

14
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,000
Don't! Please!

15
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,000
No!

16
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,400
Jeffrey, take the 9pm to Hounslow
out of your mouth.

17
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,700
Oh, look at that.
Our little boys are becomin' fast friends.

18
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,500
I say, Jeffrey, be a sport, will you, and go get
the sifter so we can build our sand village.

19
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,300
That's right. A little further.

20
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:15,500
Everyone, meet Jeffrey, the newest member
of the club of forgotten children.

21
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,700
Steve walks warily down the street
with his brim pulled way down low

22
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,500
- What the hell are you doing?
- Takin' down the Christmas decorations.

23
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,500
Peter, I'm concerned about Stewie. He
doesn't seem to play well with other children.

24
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,700
Oh, he's fine. You know, I was quite
a troublemaker myself when I was a kid.

25
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,100
Your parents'll be home any minute.
Are you sure you don't want me to clean up?

26
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,900
No, no, no. Go. Go. It'll be funny.

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Stewie needs to learn
to socialise with other children.

28
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,400
- Maybe we should put him in daycare.
- Lois, his answers are out on the open road.

29
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,900
I say we give him a hobo pack on a stick,
a can of beans and a pocketful of dreams.

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,100
Peter, do you even know which one
of our children I'm talking about?

31
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,700
Gordon?

32
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,200
I got 'em! Ha-ha-ha! It's just like hunting.

33
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,700
Chris, stop it.
What will the neighbours think?

34
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,800
Abner! Abner! The Griffin boy
just killed a plastic reindeer!

35
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,300
Gladys, it took me two hours to work up
the courage to rent this porno.

36
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,800
Now, are you gonna watch it with me or not?

37
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:45,300
OK, Mommy's leaving you here for a while.
Try to play nice with the other children.

38
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,400
What do you mean, you're leaving me here?
What is this place?

39
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,300
- Come on, let go.
- Why, you soulless witch!

40
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,100
This is a biogenetic
experimentation facility, isn't it? Admit it!

41
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,300
Oh, sweetheart, don't be upset.
You're gonna have fun here.

42
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,700
Look, if this is about the whole
me-killing-you thing, it was a bit!

43
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,300
I was doing shtick, I tell you!

44
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,900
Humina-humina-humina!

45
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,200
Oh! I'm so bored. Without Stewie around,
I have nothin' to do.

46
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,500
- Well... we could get hammered.
- Oh, it's too early for me, but you go ahead.

47
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,800
What happened to me?

48
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,300
You know, before I was married,
I led a very exciting life.

49
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,300
Oh, my God! The actress who was
the girl in Escape from Witch Mountain! 

50
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,800
Maybe a part-time job
would liven up your days.

51
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,500
Brian! That's a terrific idea!

52
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,900
A job? Lois, the '70s are over. Forget it.

53
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,300
Mom, you can't get a job.
The last time you left Dad home alone,

54
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,600
he turned the house into a giant puppet.

55
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,100
Hey. Hey! Stay outta here. Hey!

56
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,700
Nobody better come in here. 
I'm the Griffins' house. 

57
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,300
Bring me a tool shed, for I am hungry. 

58
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,000
Uh... If you get a job,

59
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,100
who's gonna feed me and protect me
from the evil monkey in my closet?

60
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,500
Now, Chris, you know there's no such thing.

61
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,900
No!

62
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,900
- Oh, now you've gone and upset the boy.
- Peter, this is a new chapter in my life.

63
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,700
The kids are growin', the nest is empty,
and I need some excitement.

64
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,300
What are you talkin' about?
Your life is plenty exciting. For example...

65
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,600
There you go! Good night.

66
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,400
Duck.

67
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,500
Duck. Duck.

68
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,100
I say, does anyone know how
The Practice ended last night? I dozed off.

69
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,100
Goose!

70
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,900
Oh, dear. It seems you're still it.

71
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,500
Stewie, what have you done?
That's not the way we play.

72
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,700
You sit here, Brad. Stewie's it.

73
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,900
Ooh! Aren't you the one in charge!

74
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,900
Oh, let's see, now. Duck. Duck.

75
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,200
Duck.

76
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,600
Goose!

77
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,200
Oh, come on, now. I barely touched you.

78
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,600
Really. Stop it. Stop your boohooing.
Stop it, I say. Stop it!

79
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,500
You see? You see? This is exactly
why people don't respect the WNBA.

80
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,900
Hey, guys, guys, get this.
So Lois wants a part-time job, right?

81
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,100
So I'm, like, I got a job
for you, baby... right here!

82
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,600
The zipper's been broken for over a month.
I gotta use a damn safety pin.

83
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,200
If Lois is lookin' for a thrill,
I could get her a job with the airline.

84
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,800
Stewardesses get to travel to exotic places,
and their husbands fly anywhere for free.

85
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,600
Fly for free?

86
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,400
Sorry, Tink. Looks like
I don't need you any more.

87
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,600
So, what? You're just gonna dump me?
Just like that?

88
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,800
You knew what this was.

89
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,600
A flight attendant? Wow, that does sound
exciting. What made you change your mind?

90
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,300
- Just my desire to see you happy.
- Oh!

91
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,700
And to exploit your hard labour for free
travel.

92
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,800
- What?
- Shh!

93
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,600
I didn't say anything.
Go to sleep, crazy lady.

94
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:26,500
Oh, Rupert, I can't sleep. I don't suppose
you have any Valium on you?

95
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,700
No, of course not. You're living the clean life
now. It's that pathetic little insect in daycare.

96
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,700
Janet.

97
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,800
Whining, insignificant wisp of fluff, she is.

98
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,900
Still, I find it odd that she's even on my mind
at all. What the deuce has come over me?

99
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,900
Well, well, well.

100
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,500
- Looks like someone's in love.
- Ha! That's so funny I forgot to laugh.

101
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,900
- Excluding that first "Ha".
- You're a sucker for a woman with blue eyes.

102
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,700
- Aha! Her eyes are green!
- Thank you for proving my point.

103
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,900
Damn!

104
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,600
Look at her, Leonard, sitting there
with her curly ebony locks

105
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,200
and those pouty come-hither lips.
My God, she's unappealing.

106
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,800
- Go!
- Who said that? Mm?

107
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,800
Who's got the big diapers? Huh?

108
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,300
She's gone. Good. Well, I'm off.

109
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,700
Hi, Stewie.

110
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,100
H... Um... Er... Y-y...

111
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,500
Leonard, you pudgy-faced apple-john,
I will not be made a fool of!

112
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,700
Here's your pillow, sir.
And your Sports Illustrated. 

113
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,500
- He's putting his arm on my armrest.
- It's my armrest.

114
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,100
Is not, stupid head! And he keeps
tryin' to take my apple juice.

115
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,800
- I'll bring you your own juice.
- Agh!

116
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,600
Hey, he keeps licking his finger
and touching me!

117
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,400
Hey, fellas, I hope you're hungry. Aagh!

118
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,200
Oh, my God! Oh, no, my Go...

119
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,100
Somebody help. Help. Help!

120
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,300
That was great.
Look at her, she's still shakin'.

121
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,700
Bastards.

122
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,800
That was beautiful.
Hey, throw me a beer, would ya?

123
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,200
Stewardess, the plane just made
my beer spill. I want a free one.

124
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,300
Sir, all your beers have been free.
All nine of them.

125
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,500
And don't you forget it, Frenchie.

126
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,600
Now bring me another one -
the movie's startin'.

127
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,300
Oh, come on.

128
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,100
Show me Morgan Fairchild in
deep something. Huh? Huh? Huh?

129
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,900
Ah, you don't care.
Hey, Frenchie, is my fort ready?

130
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,300
Yes, Mr Griffin, even though
no one else has any pillows now.

131
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,300
All right!

132
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,500
I tell you, Leonard,
women are wicked creatures.

133
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,300
They precipitated the downfall
of history's most powerful men!

134
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,300
So let it be known I want absolutely nothing
to do with the wretched enterprise of love!

135
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,400
Janet's coming.

136
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,100
Agh!

137
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,900
Argh!

138
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,200
Aa... Er, yes. Yes.

139
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,400
Hi. Cookie?

140
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,100
No, no, actually, it's Stewie, but, well,
you can call me Cookie if you like.

141
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:26,000
Yes. I... Yes, I've also been known to answer
to Artemis, Agent Buchwald and Snake.

142
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,600
Yes. Yes, I rather like "Snake".

143
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,700
Snake Griffin.

144
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,200
Cookie!

145
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,900
Oh! Oh, you want my cookie?
Oh, yes, by all means. Here you are.

146
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,700
Oops, a little bit broke off there.

147
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,400
Well, that's the way the cookie crumbles!

148
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,100
Yes. Yes. Yes, you'II... you'll get that one
halfway back to your mat. Ha! Ha... Oh, God.

149
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,700
Oh, Cupid, hast thou pierced me
with thine sweet, searing arrow?

150
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,000
Stomach, cease thy lustful quake.

151
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,500
Argh! Unhand me, woman.
I don't have gas, I'm in love!

152
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,100
Well, then, I guess it's both.

153
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,500
Peter! I'm home!

154
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,200
How was your day?

155
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,000
Uh, my day?

156
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,000
Hey. Hey.

157
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,200
You OK there, Mr Crocodile? Huh?

158
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,800
Wake up, wake up, wake up.
You need some lotion, Mr Bad Skin?

159
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,000
Huh? Huh? Huh? There you go.

160
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,600
Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh!
Oh, God! Oh, God! Agh! Agh! Agh!

161
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,700
Oh, uh, my-my-my day was OK.

162
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,700
You know, the usual. How about yours,
my little sky princess? Bet it was excitin'.

163
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,100
Oh, yeah, if you like runnin' through
a gauntlet of drunk, horny businessmen.

164
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,600
My ass feels like a pincushion.
I'm thinkin' of quittin'.

165
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,500
What? Lois, you can't quit.
What if Kurt Cobain had quit?

166
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,200
Thank you. And remember, say no to drugs.

167
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,100
Kurt, the label's excited
about your seventh album.

168
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,700
Thanks. You remember
my wife Courtney Love?

169
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,100
Who?

170
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:17,600
Well, I guess I'll give it a little
more time. It's like I always tell the kids -

171
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,700
- A quitter never wins, and don't trust whitey.
- That's the spirit.

172
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,300
All right, here I go.

173
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,700
- Stewie!
- Hello, Janet. How about a push?

174
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,900
Argh!

175
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,100
Yes. Yes, I suppose that was
rather funny, wasn't it?

176
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,100
You know, it's odd, Janet, but when
I'm with you, I... Oh, how do I describe it?

177
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,500
Excuse me?

178
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,200
- I said "May I have a blanket?"
- Oh, yes. Of course.

179
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:14,300
Ha! I said "Will you be my wife?" You said
yes, so it is official. Let me touch your face.

180
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,700
Lois, we could use your help in coach.

181
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,900
OK. Everyone? It's time
for my one-man show -

182
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
"Winston Churchill, We Hardly Knew Ye".

183
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,900
OK, Act One.

184
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,800
I'm Winston Churchill.
Ooh, would you like some tea?

185
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,300
I would, because I'm Winston Churchill.

186
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,700
Would you like a crumpet?
I would, because I'm Winston Churchill.

187
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,800
Would you like to wear knickers?
I would, because I'm W...

188
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,500
- My wife is very ill!
- Yes, do you mind?

189
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,900
I paid $380 for this flight.

190
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,900
$380? Jeez, I hope they kissed you first.

191
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,400
This is my fourth trip today.
Just this mornin' I went to Kentucky.

192
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,900
Wait a second. You're tellin' me I flew all the
way to Kentucky to get some fried chicken,

193
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,200
and the Colonel isn't even workin' today?

194
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,400
He ain't real. He dead.

195
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,400
- What?
- I say he dead.

196
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
Is Mr Sanders in?

197
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,300
What wrong with you? I say you he dead.

198
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,300
The Colonel!

199
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,900
My wife is a stewardess, so I can
fly anywhere and I don't pay jack!

200
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
- Peter!
- Lois!

201
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,700
You convinced me to keep a job I hate
just so you could fly free?!

202
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,400
If I talked real loud like that,
I could make you look like the bad guy.

203
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,900
My feet are killing me,
I've got vomit in my pocket

204
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,700
and I've seen that crappy
Julia Roberts movie 47 times!

205
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,600
Have you seen the lips on that woman?
It's like a baboon's ass on her face!

206
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:41,400
Peter, I took this job for the excitement,
and you're the one who's havin' it all!

207
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:46,300
Oh, it's excitement you want, huh? Well,
how'd you like to join the Mile High Club?

208
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:51,700
Come on. You be the stewardess, and I'll be
the mysterious stranger who's drillin' you.

209
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,200
- Ugh! Move. I have a lot of work to do.
- I can't, I'm stuck.

210
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,800
- The passengers need me.
- They're watchin' the movie. They're fine.

211
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,100
OK, everyone, this is a hijacking.

212
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,200
Peter, could you move your arm, please?

213
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,400
- Uh. Yeah. Lois. Lois.
- Please. Move it over. Try to the...

214
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,600
- God, it's like movin' a futon.
- Lois!

215
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:13,300
- Just slide your leg over... Peter, please!
- Oh. Oh, no, no. Oh! Oh!

216
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,400
Well, Lois, at least one of us
is in the Mile High Club.

217
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,500
Well, the hijacking of Flight 52 is over.
The plane has safely landed in Cuba,

218
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,600
and all Americans aboard are on
their way home, except one couple -

219
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,100
a fat man who is inexplicably
married to an attractive redhead.

220
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,800
Here's an artist's rendering
of what they might look like.

221
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,100
I called Brian. He's gonna watch the kids till
we get back. When will our passports arrive?

222
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,000
- Check back in two weeks.
- Two weeks?! But I have a baby at home!

223
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:55,000
We would have sent you with the others, but
we didn't know you were stuck in the toilet.

224
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,900
- We weren't doin' what you're thinking.
- I was.

225
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,100
- We apologise for the hijacking.
- Ah, that's OK.

226
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,000
You people aren't like
the communists they show on TV.

227
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,000
We now return to "The Communists".

228
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,800
I hear report cards vere handed out today.
Vot were your grades?

229
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,300
Uh... uh... uh...

230
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,400
Qvit Stalin and answer your father.

231
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,900
Go ahead, honey, and tell us your... Marx.

232
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,800
- Do I Khrushchev?
- Did somebody say Khrushchev?

233
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,000
I say, Janet, do you like this couch?

234
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,000
Oh, you truly are beautiful, you know that?

235
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,600
- Oh, Janet, our future is so bright.
- Cookie?

236
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,700
Oh, yes, there'll be lots of cookies.
There'll be dancing, Christmas mornings,

237
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,400
and arguments over the proper
way to discipline the children, and...

238
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,100
What are you doing? What the hell is this?

239
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,800
Is there something you need to tell me? If I'm
the only one in this thing, I deserve to know.

240
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,500
I see. Your silence says it all.

241
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,500
This is great. How the hell
are we supposed to get home?

242
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,300
We gotta get some fake passports
on the black market.

243
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,800
Where are you going?
You're never gonna find the black market.

244
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,100
That's what you said about
that back-alley abortionist.

245
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,400
I'm glad you changed your mind.
But the point is, I found the guy.

246
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,900
OK, there she is. That is...

247
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,800
That is absolutely classic!
Melinda, you're an utter delight.

248
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,100
Oh, hello, Janet. Yes. Yes, you know Melinda.

249
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,500
Yes, it seems she's, um... Oh, what did we
figure out, dear? Was it one? No, two. Yes.

250
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,800
She's two weeks younger than you.
Just look at that butt. That is a tight butt.

251
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,700
Damn! Not even a second glance.

252
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:16,500
This is what you call dolled up? Why don't
you save yourself years of sexual ambiguity

253
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,800
and get fitted for a pair of Doc Martens
and a plaid flannel shirt?

254
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,100
There it is. The black market.

255
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,800
Lois, if we don't make it outta here alive,

256
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:33,000
I should tell ya I promised my first girlfriend
we'd meet up in heaven.

257
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,300
I was lyin', but just so you know
it's somethin' we might have to deal with.

258
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,300
OK. Two American passports.
Would you like to join the black market club?

259
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,200
- Ten per cent off your first purchase.
- No, thank you. We're not from the area.

260
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,200
Peter, just pay the man.

261
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:06,300
- Do you accept bits of string?
- Sorry. Store policy.

262
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,500
But, you know, there is
another way for you to travel.

263
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,500
It's over, Leonard. I suppose
I should be grateful to that saucy harlot.

264
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,800
She taught me a valuable lesson.
There's really no such thing as love.

265
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:27,500
It's just a word used by Madison Avenue
to sell their skin creams and two-seater cars.

266
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,200
Argh! It's no use! She swims
in my blood now. I must have her!

267
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,200
Darling, why are we tormenting ourselves?
We're perfect for each other.

268
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:42,300
I admit we've got our problems,
like any couple, but true love conquers all!

269
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,100
- I like you.
- You... like me?

270
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,800
Oh! Oh, well, it's not love, but it's a start.

271
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,100
Oh, Janet, you've made me
the happiest man in the whole world.

272
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,400
- Cookie?
- Of course you can have a cookie! Stay there.

273
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,100
Cookie.

274
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,900
Cookie?

275
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,800
Cookie?

276
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,600
Cookie?

277
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:12,700
You don't care about me. It's my cookies!
It's always been the damn cookies!

278
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,600
Well, sugar, the bakery just closed.

279
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:20,400
You'll have to get your fill somewhere else,
you oatmeal-raisin-Ioving tart!

280
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,700
Don't let her see you cry, old man.
Don't let her see you cry.

281
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,300
Well, we're finally goin' home.

282
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm sorry I tricked you into that job, honey.
You deserve to have a more excitin' life.

283
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,200
Oh, Peter, bein' married to you
gives me all the excitement I can handle.

284
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,600
I mean, look at us-on a boat
in the middle of the Atlantic,

285
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,600
under the moonlight,
surrounded by refugees.

286
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,500
Yeah. Uh, about that. Uh...

287
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,500
Miguel over there has had his eye on you,
and his wife Rosa is very open.

288
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,700
- What?
- No, nothin'. This is nice.

289
