1
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:54,713
Step right up!
Step right up!

2
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,214
You won't believe your eyes!

3
00:00:56,282 --> 00:00:59,551
Step right up and see the
amazing half man, half clam!

4
00:00:59,618 --> 00:01:00,919
What a rip-off.

5
00:01:00,986 --> 00:01:03,188
It's just kim cattrall
sitting indian-style.

6
00:01:05,925 --> 00:01:07,692
Boy, they've got some
very unusual prizes

7
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,060
At the carnival this year.

8
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:11,329
A winner!

9
00:01:11,397 --> 00:01:12,797
Congratulations, son.

10
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:15,066
You've won a genuine
live homosexual!

11
00:01:15,134 --> 00:01:16,501
Ooh, where
are we going?!

12
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:17,769
Wait, don't tell me.

13
00:01:17,837 --> 00:01:19,871
Oh, boy!
Mom, can I keep him?

14
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:21,773
Well, it's a big
responsibility, chris.

15
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:24,509
That means you'll have
to clean up after
him and feed him.

16
00:01:24,577 --> 00:01:25,710
What do you eat?

17
00:01:25,778 --> 00:01:26,678
Attention.

18
00:01:26,746 --> 00:01:27,812
I like your hair.

19
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,114
Still hungry.

20
00:01:29,181 --> 00:01:31,516
You have a beautiful
speaking voice.

21
00:01:31,584 --> 00:01:33,017
I'm full.

22
00:01:33,085 --> 00:01:34,018
Let's see.

23
00:01:34,086 --> 00:01:37,255
I guess 185 pounds.

24
00:01:37,323 --> 00:01:39,190
Wrong.

25
00:01:39,258 --> 00:01:40,725
I'm 95% helium.

26
00:01:42,962 --> 00:01:44,896
Brian, look what I won!

27
00:01:44,964 --> 00:01:46,631
Wow, what'd
you win that for?

28
00:01:46,699 --> 00:01:48,533
For having the best pig
in the competition.

29
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:50,568
Wait, you bred a pig?
Sure did.

30
00:01:50,636 --> 00:01:52,303
Most genetically-perfect
one in the contest.

31
00:01:52,371 --> 00:01:53,271
Oink.

32
00:01:53,339 --> 00:01:54,506
Oh, my god!

33
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:55,840
Yes, he's something,
isn't he?

34
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:56,941
Are those fists?

35
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:59,177
Damn right.
Show him, pig.

36
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:00,979
How the hell did you do this?

37
00:02:01,046 --> 00:02:02,881
I'll let you in on
a little secret, brian.

38
00:02:02,948 --> 00:02:05,250
I didn't do it.
I got it from a farm.

39
00:02:05,317 --> 00:02:07,685
What the hell kind of farm
breeds pigs like this?

40
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:09,554
Would you like to see it
for yourself, brian?

41
00:02:09,622 --> 00:02:10,922
Yeah, I would.

42
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,423
Good, 'cause it's gonna
blow your mind

43
00:02:12,491 --> 00:02:15,360
Like the stereopticon did
to americans in 1910.

44
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,195
Hey, I'm in new york city!

45
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:18,329
No, I'm not!
Yes, I am!

46
00:02:18,397 --> 00:02:19,764
No, I'm not! Yes, I am!

47
00:02:19,832 --> 00:02:21,566
What's going on here?!

48
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:28,640
(beeping)

49
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,944
This is it, brian.

50
00:02:33,012 --> 00:02:33,912
What's that?

51
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:35,446
It's how I got the pig.

52
00:02:35,514 --> 00:02:37,148
You ever heard
of the multiverse
theory, brian?

53
00:02:37,216 --> 00:02:38,316
Well, of course I have,

54
00:02:38,384 --> 00:02:39,617
But I'm wondering
if you have.

55
00:02:39,685 --> 00:02:41,619
Oh, my god.
So transparent.

56
00:02:41,687 --> 00:02:42,854
Well, the theory states

57
00:02:42,922 --> 00:02:44,989
That there are
an infinite number of universes

58
00:02:45,057 --> 00:02:47,425
Coexisting with ours
on parallel dimensional planes.

59
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:48,359
Dimensional
planes, right.

60
00:02:48,427 --> 00:02:49,627
Don't, don't do that.

61
00:02:49,695 --> 00:02:51,329
Don't, don't repeat
the last two words

62
00:02:51,397 --> 00:02:53,498
Like you already kinda knew
what I was talkin' about.

63
00:02:53,566 --> 00:02:55,133
You have no idea
what I'm talkin' about.

64
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:57,035
Now in each of these
alternate universes,

65
00:02:57,102 --> 00:02:58,970
The reality is different
than our own.

66
00:02:59,038 --> 00:03:01,539
Sometimes only slightly,
sometimes quite radically.

67
00:03:01,607 --> 00:03:04,642
The point is, every possible
eventuality exists.

68
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,411
And that's where
you got the pig,

69
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:07,812
In a parallel universe.

70
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,781
Prepare yourself, brian,
and I'll show you.

71
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:25,396
Where are we?

72
00:03:25,464 --> 00:03:27,999
This is quahog, brian.
Same year, same time.

73
00:03:28,067 --> 00:03:29,400
But in this universe,

74
00:03:29,468 --> 00:03:32,303
Christianity never existed,
which means the dark ages

75
00:03:32,371 --> 00:03:34,305
Of scientific repression
never occurred, and thus,

76
00:03:34,373 --> 00:03:36,674
Humanity is a thousand years
more advanced.

77
00:03:36,742 --> 00:03:39,744
Ergo, muscular,
genetically perfect pigs.

78
00:03:39,812 --> 00:03:40,845
Hey, look,
there's quagmire.

79
00:03:40,913 --> 00:03:42,213
Thanks, honey.
Say hi to your husband.

80
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:43,214
(device beeping)

81
00:03:43,282 --> 00:03:45,083
Oh, I got aids again.

82
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,886
Better take my
"nyquil cold, flu and aids."

83
00:03:47,953 --> 00:03:50,054
All gone.

84
00:03:50,122 --> 00:03:51,923
What time do you suppose
it is, brian?

85
00:03:51,991 --> 00:03:53,224
I don't know,
about 3:30.

86
00:03:53,292 --> 00:03:55,260
Watch the sidewalk.

87
00:03:57,596 --> 00:04:00,365
♪ drop dead legs ♪

88
00:04:00,432 --> 00:04:02,500
♪ pretty smile ♪

89
00:04:02,568 --> 00:04:06,537
♪ hurts my head, gets me wild ♪

90
00:04:06,605 --> 00:04:08,473
♪ dig that steam... ♪

91
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,242
My god,
is that... Meg?!

92
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,510
36d, brian.

93
00:04:12,578 --> 00:04:14,145
And you know
what's amazing?

94
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:15,213
In this universe,

95
00:04:15,281 --> 00:04:16,781
She's still one
of the ugly ones.

96
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:18,016
If you saw lois,

97
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,184
You'd have to put
your penis in a wheelchair.

98
00:04:20,252 --> 00:04:22,287
Come on.
I'll show you around.

99
00:04:22,354 --> 00:04:24,155
Hey, is there a
bathroom around here?

100
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:26,190
Oh, you need
to go pee or poop?

101
00:04:26,258 --> 00:04:27,492
Poop.
One poop removal.

102
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,559
(electronic twittering)

103
00:04:28,627 --> 00:04:30,461
Wow, did I just go poop?

104
00:04:30,529 --> 00:04:32,363
You sure did.
All digital.

105
00:04:32,431 --> 00:04:33,431
Where does it go?

106
00:04:33,499 --> 00:04:34,799
It gets beamed
to another dimension.

107
00:04:34,867 --> 00:04:36,701
Let me ask you this:

108
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:39,037
What about all the
renaissance art that
christianity inspired?

109
00:04:39,104 --> 00:04:41,239
That was
my first question, too.

110
00:04:41,307 --> 00:04:42,974
Come on, have a look
at the sistine chapel.

111
00:04:49,348 --> 00:04:50,715
Wow.

112
00:04:50,783 --> 00:04:52,517
Yeah, with no christianity
to inspire michelangelo,

113
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,052
They gave the job
to john hinckley.

114
00:04:57,489 --> 00:04:59,223
All right, you ready
to go home now?

115
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,558
Are you kidding?
This is amazing.

116
00:05:00,626 --> 00:05:02,393
Can we see more
universes?

117
00:05:02,461 --> 00:05:03,861
Hmm. Well, I haven't
tried yet,

118
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,230
But I don't see why not.

119
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,668
Whoa, what's this place?

120
00:05:10,736 --> 00:05:12,303
Yeah, this universe
looks weird.

121
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:14,505
Yeah, it's cheap
and somehow lazy.

122
00:05:14,573 --> 00:05:16,174
Peter:
Yabba-dabba... (giggles)

123
00:05:20,245 --> 00:05:21,279
Rockpeter?

124
00:05:21,347 --> 00:05:22,413
(audience laughter
on laugh track)

125
00:05:22,481 --> 00:05:23,815
Yes, rocklois?

126
00:05:23,882 --> 00:05:26,818
That was wonderful rock sex
we had last rock night.

127
00:05:26,885 --> 00:05:28,119
(laughter)

128
00:05:28,187 --> 00:05:30,955
Yes, I enjoyed rocking you up
the rock last night.

129
00:05:31,023 --> 00:05:32,256
(laughter)

130
00:05:32,324 --> 00:05:34,692
I know. I'm glad you wore
that rock ring.

131
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,827
(laughter)

132
00:05:35,894 --> 00:05:37,662
But we still always use
a rockphylactic.

133
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,798
I'm ribbited for your pleasure.

134
00:05:46,238 --> 00:05:48,473
Hey, brian, want to get
the rock out of here?

135
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,974
Rock yeah.

136
00:05:52,411 --> 00:05:54,545
Huh. This looks like
spooner street,

137
00:05:54,613 --> 00:05:56,714
Only something's
not quite right.

138
00:05:56,782 --> 00:05:59,517
According
to the multiverse guide,

139
00:05:59,585 --> 00:06:01,452
This is a universe
where the United States

140
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,788
Never dropped
the atomic bomb on hiroshima,

141
00:06:03,856 --> 00:06:05,523
So the japanese
just never quit.

142
00:06:15,768 --> 00:06:16,634
(farts)

143
00:06:45,264 --> 00:06:47,298
(giggles)

144
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:48,733
Well, I think
I've seen enough.

145
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:50,134
Let's get back
to our universe.

146
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:52,003
All right, off we go.

147
00:06:53,806 --> 00:06:55,840
Ah, home, sweet home.

148
00:06:55,908 --> 00:06:57,909
Lois (happy):
Peter?

149
00:06:57,976 --> 00:06:58,910
(sad):
Peter?

150
00:06:58,977 --> 00:06:59,911
(happy):
What?

151
00:06:59,978 --> 00:07:00,778
(sad):
What?

152
00:07:02,581 --> 00:07:03,948
(happy):
Can you take out
the trash?

153
00:07:04,016 --> 00:07:06,451
(sad):
'cause it stinks
in the kitchen.

154
00:07:06,518 --> 00:07:08,286
(happy):
Sure thing, lois, delighted to.

155
00:07:08,353 --> 00:07:10,721
(sad): I get tired
when I stand.

156
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:11,823
(both gasp)

157
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,091
What the hell is this?

158
00:07:13,158 --> 00:07:14,125
This isn't our universe.

159
00:07:14,193 --> 00:07:15,760
Apparently, this is
a universe

160
00:07:15,828 --> 00:07:19,163
Where everyone has two heads:
One happy, one sad.

161
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:21,132
Honey, have you
seen stewie?

162
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,867
I can't find
him anywhere.

163
00:07:22,935 --> 00:07:24,502
I sure have!

164
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,338
He's over there,
playing in the corner.

165
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:30,875
(happy): I want you
to know I love you.

166
00:07:30,943 --> 00:07:34,112
(sad): I'm trying to get
excited about it.

167
00:07:34,179 --> 00:07:35,413
Oh, this is too freaky.

168
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:37,014
Why didn't that
thing take us home?

169
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,349
I don't know.
I told you,

170
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:39,851
It hasn't been
fully tested yet.

171
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,652
Well, we can't stay here,
that's for sure.

172
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,955
(happy):
And now back to channel 5 news
at 6:00.

173
00:07:44,022 --> 00:07:48,126
(sad):
Quahog's lowest-rated newscast.

174
00:07:48,193 --> 00:07:49,727
The president's dog
just had puppies!

175
00:07:49,795 --> 00:07:52,830
There was a plane crash.

176
00:07:52,898 --> 00:07:55,199
Stewie, please tell me
you know how to get us home.

177
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,235
Of course I know
how to get us home.

178
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:01,472
What the hell?
Stewie, what's going on?

179
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,940
Well, from the look
of it,

180
00:08:03,008 --> 00:08:05,710
I'm guessing this is quahog,
but during some sort of ice age.

181
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,512
Well, press the button.
Get us outta here.

182
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:09,780
Uh-oh, I can't reach
the device.

183
00:08:09,848 --> 00:08:10,848
What?
You're kidding.

184
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:11,983
Yeah, get comfortable.

185
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,318
I think we're gonna be here
for a while.

186
00:08:14,386 --> 00:08:16,254
Oh, look, there's your poop
from the other universe.

187
00:08:20,497 --> 00:08:21,897
Stewie, you gotta
get us out of here!

188
00:08:21,965 --> 00:08:23,432
If we stay in
here much longer,

189
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,667
We're either gonna
freeze or starve!

190
00:08:24,735 --> 00:08:26,535
I know, but I can't reach
the device.

191
00:08:26,603 --> 00:08:27,870
You try.
You're closer to it,

192
00:08:27,938 --> 00:08:29,639
And besides,
you're stronger than I am.

193
00:08:29,706 --> 00:08:30,940
Hey, what was that?

194
00:08:31,008 --> 00:08:32,742
Oh, well, you said
I was stronger than you,

195
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:34,176
And that must have
made me happy.

196
00:08:34,244 --> 00:08:35,444
So my tail
started wagging.

197
00:08:35,512 --> 00:08:37,413
Looks like it carved
through the ice a bit.

198
00:08:37,481 --> 00:08:38,481
Yeah, it did.
Keep going.

199
00:08:38,548 --> 00:08:39,649
Okay, uh, let's see, um...

200
00:08:39,716 --> 00:08:41,183
You want to go
for a walk?

201
00:08:41,251 --> 00:08:42,418
It's working!
Do more!

202
00:08:42,486 --> 00:08:44,253
Uh, you want a treat?!
You want a treat, boy?!

203
00:08:44,321 --> 00:08:45,655
That's good,
that's good, but you...

204
00:08:45,722 --> 00:08:47,056
You really have
one, right?!
Oh, yeah, yeah.

205
00:08:47,124 --> 00:08:48,624
And we're going
for that walk?!

206
00:08:48,692 --> 00:08:50,693
Oh, yeah, definitely.
And, um, I'll, I'll
give you a bath!

207
00:08:50,761 --> 00:08:52,228
No, no, no!
Oh, sorry, sorry.

208
00:08:52,296 --> 00:08:54,163
And, and I'll,
I'll let you go
for a ride in the car!

209
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:55,264
Oh, you better
not be lying!

210
00:08:55,332 --> 00:08:56,399
You want to sleep
in the bed with us?!

211
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:57,600
Yes! Oh, I never get to!

212
00:08:57,668 --> 00:08:58,668
It must be a
special occasion!

213
00:08:58,735 --> 00:08:59,735
You got it!
You're through!

214
00:08:59,803 --> 00:09:01,170
Yes! All right,
what do I do?

215
00:09:01,238 --> 00:09:02,405
Just press
the red button!

216
00:09:02,472 --> 00:09:03,339
Okay.
Uh, which one's red?

217
00:09:03,407 --> 00:09:04,707
Press the big button!

218
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,644
This can't be it.

219
00:09:08,712 --> 00:09:09,745
This doesn't
look familiar.

220
00:09:09,813 --> 00:09:10,813
You're right, brian.

221
00:09:10,881 --> 00:09:12,214
Apparently, this is
a universe

222
00:09:12,282 --> 00:09:14,550
Where everyone has
to take a poop
right just now.

223
00:09:16,586 --> 00:09:18,087
Okay, uh, bill, you got
those numbers?
Yeah, yeah.

224
00:09:18,155 --> 00:09:19,288
Okay, just leave
them on my desk.

225
00:09:19,356 --> 00:09:20,790
Okay, that works out
fine for me.

226
00:09:20,857 --> 00:09:22,458
Where's your desk?
Doug knows
where my desk is.

227
00:09:22,526 --> 00:09:23,893
Craig, are you
good with this?

228
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,561
<i>Yeah, that should work out
pretty good for me, too.</i>

229
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,901
What the hell?
What's happened to us?

230
00:09:31,968 --> 00:09:33,602
I don't know,
but suddenly I feel

231
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,604
All sweet and warm
and fuzzy.

232
00:09:35,672 --> 00:09:37,106
It seems we're in a universe

233
00:09:37,174 --> 00:09:39,208
Where everything is drawn
by disney.

234
00:09:39,276 --> 00:09:40,509
Look, there's
our house.

235
00:09:42,346 --> 00:09:43,713
(laughing)

236
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,082
Look how
gaily we run!

237
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:54,623
Oh, stewie and brian, you're
just in time for pie.

238
00:09:54,691 --> 00:09:57,293
Peter:
Did somebody say "pie"?

239
00:09:59,696 --> 00:10:02,531

intro plays)

Oh, let's live in this universe.

250
00:10:27,657 --> 00:10:29,625
Gosh, it's pretty
intoxicating, isn't it?

251
00:10:29,693 --> 00:10:32,962

You want a nice, shiny red apple
to put in that pie?

262
00:11:04,394 --> 00:11:05,428
All:
No!

263
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:11,734
Brian, we could spend
the rest of our lives here.

264
00:11:11,802 --> 00:11:13,836
It's perfect.
Sounds good to me.

265
00:11:13,904 --> 00:11:15,638
Doesn't seem to be a thing
wrong with this place.

266
00:11:15,705 --> 00:11:17,440
Hello, everybody.

267
00:11:17,507 --> 00:11:19,909
All:
Jew!

268
00:11:25,148 --> 00:11:27,917
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
This is a disney universe.

269
00:11:27,984 --> 00:11:29,952
Oh, but look at how shiny
my buttons are here.

270
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,153
Just push the...
Yeah, yeah,
okay, okay.

271
00:11:31,221 --> 00:11:33,789
I'll push the thing.

272
00:11:33,857 --> 00:11:36,792
(bright melody plays)

273
00:11:38,528 --> 00:11:41,063
Whoa, this is trippy.

274
00:11:41,131 --> 00:11:44,200
<i>I should say so. We're in
the robot chicken universe.</i>

275
00:11:44,267 --> 00:11:46,302
Will you guys move?
You're blocking the tv.

276
00:11:46,369 --> 00:11:49,472
Look! Gi joe, transformers,
thundercats, he-man!

277
00:11:49,539 --> 00:11:51,907
Yay! Those shows existed!

278
00:11:51,975 --> 00:11:54,276
How's it feel to be on a major
network for 30 seconds?

279
00:11:54,344 --> 00:11:55,511
(bleep) you!

280
00:11:55,579 --> 00:11:57,046
Bye.

281
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:01,517
My god. This place
looks terrible.

282
00:12:01,585 --> 00:12:03,886
Looks like quahog
was vaporized or something.

283
00:12:03,954 --> 00:12:06,489
It says that in this universe,
frank sinatra was never born,

284
00:12:06,556 --> 00:12:08,491
And therefore, he was unable
to use his influence

285
00:12:08,558 --> 00:12:09,859
To get kennedy elected.

286
00:12:09,926 --> 00:12:11,827
So, nixon won
the 1960 election

287
00:12:11,895 --> 00:12:13,729
And totally botched the
cuban missile crisis,

288
00:12:13,797 --> 00:12:15,130
Causing world war iii.

289
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:17,466
Wow, so I guess lee harvey
oswald never shot kennedy?

290
00:12:17,534 --> 00:12:19,301
No, he shot mayor mccheese.

291
00:12:21,304 --> 00:12:23,138
(shots firing)

292
00:12:23,206 --> 00:12:26,742
(crowd screaming)

293
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,611
That joke's
not in bad taste, right?

294
00:12:28,678 --> 00:12:30,913
Oh, who cares?
He's a cheeseburger.

295
00:12:32,549 --> 00:12:34,583
Ew. Where are we?

296
00:12:34,651 --> 00:12:37,152
I don't know. The device can't
make heads or tails of it.

297
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,123
It's just some sort of weird,
low resolution blocky universe.

298
00:12:41,191 --> 00:12:42,625
Lois, where is my supper?

299
00:12:42,692 --> 00:12:43,893
Still in the oven.

300
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,528
Will I have it soon?
Quite soon.

301
00:12:45,595 --> 00:12:46,962
Thank you!
You're welcome!

302
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,997
Nyah!
Nyah!

303
00:12:48,064 --> 00:12:48,998
Nyah!
Nyah!

304
00:12:49,065 --> 00:12:49,999
Nyah!
Nyah!

305
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:50,966
Nyah!
Nyah!

306
00:12:51,034 --> 00:12:53,002
I'm frightened.
Let's go.

307
00:12:54,738 --> 00:12:56,071
Love it.
Hate it.

308
00:12:56,139 --> 00:12:58,874
Love it.
Hate it.

309
00:13:00,577 --> 00:13:02,611
Uh, brian?
Yeah?

310
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:03,646
This feels weird.

311
00:13:03,713 --> 00:13:05,481
Hit the button.

312
00:13:06,683 --> 00:13:08,384
Oh, god, what is this?

313
00:13:08,451 --> 00:13:09,885
I feel like I'm on acid
or something.

314
00:13:09,953 --> 00:13:12,087
According to the multiverse
guide, this is a universe

315
00:13:12,155 --> 00:13:13,522
Where everything is depicted

316
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,824
<i>As a washington post
political cartoon.</i>

317
00:13:15,892 --> 00:13:17,526
Good lord, I'm naked.

318
00:13:17,594 --> 00:13:19,161
And why am I holding
a dinner platter

319
00:13:19,229 --> 00:13:20,729
That says mccain/ feingold?

320
00:13:20,797 --> 00:13:22,631
(laughing)

321
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:24,233
That's-that's pretty good.

322
00:13:24,301 --> 00:13:25,668
That's-that's funny.

323
00:13:25,735 --> 00:13:27,102
You don't get it.

324
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,904
No, no, I totally get it.

325
00:13:28,972 --> 00:13:30,940
Oh, god.
Let's go, quick.

326
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,509
Here comes an overweight cat
with dollar signs for eyes

327
00:13:33,577 --> 00:13:35,377
And a hat that says
"social security,"

328
00:13:35,445 --> 00:13:38,113
Pouring a bucket that says
"alternative minimum tax"

329
00:13:38,181 --> 00:13:40,883
Over a sad statue of liberty
holding a democracy umbrella.

330
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:42,518
(laughing):
Yes!

331
00:13:42,586 --> 00:13:45,688
Oh, that ought
to wake people up.

332
00:13:45,755 --> 00:13:48,657
Shut the (bleep) up.

333
00:13:48,725 --> 00:13:52,061
Oh, my god.
Now we're nowhere.

334
00:13:52,128 --> 00:13:53,395
Not quite, brian.

335
00:13:53,463 --> 00:13:55,664
This is a universe,
but its only inhabitant

336
00:13:55,732 --> 00:13:58,634
Is one really far away guy
who yells compliments.

337
00:13:58,702 --> 00:14:00,102
I like your shirt!

338
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,637
Thank you!

339
00:14:01,705 --> 00:14:03,339
This was nice.

340
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,076
We did it. We're back.

341
00:14:07,143 --> 00:14:10,346
No. This is the universe
of misleading portraiture.

342
00:14:10,413 --> 00:14:12,047
Aw.

343
00:14:12,115 --> 00:14:14,650
Oh, wait. It's not so bad.
There's the compliment guy.

344
00:14:14,718 --> 00:14:16,385
Hello!

345
00:14:16,453 --> 00:14:20,222
(groans)
they got both of us!

346
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:23,659
We're finished. We're
never going to get home.

347
00:14:23,727 --> 00:14:25,527
We're never going to
see our peter and lois

348
00:14:25,595 --> 00:14:27,062
Or anyone else we
know ever again.

349
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,565
You got your pal stewie.

350
00:14:29,633 --> 00:14:32,768
Great.
Aw, you could learn
something from compliment guy.

351
00:14:32,836 --> 00:14:34,536
And you know,
it's not as bad as you think.

352
00:14:34,604 --> 00:14:36,939
I may have
finally figured this out.

353
00:14:37,007 --> 00:14:39,041
I just need to make
a few more calculations...

354
00:14:52,188 --> 00:14:53,355
Whoa.

355
00:14:53,423 --> 00:14:55,424
Sorry about that.
Bad girl, holly.

356
00:14:55,492 --> 00:14:56,625
No jumpies.

357
00:14:56,693 --> 00:14:58,127
Oh, it's quite all right.

358
00:14:58,194 --> 00:15:02,231
Um, wow.
Okay, this is ridiculous.

359
00:15:02,298 --> 00:15:05,300
You go here.
You, you naughty little wire,

360
00:15:05,368 --> 00:15:06,568
You're supposed to be over here.

361
00:15:06,636 --> 00:15:07,970
How did you get over there?

362
00:15:08,038 --> 00:15:10,005
Oh, yeah.

363
00:15:10,073 --> 00:15:11,306
Come on, holly,
let's go.

364
00:15:11,374 --> 00:15:13,909
This guy's a freak.

365
00:15:13,977 --> 00:15:15,511
And that should do it.

366
00:15:15,578 --> 00:15:16,779
Now, let's go home.

367
00:15:16,846 --> 00:15:18,280
Hey! What the hell
are you doing?

368
00:15:18,348 --> 00:15:20,282
I just don't think we
should be too hasty.

369
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,917
I mean, we have a
unique opportunity

370
00:15:21,985 --> 00:15:23,919
To study alternate
universes in depth.

371
00:15:23,987 --> 00:15:25,320
Brian,
give me the damn device.

372
00:15:25,388 --> 00:15:26,622
Give it.
(groaning)

373
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:27,956
No, knock it off.
Give it.

374
00:15:28,024 --> 00:15:29,358
No, stop it. Stop it.
Come on, give it.

375
00:15:29,426 --> 00:15:30,426
No. Come on.
Come on.

376
00:15:30,493 --> 00:15:31,660
(clattering, crashing)

377
00:15:31,728 --> 00:15:33,095
What the hell, man?

378
00:15:33,163 --> 00:15:34,663
What the hell?
Look what you did!

379
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:36,265
You better put that
thing on a leash, sir,

380
00:15:36,332 --> 00:15:39,001
Or I'm going to
have to fine you.

381
00:15:39,069 --> 00:15:43,305
Take your stinkin' paws off me,
you damn dirty dog.

382
00:15:46,306 --> 00:15:48,076
What the hell were you thinking, Brian?

383
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:49,682
We're never going
to get home now.

384
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:51,684
Why the hell would you
break the damn device?

385
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:52,851
Look, it was an
accident, all right?

386
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:55,254
And besides,
look at this place.

387
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:57,523
It's a world run by dogs.

388
00:15:57,591 --> 00:15:59,892
I mean, I kind of want
to explore this universe.

389
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,160
Oh, you like role reversal?

390
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:02,561
Huh? Okay.

391
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,864
Wait, what are you doing?
Oh! Oh! Come on!

392
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:08,634
Pick up my poop!
Pick up my poop!

393
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:10,002
I'm not picking
up your poop!

394
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,537
Hey, you.
Pick up that poop.

395
00:16:11,605 --> 00:16:13,672
You heard him, brian.
Pick up my poop.

396
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,277
Go on, pick it up.
Do it-- pick up my poop!

397
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:19,578
I need a plastic bag.

398
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,146
Here's a thin napkin.

399
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:27,252
Okay, I'm a a new neighbor and
you're my pet human hotchkiss.

400
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,754
Got it?
I-I-I don't...

401
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,823
I'm not so crazy
about "hotchkiss" anymore.

402
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,291
What do you mean? You
came up with hotchkiss.

403
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,792
I know, but...

404
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,596
How about axel or-or-or
maximilian or dex, you know?

405
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,598
It's-it's got to have
an "x" in it because...

406
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,100
'cause that means
I have cool parents

407
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,036
Who take me on expensive
ski trips on spring break

408
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:45,804
And I get
to drink wine with dinner,

409
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:47,373
Even though
I'm only 14, and...

410
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,841
(rings doorbell)

411
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:50,442
Oh, my god! I know that sound!

412
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,944
That means there's a potential
intruder at the front door

413
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,479
Or one of my pals.
Either way, I'm really excited

414
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:55,314
And ready for
anything! Hello?

415
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:56,682
(chuckles)

416
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,584
Hello, my name
is blake carrington.

417
00:16:58,652 --> 00:17:00,686
Aw.
And this is
my human, gabe.

418
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:02,121
Oh, no. What?

419
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,522
We just moved in
down the street

420
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,724
And thought we'd stop in
and say hi to our new neighbors.

421
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:07,926
Well, great to meet you.
Come on in. I'm peter.

422
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:10,562
This is my family.
My wife lois.

423
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:13,499
My son, chris-- chris,
stop licking yourself

424
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,734
And come up and say hi!

425
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:17,936
My daughter meg.

426
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:20,005
Our puppy stewie.

427
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:21,674
And this is
our human brian.

428
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:23,242
Nice to meet you.

429
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:25,944
"say hi
to human brian, blake,"

430
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:27,980
Says gabe.
Hi.

431
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:30,215
Mommy, I want to play
with the new human.

432
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:31,984
Only if it's okay
with blake.

433
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,485
Uh, yeah, sure,
it's fine.

434
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:34,853
Gabe is great with puppies.

435
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:37,189
I swear to god, I hope
the next universe we go to

436
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:39,958
Is all koreans.

437
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:44,196
I know who you are, stewie.

438
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:45,431
I beg your pardon?

439
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,533
I've perfected
multiverse travel, as well.

440
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,001
In fact, I've figured out

441
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,236
How to navigate
with absolute precision.

442
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:52,871
Really?
I haven't.

443
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:55,240
We've been jumping randomly
from one universe to the next.

444
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:56,875
Did you have
the "shuffle" button on?

445
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:59,945
Oh, my god.
There you go.

446
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:01,380
That's why that
little symbol...

447
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:02,848
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
The two
crossed arrows...

448
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,183
There it is.
...Is up there
in the corner.

449
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,884
There's your problem.
Oh, my god. I feel silly.

450
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:07,286
But I can't do
anything about it.

451
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:08,921
My device has
been destroyed.

452
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:11,190
Well, I've got one of my own.
I can use it to send you back.

453
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,357
Hold on, I'll get it.

454
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,859
(doorbell rings)

455
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,294
Oh, my god! Who is it? I got it!

456
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:16,995
Morning, peter.
Hey, joe.

457
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:18,897
Bonnie and I
are having company tonight,

458
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:20,599
Wondering if I could
borrow some wet food.

459
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:22,000
Yeah, sure thing.

460
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:24,403
That's joe.
He's our local human catcher.

461
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:28,207
So don't misbehave or the human
catcher'll come after you...

462
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,708
Gabe.

463
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,076
My name's not gabe!
(growls)

464
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:33,212
Ow!
(screams)

465
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,247
Oh, you're in big trouble,
you little crap!

466
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:37,015
Boy, you shouldn't have
done that, little fella.

467
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,418
You just earned yourself
a trip to the pound!

468
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:40,753
(muffled screams)

469
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,154
(screams)

470
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:43,422
Who the hell
do you think you are?!

471
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,590
Brian! Brian!

472
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:45,924
Do something!

473
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:47,126
Look, I'm sorry about this.

474
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:48,727
Let me just pay the fine
or whatever

475
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,295
And I'll make sure
this doesn't happen again.

476
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:51,530
You can pick
him up tomorrow.

477
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:52,664
Oh. Okay.

478
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,500
Just bring a trash bag.

479
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:55,567
(wheels squeaking)

480
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,035
What did he mean by that?

481
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:59,071
Any human that bites
a dog gets euthanized.

482
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:00,606
You know that.
No, he doesn't!

483
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:03,642
He's from another universe where
dogs are subservient to humans.

484
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,110
Oh, you mean like
that time we...
Yeah.

485
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:06,979
When we bounced around
between univ...
Yeah.

486
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:08,213
And you couldn't figure out
how to...
Yes!

487
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:09,381
Oh, they're going
to kill him!

488
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:10,516
We got to get him
out of there!

489
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:11,884
It's a tough world here.

490
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:13,919
You hear about it every night
on the dog news.

491
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,622
Coming up, that bush in the park
is my bush!

492
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:17,923
My bush!

493
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:30,068
Look, there he is!

494
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:33,071
Oh, thank god. I'm saved.

495
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:38,143
Come on,
let's get out of here.

496
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:39,745
All right, the two of you,
stand over there

497
00:19:39,813 --> 00:19:43,182
And I'll send you back
where you belong.

498
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:45,384
Gosh, brian,
I sure hope this next leap...

499
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:47,286
Will be the leap home.

500
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:48,353
Human brian:
Wait!

501
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,022
Take me with you.

502
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:52,157
What do you mean? You can't
come back to our universe.

503
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:53,892
Come on, a place
where humans are in charge?

504
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,093
I can't pass that up.

505
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:56,228
Dog joe:
Hey!

506
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:58,197
Get away from there!

507
00:20:10,927 --> 00:20:12,761
(grunting)

508
00:20:21,975 --> 00:20:23,309
Well, this looks like home.

509
00:20:23,377 --> 00:20:24,677
Is there any way
we can be sure?

510
00:20:24,745 --> 00:20:26,412
Hmm.

511
00:20:28,181 --> 00:20:30,650
Mom, have you seen
my trapper keeper?

512
00:20:30,717 --> 00:20:31,817
(farting)

513
00:20:31,885 --> 00:20:33,452
(laughing)

514
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,187
Both:
Yeah, we're home!

515
00:20:35,255 --> 00:20:37,456
(laughing)

516
00:20:37,524 --> 00:20:39,091
Well, now, what do we do
about this guy?

517
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:41,193
We got two brians
in our universe now.

518
00:20:41,261 --> 00:20:43,663
Don't worry, I don't
plan to stay in quahog.

519
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,197
I'm gonna go out into the world

520
00:20:45,265 --> 00:20:46,732
And see
what I can make of myself.

521
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,868
I can be somebody here.

522
00:20:48,936 --> 00:20:50,703
And it should be easy
for you, because...

523
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:52,438
I mean-- what luck--
you're white.

524
00:20:52,506 --> 00:20:54,640
You have no idea
how big that is here.

525
00:20:58,045 --> 00:21:00,313
Good-bye, stewie.
Good-bye, brian.

526
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,381
Maybe our paths
will cross again someday.

527
00:21:05,485 --> 00:21:07,386
Ah, look at him go.

528
00:21:07,454 --> 00:21:09,355
Free in a world
of his own kind,

529
00:21:09,423 --> 00:21:11,724
Where he can finally reach
the full potential--

530
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:13,492
Oh, my god!
He got hit by a car!

531
00:21:13,493 --> 00:21:15,493
