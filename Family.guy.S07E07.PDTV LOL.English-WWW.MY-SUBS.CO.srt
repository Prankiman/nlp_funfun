00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,420
- Hey fellas, you all set for some paintball?
- You bet!

5
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,770
God! Joe, finally! You watch paralyzed too?

6
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,810
Guys, I don't think I can make it today. It looks like Bonny

7
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,010
might go in to labor any minute so I think I should stick close to home.

8
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,680
It's your fault for knocking her up.

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,050
That's why I always use a con...

10
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:56,090
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't even say that with a straight face.

11
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,090
Sorry, fellas. Have a good time.

12
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,560
Man, I am so sick of this. Joe is just gonna keep

13
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,210
bailing on us until that baby comes out of Bonny's butt.

14
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,200
Babies come out of the butt, right?

15
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,220
Yeah...

16
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,950
Well, we are gonna do something about it.

17
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,110
We are gonna figure out a way to induce labor

18
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,540
and make Bonny have that baby.

19
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,390
Yeah! The sooner that kid comes out the sooner we get Joe back.

20
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,220
Yeah. We're not complete without Joe.

21
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,400
You remember when he bailed on us for that trip to spa

22
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,400
we had to find another handicapped guy?

23
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,280
God, Seamus, I've... never seen you this naked.

24
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,180
Ahh, it's good to let the old midsection breathe.

25
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,550
What eh...

26
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,330
How the hell are you alive?

27
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,730
Hey Peter, how are you?

28
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,700
Never mind that, Bonny. I'm here to induce birth. Follow me.

29
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,630
Now I'm gonna put the TV-remote down by your feet.

30
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,450
And I'm gonna turn on "Two and a half men"

31
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:49,250
If your baby isn't totally braindead it'll come rushing out to change the channel.

32
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,240
And when he does I'll grab his hand and yank him out of there.

33
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,110
- Peter, I don't think...
- Sh! It's starting.

34
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,480
Two and a half men was filmed in front of a live ostrich.

35
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,690
Boy, this stinks. It's friday night and I don't have a date.

36
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,830
Well then, let me get you a number from my little black book.

37
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,410
Guys! Bonny's going into labor.

38
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,570
We gotta get her to the hospital. Quick, Peter, get the car.

39
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,270
No way! I don't want pregnant mess in my backseat.

40
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,900
Oh, come on, you're the guy who soiled his pants while testdriving that sportscar.

41
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,550
I don't want it.

42
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,450
All right, mrs. Swanson, you're doing fine.

43
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,120
Hey Peter, don't you wanna watch this? It's a beautiful miracle of nature.

44
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,570
I can't look. I didn't look when Lois gave birth and I can't look now.

45
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,570
You can just... tell me what it looks like.

46
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,820
You ever see a horse blink his eye?

47
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,280
Ok mrs. Swanson, you're almost there. Push. Push!

48
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,920
Get out of there! GET THE HELL OUT OF MY WIFE YOU LITTLE BASTARD!!!

49
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,380
Ok. Here we go.

50
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,640
Hold on, the wheelchair is coming first.

51
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,440
And here's the baby...

52
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:05,220
Congratulations mrs. Swanson, it's a beautiful baby girl.

53
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,820
Ah, Bonny, I'm so happy for you.

54
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,300
Oh my god! She's dying!

55
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,190
WHAT?!

56
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,230
Oh, sorry. I was watching this Paula Poundstone comedy special.

57
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,230
Here's your baby.

58
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,540
She's beautiful.

59
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,210
And she's sweetheart.

60
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,210
She sure is, Joe.

61
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,190
It's hard to believe she's already 18.

62
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,880
Attention everyone. This is a twist tie, it comes with every loaf of bread.

63
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,810
When we are done selecting our piece of bread we use the tie to preserve...

64
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,440
Oh my God!

65
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,450
Who is that angel?

66
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,840
That's Susie Swanson.

67
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,650
You don't say...

68
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,320
What? Like you think you had a shot with her?

69
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,800
Ah, you're kidding. We'll go together better than Hannity and Colmes.

70
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,560
My problem with liberals, Allen, is that liberals hate America.

71
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,560
So and I don't know if that's true

72
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,240
You've just contradicted me. You hate America!

73
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,840
If I could just get a word in.

74
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,730
You hate America. You like the terrorists.

75
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,820
Well, I guess you're right again.

76
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,910
Bonny, we've got a problem.

77
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,200
- What's the matter, Joe?
- I'll tell you while we doing a diaper change.

78
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,530
Here's the reality of the situation. I've got a hospital bill this morning.

79
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:23,270
- How bad is it?
- It's 20 thousand dollars.

80
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,180
Oh my God! Where are we gonna get that kind of money?

81
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,400
I don't know but we gotta figure that out soon.

82
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,370
I know where, Joe. You'll think out something.

83
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:36,710
I gotta tell you. That being able to pay my child hospital bills somehow makes me feel that...

84
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,140
Less of a man.

85
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,140
Oh, honey, that's silly.

86
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,010
I'm gonna show you what a man you really are.

87
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,600
Now, let's get your penis on.

88
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,480
Joe? What the hell, you're working here?

89
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,020
I have to, Quagmire.

90
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,800
The baby's hospital bill drain dollar savings

91
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,800
so I've had no choice but to take this job

92
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,580
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

93
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,220
Scuse me, I couldn't help over there and you got yourself some money issues.

94
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,140
Uh... Yeah, kinda.

95
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,810
Well, I might be able to help you. How much you need?

96
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,980
Look, I'm a police officer, I can't afford to get mixed with a lawn shark.

97
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,770
Hey, you should listen to this guy, Joe.

98
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,990
He's flipping a nickel and chewing on a toothpick.

99
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,600
Well, I... do really need the money.

100
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,820
And I don't have the credit for a bank loan.

101
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,010
Do it, Joe. Cause if you gonna work here any longer,

102
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,010
you're gonna feel smaller than my eye floaters.

103
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,240
Ah! There's one now.

104
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,220
I can never look at it dead on, it always trying to get away.

105
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,220
- Hey eye floater.
- Hi.

106
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,360
Hey! Hey, where you're going?

107
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,960
Away from you, people.

108
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,560
- Well, maybe I'll look over here.
- I'll go over here.

109
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,910
You've got an answer for everything, don't you?

110
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,490
Oh, Brian, come here.

111
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,400
Would you mind listen to this song I wrote for Susie Swanson and tell me what you think?

112
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,150
Ok.

113
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:04,360
<i>Susie... you're a baby</i>

114
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,070
That's... that's all I have so far.

115
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,130
That was horrible. It was bad as Beethoven near the end.

116
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,610
They gonna love that.

117
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,790
Well, I'm still gonna do a little work on it.

118
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,540
What's it called?

119
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,460
Susie.

120
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,460
Wow! A song named after a girl.

121
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,030
There're million of those already.

122
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:26,970
Name 20.

132
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,740
Go fuck yourself.

133
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,260
What am I gonna do, guys? I paid the hospital bill

134
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,960
but now I need $20k to pay the lawn shark.

135
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,500
I'm right back where I started.

136
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,130
Well, sounds like we need another lawn shark.

137
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:04,210
Don't worry, Joe. We're all gonna pitch in and help you raise that money.

138
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,950
Wow Peter, I got to say

139
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:12,500
this lemonade stand was really a good idea. It's selling really well.

140
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,190
That's because it has my secret ingridient in it.

141
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,300
Vodka!

142
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,300
You know what we should do?

143
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,300
You know what we should do?

144
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,910
We should just... We should just get on our bikes and just go.

145
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,420
Just go and start a business.

146
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,770
You know... I've never to... I've never told anyone this.

147
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:35,060
but you're so good at cursive.

148
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,150
I don't know Peter, we've been out here all day

149
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:44,300
and we haven't managed to interest a single woman in our massage parlour.

150
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,620
Wait a minute, here comes somebody.

151
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,620
Excuse me, stressed out lady.

152
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,710
May I interest you in a full release relaxation massage?

153
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:54,020
Oh yeah! Just what I need. To be rubbed down by big fatty

154
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,730
an old black guy, a crippled and a pervert.

155
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:00,860
Now we don't have any money and our feelings are hurt.

156
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,800
So, that's pretty much it, mr. Pewterschmidt

157
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,400
Joe's getting desperate and we haven't raised nearly enough.

158
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,820
Is there any way you could help us out?

159
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,140
Of course I could.

160
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,140
But it's funnier to me if I don't.

161
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,560
In about an hour I'm gonna piss away 20 grand.

162
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,870
What are you gonna bet on the Nicks?

163
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,570
It's... I'm sorry... I mean how often...

164
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,170
I mean... Oh, man, nobody think that's funny?

165
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,560
Oh my god, she's so hot.

166
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,680
Look at that, she can fit that full bottle in her mouth.

167
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,570
Allright, come on Stewie, you can write a song. How hard could it be.

168
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,960
<i>You got your G chord right here</i>

169
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,480
<i>It's like a cozy house where you live</i>

170
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,340
<i>that's where you start your journey</i>

171
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,330
<i>here I am in my house, nice and cozy</i>

172
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,840
<i>and then you poke your head out the door with the C chord</i>

173
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,210
<i>everything looks ok out here</i>

174
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,500
<i>maybe I'll take a walk outside</i>

175
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,700
<i>to the D chord</i>

176
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,880
<i>oh, walking around outside</i>

177
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,880
<i>look at all that stuff out here</i>

178
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,620
<i>and then we go to an A minor</i>

179
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,060
<i>getting a little cloudy out here</i>

180
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,060
<i>looking like we might have some weather</i>

181
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:19,640
<i>then we go to E minor oh, definetly goes some weather</i>

182
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,390
<i>things a little more complicated than they seen at first</i>

183
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,910
<i>and then we go back to my house</i>

184
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,910
You sound like an unbelieveable douche.

185
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:31,580
<i>then Brian comes in and I change up the tempo</i>

186
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,770
<i>Brian comes in and it changes the song</i>

187
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:38,910
<i>looking at me like he thinks I'm a douchebag</i>

188
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,100
<i>but he's gonna learn pretty fast that he's wrong</i>

189
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,310
<i>hey Brian, why are you bringing me down there?</i>

190
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:49,660
<i>why are you bringing me down? DON'T BRING ME DOWN!</i>

191
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,860
Music and lyrics by Stewie Griffin.

192
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,450
Hey Swanson, the boss is getting impatient. He wants his money.

193
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,710
He says after we've done with you, you gonna be eaten...

194
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,950
Swanson TV... TV-di... wait, what did he said?

195
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:10,960
- What?
- Wha-What did the boss said? He said something funny and now I drowe the blank, wha-wha-what it was?

196
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,480
Eh, you know what is was? You know what it was?

197
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,440
When we're done with him he's gonna be a Swanson TV-dinner.

198
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,510
That is pretty funny.

199
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,110
Look what they did to me. My legs are useless now.

200
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
And trust me, they'll be back.

201
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,470
Well, what are we gonna do?

202
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:34,130
You know what, boys? Desperate times call for desperate measures.

203
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:37,250
If that stingy old cat won't give us the money we need

204
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,250
I say we take it from him.

205
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,440
Guys, we are gonna plan a robbery.

206
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,140
Hey, hey. That's the guy.

207
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:54,040
That's the guy whose chin... looks like a b... balls.

208
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:07,910
All right. On a normal night in a Pewterschmidt mansion there might be as much as 6 million dollars in a vault alone.

209
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:13,250
But this Saturday is the Pewterschmidt annual "Bring all your cash and put it in our safe" party.

210
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:17,310
Considering the guest list there could be as much as 40 million.

211
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,310
But we only need 20 thousand.

212
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,710
All right, I'll be honest with you.

213
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:24,210
My father-in-law has treated me like crap

214
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,900
for almost 20 years and it's time for a little payback.

215
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,040
I tell you, he's treated me worse than that jerk Cristian Bale did.

216
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,840
I want you off the fucking set, you prick!

217
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:33,440
Sorry.

218
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,040
Don't just be sorry!

219
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,040
Think for one fucking second!

220
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,200
I dropped the pean(?) on Eminem and rolled over here.

221
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,860
I'm not gonna walk around and rip your fucking lights stand in a middle of a scene.

222
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,490
Those are the Christmas lights, I put them up to make everyone happy.

223
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,990
Then why the fuck are walking right through?

224
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,770
Ah, ta-da-ta-da, like this in the back room. What the fuck it is with you?

225
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:54,250
Well, you are gonna owe a fortune to a swearjack(?).

226
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:58,970
You got ... here. Hey, it's fucking distracting!

227
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:04,060
Having somebody walking up behind bries(?) in the scene.

228
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,220
Give me your fucking answer!

229
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,120
I don't get it.

230
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,740
What don't you get about it?

231
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,250
I don't get why we need another terminator. I just... I don't get it.

232
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:17,310
And by the way, sorry, I ate that last piece of pie you were saving for yourself.

233
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:20,810
Ah! Good for you! And how was it?

234
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:21,620
It was good.

235
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,750
I hope it was fucking good because it's useless now, isn't it?

236
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,010
Wa... It's nourishing me, so it's useful.

237
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,970
... sake man, you're amateur.

238
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,010
I don't know that word.

239
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,670
Stay off the fucking set man.

240
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,040
Right, let's go again.

241
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,020
Can we just take a minute?

242
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,780
Let's not take a fucking minute, let's go again!

243
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,527
I'm gonna go pee and I wanna walk around

244
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,169
some more and I walla scenes going (?).

245
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,540
You're unbelieveable, man.

246
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,360
I just don't understand...

247
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,440
You don't fucking understand what it's like working with actors. That's what that is.

248
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,700
I... I don't think that's what that...

249
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,770
That's what that is, man, I'm telling you.

250
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,060
My family is coming to town, do you mind pretending that I'm the director.

251
00:12:54,060 --> 00:13:29,022
(?)

252
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,610
Oh, there's my laptop.

253
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,130
Do you mind, I wanna check my e-mail.

254
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:38,420
Go away! I'm editing this music video, I'm making for Susie.

255
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,420
Oh, really? Music video?

256
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,910
Working on a little video there?

257
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,450
Little uh... Little music video?

258
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,190
Little compilation of visual images to go with the song?

259
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,930
Little 4-minute movie that tells the story of...

260
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,340
Yeah, that only works when I do it.

261
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:58,010
There. All done. All right, Brian, get ready to feel.

262
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,010
<i>Look into your heart - you will find</i>

263
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:27,560
<i>There's nothin' there to hide</i>

264
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:34,790
<i>Take me as I am - take my life</i>

265
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,860
<i>I would give it all - I would sacrifice</i>

266
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:49,280
<i>Don't tell me it's not worth fightin' for</i>

267
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:56,560
<i>I can't help it - there's nothin' I want more</i>

268
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,760
<i>You know it's true</i>

269
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:07,560
<i>Everything I do - I do it for you</i>

270
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:18,630
<i>There's no love - like your love</i>

271
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:26,000
<i>And no other - could give more love</i>

272
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,310
<i>There's nowhere - unless you're there</i>

273
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:43,080
<i>All the time - all the way</i>

274
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,830
- I'm not following the story arc here.
- Shut up!

275
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:57,870
<i>Look into your heart, babe</i>

276
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:20,060
<i>Oh - you can't tell me it's not worth tryin' for</i>

277
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:26,990
<i>I can't help it - there's nothin' I want more</i>

278
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:35,060
<i>I would fight for you - I'd lie for you</i>

279
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:45,390
<i>Walk the wire for you - yeah I'd die for you</i>

280
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:49,400
<i>You know it's true</i>

281
00:16:49,590 --> 00:17:02,870
<i>Everything I do - I do it for you</i>

282
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,210
Don't worry, Brian, those goose bumps will go away in about 20 minutes.

283
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:18,480
Bill, how are you? Barb, come over here and say hi to Bill Gates.

284
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,480
Hello, mr. Gates.

285
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,580
Hi, mrs. Pewterschmidt. Well, this is a great little party you guys are throwing.

286
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,950
Hey Bill, will you help me programming my Zune?

287
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,720
Oh, wait, I have an iPod like the rest of the world.

288
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,840
Why you?

289
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,200
All right, Joe, we're here.

290
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,040
All right, Peter, Quagmire, start the diversion.

291
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,560
Cleveland, find that door.

292
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,500
- Check.
- Check.

293
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:47,740
Hey fellas, knock off all that high society crap and play some of this.

294
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,460
One. Two. Three. Four.

295
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,400
<i>We can dance if we want to</i>

296
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,350
<i>We can leave your friends behind</i>

297
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:04,270
<i>'Cause your friends don't dance and if they don't dance</i>

298
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,270
<i>Well they're no friends of mine</i>

299
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,470
<i>I say, we can go where we want to</i>

300
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,870
<i>A place where they will never find</i>

301
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,080
<i>And we can act like we come from out</i>

302
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,450
All right, Cleveland, you're all clear to enter the vault.

303
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,300
Copy that.

304
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:34,120
Uh oh, it's a combination lock.

305
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,690
Looks like I'm just gonna cut through it.

306
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:39,380
Good thing I brought Reese Witherspoon's cheen.

307
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,840
Brian, do you know where Peter is?

308
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,190
Yeah, he and the guys went to rob your dad.

309
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,030
I believe you.

310
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,420
I'm in.

311
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,190
Holy crap, there's another door.

312
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,450
What are we gonna do?

313
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:15,190
Welcome to the vault. Voice identification, please.

314
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,090
Uh oh.

315
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,380
It's me, Carter, I want my money.

316
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,380
Voice print verified.

317
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,720
How the hell did you do that?

318
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,480
I can do you guys too.

319
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,360
- Hey everybody.
- Oh, hey Peter.

320
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,360
- No, it's still me.
- Ah.

321
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:37,420
Welcome to the inner vault. Penile identification required.

322
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,420
Let me handle this.

323
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,790
That's amazing! How the hell did you match it?

324
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,480
Oh, I didn't match the shape, I just stuck in and broke it.

325
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:56,110
Final checkpoint. Answer this question.

326
00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:00,620
What is the most unattractive male first name in the English language?

327
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,650
Kif.

328
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,980
Wow! Look at this place.

329
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:16,090
All right boys, pack up the do(?) and get out of there.

330
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,690
Joe, stop!

331
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,210
Lois, what are you doing here?

332
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,710
I'm here to try to talk some sense into you.

333
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,570
Do you really wanna go through with this?

334
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,670
I have to, Lois, for my family.

335
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:28,180
I don't know where else to get 20 thousand dollars.

336
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,620
But you know, dad will find out

337
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,190
he'll put his best people on a job and believe me he'll catch you.

338
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,810
That's the risk I'm willing to take.

339
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:38,610
But think about your beautiful little girl.

340
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:41,030
You can't wach her grow up from jail.

341
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:43,890
You'll miss running after her as she learns to walk...

342
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,390
I... I mean... I mean riding bikes with her as she...

343
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,870
I mean dancing at the wedding...

344
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:52,690
Look, my point is you know that you doing this wrong

345
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,690
and you know how to make it right.

346
00:20:55,300 --> 00:21:00,040
Uh... Guys... Put the money back and get out of there.

347
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,040
What? Are you out of your mind?

348
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,120
Tell 'em, Megatron.

349
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,210
DO AS I COMMAND!

350
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:06,860
Ok, ok, jeez.

351
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,490
So, how'd Susie like your video?

352
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,920
I don't care about her anymore.

353
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,920
I'm in love with Brian Adams.

354
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:22,090
Peter, I want you to promise me, you'll never do anything that stupid again.

355
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:25,370
Lois, after what you did for Joe, I promise you everything.

356
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:28,440
How the hell did you get your dad to give that 20 grand?

357
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,980
I told him it was for me.

358
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,240
I said I wanted to hire a divorce lawyer.

359
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,180
You're... you joking about that, right?

360
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,660
Lois?

361
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,660
You're joking, right?

362
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,610
Lois?!

363
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,000
