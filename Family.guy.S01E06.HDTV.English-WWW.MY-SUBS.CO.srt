To prove you are truly a member
of our tribe, you must go on a vision quest.

She's a little slow in the head.

A vision quest is a sacred spiritual journey.

in the wilderness without food or water.

-Yeah. Or shoes.

He must remain there
until he can communicate with nature.

326
00:15:30,956 --> 00:15:33,584
He must hear the wisdom
of the rocks and trees.

327
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:37,128
And then his guiding spirit
must appear to him...

328
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:39,220
...and reveal a great personal truth.

329
00:15:39,865 --> 00:15:41,560
And it's gotta be a real vision.
