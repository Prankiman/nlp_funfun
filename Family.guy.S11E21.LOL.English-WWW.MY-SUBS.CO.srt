00:00:51,962 --> 00:00:54,797
Thanks for encouraging us
to come to Gay Pride Day, Brian.

4
00:00:54,832 --> 00:00:56,193
Yeah, this seems
like it'll be fun.

5
00:00:56,216 --> 00:00:58,301
Real fun, not "entertain-
your-wife's-parents-

6
00:00:58,352 --> 00:01:00,269
while-your-wife-
is-at-work" fun.

7
00:01:00,304 --> 00:01:03,139
Laura gets home at 7:00,
so I figure we can stare

8
00:01:03,173 --> 00:01:05,041
at our wine glasses
till then.

9
00:01:09,313 --> 00:01:11,047
So, uh... so, when...

10
00:01:11,081 --> 00:01:13,850
when do you guys think
you're gonna die?

11
00:01:16,553 --> 00:01:18,103
Wow, a parade.

12
00:01:18,122 --> 00:01:19,489
It's like I'm walking
past stuff,

13
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,090
but I'm not going anywhere.

14
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:24,277
Look, there's the float
commemorating sham marriages.

15
00:01:24,311 --> 00:01:26,746
Sorry, this stomach thing
is acting up again tonight.

16
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,049
Oh, and I'm going on a business
trip to Mykonos for July.

17
00:01:30,116 --> 00:01:33,886
And it says this next one is
the "Shocking Reveal Gay Float."

18
00:01:36,974 --> 00:01:39,826
I had no idea.

19
00:01:39,828 --> 00:01:41,093
Hey, check it out.

20
00:01:41,128 --> 00:01:42,728
There's an air show.

21
00:01:45,866 --> 00:01:47,400
Oh, my God--
they're gonna crash!

22
00:01:47,434 --> 00:01:49,168
No, no, don't worry--
it's a gay air show.

23
00:01:49,203 --> 00:01:50,887
They're just gonna
lightly touch tips.

24
00:01:52,072 --> 00:01:54,123
Aw!

25
00:01:54,158 --> 00:01:55,992
Well, listen up, everybody,
'cause it's time

26
00:01:56,026 --> 00:01:57,994
for our grand prize drawing
for those tickets

27
00:01:58,028 --> 00:02:00,796
to see Celine Dion live
in Las Vegas!

28
00:02:00,831 --> 00:02:02,565
Infertility!

29
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,766
Here we go!

30
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,601
Our grand prize winner is...

31
00:02:05,636 --> 00:02:07,470
Brian Griffin.

32
00:02:10,374 --> 00:02:11,591
Wow, I don't believe it!

33
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:12,909
Hey, congratulations, buddy.

34
00:02:12,943 --> 00:02:14,143
You know, you're a lucky guy.

35
00:02:14,178 --> 00:02:16,879
The only thing I ever won
was an extra day of summer.

36
00:02:17,848 --> 00:02:20,016
Okay, Peter--
one more day.

37
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,034
Yay!

38
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:25,238
I saw what I look like
in a car window,

39
00:02:25,272 --> 00:02:26,939
and now I don't want to go.

40
00:02:30,444 --> 00:02:32,311
We now return
to <i>Franklin and Bash</i>

41
00:02:32,346 --> 00:02:34,313
<i>with Indicators to Show</i>
<i>Which One is Franklin</i>

42
00:02:34,348 --> 00:02:35,882
<i>and Which One is Bash.</i>

43
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:38,818
Defensive blows to their heads
were to send a message...

44
00:02:38,852 --> 00:02:39,869
<i>Oh, sorry, sorry.</i>

45
00:02:39,903 --> 00:02:42,388
"Help me get
into used car sales."

46
00:02:42,422 --> 00:02:44,356
Hey, Stewie, I don't know if
you have any interest in this,

47
00:02:44,374 --> 00:02:46,259
but I was wondering if you
want to go to Vegas with me

48
00:02:46,293 --> 00:02:47,426
and see Celine Dion.

49
00:02:47,461 --> 00:02:49,328
Are you kidding?
Of course I want to go!

50
00:02:49,363 --> 00:02:50,897
Wow, these are good seats!

51
00:02:50,931 --> 00:02:53,616
I know-- apparently they were
donated by Goldman's Pharmacy.

52
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,952
Turns out Mort's cousin
is Celine's opening act.

53
00:02:55,986 --> 00:02:57,420
Really? What's his talent?

54
00:02:57,454 --> 00:02:59,639
I understand he's a
magician of sorts.

55
00:02:59,673 --> 00:03:00,913
All right, for this next trick,

56
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:03,759
I need a quarter
from the audience.

57
00:03:03,794 --> 00:03:05,895
Okay, thank you.

58
00:03:15,222 --> 00:03:16,472
You almost ready, Stewie?

59
00:03:16,506 --> 00:03:17,974
We should probably start
heading to the airport.

60
00:03:18,008 --> 00:03:19,742
Yes, I was gonna talk to
you about that, actually.

61
00:03:19,776 --> 00:03:21,310
Last night, I was
thinking to myself,

62
00:03:21,345 --> 00:03:23,512
"Why fly, when we can
get there instantly?"

63
00:03:23,547 --> 00:03:24,780
What? What do you mean?

64
00:03:24,815 --> 00:03:26,782
Well, you see, I recently
completed construction

65
00:03:26,817 --> 00:03:29,135
on a teleportation device,
and it occurred to me,

66
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:31,454
this may be the perfect
chance to try it out.

67
00:03:35,142 --> 00:03:37,977
Wow, Stewie,
that's incredible!

68
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:39,679
Oh, hey, guys.

69
00:03:39,713 --> 00:03:42,148
Peter, what do
you have there?

70
00:03:42,182 --> 00:03:45,167
Give me the scissors.

71
00:03:45,202 --> 00:03:47,270
I was just gonna make
some masks!

72
00:03:47,304 --> 00:03:48,471
Use <i>your</i> scissors.

73
00:03:48,505 --> 00:03:49,922
They're not sharp!

74
00:03:51,308 --> 00:03:52,508
So, what do you say?

75
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:54,377
Hmm, teleport to Vegas, huh?

76
00:03:54,411 --> 00:03:56,428
All right, let's do it!

77
00:03:58,565 --> 00:04:01,000
Okay, now, the device is
powered by kinetic energy,

78
00:04:01,034 --> 00:04:02,969
so you've got to dance
to make it work.

79
00:04:03,003 --> 00:04:04,670
You, uh... really?

80
00:04:04,705 --> 00:04:07,623
Yeah , you've
got to dance.

81
00:04:08,942 --> 00:04:10,609
What are you doing,
you tool?

82
00:04:10,644 --> 00:04:12,144
Do you know anything
about science?

83
00:04:12,179 --> 00:04:14,580
You just saw
me program it.

84
00:04:18,518 --> 00:04:20,036
What the hell, Stewie?
It didn't work.

85
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,103
Hmm, that's odd.

86
00:04:21,138 --> 00:04:22,438
It appears there
may still be

87
00:04:22,472 --> 00:04:23,939
a few more bugs
to work out.

88
00:04:23,974 --> 00:04:25,641
Well, it was
worth a try.

89
00:04:35,402 --> 00:04:37,536
Oh, my God, Stewie--
it-it worked!

90
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:38,688
We're in Vegas!

91
00:04:38,722 --> 00:04:40,156
Yeah, all right!

92
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,674
Well, let's hit the
hospital, get checked

93
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:45,077
for teleportation
cancer and then party!

94
00:04:45,112 --> 00:04:47,613
Well, since the teleportation
machine failed to get us

95
00:04:47,647 --> 00:04:49,749
to Vegas, I suppose we should
just catch our plane.

96
00:04:49,783 --> 00:04:51,584
I'll repair it
when we get back.

97
00:04:51,618 --> 00:04:54,003
You know, this is going
to be a good trip, Brian.

98
00:04:54,037 --> 00:04:56,522
I really feel like fate
is on our side.

99
00:04:56,556 --> 00:04:58,257
Scissors are jerks.

100
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,892
And I'm a owl.

101
00:05:06,663 --> 00:05:08,013
Oh, wow, look at
that, Stewie.

102
00:05:08,014 --> 00:05:08,997
Perfect timing.

103
00:05:09,032 --> 00:05:10,132
Oh, it's beautiful.

104
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,367
Everything's just
so beautiful here.

105
00:05:12,402 --> 00:05:14,019
This is miserable.

106
00:05:14,053 --> 00:05:16,822
Three-hour delay
and a completely full flight.

107
00:05:16,856 --> 00:05:18,957
Don't look at us,
you  pig.

108
00:05:18,992 --> 00:05:21,827
Take your Juicy sweatpants
and your dirty pillow from home,

109
00:05:21,861 --> 00:05:25,030
and your bucket of Coke, and
get the hell out of my sight.

110
00:05:25,064 --> 00:05:26,798
What was her problem?

111
00:05:30,086 --> 00:05:31,353
You see that, Brian?

112
00:05:31,387 --> 00:05:34,156
That's going to be our
penises later, right?

113
00:05:36,693 --> 00:05:38,994
Stewie, that teleportation
machine is amazing.

114
00:05:39,028 --> 00:05:40,546
It's so great
that we're already here.

115
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,880
Yep, drink it in, Bri.

116
00:05:41,915 --> 00:05:44,550
Time to enjoy all the
Bellagio has to offer.

117
00:05:44,584 --> 00:05:45,801
Classic architecture.

118
00:05:45,835 --> 00:05:46,902
Beautiful art.

119
00:05:46,936 --> 00:05:48,670
Plus, the air is clean
because they suck up

120
00:05:48,705 --> 00:05:51,540
all the cigarette smoke and
dump it in the bad hotels.

121
00:05:51,574 --> 00:05:53,442
Smell that, kids?

122
00:05:53,476 --> 00:05:56,028
It's been in a rich
person's mouth.

123
00:05:56,062 --> 00:05:57,746
Hi. We're checking in--
Griffin?

124
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,014
Ah, yes.

125
00:05:59,048 --> 00:06:00,682
I see you've requested
a bed that's good

126
00:06:00,717 --> 00:06:01,683
for bouncing
and jumping?

127
00:06:01,718 --> 00:06:02,684
That is correct.

128
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:03,852
I am a businessman.

129
00:06:03,886 --> 00:06:05,220
Just sign here, please.

130
00:06:05,255 --> 00:06:07,289
And you can actually keep
that pen if you'd like.

131
00:06:07,323 --> 00:06:08,724
No way! Really?

132
00:06:08,758 --> 00:06:10,125
Wow, you see that, Brian?

133
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:11,526
Good luck already.

134
00:06:11,561 --> 00:06:13,601
You know, I know we're
switching to a digital world,

135
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,632
but I-I think this little
guy's still got a place in it.

136
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,884
Hey, we should try one of those
slot machines by the entrance.

137
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:21,038
You know, they always set
those things to pay out more

138
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,938
so they can lure people
into the casino.

139
00:06:22,972 --> 00:06:24,306
Well, that's a great idea.

140
00:06:30,763 --> 00:06:32,681
Oh, my God--
I don't believe it!

141
00:06:32,715 --> 00:06:33,548
Brian, we won!

142
00:06:33,582 --> 00:06:35,150
We won the jackpot!

143
00:06:35,184 --> 00:06:36,584
Oh, this is unbelievable.

144
00:06:36,603 --> 00:06:39,421
I haven't had this much fun
since I hosted the Oscars.

145
00:06:39,455 --> 00:06:40,689
Good evening.

146
00:06:40,723 --> 00:06:42,958
I just want to say
that I have the utmost respect

147
00:06:42,992 --> 00:06:44,159
for women everywhere.

148
00:06:44,193 --> 00:06:45,527
And also, the Jews.

149
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:46,895
Good night.

150
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:56,771
Oh, thank God,
we're finally here.

151
00:06:56,789 --> 00:06:58,707
That plane ride took forever.

152
00:06:58,741 --> 00:07:02,244
Kind of weird they showed
<i>Flight 93</i> on Flight 93.

153
00:07:02,278 --> 00:07:04,579
Hi. We're checking in--
Griffin?

154
00:07:04,614 --> 00:07:07,115
Hmm, I do have a Griffin
here, but that room

155
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,750
was checked into hours ago.
What?

156
00:07:08,785 --> 00:07:10,986
Yes, and I'm afraid we have
no other rooms available.

157
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,221
I see-- is there
a less heavy person

158
00:07:13,256 --> 00:07:14,523
that could check again for me?

159
00:07:14,557 --> 00:07:15,891
I'm sorry, we're
all booked up

160
00:07:15,925 --> 00:07:17,526
because the Slut
Convention's in town.

161
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,328
Slut Convention?
Yeah.

162
00:07:19,362 --> 00:07:21,229
They were promised a
single millionaire,

163
00:07:21,264 --> 00:07:23,165
but it's really just a
bunch of horny squirrels

164
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,533
in a rich-guy suit.

165
00:07:24,567 --> 00:07:25,534
So...

166
00:07:25,568 --> 00:07:28,170
you made your money
in business?

167
00:07:28,204 --> 00:07:31,606
Where's your
room, handsome?

168
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,761
Can I at least have that pen?

169
00:07:35,795 --> 00:07:37,262
No, that's
Bellagio property.

170
00:07:37,296 --> 00:07:38,397
Aw.

171
00:07:38,431 --> 00:07:40,265
Well, this sucks.
Hey, I'm gonna go try one

172
00:07:40,299 --> 00:07:41,819
of those slot machines
by the entrance.

173
00:07:41,834 --> 00:07:43,669
They always set
those things to pay out more

174
00:07:43,703 --> 00:07:45,537
so they can lure people
into the casino.

175
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,645
Damn it, Vegas!

176
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,598
Excuse me, where can I find
some smoking Asians?

177
00:07:56,632 --> 00:07:58,500
Oh, everywhere? Okay.

178
00:08:04,006 --> 00:08:08,143
♪ Luck be a lady tonight

179
00:08:10,863 --> 00:08:14,733
♪ Luck be a lady tonight

180
00:08:17,303 --> 00:08:19,854
♪ Luck if you've ever been

181
00:08:19,872 --> 00:08:22,791
♪ A lady to begin with

182
00:08:22,825 --> 00:08:26,912
♪ Luck be a lady tonight

183
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:34,336
♪ Luck let

184
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:39,524
♪ A gentleman see

185
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,993
♪ How nice a dame you can be

186
00:08:50,887 --> 00:08:53,054
Oh, my God, this
place is a dump.

187
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:54,556
Well, let's not be
so quick to judge.

188
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,641
It says here there's
a continental breakfast.

189
00:08:56,676 --> 00:08:58,777
Oh, the continent is Africa.

190
00:08:58,811 --> 00:09:00,251
Stewie, this place
is a complete pit.

191
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:02,047
I mean, doesn't it seem
weird to you that we have

192
00:09:02,081 --> 00:09:03,932
to re-check-in
every 20 minutes?

193
00:09:03,966 --> 00:09:07,702
Also the porn is free, but we
have to watch it in the lobby.

194
00:09:12,024 --> 00:09:13,992
Okay, let's see if we can
turn this trip around.

195
00:09:14,026 --> 00:09:15,393
I'm gonna try some blackjack.

196
00:09:15,428 --> 00:09:16,461
Here, take $40.

197
00:09:16,496 --> 00:09:17,736
I'm gonna go get
some ice cream.

198
00:09:17,764 --> 00:09:19,548
All right, I'll
catch up with you.

199
00:09:19,582 --> 00:09:21,349
Hey there...

200
00:09:21,384 --> 00:09:22,551
Denise.

201
00:09:22,585 --> 00:09:24,553
How you doing today?
I don't know.

202
00:09:24,587 --> 00:09:26,988
I usually have to check
with my boyfriend first.

203
00:09:27,023 --> 00:09:27,989
Oh.

204
00:09:28,024 --> 00:09:29,858
Uh... hit, please.

205
00:09:30,493 --> 00:09:32,527
24? Crap!

206
00:09:32,562 --> 00:09:34,696
Do you know what it's
like to go to the doctor

207
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,731
and see your own foot
in the garbage can?

208
00:09:36,766 --> 00:09:39,100
Okay, you have a good night.

209
00:09:39,168 --> 00:09:41,236
Hey, Stewie, I need
some more money.

210
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,771
I lost it all, Brian!

211
00:09:42,805 --> 00:09:43,772
What?

212
00:09:43,806 --> 00:09:45,807
Well, I was on my way
to get ice cream

213
00:09:45,842 --> 00:09:48,910
and I passed a roulette table,
and I put it all on 16

214
00:09:48,945 --> 00:09:51,112
because of that
Taylor Swift song, "Sixteen."

215
00:09:51,147 --> 00:09:52,481
That song is
called "Fifteen."

216
00:09:52,515 --> 00:09:53,682
It came up 15!

217
00:09:53,716 --> 00:09:55,684
Stewie, that was all
the money I brought.

218
00:09:55,718 --> 00:09:57,686
I knew I should've brought
Peter instead of you.

219
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,321
Oh, come on, you would've
done much worse with him.

220
00:09:59,355 --> 00:10:02,190
He's got a terrible tell.

221
00:10:14,353 --> 00:10:16,054
Any cards, Peter?

222
00:10:16,088 --> 00:10:17,422
No, I'm good.

223
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,444
Oh, this is gonna be great.

224
00:10:22,478 --> 00:10:24,079
I hear she puts on
an amazing show.

225
00:10:24,113 --> 00:10:26,147
She does-- you'll be
amazed that that voice

226
00:10:26,165 --> 00:10:27,866
comes out of that face.

227
00:10:30,753 --> 00:10:32,420
Oh, thank God,
we made it in time.

228
00:10:32,455 --> 00:10:33,588
I didn't realize how far

229
00:10:33,623 --> 00:10:35,357
that awful hotel is
from the Strip.

230
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,926
The woman who cleaned
our room had no ears.

231
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:41,730
I'm sorry,
these tickets are invalid.

232
00:10:41,764 --> 00:10:42,998
What?

233
00:10:43,032 --> 00:10:44,466
It's showing that they've
already been scanned.

234
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,700
I can't let you in.

235
00:10:45,735 --> 00:10:47,736
Oh, this trip has
been a disaster.

236
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,105
I know. I actually thought
I was gonna win big

237
00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:52,240
and get that plastic surgery
I always wanted.

238
00:10:52,275 --> 00:10:53,608
Oh, my God!

239
00:10:53,643 --> 00:10:54,860
Look at him.

240
00:10:54,894 --> 00:10:57,729
He's so cute.

241
00:10:59,198 --> 00:11:01,483
I'm small,
so this is okay.

242
00:11:05,755 --> 00:11:07,105
You know what, screw it.

243
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:09,407
I say we just cut our
losses and fly home.

244
00:11:09,442 --> 00:11:11,793
Yeah, I'm not so sure
about that.

245
00:11:11,827 --> 00:11:12,928
What? Why?

246
00:11:12,962 --> 00:11:14,896
Well, I may have...

247
00:11:14,931 --> 00:11:16,798
And-and you are gonna
laugh about this,

248
00:11:16,832 --> 00:11:18,633
if I know your dark
sense of humor,

249
00:11:18,668 --> 00:11:21,937
but I may have gambled away
our plane tickets.

250
00:11:21,971 --> 00:11:23,838
You what? How do
you even do that?

251
00:11:23,873 --> 00:11:29,961
It's Vegas, Brian.
You can gamble anything.

252
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,164
I'm sorry, it's 31.

253
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:34,232
Ow!

254
00:11:34,267 --> 00:11:35,750
How's it going here?

255
00:11:35,785 --> 00:11:37,819
Not great.
I know what you mean.

256
00:11:37,853 --> 00:11:40,155
We just took a pounding
at the craps table.

257
00:11:40,189 --> 00:11:42,357
Look, why don't we just
call Lois and the fat man?

258
00:11:42,391 --> 00:11:43,375
Maybe they can help us.

259
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:44,609
I don't know about that.

260
00:11:44,644 --> 00:11:46,378
You know that
500 bucks we lost?

261
00:11:46,412 --> 00:11:49,781
I sort of took that from
Lois without asking.

262
00:11:49,815 --> 00:11:51,850
If she finds out it's
all gone, she'll kill me.

263
00:11:51,884 --> 00:11:52,984
Oh.

264
00:11:55,221 --> 00:11:57,489
My buddy's got the inside track.

265
00:11:57,523 --> 00:11:58,757
It's a sure thing.

266
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,825
I like how all your teeth
are different shapes.

267
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,210
Why are you
telling us this?

268
00:12:02,244 --> 00:12:03,578
What do you want from us?

269
00:12:03,596 --> 00:12:05,380
Honestly,
I'm trying to sell my condo,

270
00:12:05,414 --> 00:12:07,616
and I need people to come
to the open house

271
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,284
and talk
about how nice it is.

272
00:12:09,318 --> 00:12:12,404
Wow, the price per square foot
is quite competitive

273
00:12:12,438 --> 00:12:14,205
with similar homes in the area.

274
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,540
Yes, I also love it.

275
00:12:15,574 --> 00:12:17,042
I will likely purchase it

276
00:12:17,076 --> 00:12:19,044
unless others
put in a rival bid.

277
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:20,378
Well, what's stopping you?

278
00:12:20,413 --> 00:12:22,047
You know, you've always been
so noncommittal

279
00:12:22,081 --> 00:12:23,281
in our relationship.

280
00:12:23,316 --> 00:12:25,050
Do know how much
it hurt my feelings

281
00:12:25,084 --> 00:12:27,018
when you paused before
introducing me to your parents?

282
00:12:27,053 --> 00:12:29,821
And it's the same reason you
didn't take that job in Denver.

283
00:12:29,855 --> 00:12:31,723
I'm sorry I didn't mean
to waste your time.

284
00:12:31,757 --> 00:12:34,359
I just remembered my husband
is a total chicken.

285
00:12:34,393 --> 00:12:37,529
I'm not 100% sure
what we're doing any more.

286
00:12:42,568 --> 00:12:45,136
It's like I say, the best
thing you can see in Vegas

287
00:12:45,171 --> 00:12:46,938
is bar, bar, bar.

288
00:12:46,973 --> 00:12:49,674
Yeah, and he's not talking
about slot machines.

289
00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:51,042
Ooh!

290
00:12:51,077 --> 00:12:53,244
Stewie, I'm still not sure
this is a great idea.

291
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,580
Relax, Brian; we're betting
on one basketball game.

292
00:12:55,614 --> 00:12:56,881
That's it.

293
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,150
Then we'll be out of debt
and on our way home.

294
00:12:59,185 --> 00:13:00,485
I suppose.
I just wish

295
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:02,620
we didn't have to borrow money
from a loan shark.

296
00:13:02,655 --> 00:13:04,175
I mean, that guy seemed
pretty serious.

297
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,358
Okay, and just a couple
of remaining items.

298
00:13:06,392 --> 00:13:09,094
Please indicate here
if I look like a schmuck to you.

299
00:13:09,128 --> 00:13:10,729
I'm gonna say no.

300
00:13:10,763 --> 00:13:13,365
Great. Then please check here
and initial there.

301
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:16,067
Uh, next, do you think
this is some kind of game?

302
00:13:16,102 --> 00:13:17,769
Um, no.

303
00:13:17,803 --> 00:13:19,037
Okay, initial, please.

304
00:13:19,071 --> 00:13:20,772
And finally, my date of birth.

305
00:13:27,413 --> 00:13:29,514
And 'll at it for us here

306
00:13:29,548 --> 00:13:31,816
with Duke losing
by just three points.

307
00:13:31,851 --> 00:13:34,753
We... we lost, Brian.

308
00:13:34,787 --> 00:13:36,488
Oh
crap, we're screwed.

309
00:13:37,656 --> 00:13:39,858
Hey, Stewie, give me
$100 from the backpack.

310
00:13:39,892 --> 00:13:41,493
I want to pay a
Wayne Neon look-alike

311
00:13:41,527 --> 00:13:43,061
to beat up a
Rita Rudner look-alike.

312
00:13:43,095 --> 00:13:44,596
I'll give you $1,000.

313
00:13:44,598 --> 00:13:46,631
Pay him to beat up Rita Rudner.

314
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,734
Stewie, we got to get
the hell out of here

315
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:51,049
before that loan shark finds us.

316
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,071
Yes, you're right.

317
00:13:54,073 --> 00:13:55,707
I've got a bad feeling, Brian.

318
00:13:55,741 --> 00:13:57,575
I've got a good
feeling, Brian.

319
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,444
I'm gonna get
me that honey.

320
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,061
I say, Brian,
this backpack feels

321
00:14:08,062 --> 00:14:09,696
a bit lighter
than it did before.

322
00:14:09,731 --> 00:14:11,332
Well, I wasn't gonna
tell you till later,

323
00:14:11,349 --> 00:14:13,300
but I actually used
part of my portion

324
00:14:13,318 --> 00:14:15,569
to take care of some
personal business.

325
00:14:15,603 --> 00:14:18,255
All right, fine.

326
00:14:43,064 --> 00:14:44,514
Hey, boss, it's me.

327
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:46,909
I just spotted those two idiots
who borrowed all that money.

328
00:14:46,935 --> 00:14:48,402
Yeah, well, now they're
strutting around

329
00:14:48,436 --> 00:14:49,887
in flashy suits.

330
00:14:49,921 --> 00:14:52,556
Don't worry; I'll get that
money back no matter what,

331
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,441
and for sure I'm not
gonna stop first

332
00:14:54,475 --> 00:14:56,493
and get some crepes
in the lobby.

333
00:14:56,527 --> 00:14:58,428
Where can I get
some crepes?

334
00:15:03,818 --> 00:15:05,338
Hey, Stewie,
thanks for coming with me.

335
00:15:05,353 --> 00:15:06,937
This really has been
an amazing trip.

336
00:15:06,971 --> 00:15:08,272
Yeah, it's been great.

337
00:15:08,306 --> 00:15:09,690
Um, listen, Brian,

338
00:15:09,724 --> 00:15:11,792
this might be a good
time to tell you, uh,

339
00:15:11,826 --> 00:15:14,928
I invited, um, somebody

340
00:15:14,963 --> 00:15:16,396
to come to the room.

341
00:15:16,431 --> 00:15:17,598
Well, what do you mean?

342
00:15:17,632 --> 00:15:19,633
Oh, that must be him now.

343
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:23,737
Okay, come on, you look nothing
like your picture in the ad.

344
00:15:23,771 --> 00:15:25,155
Shut up and give
me the money!

345
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:26,790
What? What the hell
are you talking about?

346
00:15:26,824 --> 00:15:28,659
Okay, I'm starting to think
you're not Apollo.

347
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:31,061
You bastards think you can
just borrow a bunch of money

348
00:15:31,095 --> 00:15:33,397
from a loan shark and then
waste it on tacky suits?

349
00:15:33,431 --> 00:15:35,499
Tacky?
Sir, I'll have you know

350
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:37,634
I bought this
in the lobby of a casino.

351
00:15:37,669 --> 00:15:38,735
Well, don't shoot.

352
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,304
You must have us confused
with somebody else.

353
00:15:40,338 --> 00:15:42,105
We didn't borrow
any money, I swear.

354
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,358
Sounds like somebody
wants to die.

355
00:15:44,392 --> 00:15:45,659
Aah! No, no!
Stewie,

356
00:15:45,693 --> 00:15:47,060
just give him the money
from the backpack.

357
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:48,561
Okay, okay. Don't shoot.

358
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:50,180
Wha... It's empty.

359
00:15:50,214 --> 00:15:52,115
It's just Cheerios
and coloring books.

360
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,784
What? Where the hell
is the money?

361
00:15:53,818 --> 00:15:55,452
Sir, we can't give you
any money,

362
00:15:55,486 --> 00:15:57,421
but if you've got
some milk and a bowl,

363
00:15:57,455 --> 00:15:59,856
we can give you a pretty
healthy way to start your day.

364
00:15:59,891 --> 00:16:01,058
All right,
enough of this.

365
00:16:01,092 --> 00:16:02,326
You, dog,

366
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,227
pick which one of
you two is gonna die.

367
00:16:04,262 --> 00:16:06,997
What? You can't ask me
to decide something like that.

368
00:16:07,031 --> 00:16:10,334
The life of every being
is sacred, just like the life...

369
00:16:10,368 --> 00:16:11,668
Fine. I'll kill you.

370
00:16:11,703 --> 00:16:13,103
No, no, kill him.
He's a baby.

371
00:16:13,137 --> 00:16:14,604
He-he won't even remember
he was alive.

372
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:15,806
You son of a b...

373
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,175
Aah! Stewie!

374
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:21,094
Now, get us the
money you borrowed.

375
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:23,363
Oh, my God, Stewie, no!

376
00:16:27,835 --> 00:16:29,770
Yeah, I was booked
for three hours

377
00:16:29,804 --> 00:16:31,938
by Archibald Meatpants.

378
00:16:31,973 --> 00:16:34,174
He's... he's dead.

379
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,677
Okay, well, either way,
I'm getting paid,

380
00:16:36,711 --> 00:16:39,229
and somebody's
getting torn open.

381
00:16:42,934 --> 00:16:44,484
What the hell
are we gonna do, Stewie?

382
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,219
We have no money,
no way to get home,

383
00:16:46,254 --> 00:16:48,288
and one of the loan shark's
goons is probably gonna bust

384
00:16:48,322 --> 00:16:50,190
through that door
any minute and kill us both.

385
00:16:50,224 --> 00:16:51,591
I wish my daddy were here.

386
00:16:51,626 --> 00:16:53,427
He always knows what to do.

387
00:16:56,664 --> 00:16:58,365
Oh, son of a bitch.

388
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,733
Well, I better leave a note.

389
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:01,301
It's the right thing to do.

390
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,873
God, I've never felt
so hopeless.

391
00:17:06,908 --> 00:17:08,542
I mean, what are we
supposed to do?

392
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:10,110
Just wait for them
to come kill us?

393
00:17:10,144 --> 00:17:11,478
Well, we could
go on the run.

394
00:17:11,512 --> 00:17:13,513
With what money?
And they'd still find us.

395
00:17:13,548 --> 00:17:15,068
Well, why don't we
just hitchhike home?

396
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,366
Even if we could get
back there,

397
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:18,668
we'd just be putting
the whole family in danger.

398
00:17:18,703 --> 00:17:20,670
I don't see any way
out of this.

399
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:23,407
Well, there is one
thing we could do.

400
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:24,541
What? What's that?

401
00:17:24,575 --> 00:17:27,244
We could go out
on our own terms.

402
00:17:27,278 --> 00:17:28,779
What? You're saying
we should kill ourselves?

403
00:17:28,813 --> 00:17:29,880
Well, think about it.

404
00:17:29,914 --> 00:17:31,074
We're stuck here,
just waiting

405
00:17:31,082 --> 00:17:32,416
for some mobster
to do it.

406
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,451
At least this way,
we can go out together.

407
00:17:34,485 --> 00:17:36,420
But think
about what you're saying.

408
00:17:36,454 --> 00:17:37,854
Brian, we're dead
no matter what.

409
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:39,756
At least this way,
it'll be quick and clean.

410
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,758
Well, not clean for the staff
of the hotel,

411
00:17:41,793 --> 00:17:43,827
but that's not really gonna be
our problem anymore.

412
00:17:43,861 --> 00:17:45,429
I-I don't know.

413
00:17:45,463 --> 00:17:47,497
Look, it's not like we've got
a lot to live for.

414
00:17:47,532 --> 00:17:49,032
I mean, I'm just gonna
end up like Chris,

415
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:51,585
only I'll be smart enough
to realize how miserable I am.

416
00:17:51,619 --> 00:17:53,653
And you've only got
a few good years left anyway,

417
00:17:53,688 --> 00:17:55,822
and that's if we even get
out of here alive.

418
00:17:56,824 --> 00:17:58,558
All right, Stewie.

419
00:17:58,593 --> 00:18:00,794
Let's do it.

420
00:18:00,828 --> 00:18:02,395
Yeah, see, I'm glad
you came around.

421
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,498
You know, the only thing
that was holding me back

422
00:18:04,532 --> 00:18:07,434
even a little is knowing how
much Lois is gonna milk this.

423
00:18:07,468 --> 00:18:11,004
Everyone, I truly want
to thank you for your support

424
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:13,874
and remind you that,
as far as casseroles go,

425
00:18:13,908 --> 00:18:15,008
we're good on pasta,

426
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:17,310
but we could use
some more dessert items.

427
00:18:19,847 --> 00:18:22,015
Oh, I miss my baby so much,

428
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:23,683
and I'm more
of a chocolate person

429
00:18:23,718 --> 00:18:25,819
than a fruit person.

430
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:35,228
Well, this is it.

431
00:18:35,263 --> 00:18:37,063
I guess so.

432
00:18:37,098 --> 00:18:38,732
Count to three?

433
00:18:38,766 --> 00:18:40,400
Yep.

434
00:18:40,434 --> 00:18:42,819
One, two...

435
00:18:42,854 --> 00:18:44,254
Three!
I'm sorry.

436
00:18:44,288 --> 00:18:45,605
I can't. I want to live!

437
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,457
I didn't really think
we were gonna do it.

438
00:18:47,492 --> 00:18:49,793
You dick!

439
00:18:49,827 --> 00:18:51,228
Oh, my God, Brian!

440
00:18:51,262 --> 00:18:52,913
Brian, no!

441
00:18:52,947 --> 00:18:54,464
Good Lord, what have I done?

442
00:18:54,515 --> 00:18:56,416
I better get the hell
out of here.

443
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,001
What the deuce?

444
00:18:58,035 --> 00:19:00,053
Where did this come from?

445
00:19:01,055 --> 00:19:03,423
Well, looks like
Archibald Meatpants

446
00:19:03,457 --> 00:19:05,358
is gonna have a fun night.

447
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,564
One-way to Providence, please.

448
00:19:10,598 --> 00:19:12,883
Yeah, how much to get
to Providence?

449
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:14,317
Brian?

450
00:19:14,352 --> 00:19:16,319
Stewie, what the hell?

451
00:19:16,354 --> 00:19:17,420
But how can you be...

452
00:19:17,455 --> 00:19:18,889
Oh, my God.

453
00:19:18,923 --> 00:19:20,924
C-Could it be?

454
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,659
What the hell is going on?

455
00:19:22,693 --> 00:19:24,528
My teleportation machine worked.

456
00:19:24,562 --> 00:19:26,263
Of course it did;
that's how we got here.

457
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,597
No, that's how
you got here.

458
00:19:27,632 --> 00:19:28,899
I flew.

459
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:31,001
The machine must have
created two pairs of us--

460
00:19:31,035 --> 00:19:32,769
one that was teleported
to Las Vegas

461
00:19:32,803 --> 00:19:33,970
and the other that wasn't.

462
00:19:34,005 --> 00:19:35,639
You're kidding.
That's unbelievable.

463
00:19:35,673 --> 00:19:37,107
I know, it... Wait.

464
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:38,508
Where's the other me?

465
00:19:38,543 --> 00:19:40,577
Oh, um... What?

466
00:19:40,611 --> 00:19:42,612
Where is the Stewie
you came with?

467
00:19:42,647 --> 00:19:46,016
Oh, well, th-these thugs
came to shoot you,

468
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,718
and I tried to throw myself
in front of the bullet,

469
00:19:48,753 --> 00:19:51,421
but it must have gone, like,
under my armpit or something

470
00:19:51,455 --> 00:19:53,356
'cause it-it exploded
your face.

471
00:19:53,391 --> 00:19:54,958
Wait, what about
the other me?

472
00:19:54,992 --> 00:19:56,826
Oh, it was so sad.

473
00:19:56,861 --> 00:19:58,245
You took your own life.

474
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:00,213
I tried like hell to
talk you out of it,

475
00:20:00,248 --> 00:20:01,748
but you jumped
off a balcony.

476
00:20:01,782 --> 00:20:03,483
People keep coming
back every hour

477
00:20:03,517 --> 00:20:04,935
because they think
it's a regular show,

478
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:07,204
like-like the volcano or
the pirate ship thing.

479
00:20:07,238 --> 00:20:08,538
Wow.

480
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:11,174
Well, I-I'm so glad
you're alive.

481
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:12,592
Yeah, same with you.

482
00:20:12,627 --> 00:20:14,594
Well, we should
probably head home.

483
00:20:14,629 --> 00:20:15,795
Definitely.

484
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,881
Um, uh, the only thing is,
I'm a little short.

485
00:20:17,915 --> 00:20:19,549
Is there any chance
you could cover me

486
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:20,450
for the ticket?

487
00:20:20,484 --> 00:20:22,502
Oh, let me see
how much I have.

488
00:20:26,273 --> 00:20:28,708
Good news!
I have just enough.

489
00:20:28,743 --> 00:20:31,177
Now departing for Providence.

490
00:20:31,212 --> 00:20:32,779
Hey, did you guys see <i>O?</i>

491
00:20:32,813 --> 00:20:33,980
No, that seemed lame.

492
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:36,032
You know, the other you
was a lot more fun.

493
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:37,100
Which one is <i>O?</i>

494
00:20:37,134 --> 00:20:38,668
Is that the-the
swimming one?

495
00:20:38,703 --> 00:20:40,537
Don't-don't try to demean it.

496
00:20:40,571 --> 00:20:42,756
How does it feel to be
the least cultured person

497
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,291
at a bus station?

498
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:55,548

499
00:20:58,256 --> 00:20:59,456
Hey.

500
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,674
Hey.
