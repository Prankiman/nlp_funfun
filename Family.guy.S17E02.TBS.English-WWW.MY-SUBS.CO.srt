Hey, who wants to play "Drink the Beer"?

00:00:35,272 --> 00:00:37,239
- Right here.
- Heh. You win!

00:00:37,274 --> 00:00:39,608
- All right! What do I win?
- Another beer!

Okay, all right.

- No, no, no, no. Twist it.
- What? I am.

00:01:10,006 --> 00:01:11,273
Mm-hmm.

28
00:01:11,308 --> 00:01:13,275

Sorry it took us so long
to have dinner together.

00:01:24,454 --> 00:01:26,589
Oh, that's okay. You were busy...

34
00:01:26,623 --> 00:01:28,023
being dead.

35
00:01:31,027 --> 00:01:33,329
Did you warn this guy
when he married you

36
00:01:33,363 --> 00:01:35,564
he also married your friends?

37

Ah-ha-ha-ha!

Oh, Meg, you have to babysit
for Stewie Saturday.

41
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:55,317
- Nope.
- Okay. Chris, you have to do it.

42
00:01:55,352 --> 00:01:56,919
What? That's not fair.

43
00:01:56,953 --> 00:01:59,922
- I have a party to go to.
- Sorry, Meg found pictures

44
00:01:59,956 --> 00:02:02,124
on your father's computer,
and she's blackmailing us.

45
00:02:02,158 --> 00:02:05,261
She can do what she wants
till we get some dirt on her.

46
00:02:05,295 --> 00:02:07,196
I didn't know it was supposed to be hard

47
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,164
before I took the picture.

48
00:02:20,644 --> 00:02:22,511
Oh, hey, Peter. Be with you in a sec.

49
00:02:22,545 --> 00:02:24,680
- I'm burning the place down.
- You got the bedbugs?

50
00:02:24,714 --> 00:02:27,483
That don't make sense. This
isn't the Red Rock Motor Lodge

51
00:02:27,517 --> 00:02:29,184
in Montgomery, Alabama.

52
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:31,020
Please send the lawsuit to our lawyer,

53
00:02:31,054 --> 00:02:32,788
whose address is below.

54
00:02:32,822 --> 00:02:35,357
That's right, she's also a lawyer.

55
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,493
The mystery deepens.

56
00:02:37,527 --> 00:02:39,094
I don't have bedbugs.
I'm burning it down

57
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:40,529
so I can fake my own death.

58
00:02:40,563 --> 00:02:42,197
Can you throw me that white fur coat

59
00:02:42,232 --> 00:02:44,199
- filled with HoneyBaked hams?
- What?

60
00:02:44,234 --> 00:02:46,568
I just... I can't take it, Peter.

61
00:02:46,603 --> 00:02:49,238
I thought I could marry Jess,
but it's awful!

62
00:02:49,272 --> 00:02:50,906
I can't live this way!

63
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,207
Hey, relax. You're married now.

64
00:02:52,242 --> 00:02:54,009
You don't have to worry about nothin'.

65
00:02:54,044 --> 00:02:55,377
Everything's done for you.

66
00:02:55,412 --> 00:02:58,013
I mean, I literally don't know
where socks come from.

67
00:02:58,048 --> 00:02:59,848
No idea. Do they come from trees?

68
00:02:59,883 --> 00:03:01,216
From bushes? I don't know.

69
00:03:01,251 --> 00:03:03,052
Get a hole in one, new pair shows up

70
00:03:03,086 --> 00:03:04,520
in my drawer, just like that.

71
00:03:04,554 --> 00:03:07,556
Food, too. I chucked the mustard
onto the front lawn last week.

72
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,091
That night, back in the fridge.

73
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,626
That <i>would</i> be kind of nice.

74
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,960
Listen, stick with me.

75
00:03:11,995 --> 00:03:13,662
We're gonna have a great adventure,

76
00:03:13,697 --> 00:03:16,732
like the astronaut who thinks
the lowest number is three.

77
00:03:16,766 --> 00:03:19,601
<i>And liftoff in five, four,</i>

78
00:03:19,636 --> 00:03:21,170
<i>- three...
- Whoa!</i>

79
00:03:21,204 --> 00:03:23,172
<i>- two, one...
- Oh.</i>

80
00:03:23,206 --> 00:03:26,108
<i>- liftoff.
- Whoa!</i>

81
00:03:30,213 --> 00:03:31,547
This is our spot, Brian.

82
00:03:31,581 --> 00:03:34,183
A place just for married guys
like you and me.

83
00:03:34,217 --> 00:03:35,551
Husbands Restaurant?

84
00:03:35,585 --> 00:03:37,052
I've never seen this place before.

85
00:03:37,087 --> 00:03:39,054
- Is it new?
- Nope. Been here for 30 years.

86
00:03:39,089 --> 00:03:41,223
You just can't see it
until you get married.

87
00:03:41,257 --> 00:03:42,624
Watch. Take your ring off.

88
00:03:46,596 --> 00:03:48,097
- Wow!
- Wearing the ring

89
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:50,199
also makes you wear giant khaki shorts

90
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:53,369
with a belt and a lot of keys
rattling around in the pockets.

91
00:03:56,473 --> 00:03:58,607
You're right!

92
00:03:58,641 --> 00:04:00,275
What are all these keys for?

93
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,677
A series of sheds.

94
00:04:01,711 --> 00:04:03,712
I got a lot of sheds back home.

95
00:04:03,747 --> 00:04:05,714
Oh. You have more than one shed?

96
00:04:05,749 --> 00:04:07,349
'Course. You always need an extra shed.

97
00:04:07,384 --> 00:04:10,486
I even got one shed that
just has an extra shed in it.

98
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,422
- You guys talking about sheds?
- Hell yes. I love my sheds.

99
00:04:13,456 --> 00:04:15,457
- Me, too.
- High five on sheds.

100
00:04:15,492 --> 00:04:16,725
Sheds!

101
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,293
Sheds...

102
00:04:18,328 --> 00:04:22,131
sheds... sheds... sheds...

103
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:27,770
Are those really Tom Arnold's
sweatpants in that frame?

104
00:04:27,804 --> 00:04:29,838
Yep. That's the Husbands wall of heroes.

105
00:04:29,873 --> 00:04:32,107
There are a lot of fat guys here.

106
00:04:32,142 --> 00:04:33,942
Well, yeah, Brian.
Every man's true weight

107
00:04:33,977 --> 00:04:36,145
is at least 20 pounds heavier
than how they look.

108
00:04:36,179 --> 00:04:38,914
You know how much energy
it takes to hold all that in?

109
00:04:38,948 --> 00:04:40,315
You can finally let go.

110
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,584
Just relax. Exhale for once.

111
00:04:42,619 --> 00:04:44,620
Exhale like you never have to attract

112
00:04:44,654 --> 00:04:46,755
a pretty woman ever again.

113
00:04:52,362 --> 00:04:54,663
Wow, that feels amazing.

114
00:04:54,697 --> 00:04:56,899
Now, let's order some food.
I'm starving.

115
00:04:56,933 --> 00:04:59,334
Nice to meet you, Starving. I'm Brian.

116
00:05:13,116 --> 00:05:16,351
Oh, looks like they really
want me to come to that party.

117
00:05:16,386 --> 00:05:19,488
- We're gonna have to go.
- You... you have a pager?

118
00:05:19,522 --> 00:05:21,323
- Yeah.
- You get paged?

119
00:05:21,357 --> 00:05:23,025
Yeah, that's how a pager works.

120
00:05:23,059 --> 00:05:24,993
Why don't you just get a phone?

121
00:05:25,028 --> 00:05:27,696
Um, you mean one of your
government tracking devices?

122
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,698
No, thanks. I'm using a pager.

123
00:05:29,732 --> 00:05:31,700
"Oh, you're looking at your steps?"

124
00:05:31,734 --> 00:05:34,169
No, the government's
watching where you're going.

125
00:05:34,204 --> 00:05:37,172
It's not nap time, Stewie. Wake up.

126
00:05:37,207 --> 00:05:39,708
All right, we're out of here.

127
00:05:39,742 --> 00:05:41,577
Okay, Stewie's going to the party.

128
00:05:41,611 --> 00:05:44,046
- Yeah, but where's Chris going?
- I have no idea!

129
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,881
He's completely off the grid!

130
00:05:45,915 --> 00:05:48,517
Damn it! He can't hide forever.

131
00:05:51,087 --> 00:05:53,722
Where are you?

132
00:06:02,065 --> 00:06:04,032
Boy, this really is a high school party.

133
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:06,668
Complete with the popular kid
who's clearly going to die

134
00:06:06,703 --> 00:06:08,504
in a car accident tonight.

135
00:06:08,538 --> 00:06:10,672
Hey, Jagger, can you
help out at the soup kitchen

136
00:06:10,707 --> 00:06:13,475
- tomorrow at noon?
- Sure. I should be alive then.

137
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,043
Yeah, he gone.

138
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,846
I see we're smoking.

139
00:06:17,881 --> 00:06:19,681
We're not smoking. We're vaping.

140
00:06:19,716 --> 00:06:22,017
- What's the difference?
- Smoking is for losers.

141
00:06:22,051 --> 00:06:23,819
Vaping is for douchebags.

142
00:06:23,853 --> 00:06:25,821
Aw. I want to be a douchebag.

143
00:06:25,855 --> 00:06:27,689
Do you own 19 hats?

144
00:06:27,724 --> 00:06:31,360
I only have one, but it's a
Stussy hat with a flat brim.

145
00:06:31,394 --> 00:06:32,761
Have a seat.

146
00:06:38,801 --> 00:06:40,869
Whoo-hoo, it's delightful!

147
00:06:40,904 --> 00:06:43,171
Chris! Chris, isn't this cool?

148
00:06:43,206 --> 00:06:46,174
Stewie, don't say my name!
There's an Alexa in here!

149
00:06:47,443 --> 00:06:49,111
Sir, we have eyes on Chris.

150
00:06:49,145 --> 00:06:51,146
He's at a douchebag vaping party.

151
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,117
Sooner or later, they all get sloppy.

152
00:07:01,457 --> 00:07:03,258
I got to say, Bri, the guys at Husbands

153
00:07:03,293 --> 00:07:04,693
are a little worried about you.

154
00:07:04,727 --> 00:07:06,094
They said you had four

155
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:08,130
Scott Peterson
fish sandwiches yesterday.

156
00:07:09,966 --> 00:07:11,400
Fireball?

157
00:07:11,434 --> 00:07:13,702
No, because I'm not a Skidmore freshman

158
00:07:13,736 --> 00:07:15,904
at a Lake George share-house.

159
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:17,806
Or am I?

160
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:21,443
Man, Skidmore's the best!

161
00:07:21,477 --> 00:07:23,478
You said it, Pete. Race you to the raft?

162
00:07:23,513 --> 00:07:24,680
You're on!

163
00:07:24,714 --> 00:07:26,148
Yeah, let's go!

164
00:07:26,182 --> 00:07:28,684
<i>But the water was too shallow.</i>

165
00:07:28,718 --> 00:07:31,286
<i>Bryce broke his neck
and never walked again.</i>

166
00:07:31,321 --> 00:07:33,455
<i>This put an end to off-campus drinking</i>

167
00:07:33,489 --> 00:07:35,290
<i>and lake house rentals.</i>

168
00:07:35,325 --> 00:07:36,491
<i>I was just fine.</i>

169
00:07:36,526 --> 00:07:38,293
<i>I landed on Bryce.</i>

170
00:07:39,996 --> 00:07:41,964
He's starting to smell.

171
00:07:41,998 --> 00:07:43,432
He needs a bath.

172
00:07:43,466 --> 00:07:45,367
He doesn't like baths.

173
00:07:45,401 --> 00:07:48,103
And I see you lost the alcohol argument.

174
00:07:48,137 --> 00:07:49,805
Can't you hear them talking about you?

175
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:52,174
Yeah. I'm a dog, I can hear everything.

176
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:55,143
By the way, the <i>Stranger Things</i>
<i>monster just farted.</i>

177
00:07:55,178 --> 00:07:58,647
Whew! Must have been
that fat chick I ate.

178
00:07:58,681 --> 00:08:01,516
- Time for dinner, guys.
- Awesome. I'm starving.

179
00:08:02,518 --> 00:08:04,319
Oh!

180
00:08:04,354 --> 00:08:05,654
Oh...

181
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:07,356
Holy crap! Brian, you okay?

182
00:08:12,528 --> 00:08:14,229
Keep it down up there!

183
00:08:15,865 --> 00:08:17,933
Holy crap, Hal, what's wrong with you?

184
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:20,202
You love it.

185
00:08:26,701 --> 00:08:27,881
How does it look, Doc?

186
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:30,151
I'm sorry to say you have hip dysplasia.

187
00:08:30,185 --> 00:08:31,652
What's that?

188
00:08:31,687 --> 00:08:33,754
I'm not re what dysplasia is,
but I do know

189
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:36,324
you don't often see a "Y"
that far up in a word.

190
00:08:36,358 --> 00:08:38,259
I took the liberty
of X-raying my own hip

191
00:08:38,293 --> 00:08:40,494
to show you what
a normal one looks like.

192
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:42,963
Why does it look like there's
a Batmobile in your colon?

193
00:08:42,998 --> 00:08:44,465
Just keep your eyes on the hips.

194
00:08:44,499 --> 00:08:45,866
So, what's the next step?

195
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:48,803
I was hoping, whenever the
Bat-Signal goes up in the sky,

196
00:08:48,837 --> 00:08:51,305
- this thing will just drive out.
- Uh, no. For Brian.

197
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,507
Ah. Well, wouldn't hurt
to lose some weight.

198
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:56,344
And he won't be able to walk
until his hip heals.

199
00:08:56,378 --> 00:08:58,512
He'll need someone to take care of him.

200
00:08:58,547 --> 00:08:59,947
I'll take care of him.

201
00:08:59,981 --> 00:09:02,683
Like you took care of me
when <i>I</i> was sick.

202
00:09:02,718 --> 00:09:04,819
Come back in a week,
we can check your pfft-pfft.

203
00:09:04,853 --> 00:09:05,986
What is that?

204
00:09:06,021 --> 00:09:07,788
That's the sound
a blood pressure machine makes.

205
00:09:07,823 --> 00:09:09,857
I do impressions
for the doctor talent show.

206
00:09:09,891 --> 00:09:11,659
Do you know what this is?

207
00:09:11,693 --> 00:09:13,794
Braaap! Braaap!

208
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:15,529
An MRI?

209
00:09:15,564 --> 00:09:18,132
Yes! Adding that to my set.

210
00:09:22,971 --> 00:09:24,505
Oh, my God.

211
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:26,674
- Where there's smoke, there's...
- Just me vaping.

212
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,809
Stewie, if Mom and Dad
see you with that thing,

213
00:09:28,844 --> 00:09:29,977
they'll kill me.

214
00:09:30,011 --> 00:09:31,212
Get rid of it!

215
00:09:31,246 --> 00:09:33,047
No way. It's awesome. Watch this.

216
00:09:39,588 --> 00:09:41,555
I'm not good at the football part.

217
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,557
It smells like raspberry.

218
00:09:43,592 --> 00:09:45,860
Yeah. It's basically the same
as eating fruit.

219
00:09:45,894 --> 00:09:48,929
- Vaping isn't bad for you?
- It can't be bad for you

220
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,998
if Stephen Dorff gave up acting for it.

221
00:09:51,032 --> 00:09:53,567
It does seem like they're
making it for kids.

222
00:09:53,602 --> 00:09:56,337
This flavor is... "baby formula."

223
00:09:56,371 --> 00:09:58,038
Let me try.

224
00:10:00,075 --> 00:10:01,409
Yummy.

225
00:10:01,443 --> 00:10:02,843
Watch this.

226
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:09,183
Like the movie <i>The Ring.</i>

227
00:10:09,217 --> 00:10:10,551
Awesome!

228
00:10:14,256 --> 00:10:15,589
Come back here, you.

229
00:10:16,758 --> 00:10:19,226
Giggity, giggity, crabbity, giggity.

230
00:11:35,637 --> 00:11:37,137
E-liquid, please.

231
00:11:37,172 --> 00:11:39,073
Anything that tastes like
a Fruit Roll-Up.

232
00:11:39,107 --> 00:11:40,274
Good, all good.

233
00:11:40,308 --> 00:11:41,342
- Good.
- All good.

234
00:11:41,376 --> 00:11:42,643
No worries, all good?

235
00:11:42,677 --> 00:11:44,311
- We're good.
- Good, all good.

236
00:11:44,346 --> 00:11:45,346
Here you go.

237
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,480
You good? You all good?

238
00:11:46,515 --> 00:11:47,982
- All good here.
- Yep, we're good.

239
00:11:48,016 --> 00:11:49,950
Good, all good.

240
00:11:49,985 --> 00:11:52,653
This whole vaping thing
was a very smart move.

241
00:11:52,687 --> 00:11:54,955
It tastes great
and I don't feel violently ill

242
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,191
as long as some of this vapor
is in my lungs.

243
00:11:57,225 --> 00:11:59,260
Plus, when you wake at night shaking

244
00:11:59,294 --> 00:12:01,128
because you haven't had any
in three hours,

245
00:12:01,162 --> 00:12:03,230
it's so easy to vape more.

246
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:05,199
Let's face it, this is
the most fun we've had

247
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:08,702
since Mom got hooked on coffee
and bought that Alpuccino maker.

248
00:12:08,737 --> 00:12:12,239
Hoo-ah!

249
00:12:15,844 --> 00:12:18,345
Thank you for having us over for dinner.

250
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,482
Sometimes it's been difficult to cook

251
00:12:21,516 --> 00:12:23,884
with all the other things
I have to do for Brian.

252
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:26,086
Oh, don't listen to her, I'm so easy.

253
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:28,022
I do have to go to the bathroom, though.

254
00:12:30,392 --> 00:12:32,192
Jess really has been amazing.

255
00:12:33,695 --> 00:12:36,230
She even set up surgery for me
to have my hip fixed.

256
00:12:38,266 --> 00:12:40,134
Uhp, don't get fooled.

257
00:12:41,403 --> 00:12:42,870
I don't know what I'd do without her.

258
00:12:42,904 --> 00:12:45,039
I think I've really found true love.

259
00:12:45,073 --> 00:12:47,541
Well, that's lovely.

260
00:12:47,576 --> 00:12:49,677
You know, I don't think
we've said grace yet.

261
00:12:49,711 --> 00:12:51,211
- Oh, yeah.
- Bless us, oh Lord,

262
00:12:51,246 --> 00:12:52,880
for these thy gifts,
which we are about to receive.

263
00:12:52,914 --> 00:12:54,748
Get out of there, Mountain Dew.

264
00:12:58,753 --> 00:13:00,554
I'm here for Brian Griffin.

265
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:01,755
Well, this is it, Jess.

266
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,557
See you after my hip surgery.

267
00:13:03,592 --> 00:13:05,559
He won't be needing this anymore.

268
00:13:05,594 --> 00:13:06,694
Thanks.

269
00:13:06,728 --> 00:13:08,162
Good-bye, Brian.

270
00:13:08,196 --> 00:13:09,930
You mean "see you soon," right?

271
00:13:09,965 --> 00:13:11,565
Wait, why won't I need my collar?

272
00:13:14,636 --> 00:13:16,604
So, what's this?

273
00:13:16,638 --> 00:13:18,238
Kind of like a pre-op?

274
00:13:18,273 --> 00:13:20,107
Are all these dogs having hip surgery?

275
00:13:21,142 --> 00:13:22,576
Where do you think you are?

276
00:13:22,611 --> 00:13:25,212
This isn't a doctor's office,
this is the pound.

277
00:13:25,246 --> 00:13:26,747
You're being euthanized.

278
00:13:26,781 --> 00:13:29,383
What? Jess is having me put down?

279
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:31,752
Oh, my God, this can't be happening!

280
00:13:31,786 --> 00:13:34,355
Did you also eat a kid?

281
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,255
Look, there's been a horrible mistake.

282
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,657
You've got the wrong dog.

283
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:48,359
Says right here I got
to euthanize Brian Griffin,

284
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,161
and you're him.

285
00:13:50,195 --> 00:13:52,397
You wouldn't kill
a singing dog, would you?

286
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,666
<i>Hello, my baby, hello, my honey</i>

287
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,001
<i>Hello, my ragtime gal.</i>

288
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:15,086
Oh, now you're getting
euthanized for sure.

289
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:24,262
Hi, honey.

290
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:26,364
Mommy needs money for scratchers.

291
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:29,767
What the... what kind
of brazen thievery is this?

292
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,371
Where'd you get this?

293
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,373
Chris Griffin! You get in here!

294
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:37,709
What is this?

295
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:39,610
Um... robot penis?

296
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:41,546
Seriously, I'm absolutely
jonesing right now,

297
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,780
so give it back.

298
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,082
I know what this is. I watch Bravo.

299
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:45,450
- I'm not doing it.
- You are too young

300
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:46,884
- to be doing this.
- Maybe it's his and he's just

301
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,252
- too dumb to hide it.
- And if that's not bad enough,

302
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:49,787
you leave it out for Stewie
to get his hands on it?

303
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,923
I don't know, Mom,
I'm not my brother's keeper.

304
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:54,158
- He's just a baby.
- Babies are stupid like that!

305
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:55,426
I'm taking it...

306
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,762
and you are grounded, mister.

307
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:00,398
Now look what you did,
you little son of a bitch.

308
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:01,466
She has my vaporizer.

309
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,734
You have to get it back.

310
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,235
That's your problem.

311
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:06,938
You lost your vape pen,
I didn't lose mine.

312
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:09,674
Well, I guess you win.

313
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,987
Hey.

314
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,403
Oh, tastes so good, like skin berries.

315
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,371
I'm alive with pleasure.

316
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,550
It's possible we've taken this too far.

317
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:55,353
I'll just go down and get yours back.

318
00:15:56,955 --> 00:16:00,024
I will never forget this day.

319
00:16:03,061 --> 00:16:05,229
Mom, I need to talk to you.

320
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,598
Technically, that was not my vape pen,

321
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,701
but I do need it back because
it belongs to a friend of mine.

322
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,537
We accidentally switched jackets,

323
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:15,106
not unlike that episode
of <i>The Brady Bunch</i> when Greg...

324
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,445
Oh, damn it, Chris, why do your
lies have to take so damn long?

325
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,380
You're smoking the vape pen?

326
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,182
No, I'm sneaking a real cigarette

327
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,284
like frustrated mothers
are supposed to do.

328
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,352
You're such a hypocrite!

329
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:29,954
At least vaping is healthy.

330
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:31,522
Oh, don't be an idiot.

331
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:34,025
Vaping is just as bad,
and you look like a douchebag.

332
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,327
No, I don't. I look cool.

333
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:37,962
Go ahead.

334
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:39,530
Hold it to your mouth.

335
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:45,603
Oh, my God, I'm a douchebag.

336
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,007
It's okay, Chris.

337
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,876
Your secret's safe with me.

338
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:07,191
Hey, what's up, Jess?

339
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,693
I came to see how Brian's...

340
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,094
Hoo-ah!

341
00:17:10,128 --> 00:17:12,129
Sorry, I'm just making an Alpuccino.

342
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,498
Oh.

343
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,765
Well, anyway, I was just wondering...

344
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,367
Hoo-ah!

345
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:18,035
Sorry, my mom wanted one, too.

346
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,403
Oh, that's-that's fine.

347
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,038
- So is Brian...
- Can I get you one?

348
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,139
Uh, sure.

349
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,374
Is Brian going to, uh...

350
00:17:23,408 --> 00:17:24,909
Hoo-ah!

351
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:26,244
When is Brian coming back?

352
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:27,378
Oh, never.

353
00:17:27,412 --> 00:17:28,713
I'm having him euthanized.

354
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:30,081
Euthanized?

355
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,449
Oh, my God!

356
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:39,690
Come on, come on.

357
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,971
Euthanize, euthanize, euthanize...

358
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,476
Oh, my God!

359
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,011
I got to do something!

360
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,553
Damn it. Now I have to do that
with every dictionary here.

361
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,788
Hold on, Brian, hold on.

362
00:18:16,461 --> 00:18:18,396
Don't worry, buddy. I'm on my way.

363
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:30,408
I'm warning you, if you kill me,
the Internet's gonna freak out.

364
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,448
Please, it can't end like this.

365
00:18:37,482 --> 00:18:39,116
There has to be something I can do.

366
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,018
Well, for 200 bucks, I'll strangle you

367
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:44,255
with my bare hands and stare
into your eyes as you die.

368
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,157
What? I'm not paying for that.

369
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:47,758
I meant I'll pay you.

370
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,794
Stop! That's my dog!

371
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:51,162
Oh, Peter, thank God.

372
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,730
You got here just in time.

373
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:54,865
You want to make $200?

374
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,133
I do.

375
00:18:56,168 --> 00:19:00,538
It's... beautiful.

376
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,609
What the hell are you doing here?

377
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,043
Brian, I can explain.

378
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,512
Explain what? How you brought me
here to have me killed?

379
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:09,847
Well, you're no better.

380
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:11,515
You could have saved my life
in the restaurant,

381
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,417
but you let me choke to death.

382
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,853
Okay, fine.
I probably could have done more

383
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:17,188
to save your life.

384
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:19,357
I was just so unhappy
being married, I...

385
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:23,027
I guess I felt letting you Che
was my only way out.

386
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:24,328
God, that sounds awful.

387
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:25,763
Maybe I did deserve to die.

388
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:28,399
W-Well, and I should've kept
taking care of you,

389
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,868
instead of bringing you here
to have you killed.

390
00:19:30,902 --> 00:19:34,772
Maybe I deserve to be
with someone who let me die.

391
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:38,009
Maybe we deserve each other.

392
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:40,544
It does seem like we're meant
for each other.

393
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:44,048
I mean, gosh, maybe that's what
true marriage is...

394
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:46,150
two people who want each other to die.

395
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:47,818
Now you're getting it.

396
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,454
So much beauty.

397
00:19:55,434 --> 00:19:57,633
Oh, Brian, I'm sorry that Jess died

398
00:19:57,635 --> 00:19:58,935
during the commercial break,

399
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:01,338
but it was a very nice funeral service.

400
00:20:01,372 --> 00:20:03,306
Yeah, it's sad.

401
00:20:03,341 --> 00:20:06,509
She was the love of my life,
my heart, my...

402
00:20:06,544 --> 00:20:07,577
Hoo-ah!

403
00:20:07,612 --> 00:20:10,680
I took that from her apartment.

404
00:20:10,715 --> 00:20:13,183
So, Chris, I hear
you been doing some vaping.

405
00:20:13,217 --> 00:20:14,651
So douchey.

406
00:20:14,685 --> 00:20:16,386
Mom, you told him?

407
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,588
- We had a deal.
- Thanks a lot, Peter.

408
00:20:18,623 --> 00:20:20,357
You promised you wouldn't say anything.

409
00:20:20,391 --> 00:20:21,992
Oh, I'm supposed to keep your secret

410
00:20:22,026 --> 00:20:23,994
after you lied to me
about sneaking cigarettes?

411
00:20:24,028 --> 00:20:26,496
What the hell, Chris? You told him, too?

412
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,632
- No, I didn't.
- Brian told me.

413
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:31,134
Are you serious, Peter? You said
you wouldn't say anything.

414
00:20:31,168 --> 00:20:32,702
I promised Meg I wouldn't tell anyone.

415
00:20:32,737 --> 00:20:34,871
Oh, good job with that, dick.

416
00:20:34,905 --> 00:20:36,706
Chris, the only reason I told him

417
00:20:36,741 --> 00:20:38,475
was he promised he'd keep
his mouth shut.

418
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:40,010
Oh, nice job, Chris.

419
00:20:40,044 --> 00:20:41,411
I should've known not to trust someone

420
00:20:41,445 --> 00:20:42,879
who kisses his own brother.

421
00:20:42,913 --> 00:20:44,814
What? Wh-Who told you that?

422
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:46,783
- Don't look at me.
- Meg told me.

423
00:20:46,817 --> 00:20:49,819
How does it feel, Meg,
you frigging town crier?

424
00:20:49,854 --> 00:20:51,921
<i>- You're such a bitch.
- She's a bitch?</i>

425
00:20:51,956 --> 00:20:54,090
<i>Meg, you said you
wouldn't tell Stewie's secret.</i>

426
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,558
Stewie, you told Dad?

427
00:20:55,593 --> 00:20:57,060
I had to get it off my chest.

428
00:20:57,094 --> 00:20:58,395
I didn't think he'd understand me.

429
00:20:58,429 --> 00:21:00,930
I understand pieces now and then.

430
