00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,580
- Hi, I'm Brian Griffin.
- I'm Stewart.-

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:08,420
Many of you have written in
with suggestions for episodes.

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,880
They're mostly God-awful.

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,300
Well, we've produced
three of our favourite suggestions.

6
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,390
Favourites? That's charitable.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,600
What is that?

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,940
- It's from Dharma and Greg.
- I'm surprised it still works.

9
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,440
- Whoa!
- Enjoy.

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,280
"It seems today that all you see

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,620
"Is violence in movies and sex on TV

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,370
"But where are those
good old-fashioned values

13
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,420
"On which we used to rely?

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,630
"Lucky there's a family guy

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,630
"Lucky there's a man who positively
can do all the things that make us

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,300
"Laugh and cry

17
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:54,640
"He's a family guy

18
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,820
Now back to "The Newlywed Game".

19
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,870
Carol, how did Nick answer the following:

20
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,200
"The last thing I would ever
give my wife is... blank"?

21
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,580
A little spending money?

22
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,840
Sorry, that's incorrect. Nick actually said

23
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,380
"the antidote".

24
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,550
- Nick, what are you talking abou...?
- Oh, Meg, you were right.

25
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:31,020
- Oh, my God! A genie!
- I am here to grant you three wishes.

26
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,600
- Peter, three wishes! This is so exciting!
- I want a new hat!

27
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,230
- I want a new hat!
- I want them to have new hats!

28
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,990
Kids, these are your father's wishes.
Get whatever you want.

29
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,950
That's easy. I wish I could see
what Kelly Ripa was like off the set.

30
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,120
So it shall be.

31
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,870
- Great show today, Kelly.
- Thanks. You, too.

32
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,970
Gelman needs us onstage
for a couple of reshoots.

33
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,550
Be right there. I have to put on my face.

34
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,220
Did you see the size of that dressing room?

35
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,140
- They must really want to keep her.
- Your second wish?

36
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:14,110
I gotjust the thing.
I wish I had my own theme music.

37
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,570
Done!

38
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,700
- I don't hear anything.
- Get up. Try it out.

39
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,630
Sweet!

40
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,750
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah!

41
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,300
Hey, wanna turn that stuff down?

42
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,140
Come on, that's classic travelling music.
Try to enjoy it.

43
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,970
"Riding on a bus, riding on a bus,
sitting next to bums

44
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,850
"There's an open seat, hope that isn't pee

45
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:24,690
- I'm sick of hearing it!
- I'm sorry, buddy, I can't turn it off.

46
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,610
Then I'm gonna break
every bone in your body.

47
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,530
- I wish I had no bones!
- Done.

48
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,160
That ought to show you!

49
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:43,380
Oh, no. I gotta fart,
but I don't know which way to lean.

50
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:49,300
I know you might be a little concerned
about me not having bones,

51
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,590
but I gotta tell you, it's not that bad.

52
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,800
Dad's just like Silly Putty.

53
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,640
Look what I can do to Mary Worth's
smug sense of self-satisfaction.

54
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,690
That's right, son. Take her down a peg.

55
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,480
I guess we could all adjust to this.

56
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,240
- Look! I'm making an angel!
- See? Everything's gonna be fine.

57
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,860
Now smile while I write
my name in you.

58
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,370
Argh! Argh!

59
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,880
Let go!

60
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,720
Aagh!

61
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,980
But, Mom, I've got to
use the bathroom now!

62
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,730
Your father gets incredibly filthy
rolling around everywhere.

63
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,700
- He has to take 12 baths a day.
- I don't like Dad any more.

64
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,910
I invited some friends over
to jump on him like a trampoline,

65
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,740
but his roll of fat sucked up Ryan's shoe

66
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,830
and his mom yelled at him
when he got home

67
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:57,000
and he beat me up at school the next day!
It's all here in this pamphlet.

68
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,260
We have to learn to accept this,
like one of those stories on Dateline

69
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:06,470
where a family member suffers a horrible
accident and is a burden on everybody.

70
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,640
They pretend to be happy,
but they're dead inside. They're dead.

71
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,940
And that'll be our lives, hm?

72
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,650
What a big, boneless jerk I am.

73
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:20,150
I might've screwed up my life but there's
no reason to keep screwing up theirs.

74
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,950
Goodbye, cruel bone-filled world!

75
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,000
Oh, so this is where
all the waste and sewage winds up.

76
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,380
Aaaargh!

77
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,930
Cut and print. That's a wrap.
Greatjob, Peter.

78
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,520
- Coming to the wrap party?
- I don't know.

79
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,980
I got a stand-up comedy class
at The Learning Annex.

80
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:54,860
Actually, I won't be a stand-up comic.
I'll be more like an amorphous-blob comic.

81
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,070
- I gotta write that down.
- Nonsense!

82
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:00,820
I'll have the studio send a flatbed for you!
See you at eight!

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,710
There's something
I've wanted to say all evening.

84
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,420
What's that,
Mrs Catherine Zeta-Jones Douglas?

85
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:19,600
- I want to jump your non-bones.
- Jeez, I can't believe I'm your type.

86
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,770
As you can tell from my husband,
I've got a thing for saggy, shapeless men.

87
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,520
I'm married to Catherine Zeta-Jones.
Will you sleep with me?

88
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,060
I'll have to pass.

89
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:34,700
But Louie Anderson's eating the decorative
soaps in the bathroom. Why not try him?

90
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,080
- Aren't you Peter, the human stunt bag?
- That depends on who's asking.

91
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,160
I'm a doctor doing an experimental procedure
to give bones to ajellyfish,

92
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,750
but I'd like to try it on a human. Interested?

93
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,540
- I don't know.
- Interested?

94
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,920
Didn't you just say that? I'll do it!

95
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,890
The operation was a complete success!
What are you going to do now?

96
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,640
I had the operation
so I could go back to my family.

97
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,440
It's been so long.
What if they don't love me any more?

98
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,360
Where do you think
all those bones came from?

99
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,360
- Surprise!
- My God!

100
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,490
You mean it's your bones that are inside me?

101
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,280
Mostly. We picked up
a drifter to fill in the torso.

102
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:17,870
Like I always say, a family of freaks
is better than no family at all!

103
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:23,000
Let's go home! You know what's weird?
This was covered by my HMO.

104
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,730
You dare me to pop a wheelie in this thing?

105
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:41,560
That doesn't sound safe at all.
OK, I dare you.

106
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,700
Wow! That was great!

107
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,540
Six! Six bats.

108
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,250
Seven! Seven bats!

109
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,590
- Is the Count a vampire?
- What's that?

110
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:06,800
Those big fangs. Have they ever shown him
do somebody in, then feed on him?

111
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,300
You're asking if they've
done a Sesame Street

112
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:13,270
in which the Count kills somebody,
then sucks their blood for sustenance?

113
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,810
- Yeah.
- No.

114
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,020
There's something out in the yard!

115
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:23,990
- It looks like the back of a tanker truck.
- Wow! What do you think's inside?

116
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,990
- Maybe it's candy!
- Chris, no!

117
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,490
Lois, Lois. Let him dream.

118
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,040
- Eugh! What is this stuff?
- It's some kind of nuclear waste.

119
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:38,300
Dear me.
Does anyone else feel a trifle queasy?

120
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,840
What? Do I have a boogie? I say!

121
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,050
It appears my cranium has doubled in size!

122
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:53,310
How delightful! This toxic stew seems
to have given me telekinetic abilities!

123
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,990
Hey! I can make fire!

124
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,200
Come here a second.
This is gonna be hilarious.

125
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,000
OK, on the count of three. One, two, three...

126
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,710
Do it again!

127
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:17,090
All right. Clearly something
very strange has happened here.

128
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:20,430
We've each acquired superpowers
from that nuclear waste.

129
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:24,890
We've been given a gift.
Whether that gift is Chris's fire conjuring,

130
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,230
Stewie's telekinesis, Brian's superspeed...

131
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,310
- Ask how the queen of England is.
- How's...

132
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,440
- She's great.
... Peter's morphing ability...

133
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,940
Hey, Lois, I'm a wishing troll.

134
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,620
...my superstrength,

135
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:44,700
or Meg's, um... super-amazing
ability to grow her fingernails,

136
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:51,590
we must to use these powers properly
and not abuse them for personal gain.

137
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:52,760
- Understand?
- Yes.

138
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,630
- Mm-hm.
- Got it.

139
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:03,180
Oh, no. I forgot the detergent. Excuse me,
would you watch him for a moment?

140
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,140
Sure thing, ma'am.

141
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,440
Whoa there, little guy. You gotta pay for that.

142
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,860
Go suck a railroad spike. I have no money.

143
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,700
Then I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to take it away from you.

144
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,320
Argh! Argh! Argh!

145
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,240
Oh, God! Please help me!

146
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,290
Move it, you slowpoke, the light's green!

147
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:30,510
What does that cloud look like to you,
honey? To me it looks like... rain.

148
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,640
I used thatjoke at work today.
I'm the funniest guy at the office.

149
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,470
- They say I should do stand-up.
- Oh! This is insane!

150
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,530
Oh, my God, *NSync is in town.
If you get me a lock of Justin's hair,

151
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:54,160
I'll never ask you
for shopping money again. Please?!

152
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,410
We promised Lois
we'd use our powers responsibly.

153
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,420
I suppose doing the exact opposite
couldn't hurt.

154
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:10,640
- Hey, do you want to split a Toblerone?
- Oh, gosh! Yeah. I think I do.

155
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,560
Whoo-whoo! Next stop, my thighs!

156
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,060
All right, Meg, wait here. I'll be right back.

157
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,860
Hi. Britney Spears. You mind if I go in?

158
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,900
- Oh, not at all, Miss Spears.
- Oh, call me Peter.

159
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,030
- Hey, fellas.
- Britney? What are you doing here?

160
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:30,870
I was in the neighbourhood -
I'm gonna steal one of your beers -

161
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,290
and I figured I'd stop by and say hi.

162
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,370
You mind if I have a seat?

163
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,670
- I am out of shape. I got a favour to ask you.
- What is it?

164
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,510
I got a hole in my car's muffler.
I need to plug it.

165
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,880
- Can I have some of your hair?
- I guess so.

166
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:50,060
Oh, great. Thanks. All right, hold still now.

167
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,600
You'll be fine. Give me a kiss.

168
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:59,570
- Agh!
- I'm Gene Shalit now! Bye!

169
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,740
- Here's your martini.
- Thanks.

170
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,580
- Hey, it's gone!
- I'm sorry, ma'am. Here's another one.

171
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,000
What the hell is going on here?

172
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,250
Hi. Can I get some pretzels or something?
I gotta drive.

173
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:20,630
Hey, did you bring enough breasts
for the rest of the class?

174
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,310
Hector, how long have we known each other?

175
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,680
- Since first grade.
- Yeah. Yeah.

176
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,940
You remember that time
you called me "Chris Gristle"?

177
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,860
- I think so.
- Well, burn for it!

178
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:45,450
It's a bird, it's a plane,
it's a lower-middle-class Irish family.

179
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,580
This is just one of
many public disturbances

180
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,960
caused by the Griffin family of Quahog,
who seem to have acquired superpowers.

181
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,510
Very strange story, Diane.
Coming up next: Can bees think?

182
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:59,300
A new study confirms that no, they cannot.

183
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,680
Citizens of Quahog, we have a problem!

184
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:06,100
You're damn right! Peter stole my hair!

185
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,770
- Settle down, Jeffrey!
- Justin.

186
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:11,820
Mike. Clearly the Griffin family
is out of control, but not to fear.

187
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,570
I've tangled with superbeings before.
They can be stopped!

188
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:20,910
You can't stop us, Mayor West!
We are all-powerful!

189
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,910
Clearly you've let yourselves
become drunk with power.

190
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,920
Silence!

191
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,920
- We demand obedience!
- Or else!

192
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,590
Is that all you can do?
Ow! That kinda hurt!

193
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,930
Is that bleeding?
I guess it's all right. Ouch, though!

194
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:39,260
Anyone who opposes our demands
will be destroyed!

195
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:43,020
Our first demand:
You will erect a statue in the town square.

196
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,270
It will depict Blair Warner admitting to
Mrs Garrett that the poem she submitted

197
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,990
for her creative writing class was
plagiarised from a work by Emily Dickinson.

198
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,490
We have spoken! Agh!

199
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,290
That's it! We have to fight fire with fire.

200
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:03,750
If nuclear refuse gave them superpowers,
it could do the same for me.

201
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:08,260
Citizens, I'm off to the toxic waste dump!

202
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,520
- Mayor West, you have lymphoma.
- Oh, my!

203
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,230
Probably from rolling around in toxic waste.

204
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,360
- I see.
- What were you trying to prove?

205
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,820
- I was trying to gain superpowers.
- That's just silly.

206
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,820
Silly, yes. Idiotic, yes.

207
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:39,210
No, no! That's not what Mrs Garrett's
bosom looked like. It looked more like this.

208
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,040
Notice the sun spots
at the top of the right can.

209
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:45,380
Excuse me. I have a message
from the Quahog hospital.

210
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:53,310
- I just feel awful about this, Mayor West.
- Yeah. Me, too. Stewie, fluff his pillows.

211
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:56,100
I'll heat up his soup.

212
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,810
I'll go to China to see if there's a cure.
Nope.

213
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,940
Now, now. The doctor says I'll make
a full recovery. But you learned your lesson.

214
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:07,570
I can't believe we let those superpowers
go to our heads.

215
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,620
- I feel like such a bastard.
- Me, too.

216
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,750
For now, we'll use our powers
to help you get better.

217
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:19,590
Thank you. As long as I have Mrs Garrett's
giant rack by my bedside, I'll be all right.

218
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,380
Girls! Girls! Girls!

219
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:42,820
Hear ye, hear ye. I call to order the
first meeting of the We Hate Broads Club.

220
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,370
- Yeah!
- Cos all you need in life is your best pals.

221
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:50,120
- Sure! As long as those pals ain't dames!
- O-tay!

222
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,750
What was that?

223
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,750
Hey! We told you guys
to quit snooping around here!

224
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,220
We need to find a story
if I'm ever gonna be a big-time reporter.

225
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:04,930
All right, make like Siamese twins
and split... and then one of you die.

226
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,270
When do we have the grape juice?
I came for grape juice.

227
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:14,230
Hey, Quagmire, watch this.

228
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:16,820
Hey, "kick me"!

229
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:23,280
We have a new studentjoining us this
morning. Her name is Lois Pewterschmidt.

230
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,750
- Ugh! Just what we need, another girl.
- You said it!

231
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,420
Wow! I'd like to play doctor with her!

232
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:35,380
And remove her inflamed appendix
before it bursts, causing sepsis.

233
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:38,930
Giggidy-giggidy-giggidy!

234
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:43,220
- What you reading?
- The Red Badge of Courage.

235
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:47,270
I sure wish I could meet a brave fella
like the guy in this book.

236
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:52,190
- You know, I'm a brave guy, Lois.
- You're not brave enough to laugh at death!

237
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,150
Watch me!

238
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,490
Thanks! Like I don't have
enough trouble fitting in!

239
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,910
You're not brave enough
to take your clothes off!

240
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,790
Way ahead of you. Oh!

241
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:05,750
I bet you're too chicken
to spend a night at the old Selberg place.

242
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:11,260
- Cleveland, mind stepping out of the way?
- Oh, sorry.

243
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,140
I ain't chicken to spend the night!

244
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,350
I ain't neither!
To prove it, I'll go up there tonight!

245
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,390
- See you there, pal!
- You can't stay in that house!

246
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,980
Old man Selberg's ghost still haunts it.

247
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,820
Not to mention the myriad
of bacteria and allergens

248
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,860
from years of substandard housekeeping.
It does not augur well for you.

249
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:34,530
Aw, zip it, egghead.
You with your big words and your...

250
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,450
and your small difficult words.

251
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,660
Wow! Any boy who would
spend the night in that creepy place

252
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,580
sure would be the bravest fella I ever met.

253
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:46,300
That Lois is some kind of woman.

254
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,050
Yeah. Just thinking about her
makes my testicles want to drop.

255
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,760
Oops, speak of the devil.
Ooh. Make that devils.

256
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:05,280
Quagmire's team takes the left side of the
house and Peter's team will take the right.

257
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,200
Whoever's alive in the morning
can bury his dead pals.

258
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,540
Do I have a cobweb in my hair?
It feels like I have a cobweb in my hair.

259
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:22,170
- What was that?
- Michael Winslow from Police Academy.

260
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,190
- This house gives me the creeps.
- Yeah, let's get out of here.

261
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,900
Wait, wait. We can't let those guys win.

262
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,610
- We ought to pretend we're ghosts, see?
- Then we'll scare the other guys out...

263
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,410
We say we spent the night
and everyone thinks

264
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:51,370
we're the bravest kids in the world.
Especially Lois.

265
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,660
All right!

266
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,920
Hey, I got a great idea!

267
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,300
This'll really scare them. Everybody set?

268
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,890
- Check!
- Check!

269
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,760
Sock it to me!

270
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,320
If we had a teacup, this would be like
playing find the teacup in the bedsheet,

271
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,400
like I do with my Aunt Sophia.

272
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,710
Aaaagh!

273
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,960
My God! Not only are ghosts real,
but their innards are made of children.

274
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,090
It's us!

275
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,300
Whoo-oo-oo!

276
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,970
- That's a nice effect!
- Yeah, that's really scary,

277
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,440
Wait a second. If you're there, and I'm here,

278
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,270
and Istanbul is in this general area,
then who the hell is that?

279
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,620
Ha! Get used to this sight, Diane:
Guys running away from you.

280
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,960
You're so deep in the closet
you're finding Christmas presents.

281
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:12,920
Remember our story:
We tell Lois we both stayed all night.

282
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,130
And I caught the ghost with my lasso.

283
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:18,550
I punched him so hard
he ran crying all the way back to hell!

284
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,680
She'll have to believe that.
It hangs together perfectly.

285
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,980
Our top story: Cowardly kids
lay down rubber at the old Selberg place.

286
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,100
Turn that up.

287
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:30,020
Peter Griffin and Glen Quagmire
were seen bolting

288
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:34,200
out of the supposedly haunted house
after one half-hour,

289
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,660
leaving only their pride
and twin trails of urine behind them.

290
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,870
Cheese and crackers!
Now Lois'll know everything!

291
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,540
Not if I can help it!

292
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,710
- Newsroom.
- This is Peter Griffin.

293
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,760
Stop saying that stuff
or we'll watch something else!

294
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,510
Today on The View:
Cooties, the silent killer.

295
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,220
Lois, there's something we gotta tell you.

296
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:03,190
Yeah. We didn't stay in the haunted house.
We're not brave.

297
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:07,150
- I've decided I don't care about bravery.
- You don't?

298
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:11,450
No. I realised what I really like is smarts.

299
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,990
Sorry I'm late, darling.
I was checking my stool for blood.

300
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,580
- Mort Goldman!
- He's so clever! Show 'em, Morty!

301
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,420
Whoo-oo-oo!

302
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,640
He got us again!

303
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,970
This just shows that
women are nothing but trouble!

304
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,980
You said it! Let's you and me
swear off 'em for good!

305
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,440
And how!

306
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:45,650
Quagmire, it seems to me we've each
made another 500 million dollars.

307
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:50,450
Good thing we swore off women
so we could accumulate this vast wealth.

308
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:53,870
Watch the ticker. I'll go microwave
a bagel and have sex with it.

309
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,750
Butter's in the fridge!
