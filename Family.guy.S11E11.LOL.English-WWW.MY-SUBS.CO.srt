Hey, why do you have a

36
00:01:31,038 --> 00:01:32,989
I pulled over some
punk Harvard kid

37
00:01:33,024 --> 00:01:35,458
who gave me a bunch of
lip, so I took his I.D.

38
00:01:35,493 --> 00:01:38,244
Man, I bet they got fancy food
up there at Harvard.

39
00:01:38,279 --> 00:01:40,163
Like them turkeys
with paper shoes.

Or pigs with apples
in their mouths.

41
00:01:42,016 --> 00:01:44,434
Or them lambs what ain't never
seen the light before.

42
00:01:44,468 --> 00:01:46,403
Oh, yeah, I love
eating food that's sad.

43

Hey, you know,
we should drive up there

to eat for free.

Tonight, I want to go out

And not one
of these campus bars.

68
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:55,288
I want to get wrecked

Helen, you're
outrageous.

It's fun, Lois!
It's whimsical!

84

It's ridiculous!

85
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:35,712

No.

midterm.

95

I thought of it first.

00:06:57,564 --> 00:06:59,098
Aw, aw, damn it.

160
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:00,500
I guess we're not going.

161
00:07:00,551 --> 00:07:02,185
Hey, Stewie,
here's five bucks.

162
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:03,419
Get naked.

163
00:07:10,044 --> 00:07:11,678
This... this can't be possible!

164
00:07:11,713 --> 00:07:13,413
I can't be married
to a prostitute!

165
00:07:13,448 --> 00:07:15,349
Where will you two be going
on your scummymoon?

166
00:07:15,383 --> 00:07:17,451
And can I plan your
bridal golden shower?

167
00:07:17,485 --> 00:07:18,719
I don't even know your name!

168
00:07:18,753 --> 00:07:20,988
It's Charmese.
Perfect.

169
00:07:21,022 --> 00:07:23,790
Listen, Charmese, I was
obviously very, very drunk.

170
00:07:23,825 --> 00:07:25,325
This whole thing
is a huge mistake.

171
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,960
Now, we got to
fix this right away.

172
00:07:26,995 --> 00:07:28,862
Like hell we do,
sweet cream.

173
00:07:28,897 --> 00:07:30,797
This is just what
I've always wanted:

174
00:07:30,832 --> 00:07:32,499
to settle down,
find a husband

175
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:33,934
and live the
married life.

176
00:07:33,968 --> 00:07:36,036
And now I got that.

177
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,771
Your new wife
is a human toilet.

178
00:07:37,805 --> 00:07:40,057
Look, I don't remember
anything about last night.

179
00:07:40,091 --> 00:07:42,025
How do I... how do I even know
we're really married?

180
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,328
I got our marriage certificate
right here.

181
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,530
It's legit.

182
00:07:46,564 --> 00:07:48,515
And it looks like I signed
one of the witness lines

183
00:07:48,549 --> 00:07:50,350
and Peter partially signed
the other.

184
00:07:51,452 --> 00:07:52,452
Joe, look.

185
00:07:57,008 --> 00:08:00,127
You know, after 40 years
in my line of work,

186
00:08:00,161 --> 00:08:02,562
I've learned the difference
between true love

187
00:08:02,597 --> 00:08:05,248
and doing the entire bowling
team of a pizza restaurant

188
00:08:05,283 --> 00:08:06,850
on a box spring by a brook.

189
00:08:06,884 --> 00:08:08,752
This is true love.

190
00:08:08,786 --> 00:08:10,821
Hey, what's our
last name again?

191
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,693
You know, Quagmire,
I was thinking last night,

192
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:20,163
I might remember Charmese
from a stag party in 1991.

193
00:08:20,198 --> 00:08:22,165
Ask her if she remembers
getting hit in the forehead

194
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,400
with a meatball sandwich.

195
00:08:23,434 --> 00:08:25,135
You guys, I can't
stay married to her.

196
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:27,404
This whole thing
is a complete disaster!

197
00:08:27,438 --> 00:08:28,522
In fact, you know what?

198
00:08:28,556 --> 00:08:30,276
I got to go down
to the courthouse right now

199
00:08:30,308 --> 00:08:31,408
and file for divorce.

200
00:08:31,442 --> 00:08:32,843
This thing ends now.

201
00:08:32,877 --> 00:08:34,227
Hang on,
Quagmire.

202
00:08:34,262 --> 00:08:35,662
I'm not sure
that's a good idea.

203
00:08:35,697 --> 00:08:39,299
Quahog has some extremely
draconian laws governing divorce

204
00:08:39,334 --> 00:08:41,201
that all heavily
favor the woman.

205
00:08:41,235 --> 00:08:42,235
What? What do you mean?

206
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,236
Well, to be honest,

207
00:08:43,271 --> 00:08:44,438
if you divorce her,

208
00:08:44,472 --> 00:08:46,606
she'll probably get
everything you have.

209
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:48,208
What? No,
that's impossible!

210
00:08:48,242 --> 00:08:49,910
I can't lose all
my money and my house!

211
00:08:49,944 --> 00:08:51,378
Then I'll have
to move into some

212
00:08:51,412 --> 00:08:53,380
depressing divorced
guy apartment!

213
00:08:53,414 --> 00:08:54,815
As you can see,
we have plenty

214
00:08:54,849 --> 00:08:56,149
of cabinet space
for your plate.

215
00:08:56,184 --> 00:08:57,985
The oven, of course,
is just decorative.

216
00:08:58,019 --> 00:08:59,319
Seems okay.

217
00:08:59,354 --> 00:09:00,834
Do you have any other
units available?

218
00:09:00,855 --> 00:09:02,089
This is our only one.

219
00:09:02,123 --> 00:09:04,358
I hope you're happy, Marsha!

220
00:09:04,392 --> 00:09:06,426
We might have
something upstairs.

221
00:09:06,461 --> 00:09:07,561
Sorry, Quagmire,

222
00:09:07,595 --> 00:09:08,895
but the only way
around the law

223
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,530
is if the woman
consents to a divorce.

224
00:09:10,565 --> 00:09:11,832
Consent?

225
00:09:11,866 --> 00:09:13,300
But Charmese will
never agree to that.

226
00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:15,635
You heard her, the crazy skank
wants to be a wife.

227
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,803
She's found
herself a husband

228
00:09:16,838 --> 00:09:17,804
and she's not
letting go.

229
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,239
I bet she's what happens

230
00:09:19,273 --> 00:09:21,375
if you put a Hooters girl
in the microwave on "high."

231
00:09:21,409 --> 00:09:22,509
Well, the only
other choice

232
00:09:22,543 --> 00:09:24,111
is to let her take
all your money.

233
00:09:24,145 --> 00:09:25,779
Well, I
obviously can't do that.

234
00:09:25,813 --> 00:09:27,533
I guess I'm just gonna
have to suck it up...

235
00:09:27,548 --> 00:09:29,566
Let her suck it up-- she's
the expert. Sorry, keep going.

236
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,535
...and at least try to make
things work with Charmese.

237
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:32,869
And who knows?

238
00:09:32,904 --> 00:09:34,538
Maybe it... maybe it
won't be that bad.

239
00:09:34,572 --> 00:09:36,807
After all, I liked her enough
to marry her last night.

240
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:38,081
I must've seen
something in her.

241
00:09:38,109 --> 00:09:39,743
There you go, that's
the spirit, buddy.

242
00:09:39,777 --> 00:09:41,378
There's a little bit
of good in everyone.

243
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:43,380
Except that president guy
from <i>The Hunger Games.</i>

244
00:09:43,414 --> 00:09:44,464
He was pretty bad.

245
00:09:44,532 --> 00:09:46,666
This year, in addition
to the Hunger Games,

246
00:09:46,701 --> 00:09:49,186
we're going to do
the Special Hunger Games.

247
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,370
I'm Andy!

248
00:09:50,405 --> 00:09:51,855
I love
you, Andy!

249
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:53,223
Come on,
guys, fight.

250
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,627
So, Doc, I figured
if Charmese and I

251
00:09:57,662 --> 00:09:58,962
are gonna live
as man and wife,

252
00:09:58,996 --> 00:10:00,297
I ought to get
her checked out.

253
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:02,499
Of course. Charmese,
when's the last time

254
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:03,700
you had a pelvic exam?

255
00:10:03,735 --> 00:10:05,502
When was
the Missouri Compromise?

256
00:10:05,536 --> 00:10:07,370
Uh, I think 1821.

257
00:10:07,405 --> 00:10:09,372
Then I've never
had a pelvic exam.

258
00:10:09,407 --> 00:10:10,557
All right,
I'm going in.

259
00:10:10,591 --> 00:10:12,743
If I tug on the rope twice,
that means pull me out.

260
00:10:16,748 --> 00:10:18,248
God, who are the pigs

261
00:10:18,282 --> 00:10:20,751
who just throw their
empty beer cans down here?

262
00:10:24,655 --> 00:10:25,622
Hey, Charmese.

263
00:10:25,656 --> 00:10:27,457
You know, I really
love your clothes...

264
00:10:27,491 --> 00:10:28,708
I found a lot of them

265
00:10:28,743 --> 00:10:30,610
on strung-out
teenage corpses.

266
00:10:30,645 --> 00:10:31,611
That's so lovely.

267
00:10:31,646 --> 00:10:33,207
But I was thinking,
maybe this afternoon

268
00:10:33,214 --> 00:10:34,714
you'd like to borrow
my credit card

269
00:10:34,749 --> 00:10:36,183
and buy yourself
a new wardrobe.

270
00:10:36,217 --> 00:10:37,984
You know, something
a little more conservative.

271
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:38,985
Really?

272
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,520
That's so
sweet, Glenn.

273
00:10:40,555 --> 00:10:42,823
No one's ever cared
about me like that before.

274
00:10:42,857 --> 00:10:44,424
Thank you.

00:11:10,535 --> 00:11:11,735
for crack money.

284
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:17,174
Gosh, thanks so much
for having us over, you guys.

285
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,775
Of course, Glenn.

286
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,544
Welcome to our
home, Charmese.

287
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:21,945
Sit anywhere you like.

288
00:11:21,979 --> 00:11:24,981
That chair with the garbage bag
taped over it looks pretty good.

289
00:11:26,434 --> 00:11:28,301
Meg, you look
pretty next to her.

290
00:11:28,336 --> 00:11:30,237
So, Charmese,

291
00:11:30,271 --> 00:11:32,005
I was thinking
of writing an article

292
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,406
about you
for my school paper.

293
00:11:33,441 --> 00:11:35,976
Do you charge black guys
more or less?

294
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,644
Hmm, that's a hard question
to answer.

295
00:11:37,678 --> 00:11:39,346
Most of them get a group rate.

296
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,114
Come on, now,
let's not talk about work.

297
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:42,249
It's a dinner party.

298
00:11:42,283 --> 00:11:44,467
Are you and Glenn
thinking about children?

299
00:11:44,502 --> 00:11:47,037
Unfortunately,
I can't have children.

300
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,638
Oh, menopause?

301
00:11:48,673 --> 00:11:51,842
No, I got knifed
in the vagina one Christmas.

302
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:53,877
Ah, the holidays
are always stressful.

303
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:56,346
I have $3.74.

304
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,931
Do something to me.

305
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:00,700
I love you.

306
00:12:00,735 --> 00:12:03,253
I want to take you
away from all this.

307
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:05,205
They're supposedly putting
an ice cream place

308
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:06,907
where the shoe store was.

309
00:12:06,941 --> 00:12:09,059
Excuse me, Lois,
where's your bathroom?

310
00:12:09,093 --> 00:12:11,127
I got to check on
a whistling sound.

311
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:14,030
Upstairs, to the left.

312
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:17,434
Um, I'm obsessed
with Charmese.

313
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:22,305
Hey.

314
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,340
Let's do it.

315
00:12:23,374 --> 00:12:24,991
What? You mean, like sex?

316
00:12:25,026 --> 00:12:26,576
Yeah, and we
should go now.

317
00:12:26,611 --> 00:12:28,251
I just stuffed everything
back into place.

318
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:29,713
Uh, you know, Charmese,

319
00:12:29,747 --> 00:12:31,414
I don't really think
I'm in the mood.

320
00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:32,983
What? You're never
in the mood.

321
00:12:33,017 --> 00:12:34,417
We've been married
two weeks,

322
00:12:34,452 --> 00:12:36,453
and we haven't done it
since that first night.

323
00:12:36,487 --> 00:12:38,221
I haven't gone two
weeks without sex

324
00:12:38,256 --> 00:12:40,690
since I was in a
coma for six weeks.

325
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:43,093
Yeah, sorry, Charmese,
I'm-I'm just not feeling it.

326
00:12:43,127 --> 00:12:45,128
Geez, what the hell's
your problem?

327
00:12:45,162 --> 00:12:47,030
What are... what are you,
gay or something?

328
00:12:47,064 --> 00:12:48,865
Excuse me?
You heard me.

329
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,367
Are you some kind of 'mo?

330
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:53,169
Oh, God, please tell me I'm
not married to some Nancy boy.

331
00:12:53,204 --> 00:12:56,223
Why? Would that
be a problem?

332
00:12:56,257 --> 00:12:58,608
Are you kidding?
Course it would.

333
00:12:58,643 --> 00:13:01,044
My dream is to live the
married life and settle down.

334
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:03,246
I can't be doing
that with no gay.

335
00:13:03,281 --> 00:13:04,781
I see.

336
00:13:04,815 --> 00:13:07,751
Well, Charmese,
I have something to tell you,

337
00:13:07,785 --> 00:13:09,786
and this isn't easy.

338
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,987
But I'm gay.

339
00:13:11,022 --> 00:13:12,455
What? No.

340
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,757
You can't be.

341
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,825
I was gonna be your
perfect little wife.

342
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,495
I was gonna make you
breakfast maybe once a week,

343
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:19,930
and give you stuff to do

344
00:13:19,964 --> 00:13:21,898
right when you walk through
the door after work.

345
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,600
And I would've
loved that, Charmese,

346
00:13:23,634 --> 00:13:26,469
if I just weren't
so super duper double gay.

347
00:13:26,504 --> 00:13:29,272
Oh, this is awful.

348
00:13:29,307 --> 00:13:30,607
Aw, don't cry, Charmese.

349
00:13:30,641 --> 00:13:31,891
You'll find the right guy.

350
00:13:31,926 --> 00:13:33,093
There's someone
for everyone.

351
00:13:33,127 --> 00:13:35,312
Even if you're
a narcissistic pedophile.

352
00:13:35,346 --> 00:13:38,014
Hey, Ma, we got any pictures
of me when I was a kid?

353
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:39,599
Maybe something in a tub?

354
00:13:41,702 --> 00:13:43,770
I'm really sorry it
didn't work out, Glenn.

355
00:13:43,804 --> 00:13:45,205
Me, too, Charmese.

356
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:46,573
I'll send
the divorce papers

357
00:13:46,607 --> 00:13:49,609
to that Rite Aid
where you brush your teeth.

358
00:13:51,195 --> 00:13:52,696
Hey, buddy, what happened?
She gone?

359
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,180
Yep, I'm off
the hook, Peter.

360
00:13:54,215 --> 00:13:55,582
I told Charmese
I was gay,

361
00:13:55,616 --> 00:13:57,717
and now she's gonna consent
to a no-fault divorce.

362
00:13:57,752 --> 00:13:59,552
That's brilliant,
Quagmire.

363
00:13:59,587 --> 00:14:01,655
It's the exact opposite
of what Hugh Jackman does.

364
00:14:01,689 --> 00:14:03,990
Pretend you're gay
to get out of marriage.

365
00:14:04,025 --> 00:14:05,158
Thank God.

366
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:06,493
I really dodged
a bullet there.

367
00:14:06,527 --> 00:14:08,361
I don't know what the
hell I was thinking.

368
00:14:08,396 --> 00:14:09,796
Eh, everybody
makes mistakes.

369
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,197
Even doctors.

370
00:14:12,733 --> 00:14:14,567
You forgot to say...

371
00:14:14,602 --> 00:14:16,369
I forgot to say "clear."

372
00:14:16,404 --> 00:14:19,539
Finally, back to my old life.

373
00:14:20,691 --> 00:14:23,009
Hello, Internet porn.

374
00:14:23,044 --> 00:14:24,878
Man, I haven't done this
in two weeks.

375
00:14:24,912 --> 00:14:26,980
I should weigh myself
before and after.

376
00:14:27,014 --> 00:14:29,499
Sorry, I forgot
my prescription mouthwash.

377
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:31,201
Aah!
Oh, my God.

378
00:14:31,235 --> 00:14:32,535
What are you watching?

379
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,104
That... that's
straight porn.

380
00:14:34,138 --> 00:14:36,022
Listen, Charmese, it's not
what you think, all right?

381
00:14:36,057 --> 00:14:37,257
I've been poisoned,

382
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,825
and I'm trying to
make myself throw up.

383
00:14:38,859 --> 00:14:40,844
Gay men don't watch
straight porn.

384
00:14:40,878 --> 00:14:43,079
You lied to me,
you son of a bitch.

385
00:14:43,114 --> 00:14:44,681
No, no, I'm gay, I swear!

386
00:14:44,715 --> 00:14:46,416
Here, watch me,
uh, uh, go there.

387
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,917
Jen Aniston?

388
00:14:47,952 --> 00:14:50,387
More like Jen
Can't-get-a-man-iston!

389
00:14:50,421 --> 00:14:51,855
See? I went there.

390
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:53,356
Damn it, Glenn,
if you're not gay,

391
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:54,891
then the divorce is off.

392
00:14:54,925 --> 00:14:56,826
No, no, I am.
I swear to God.

393
00:14:56,861 --> 00:14:58,228
All right, fine.

394
00:14:58,262 --> 00:15:00,230
If you're really gay
and you want that divorce,

395
00:15:00,264 --> 00:15:02,132
all you got to do is one thing.

396
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,633
Anything, Charmese. Name it.

397
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:04,968
Prove it.

398
00:15:05,002 --> 00:15:07,070
Let me watch you have sex
with a man.

399
00:15:07,104 --> 00:15:08,805
Wh-What?

400
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:10,006
You heard me.

401
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,242
I want to see you
get it on with a guy.

402
00:15:14,111 --> 00:15:16,379
All right, Charmese,
I'll do it.

403
00:15:16,414 --> 00:15:21,084
If that's what it takes,
I'll have sex with another man.

404
00:15:22,686 --> 00:15:23,920
Look, Daddy.

405
00:15:23,954 --> 00:15:25,655
Teacher says every
time a bell rings,

406
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:28,391
some gay guy's gonna have
sex with another gay guy.

407
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:31,494
We're gonna pull you
out of that school.

408
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,696
We now return to
<i>The Dyslexic Baseball Wrap-Up.</i>

409
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,714
And the Yew Nork Nankees
bave heaten

410
00:15:41,749 --> 00:15:44,484
the Oltimore Borioles nive
to foo here at Yamden Cards.

411
00:15:44,518 --> 00:15:46,953
The Borioles now
lace a fong toad rip

412
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,705
where they'll
face the Sed Rox,

413
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,973
the Revil Days
and the Jue Blays.

414
00:15:52,543 --> 00:15:54,177
Hey, Peter, you got a minute?

415
00:15:54,211 --> 00:15:55,778
Oh, yeah, sure.
Come on in, Quagmire.

416
00:15:55,813 --> 00:15:58,781
Listen, um, I need
to ask you to do something,

417
00:15:58,816 --> 00:16:00,783
and it's something huge.

418
00:16:00,818 --> 00:16:02,785
I mean, it's, like,
the biggest thing

419
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,787
a guy could ever ask
his friend to do.

420
00:16:04,822 --> 00:16:06,989
Hey, we're best pals, right?
Whatever you need.

421
00:16:07,024 --> 00:16:08,357
All right,
and you have to understand,

422
00:16:08,392 --> 00:16:11,394
I would never ask you to do this
if I had any other choice

423
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,862
and if what were at stake

424
00:16:12,896 --> 00:16:15,164
was anything less
than my entire way of life.

425
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,666
Geez, Quagmire, what is it?

426
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,267
Charmese won't
give me a divorce

427
00:16:18,302 --> 00:16:20,136
because she doesn't
believe I'm gay,

428
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:24,140
so I need you to have sex
with me while she watches.

429
00:16:33,684 --> 00:16:35,351
I have some demands.

430
00:16:35,385 --> 00:16:36,686
Of course, of course.

431
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,954
Nobody can ever know.

432
00:16:37,988 --> 00:16:39,689
Absolutely. I'm right there
with you on that one.

433
00:16:39,723 --> 00:16:41,257
There will be no
kissing on the mouth.

434
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,792
Okay.
I changed my mind.

435
00:16:42,826 --> 00:16:44,460
There will be kissing
on the mouth.

436
00:16:44,495 --> 00:16:45,962
Uh, all right.

437
00:16:45,996 --> 00:16:47,163
Good. Now, what else?

438
00:16:47,197 --> 00:16:48,448
What else? Uh, yes.

439
00:16:48,482 --> 00:16:50,383
If, per chance,
it is beautiful,

440
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:51,984
I reserve the
right to cry.

441
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:53,519
Peter, I can't imagine
any scenario

442
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,921
where this
is gonna be beautiful.

443
00:16:54,955 --> 00:16:56,022
Oh, I can.

444
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,390
I'm a very
passionate man.

445
00:16:57,424 --> 00:16:59,542
Haven't you ever seen
my Spanish soap operas?

446
00:16:59,576 --> 00:17:01,327
<i>Mi amor!</i>

447
00:17:02,996 --> 00:17:04,313
Papa!

448
00:17:05,532 --> 00:17:07,066
<i>Niño!</i>

449
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:11,504
<i>Bueno.</i>

450
00:17:22,132 --> 00:17:23,800
Peter, can we just
get out of here?

451
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,284
I want to get
this over with.

452
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,986
This was part
of the deal, Quagmire.

453
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,788
I need this
to be a lovely evening.

454
00:17:28,822 --> 00:17:30,022
Fine.

455
00:17:30,057 --> 00:17:31,991
How was work today?

456
00:17:32,025 --> 00:17:33,426
I don't want to talk
about work.

457
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,061
Hey, should we go
someplace else for dessert?

458
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,429
You know, someplace fun,
downtown,

459
00:17:36,463 --> 00:17:37,864
where the college kids go?

460
00:17:37,898 --> 00:17:40,099
What? I'm not taking you to
two different restaurants.

461
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:42,702
Huh. Hard to believe
your marriage isn't working out.

462
00:17:42,736 --> 00:17:44,654
A rose for the gentleman?

463
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,289
What? No. Scram.

464
00:17:46,323 --> 00:17:48,324
Hey, I'm not just
a poorly cleaned butt.

465
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,459
There's a whole man around it
you have to please.

466
00:17:50,494 --> 00:17:51,561
Fine.

467
00:17:51,595 --> 00:17:53,079
Here.

468
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,031
Quagmire, what's going on
with you?

469
00:17:55,065 --> 00:17:56,566
You don't seem
very present tonight.

470
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,884
Why are you so tense?

471
00:17:57,918 --> 00:18:00,453
I'm tense because I have
to bang you in 20 minutes!

472
00:18:00,487 --> 00:18:02,488
Well, if it's so much
of a chore.

473
00:18:03,774 --> 00:18:06,175
What the  is
going on with my life?

474
00:18:09,146 --> 00:18:10,713
Okay, Charmese, here we go.

475
00:18:10,747 --> 00:18:12,582
Are you sure you want
to watch this?

476
00:18:12,616 --> 00:18:14,617
I'm just warning you,
you're in the splash zone.

477
00:18:14,651 --> 00:18:16,752
Ugh, if I get anything
out, I'll be happy.

478
00:18:16,787 --> 00:18:17,820
Get on with it.

479
00:18:17,855 --> 00:18:19,188
Uh, okay.

480
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:22,275
Here, let me
stroke your hair.

481
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,809
Thank you.

482
00:18:23,844 --> 00:18:26,312
I want to do gay
things for you.

483
00:18:26,346 --> 00:18:29,682
I... I crave your groin.

484
00:18:29,716 --> 00:18:33,553
Yes, and I cannot wait
to intertwine our bodies

485
00:18:33,587 --> 00:18:36,372
and make each other's
fingers smell terrible.

486
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,107
Enough! Kiss each other.

487
00:18:43,981 --> 00:18:46,148
Oh, yeah,
that was so hot.

488
00:18:46,183 --> 00:18:48,050
Just like we always do.

489
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,952
Now take off
each other's clothes.

490
00:18:49,987 --> 00:18:53,205
Oh, God, I'm so
excited for gay sex.

491
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,607
Me, too.

492
00:18:54,641 --> 00:18:57,293
Your body makes me
so horny.

493
00:18:57,327 --> 00:18:59,228
Shut up and do it.

494
00:19:06,203 --> 00:19:08,404
It's very close, Peter.

495
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:11,274
The paintbrush
is about to touch the canvas.

496
00:19:11,325 --> 00:19:12,625
Come on, Peter.

497
00:19:12,643 --> 00:19:14,093
Sir Ian McKellen does this.

498
00:19:14,127 --> 00:19:15,311
You can do this.

499
00:19:15,345 --> 00:19:16,596
Here we go.
Here we go.

500
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,980
Here we go!
Just do it!

501
00:19:18,015 --> 00:19:19,215
Wait.

502
00:19:19,249 --> 00:19:20,566
Stop.

503
00:19:20,601 --> 00:19:23,903
Look, Glenn,
you're obviously not gay.

504
00:19:23,937 --> 00:19:25,621
Ye I am.
Well, I'm something

505
00:19:25,656 --> 00:19:27,924
'cause I've been at full-sail
for the last half hour.

506
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,592
No, Glenn, you're not.

507
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,928
I see that now,
and the truth is,

508
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,463
if you're willing to go
this far to get a divorce,

509
00:19:34,498 --> 00:19:37,667
then maybe we shouldn't
be married after all.

510
00:19:37,701 --> 00:19:39,802
What... what are you saying?

511
00:19:39,836 --> 00:19:42,371
I'm saying,
I'll give you your divorce.

512
00:19:42,406 --> 00:19:44,006
You're off the hook.

513
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,241
Oh.

514
00:19:45,275 --> 00:19:46,409
Oh, thank you, Charmese.

515
00:19:46,443 --> 00:19:47,710
Thank you so much.

516
00:19:47,744 --> 00:19:50,413
I-I can't believe
you'd do that for me.

517
00:19:50,447 --> 00:19:51,847
Well, it's for me, too.

518
00:19:51,882 --> 00:19:53,649
You were real nice
to me, Glenn,

519
00:19:53,684 --> 00:19:55,351
nicer than
any other guy's been,

520
00:19:55,385 --> 00:19:57,320
but I wanted
to be somebody's wife,

521
00:19:57,354 --> 00:19:59,655
not somebody's burden.

522
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,173
Good luck to you, sweetie.

523
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,275
And good luck to
you, Charmese.

524
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,510
Thanks.

525
00:20:04,544 --> 00:20:06,278
You're very special to me.

526
00:20:06,313 --> 00:20:09,548
I'm sorry my urine melted a hole
through your toilet.

527
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,783
Aw.

528
00:20:13,303 --> 00:20:15,287
Thank God that's over.

529
00:20:15,322 --> 00:20:16,656
Yeah, no kidding.

530
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,924
Hey, you know, there's not
too many guys in the world

531
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:20,793
who would be willing to do
something like that

532
00:20:20,827 --> 00:20:21,827
for their pal.

533
00:20:21,862 --> 00:20:23,029
Ah, don't mention it.

534
00:20:23,063 --> 00:20:24,363
No, no,
you're an amazing friend,

535
00:20:24,398 --> 00:20:25,831
and I really owe you.

536
00:20:25,866 --> 00:20:27,266
Thanks, Peter.

537
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,301
Ah, you're welcome, buddy.

538
00:20:31,204 --> 00:20:33,883
Hey, Quagmire, why is the red
light blinking on your computer?

539
00:20:36,516 --> 00:20:38,467
What are
we watching? <i>Glee?</i>

540
