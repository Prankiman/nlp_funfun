<i>Family Guy
Boys Do Cry</i>

2
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:38,018
We now return to Julia Louis-Dreyfus
in "Now It's Just Getting Sad."

3
00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:39,974
Okay, okay, hear me out.

4
00:00:39,975 --> 00:00:43,713
My character is a therapist
living in the city,

5
00:00:43,714 --> 00:00:47,080
but I'm married to an elephant.

6
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:49,196
Hi, I'm the husband.
Hey, honey.

7
00:00:49,197 --> 00:00:53,092
We're going to my parents' this weekend.
Did you pack your trunk?

8
00:00:53,978 --> 00:00:56,550
I don't think I want to go.
I don't like going to your parents.

9
00:00:56,553 --> 00:00:57,796
Why?

10
00:00:57,794 --> 00:01:00,323
Maybe because your dad's
an ivory hunter?

11
00:01:00,328 --> 00:01:02,773
See, there's a lot going on here.
A lot going on.

12
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:04,763
It actually, it actually
gets pretty watchable.

13
00:01:06,658 --> 00:01:08,492
Ah, damn, it's still raining.

14
00:01:08,498 --> 00:01:09,903
Lois, you mind if I
go in the house?

15
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:12,043
Fine, fine, just put
the newspaper down.

16
00:01:19,557 --> 00:01:20,753
Hey, Lois, look at this.

17
00:01:20,756 --> 00:01:23,213
The church is holding auditions
for a new organist.

18
00:01:23,215 --> 00:01:26,731
Really? Wow, you know, that sounds
like it could be a lot of fun.

19
00:01:26,735 --> 00:01:29,322
Yeah, it's been a while since
you've had the chance to play in public.

20
00:01:29,328 --> 00:01:31,273
Church organist?
Ah, that's boring.

21
00:01:31,278 --> 00:01:32,712
Why don't you do something
more interesting?

22
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:34,493
Like when I had that job
feeding the homeless.

23
00:01:34,767 --> 00:01:37,363
That's going to make you big and strong.

24
00:01:37,368 --> 00:01:38,890
Burping time.

25
00:01:39,336 --> 00:01:42,891
Oh, smells like someone
needs to be changed.

26
00:01:42,926 --> 00:01:46,560
When was the last time you were changed,
seven days ago?

27
00:01:46,598 --> 00:01:50,150
That's one week.
There are seven days in a week.

28
00:01:50,186 --> 00:01:52,551
I love you, filthy hobo.

29
00:01:56,735 --> 00:01:58,492
Huh, huh! All right.

30
00:02:01,108 --> 00:02:03,040
Why do you say "organist"
if you don't want...

31
00:02:03,045 --> 00:02:04,890
I don't understand
the world anymore.

32
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:12,212
Here be a jaunty sea chantey
from me boyhood.

33
00:02:12,846 --> 00:02:15,213
<i>You shake me nerves
and you rattle me brain</i>

34
00:02:15,795 --> 00:02:18,432
<i>Too much love
drives a man insane</i>

35
00:02:18,818 --> 00:02:21,381
<i>You broke me will,
oh, what a thrill</i>

36
00:02:21,615 --> 00:02:24,223
<i>Goodness gracious,
great balls of fire.</i>

37
00:02:35,757 --> 00:02:37,941
<i>I know what boys like</i>

38
00:02:37,998 --> 00:02:40,492
<i>I know what guys want</i>

39
00:02:40,506 --> 00:02:42,902
<i>I know what boys like</i>

40
00:02:42,935 --> 00:02:44,822
<i>Boys like</i>

41
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:46,953
<i>Boys like me.</i>

42
00:02:47,187 --> 00:02:49,900
All right, up next is Lois Griffin.

43
00:02:49,908 --> 00:02:53,180
Well, I don't know if I can compete
with the rest of these people,

44
00:02:53,185 --> 00:02:54,553
but here goes.

45
00:03:00,207 --> 00:03:03,791
My word, what a fascinating man
this Jesus must have been.

46
00:03:03,795 --> 00:03:05,571
I can just imagine meeting him.

47
00:03:35,947 --> 00:03:38,291
That was beautiful,Mrs. Griffin.

48
00:03:38,296 --> 00:03:40,151
Up next is Jake Tucker.

49
00:03:56,507 --> 00:04:00,723
Well, finally! Some of us have been
waiting all evening for a certain wife

50
00:04:00,726 --> 00:04:02,903
to come home and feed
her starving family.

51
00:04:02,906 --> 00:04:06,443
Peter, I told you I was going to be late.
Couldn't you have handled dinner?

52
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:08,290
You can't ask me to make dinner, Lois.

53
00:04:08,297 --> 00:04:10,770
That's like asking me to choose
between Sarah Jessica Parker

54
00:04:10,775 --> 00:04:13,821
and Kirsten Dunst in a
hotbody/weird face contest.

55
00:04:13,825 --> 00:04:14,690
It can't be done.

56
00:04:14,695 --> 00:04:16,523
Well, I've got good news.

57
00:04:16,525 --> 00:04:18,992
I'm going to be the church's
new organist.

58
00:04:18,998 --> 00:04:20,551
- Hey, congrats.
- Wow, Mom, that's great.

59
00:04:20,557 --> 00:04:22,553
That means you'll play the organ.

60
00:04:22,556 --> 00:04:26,993
It also means that this family is going to
start going to church again on Sundays.

61
00:04:27,027 --> 00:04:28,623
Being there today reminded me

62
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:32,191
of how important religious services
are to the moral fiber of a family.

63
00:04:32,197 --> 00:04:35,051
And lately, this family has been
lacking moral fiber.

64
00:04:35,057 --> 00:04:36,881
Especially you, Meg.

65
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:39,713
Meg, what happened to you?

66
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:41,371
She can't answer you.

67
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,133
She can't even talk.

68
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:46,882
Ever since she started smoking pot,
she just kind of lays there.

69
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:48,383
It's really sad.

70
00:04:48,386 --> 00:04:50,012
And a tiny bit funny.

71
00:04:50,048 --> 00:04:52,511
Oh, my God, I think I'm getting
a contact high.

72
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,202
Oh, now I'm messed up, too.

73
00:04:58,477 --> 00:04:59,970
Good morning, everyone.

74
00:05:00,017 --> 00:05:04,443
A reading from the letter of John
to the couple with the crying baby upstairs.

75
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:07,190
"Obviously you hearyour kid crying

76
00:05:07,197 --> 00:05:09,181
"and you're trying to break
him of some habit.

77
00:05:09,187 --> 00:05:10,681
"But I got news for you.

78
00:05:10,697 --> 00:05:12,161
"It's not working.

79
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:14,131
"I swear to God if it doesn't stop,

80
00:05:14,136 --> 00:05:17,331
I will come up thereand show him
what real pain is."

81
00:05:17,337 --> 00:05:18,291
The Word of the Lord.

82
00:05:18,336 --> 00:05:19,393
Praise be to God.

83
00:05:19,468 --> 00:05:21,310
Oh, I am so hungry.

84
00:05:21,317 --> 00:05:23,373
Oh, look, they're handingout
cookies up there.

85
00:05:23,386 --> 00:05:24,523
Stewie, wait, don't...

86
00:05:24,637 --> 00:05:26,603
Hey, there.
Eat up, y'all.

87
00:05:26,648 --> 00:05:29,940
Youse is good church going folk.
Y'all deserve a little treat.

88
00:05:29,946 --> 00:05:30,662
Give me that!

89
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:33,681
Well, aren't you
an enthusiastic wafer muncher.

90
00:05:33,685 --> 00:05:36,372
- What is that, punch?
- Oh, don't y'all drink that.

91
00:05:36,388 --> 00:05:38,241
Youse gonna get sick.

92
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:39,421
Yep.

93
00:05:41,547 --> 00:05:44,960
- That baby just threw up the host!
- That's a sign of the devil.

94
00:05:44,967 --> 00:05:46,983
- Oh, my God,is he possessed?
- He's possessed!

95
00:05:46,997 --> 00:05:49,021
That baby is possessed by Satan!

96
00:05:49,028 --> 00:05:51,602
Calm down, everyone.
He's just a little sick.

97
00:05:51,608 --> 00:05:53,401
I'll take him home.Come on, sweetie.

98
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:55,193
Oh, sweet, weare out of here.

99
00:05:55,195 --> 00:05:57,120
Now I can do what I planned
to do this morning...

100
00:05:57,467 --> 00:05:59,112
Gladiator mice.

101
00:05:59,915 --> 00:06:02,672
Yes, yes, die, die, die!

102
00:06:02,677 --> 00:06:05,900
I have everything,and you have nothing!

103
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:10,863
Ugh, what a horrible morning.

104
00:06:10,867 --> 00:06:15,402
You know, all I wanted was for us to share
a simple Sunday church service as a family.

105
00:06:15,407 --> 00:06:17,403
But I guess that's too much to ask.

106
00:06:22,446 --> 00:06:24,090
Good afternoon, Mrs. Griffin.

107
00:06:24,096 --> 00:06:27,322
We're here to take custody of your baby
so that the good reverend here

108
00:06:27,328 --> 00:06:31,292
can perform an exorcism and banish
the devil from his infant soul.

109
00:06:31,295 --> 00:06:35,041
What?! You are not performing
an exorcism on my baby.

110
00:06:35,045 --> 00:06:38,663
Mrs. Griffin,you can give him to us,
or we can take him by force.

111
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:40,321
- No!
- Don't worry, Lois,

112
00:06:40,328 --> 00:06:42,792
we'll hide in the one place they can't find us.

113
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:44,672
In Imagination Land,

114
00:06:44,718 --> 00:06:47,642
where you burp where you fart,
and you fart where you burp.

115
00:06:50,256 --> 00:06:52,302
Indeed, that's how it happens.

116
00:06:57,237 --> 00:06:58,503
Where are we going?

117
00:06:58,507 --> 00:07:01,531
Who cares as long as it's away
from those bloody church fanatics.

118
00:07:01,536 --> 00:07:03,172
We're going to Texas.

119
00:07:03,187 --> 00:07:06,183
We can stay at my sister Carol's
place until this blows over.

120
00:07:06,198 --> 00:07:10,081
Texas? We're going to Texas
in search of religious tolerance?

121
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:13,512
That's going to be like trying to get
Sneakers O'Toole to take his sneakers off.

122
00:07:13,687 --> 00:07:17,751
I'm not taking my sneakers off
I am Sneakers O'Toole.

123
00:07:17,757 --> 00:07:19,361
Hey, take those sneakers off.

124
00:07:19,367 --> 00:07:20,853
- No!
- Take them off, I said!

125
00:07:20,855 --> 00:07:21,733
No!

126
00:07:22,078 --> 00:07:24,783
Ah, let him go.
We'll never catch him.

127
00:07:24,788 --> 00:07:26,362
Not in these shoes.

128
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:30,610
I'm not taking my sneakers off
I am Sneakers O'Toole.

129
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,412
- Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.
- And I'm Diane Simmons.

130
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:36,332
Authorities are on the look out for
one-year-old Stewie Griffin,

131
00:07:36,338 --> 00:07:39,362
a Quahog infant who is believed
to be possessed by Satan.

132
00:07:39,368 --> 00:07:43,483
A substantial reward is being offered for
any information leading to his capture.

133
00:07:43,515 --> 00:07:47,663
In other pseudo-scientific news,
a local man claims to have spotted bigfoot.

134
00:07:47,665 --> 00:07:49,423
We've got the exclusive interview.

135
00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:53,022
I was about to bone my girlfriend
out at the lake,

136
00:07:53,026 --> 00:07:54,753
but suddenly she yelled,

137
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,453
so I looked up
and it was bigfoot.

138
00:07:57,467 --> 00:08:00,450
- So what happened next?
- Then I went back to bone her,

139
00:08:00,455 --> 00:08:05,613
but the mosquitoes were going crazy,
and she said there was no way.

140
00:08:07,838 --> 00:08:10,641
All right, get your snacks
and hurry out, you guys.

141
00:08:11,455 --> 00:08:13,470
Yeah, look, they have Chunky bars.

142
00:08:13,513 --> 00:08:17,526
What a God-awful mess those things are,
chocolate with raisins in it.

143
00:08:17,524 --> 00:08:20,393
Yeah, yeah, that's what kids
want with their chocolate-- fruit.

144
00:08:20,438 --> 00:08:23,623
Why don't you put sunflower seeds
in the Ding Dongs while you're at it?

145
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:25,921
- Is that part of your stand-up act?
- I don't know, do you like it?

146
00:08:25,928 --> 00:08:27,112
I wouldn't open with it.

147
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:32,813
Pardon me, sir.
We're trying to locate a possessed child.

148
00:08:32,816 --> 00:08:34,331
Have you seen anyone
who looks like this?

149
00:08:34,367 --> 00:08:35,433
Yeah, that's my son.

150
00:08:35,445 --> 00:08:37,883
He's actually inthe mini-mart right now.
He'll be out in a second.

151
00:08:37,957 --> 00:08:40,922
I-I-I-I mean, I mean no, no.
Never seen him before.

152
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,333
Hmm. What was that first thing you said?

153
00:08:43,337 --> 00:08:45,771
Oh, I was just saying that baby
in the picture is my son.

154
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,872
He's traveling with us.
He's part of our family.

155
00:08:47,877 --> 00:08:50,593
We're trying to avoid being
found by police like you.

156
00:08:50,628 --> 00:08:54,882
I mean, I was just remarking
what a nice tie you have on.

157
00:08:54,925 --> 00:08:57,541
I love this tie.

158
00:08:57,596 --> 00:08:59,091
All right, you folks take care now.

159
00:09:00,685 --> 00:09:02,602
Oh, did you hear that cashier's accent?

160
00:09:02,648 --> 00:09:04,732
"Would you like some change
please for you?"

161
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:08,123
Oh, you know, if it weren't for 9/11,
those guys would be adorable.

162
00:09:08,158 --> 00:09:09,292
Oh, my God, look.

163
00:09:10,886 --> 00:09:12,323
Quick, into the bathroom.

164
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:16,031
We're going to have to come up with a way
to change your appearance.

165
00:09:16,038 --> 00:09:18,343
Well, I could disguise myself as Britney Spears.

166
00:09:18,347 --> 00:09:21,152
I'm already standing in urine,
and I hate the person I'm with.

167
00:09:21,155 --> 00:09:23,802
No, see, there's got to be something
in here we can use.

168
00:09:32,015 --> 00:09:34,131
Boy, that was a close one back there.

169
00:09:34,137 --> 00:09:35,922
Way to think on your feet, Brian.

170
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:38,253
We got lucky.
How you holding up, Stewie?

171
00:09:39,935 --> 00:09:41,510
Um...
I feel right, Brian.

172
00:09:42,046 --> 00:09:43,323
I feel right.

173
00:09:51,065 --> 00:09:54,013
Are you sure Aunt Carol won't mind us using her house?

174
00:09:54,017 --> 00:09:56,992
She won't care, Chris.
She's off on her ninth honeymoon.

175
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:00,650
When will it work for her?

176
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,583
Howdy, new neighbors.

177
00:10:02,588 --> 00:10:05,103
- Pleased to welcome you.
- We're the Lynches.

178
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:06,353
We live next door.

179
00:10:06,358 --> 00:10:08,983
Nice to meet you.
We're the Griffins.

180
00:10:08,988 --> 00:10:12,473
Nellie here is a homemaker.
And I'm a queer chaser and beater.

181
00:10:12,475 --> 00:10:14,953
Lois, I'm not sure this is the right place for us.

182
00:10:14,955 --> 00:10:17,470
These Texans are socially backward and,

183
00:10:17,475 --> 00:10:19,602
politically, they're all
stubborn as a mule.

184
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:22,682
Nope, sorry, Kevin Bacon
wasn't in Footloose.

185
00:10:22,718 --> 00:10:25,402
- What ? Of course he was.
- No, he wasn't. You lose.

186
00:10:25,438 --> 00:10:28,012
- Of course he was, he was the star.
- No, you're wrong. Look it up.

187
00:10:28,018 --> 00:10:29,882
I don't have to look it up.
It's common knowledge.

188
00:10:29,886 --> 00:10:30,710
- He was on the cover of...Nope.
- Nope.

189
00:10:30,746 --> 00:10:32,902
- People magazine when the movie...
- Nope. No. No.

190
00:10:32,906 --> 00:10:34,272
- Everyone knows Kevin Bacon
- No, no, No, No!

191
00:10:34,287 --> 00:10:37,181
- was the star of Footloose.
- No! No! No!

192
00:10:37,187 --> 00:10:41,632
No! No! No! No!
Hyan! Hyan!

193
00:10:44,767 --> 00:10:46,590
Look what the Lynches gave us.

194
00:10:46,597 --> 00:10:50,393
A needle point of Chuck Norris
from Walker, Texas Ranger.

195
00:10:50,395 --> 00:10:54,261
You know, they say Chuck Norris is so tough
there's no chin under his beard.

196
00:10:54,466 --> 00:10:57,570
- There is only another fist.
- That's ridiculous.

197
00:10:58,078 --> 00:10:59,192
Chuck Norris ?

198
00:11:00,847 --> 00:11:04,573
You know, this place may be the upside
to everything that's happened.

199
00:11:04,577 --> 00:11:08,273
The people are kind and generous.
They seem whole some and moral.

200
00:11:08,277 --> 00:11:11,162
Exactly the kind of influence
this family needs.

201
00:11:11,168 --> 00:11:14,560
Lois, we're living in a red state
with a bunch of right-wing nutjobs.

202
00:11:14,565 --> 00:11:16,173
Hey, Chris, check out my belt buckle.

203
00:11:16,178 --> 00:11:18,840
It says, "Everything's bigger in Texas."

204
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:23,581
Belts are a great way
to express opinions.

205
00:11:25,555 --> 00:11:29,032
<i>This is Channel Five News,
Texas, with Duke Dillon.</i>

206
00:11:29,037 --> 00:11:31,262
Howdy, Texas.
I'm Duke Dillon.

207
00:11:31,307 --> 00:11:32,713
At the top of the news tonight,

208
00:11:32,717 --> 00:11:36,192
authorities have called off their pursuit
of a fugitive Rhode Island baby

209
00:11:36,225 --> 00:11:38,181
who was thought
to be possessed by the devil.

210
00:11:38,185 --> 00:11:39,871
Oh! Thank God!

211
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,371
This turn of events came
after Vatican scientists

212
00:11:42,378 --> 00:11:45,970
announced today that the devil is not
the greatest threat to salvation

213
00:11:46,007 --> 00:11:49,042
due to last week's discovery
of the Superdevil.

214
00:11:49,048 --> 00:11:51,341
Religion reporter Dallas Houston has the story.

215
00:11:51,346 --> 00:11:51,992
Thanks, Duke.

216
00:11:51,995 --> 00:11:54,873
Well, let me try and give you a clear
picture of what we're dealing with here.

217
00:11:54,968 --> 00:11:57,921
Here's a photo of the devil,
and here's the Superdevil.

218
00:11:57,928 --> 00:12:00,672
Now, as you can see, there are
some significant differences.

219
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,410
The Superdevil is at least
six inches taller,

220
00:12:03,417 --> 00:12:06,423
he has a flying motorcycle
and a jar of marmalade

221
00:12:06,428 --> 00:12:08,722
that we believe forces you
to commit adultery.

222
00:12:08,726 --> 00:12:09,882
Thanks a lot, Dallas.

223
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,450
Looks like we all got something
new to be afraid of.

224
00:12:12,746 --> 00:12:14,463
Everyone, it's over!

225
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,512
We can go back to Quahog.

226
00:12:19,787 --> 00:12:21,281
Hey, Lois, you say something?

227
00:12:21,786 --> 00:12:24,781
Aw, just that I think you're going to love this cake.

228
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:28,150
None for me, thanks.
It's going to go straight to my vagina.

229
00:12:28,195 --> 00:12:30,580
That's what girls worry about,
right, having big vaginas?

230
00:12:33,696 --> 00:12:35,792
Dad, why aren't you taking the car?

231
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,393
Chris, we're in Texas now.
If I'm not riding a horse,

232
00:12:38,397 --> 00:12:41,470
I'm going to stick out like a straight guy
in a figure-skating competition.

233
00:12:44,107 --> 00:12:46,503
Boo-ya! Triple salchow in your face!

234
00:12:46,508 --> 00:12:48,621
Hey, you want this? Huh?
You want some of this?

235
00:12:48,657 --> 00:12:50,633
Oh, man, look at your rack.

236
00:12:50,648 --> 00:12:53,303
I'd motorboat that.
I'd motorboat the hell out of it!

237
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:54,993
Right after this layback spin.

238
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,553
Bottle of Jack Daniels, please.

239
00:13:01,677 --> 00:13:03,213
- There you go.
- Thanks.

240
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:04,493
What's this?

241
00:13:04,498 --> 00:13:07,272
That's your gun.
Buy some liquor,get a free gun.

242
00:13:07,275 --> 00:13:10,223
Is that like a special you have
on now or something?

243
00:13:10,225 --> 00:13:11,493
Nope. Texas state law.

244
00:13:11,498 --> 00:13:12,882
You have a nice day now.

245
00:13:12,906 --> 00:13:14,060
State law?

246
00:13:14,098 --> 00:13:17,180
God! This place officially sucks
worse than the WNBA.

247
00:13:18,515 --> 00:13:21,470
And, at the top of the second half,
it's 16 to nine.

248
00:13:21,475 --> 00:13:23,181
Easton leads the scoring with four.

249
00:13:23,186 --> 00:13:26,533
And that's why she commands
$7,000 a year.

250
00:13:26,538 --> 00:13:29,023
These gals sure do
make it look difficult.

251
00:13:29,027 --> 00:13:32,511
But is having this minor skill
worth being so unattractive?

252
00:13:32,518 --> 00:13:34,400
That's for the fan to decide.

253
00:13:34,587 --> 00:13:35,543
Yay!

254
00:13:42,387 --> 00:13:43,683
Huh. That was kind of cool.

255
00:13:52,236 --> 00:13:54,592
Been a long day, Lois.
Long day.

256
00:13:54,637 --> 00:13:56,210
Peter, what the hell?

257
00:13:56,218 --> 00:13:58,260
You can't bring that horse into our bed.

258
00:13:58,267 --> 00:14:01,320
Lois, I cannot believe you would
ban the horse from our bed.

259
00:14:01,328 --> 00:14:04,630
He is a graceful, majestic creature
who is a part of this family

260
00:14:04,638 --> 00:14:07,572
and only wants you to love and respect...
The horse may have pooped in the bed.

261
00:14:10,926 --> 00:14:14,802
I hereby call this meeting
of the Texas Youth Club to order.

262
00:14:14,818 --> 00:14:17,361
First, I'd like to welcome
our two newcomers,

263
00:14:17,368 --> 00:14:19,152
Chris and Meg Griffin.

264
00:14:19,196 --> 00:14:22,401
Wow! This is the coolest club
I've ever been in.

265
00:14:22,406 --> 00:14:24,720
Well, you're not quite in the club yet.

266
00:14:24,727 --> 00:14:26,401
You got to pass the initiation.

267
00:14:26,425 --> 00:14:27,671
What do we have to do?

268
00:14:27,675 --> 00:14:29,720
You got to sneak on
to the Crawford Ranch

269
00:14:29,728 --> 00:14:32,311
and steal a pair of
George Bush's underwear.

270
00:14:32,345 --> 00:14:36,422
And then bring it back here
so we can bask inits Bushy goodness.

271
00:14:36,457 --> 00:14:40,503
Boy, that's even kinkier than the porn
they make for senior citizens.

272
00:14:41,826 --> 00:14:43,662
Can I help you, Edward?

273
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:46,503
Yeah. I'm here for the early bird special.

274
00:14:47,565 --> 00:14:50,491
- Are those new slacks?
- What's that, now?

275
00:14:50,497 --> 00:14:55,483
- Are those new slacks?
- I got these on special at Caldors.

276
00:14:55,537 --> 00:14:58,141
- Who drove you there?
- My nephew.

277
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,552
Oh. That was nice of him.

278
00:15:00,847 --> 00:15:02,920
I forgot why I came over.

279
00:15:03,707 --> 00:15:05,652
Are those new slacks?

280
00:15:10,638 --> 00:15:12,472
What is this? What the hell
are we doing here?

281
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:15,252
Welcome to your first
toddler pageant, Stewie.

282
00:15:15,295 --> 00:15:17,421
It's what you do when you're in Texas.

283
00:15:17,426 --> 00:15:18,360
Oh, lovely.

284
00:15:18,407 --> 00:15:21,473
A first-class ticket to a semen-stained
death in the basement.

285
00:15:21,517 --> 00:15:25,113
Why don't you meet the other contestants
while I go register you?

286
00:15:25,165 --> 00:15:28,342
Hello. I'm, uh... Stephanie Griffin.

287
00:15:28,346 --> 00:15:30,542
- Hi, Stephanie.
- What's your talent?

288
00:15:30,545 --> 00:15:35,760
I sing, I do gymnastics, and I can play
seven instruments at the same time.

289
00:15:35,775 --> 00:15:37,423
Hmm. You could be a threat to me.

290
00:15:37,426 --> 00:15:38,100
Chuck.

291
00:15:43,267 --> 00:15:45,403
There it is... the Crawford Ranch.

292
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,721
I can't believe we're actually doing this.

293
00:15:47,725 --> 00:15:49,932
What a bonding adventure for the two of us.

294
00:15:49,936 --> 00:15:51,002
Settle down, Meg.

295
00:15:51,005 --> 00:15:53,893
Okay, I see Old Man Cheney
guarding the place.

296
00:15:55,146 --> 00:15:58,013
18% approval ratings.

297
00:15:59,797 --> 00:16:02,722
I'll give you 18% of my foot in your ass.

298
00:16:04,706 --> 00:16:07,373
I'd like you to meet
my daughter's husband Michael.

299
00:16:22,145 --> 00:16:24,942
Wow! Look how organized he is.

300
00:16:24,946 --> 00:16:29,523
He's already got his sugar cut up into neat
little lines for his breakfast tomorrow.

301
00:16:29,568 --> 00:16:31,461
And a razor blade to shave.

302
00:16:32,688 --> 00:16:34,222
Wow! Look at this.

303
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:37,281
I can't believe Mrs. Bush kept
all these Planned Parenthood receipts.

304
00:16:37,298 --> 00:16:41,303
Holy cow! She's been scraped more times
than a fisherman's knuckle.

305
00:16:41,345 --> 00:16:43,130
Hey, what are you kids doing here?

306
00:16:43,177 --> 00:16:46,341
You tell Javier to back off.
I'll have his money by next week.

307
00:16:46,346 --> 00:16:47,790
- What?
- Nevermind

308
00:16:47,828 --> 00:16:49,592
Hey, you guys want to see something?

309
00:16:49,597 --> 00:16:51,152
Grab a beer and follow me.

310
00:16:52,848 --> 00:16:55,821
See this car?
I restored it myself this summer.

311
00:16:55,825 --> 00:16:58,351
I was here for 12 weeks. I had to do something.

312
00:16:58,578 --> 00:17:01,582
But, along the way,
I learned about honesty, integrity,

313
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:04,630
and cold filtered Miller Genuine Draft.

314
00:17:06,278 --> 00:17:08,272
That's an adult beverage right there.

315
00:17:08,408 --> 00:17:10,223
You understand
what I'm trying to say to you?

316
00:17:10,226 --> 00:17:12,450
Yes. But I have just one question.

317
00:17:12,476 --> 00:17:14,670
Can I borrow your underpants
for ten minutes?

318
00:17:25,468 --> 00:17:26,340
Hello.

319
00:17:26,376 --> 00:17:30,040
- Oh. Hi, Jillian.
- Brian, I'm reading TV Guide.

320
00:17:30,078 --> 00:17:33,622
Can you explain how these cheers
and jeers work again?

321
00:17:33,627 --> 00:17:38,310
Well, the cheers is when they generally
approve of something on television,

322
00:17:38,315 --> 00:17:41,912
and jeers is when
they find some sort of fault with it.

323
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:45,052
Oh. See... yeah, I'm not quite...

324
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,100
We can't do this over the phone.

325
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,700
You're going to have to come over.

326
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:52,262
I can't come over. We're still on the run
because the town thinks Stewie's possessed.

327
00:17:52,336 --> 00:17:56,403
No, they don't. Didn't you hear?
They stopped chasing you weeks ago.

328
00:17:56,436 --> 00:17:59,822
- What? I have to go.
- Wait, wait! I have another question.

329
00:17:59,855 --> 00:18:01,793
How do I know if I'm Jewish?

330
00:18:01,827 --> 00:18:02,990
- Are you Jewish?
- No

331
00:18:02,997 --> 00:18:04,651
- There you go, sport.
- Thank you.

332
00:18:05,948 --> 00:18:08,181
Hey, guys, thanks so much
for inviting me out today.

333
00:18:08,185 --> 00:18:10,241
I'm psyched to brand my first cow.

334
00:18:10,247 --> 00:18:13,103
Here you are, Peter.
All fired up and ready to go.

335
00:18:14,486 --> 00:18:16,370
Oh...!

336
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,403
Oh, yes!

337
00:18:19,407 --> 00:18:21,853
Yes! Oh...!

338
00:18:21,857 --> 00:18:23,162
Oh, hang on a second.

339
00:18:31,398 --> 00:18:33,011
Man, Texas is great.

340
00:18:33,016 --> 00:18:36,341
Back where I'm from, a retarded guy
could never have this much fun.

341
00:18:37,046 --> 00:18:39,392
- What did you just say?
- What?

342
00:18:39,445 --> 00:18:41,012
Technically, I'm retarded.

343
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,800
Fellas! Fellas! Can't we talk this over?

344
00:18:43,817 --> 00:18:45,893
Talking is for terrorists and blacks.

345
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:48,640
In Texas, we execute the retarded.

346
00:18:48,647 --> 00:18:51,131
Oh, my God! So this is how it ends?

347
00:18:51,177 --> 00:18:54,672
I always thought I'd die having to sit
through the Canadian Film Festival.

348
00:18:54,845 --> 00:18:57,292
I don't wish to cause you
any harm,

349
00:18:57,297 --> 00:18:58,471
and I won't.

350
00:18:58,478 --> 00:18:59,570
The end.

351
00:19:10,346 --> 00:19:12,413
Horsey, you saved my life.

352
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:15,162
No problem, Peter. Glad to help out.

353
00:19:15,218 --> 00:19:17,180
Wow! Gilbert Gottfried.

354
00:19:17,188 --> 00:19:19,031
- That's right!
- Awesome.

355
00:19:23,368 --> 00:19:27,813
Now the final contestant for our
talent portion of the competition,

356
00:19:27,898 --> 00:19:29,370
Stephanie Griffin.

357
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,043
Thank you, thank you.

358
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:33,492
Hey, what's the deal
with Chunky bars, huh?

359
00:19:33,498 --> 00:19:35,551
Chocolate with raisins in it?

360
00:19:35,556 --> 00:19:38,183
Yeah, that's what kids want with their chocolate-- fruit.

361
00:19:40,468 --> 00:19:41,932
Wow, that bit is killing.

362
00:19:41,938 --> 00:19:44,293
Hey, Lois, great news.
We can go back to Quahog.

363
00:19:44,338 --> 00:19:47,850
I know, Brian. Shh!
We're about to see if Stewie won.

364
00:19:47,857 --> 00:19:49,153
Wait a minute. You know?

365
00:19:49,467 --> 00:19:52,841
- How long have you known?
- A few weeks. Who cares?

366
00:19:52,848 --> 00:19:54,722
Wait a minute. You...
you've known for weeks,

367
00:19:54,738 --> 00:19:56,763
and you've been lying
about having to stay here?

368
00:19:56,808 --> 00:19:58,210
Brian, don't you see?

369
00:19:58,216 --> 00:20:01,150
This is a wholesome
community with real values.

370
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:04,142
And our firstrunner-up is...

371
00:20:04,146 --> 00:20:07,133
Miss Dixie-Ann Thomas.

372
00:20:07,175 --> 00:20:12,933
Which means that Miss Stephanie Griffin
is our new Little Miss Texas!

373
00:20:16,495 --> 00:20:19,381
Oh! Oh, my God!
Oh, I never expected this.

374
00:20:19,387 --> 00:20:21,701
Oh, I'm so, so honored.

375
00:20:23,745 --> 00:20:25,781
Hey, that's not a girl!

376
00:20:25,786 --> 00:20:27,140
It's Enrico Palazzo!

377
00:20:27,146 --> 00:20:29,870
No, it's not!It's one of them queerosexuals!

378
00:20:29,877 --> 00:20:30,793
Get him!

379
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:37,691
Quick! Get on!

380
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:50,293
- Thank you for all your help.
- My pleasure, Peter. Anytime.

381
00:20:50,298 --> 00:20:52,971
Oh, fantastic.
Hey, do you still do stand-up?

382
00:20:52,977 --> 00:20:56,080
- I do. I'm still touring.
- Oh, wow. Can we get tickets?

383
00:20:56,085 --> 00:20:58,711
Absolutely. I'm in Atlanta next week.

384
00:20:58,755 --> 00:21:00,660
Great. Oh, well,this will be fun.

385
00:21:07,026 --> 00:21:09,230
It is so good to be home.

386
00:21:09,305 --> 00:21:12,932
You know, I wanted us to live
in a place with real family values.

387
00:21:12,977 --> 00:21:16,651
But values don't come from where
you live or who your friends are.

388
00:21:16,698 --> 00:21:19,730
They come from inside,
from your own beliefs.

389
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:21,483
I agree, Lois.
Like, for instance,

390
00:21:21,485 --> 00:21:25,271
if you're watching a TV show and
you decide to take your values from that,

391
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,482
you're an idiot.

392
00:21:26,516 --> 00:21:30,312
Maybe you should take responsibility
for what values your kids are getting.

393
00:21:30,335 --> 00:21:33,830
Maybe you shouldn't be letting your kids
watch certain shows in the first place

394
00:21:33,847 --> 00:21:37,413
if you have such a big problem with them,
instead of blaming the shows themselves.

395
00:21:39,285 --> 00:21:40,611
Yeah
