11
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:36,176
What are you doing to Dad?

12
00:00:36,177 --> 00:00:38,245
What? I'm going to the grocery store.

13
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,580
Okay, you remember <i>Memento?</i> That.

14
00:00:40,581 --> 00:00:42,016
Don't forget the cucumbers, Peter.

15
00:00:42,017 --> 00:00:43,717
All right. Where's that?

16
00:00:43,718 --> 00:00:46,086
Oh, hey, right, 'cause of
that thing we started doing.

17
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,688
By the way, speaking of
which, best "O" ever.

18
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:50,724
I felt dirty for an hour,
but it's gone now.

19
00:00:50,725 --> 00:00:52,192
Now I just can't wait for night.

20
00:00:52,193 --> 00:00:54,027
I wish you hadn't said
that at full volume

21
00:00:54,028 --> 00:00:56,021
in front of our children.

22
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:58,232
I can't tell if they have
a really good marriage

23
00:00:58,233 --> 00:00:59,632
or a really bad one.

24
00:00:59,633 --> 00:01:01,916
I feel like it's weird but strong.

25
00:01:01,917 --> 00:01:03,370
Like Danny Trejo.

26
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:05,757
Thank you for noticing.

27
00:01:11,462 --> 00:01:14,414
You ready for movie
marathon day, Rupert?

28
00:01:14,415 --> 00:01:16,583
Ah, I was born ready, too.

29
00:01:16,584 --> 00:01:18,452
All right, time for <i>Fast and the Furious</i>

30
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:19,887
one through seven.

31
00:01:19,888 --> 00:01:22,122
All right, let's get (BLEEP) high.

32
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,958
You can't be high for this, Brian.

33
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,224
This is serious stuff.

34
00:01:25,225 --> 00:01:27,126
This is a 14-hour meditation

35
00:01:27,127 --> 00:01:29,729
on the importance of family, fast cars,

36
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,777
product placement, racial
ambiguity and family.

37
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:35,302
Where's eight? Didn't
that one just come out?

38
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,471
<i>Someone</i> said they were
going to get me eight

39
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,973
on Blu-ray for my birthday,

40
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:41,275
and<i> someone</i> got me a limited edition

41
00:01:41,276 --> 00:01:43,977
Michael Kors pebbled
leather tote bag instead.

42
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,964
- You love that bag.
- I know. You're the best.

43
00:01:45,965 --> 00:01:47,557
Okay, put in<i> Fast 6.</i>

44
00:01:47,558 --> 00:01:48,748
You're starting with six?

45
00:01:48,749 --> 00:01:51,418
Um, yeah. We're going in
order from best to worst.

46
00:01:51,419 --> 00:01:54,188
Six, five, seven, three... I
know that's controversial...

47
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:55,789
One, four, two.

48
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,024
By the way, don't tell Rupert

49
00:01:57,025 --> 00:01:58,993
about Paul Walker being D-E-A-D.

50
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:00,087
He doesn't know.

51
00:02:02,447 --> 00:02:03,797
All right. So, what's the plot?

52
00:02:03,798 --> 00:02:06,934
Oh, you don't understand these movies.

53
00:02:09,037 --> 00:02:10,504
What was that, Rupert?

54
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:11,715
Oh, yes.

55
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,604
Yes.

56
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:15,327
No.

57
00:02:15,943 --> 00:02:18,096
I don't know. Maybe? Maybe bi?

58
00:02:18,779 --> 00:02:21,279
That's Ludacris. That's not Tyrese.

59
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,984
What are you talking about?
They look nothing alike.

60
00:02:22,985 --> 00:02:24,724
Ludacris looks like a human peanut,

61
00:02:24,725 --> 00:02:26,153
and Tyrese looks slick.

62
00:02:26,154 --> 00:02:27,941
He looks like a Chinese black.

63
00:02:27,942 --> 00:02:29,828
Like Africa and Asia had sex

64
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:31,358
while Europe sat on a chair

65
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,410
in the corner of the
hotel room and watched.

66
00:02:33,411 --> 00:02:36,030
Ludacris, human peanut.
Tyrese, Chinese black.

67
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,998
Are you gonna keep talking like
this during the whole thing?

68
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:39,806
What? I'm answering Rupert's questions.

69
00:02:39,807 --> 00:02:41,173
Now we're gonna have to rewind.

70
00:02:41,174 --> 00:02:43,637
We just missed the scene where
half the team steals a tank

71
00:02:43,638 --> 00:02:45,873
while the other half pretends
to be a DJ for some reason.

72
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,206
- Damn it.
- Yeah, okay.

73
00:02:47,207 --> 00:02:49,043
- I'm going to the bar.
- Suit yourself.

74
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,303
Rupert and I are just fine without you.

75
00:02:52,404 --> 00:02:53,479
You're right.

76
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,914
I bet he is on his period.

77
00:02:54,915 --> 00:02:56,650
Whatever that means.

78
00:02:56,651 --> 00:02:58,052
La, la, la, la. Stop, stop, stop, stop.

79
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,353
Gross, gross, gross. Ew, ew, ew.

80
00:02:59,354 --> 00:03:01,284
No, no, no. No. Ew. Ew.

81
00:03:01,285 --> 00:03:03,590
A loaf of bread, a container of milk

82
00:03:03,591 --> 00:03:05,592
and a stick of butter.

83
00:03:05,593 --> 00:03:07,928
A loaf of milk, a container of bread

84
00:03:07,929 --> 00:03:10,097
and a<i> Joe Dirt</i> DVD.

85
00:03:10,098 --> 00:03:12,699
A<i> Joe Dirt</i> DVD, Scarlett Johansson

86
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,919
and treasure from a fish tank.

87
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:18,906
<i> Attention, shoppers.</i>

88
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,174
<i>Beloved cereal icon Boo Berry</i>

89
00:03:21,175 --> 00:03:23,494
<i>is now greeting customers in aisle six.</i>

90
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:25,446
Boo Berry?

91
00:03:25,447 --> 00:03:26,747
<i>The</i> Boo Berry?

92
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,749
<i>Are there imposter Boo Berries?</i>

93
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,028
Hey, watch it.

94
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:33,353
Oh, Mr. Boo Berry, I'm your biggest fan.

95
00:03:33,354 --> 00:03:34,955
You're not the one threatening me

96
00:03:34,956 --> 00:03:36,090
on Facebook, are you?

97
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:39,126
No, no. No, not-not you. Not you.

98
00:03:39,127 --> 00:03:41,195
Hey, you know what I always
loved about your cereal?

99
00:03:41,196 --> 00:03:42,955
It tasted like blueberries.

100
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,898
Oh, my God.<i> Boo Berries.</i>

101
00:03:44,899 --> 00:03:46,475
And you're... and you're a ghost.

102
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,935
'Cause... So that-that's the "boo."

103
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,271
Did you guys know you were
doing that? Oh, my God.

104
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:52,440
- Anyway, can I shake your hand?
- Sure.

105
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:11,892
I've been touched by greatness.

106
00:04:11,893 --> 00:04:14,561
I am never washing this hand again.

107
00:04:14,562 --> 00:04:16,262
This is the best thing to happen to me

108
00:04:16,263 --> 00:04:17,831
since I became a wisecracking,

109
00:04:17,832 --> 00:04:20,176
fourth-wall-breaking superhero.

110
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,635
Call me Redstool.

111
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,070
The treatment didn't give me powers,

112
00:04:23,071 --> 00:04:25,172

125
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,343
You okay if I go to bed?

126
00:05:04,344 --> 00:05:07,505
Oh, I like that we're comfortable
doing things separately, too.

127
00:05:07,506 --> 00:05:08,585
Good night.

128

Do me a favor and don't wake
me when you come up, though.

129
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,653
Yes, you do. You always
step on the creaky board.

130
00:05:13,654 --> 00:05:15,819
Yes, you do. Every time.

131
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,901
No,<i> you're</i> being a little bitch.

Defuse. Defuse.

135
00:05:24,307 --> 00:05:25,866
Rupert, I'm sorry.

136
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,300
I overreacted.

137
00:05:27,301 --> 00:05:28,679
Now you say you're sorry.

138
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,208
What do you mean, "For what"?

139
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:31,258
I hate you!

140
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,748
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

141
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:37,578
I love you. I value you.

142
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:39,312
We're not escalating. It's fine.

143
00:05:39,313 --> 00:05:40,980
I'll see you in the morning.

144
00:05:40,981 --> 00:05:42,092
Good night.

145

00:06:42,043 --> 00:06:43,758
This is getting embarrassing.

164
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,868
Murderer!

165
00:06:53,869 --> 00:06:55,330
You killed Rupert.

166
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,136
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

167
00:06:57,137 --> 00:06:58,497
Hey, whoa. Hey, what's going on?

168
00:06:58,498 --> 00:07:01,566
You killed my best friend
is what's going on.

169
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:03,502
Oh. Uh-oh.

170
00:07:03,503 --> 00:07:04,936
Bear-killing bastard.

171
00:07:04,937 --> 00:07:07,506
Oh, my God. Stewie, I am so sorry.

172
00:07:07,507 --> 00:07:09,074
I-I was drunk. It was an accident.

173
00:07:09,075 --> 00:07:10,809
I must have thought he was a chew toy.

174
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,978
So? If you were driving
drunk and ran him over,

175
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:14,412
would you still go to jail?

176
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:15,814
Yes! You killed him.

177
00:07:15,815 --> 00:07:17,249
Let me make it up to you, please.

178
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,830
How about you kill something I love?

179
00:07:18,831 --> 00:07:20,117
How about I do that?

180
00:07:20,118 --> 00:07:21,996
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.

181
00:07:21,997 --> 00:07:23,884
Okay, that's-that's fine. That's fair.

182
00:07:23,885 --> 00:07:25,357
No, I-I meant, like-like...

183
00:07:25,358 --> 00:07:26,825
like my favorite tennis ball.

184
00:07:26,826 --> 00:07:29,531
You're comparing Rupert
to a tennis ball?

185
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,783
What is wrong with you?

186
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,251
No wonder you two never got along.

187
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:34,395
He always knew there was
something off about you,

188
00:07:34,396 --> 00:07:36,564
and now we know what it
was. You're a psycho!

189
00:07:36,565 --> 00:07:38,032
- Stewie, I didn't mean to...
- Shut up!

190
00:07:38,033 --> 00:07:40,134
- You don't understand. I...
- Shut up.

191
00:07:40,135 --> 00:07:42,702
Stop trying. It's over.

192
00:07:42,703 --> 00:07:44,238
Look at me. Watch. See what I'm doing?

193
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:45,973
Twitter: unfollow.

194
00:07:45,974 --> 00:07:47,741
Instagram: unfollow.

195
00:07:47,742 --> 00:07:49,577
Snapchat: unfollow.

196
00:07:49,578 --> 00:07:51,645
And there we go. Done.

197
00:07:51,646 --> 00:07:53,347
We are not friends anymore.

198
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:54,749
- But, Stewie...
- Bye.

199
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,916
Dikembe Mutombo, will you do the thing?

200
00:07:56,917 --> 00:07:59,200
Brian, you are blocked.

201
00:08:08,424 --> 00:08:11,031
Why are you brushing your
teeth with your left hand?

202
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,410
Can't risk the right getting wet, Lois.

203
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:16,770
Boo Berry touched it, and it is now
a sacred space, like a temple.

204
00:08:16,771 --> 00:08:18,739
Okay. Well, I'm gonna
have middle-aged woman,

205
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,509
boobs-falling-off-to-the-side sleep now.

206
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:30,851
Hey, Chris, have you seen...

207
00:08:30,852 --> 00:08:32,952
What, uh... what-what are you doing?

208
00:08:32,953 --> 00:08:36,165
Operating my thriving
<i>quinceañera</i> dress business.

209
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,758
Do me a favor, stand on that chair?

210
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:40,226
Uh, okay.

211
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:41,962
So, what's up?

212
00:08:41,963 --> 00:08:43,764
I'm looking for Stewie.
He and I had a fight,

213
00:08:43,765 --> 00:08:45,633
and I'm scared he might've
done something drastic.

214
00:08:45,634 --> 00:08:46,900
Him?

215
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,468
You're the one who killed his friend.

216
00:08:48,469 --> 00:08:50,971
Okay, I see he got to you before I did.

217
00:08:50,972 --> 00:08:52,706
It's a stuffed animal, Chris.

218
00:08:52,707 --> 00:08:55,042
Yeah, well, he cremated
that stuffed animal,

219
00:08:55,043 --> 00:08:57,912
and he's going to Vermont
to scatter the ashes.

220
00:08:57,913 --> 00:08:59,613
What? I got to go after him.

221
00:08:59,614 --> 00:09:01,615
Not until I finish fitting this.

222
00:09:01,616 --> 00:09:03,451
How you feeling?<i> Bueno?</i> Fits good?

223
00:09:03,452 --> 00:09:04,543
This isn't mine.

224
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,489
Do you or do you not feel<i> bonita?</i>

225
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:09,323
I feel<i> bonita.</i>

226
00:09:09,324 --> 00:09:11,800
Wonderful, because you look<i> bonita.</i>

227
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:15,847
<i>Gracias, cariña, puedes
recogerlo el miércoles.</i>

228
00:09:16,816 --> 00:09:20,143
Pablo is gonna lose his mind.

229
00:09:21,136 --> 00:09:22,270
Mwah.

230
00:09:27,493 --> 00:09:28,676
Stewie!

231
00:09:28,677 --> 00:09:30,577
Hmm. Well, violent murderers

232
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:32,111
can often be found at bus stations,

233
00:09:32,112 --> 00:09:33,313
so why am I surprised?

234
00:09:33,314 --> 00:09:34,981
You can't go to Vermont alone.

235
00:09:34,982 --> 00:09:36,842
I'm not. Got Rupert with me.

236
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:38,284
He and I had an agreement,

237
00:09:38,285 --> 00:09:41,154
if he died first, I would scatter
his ashes on a mountain.

238
00:09:41,155 --> 00:09:43,524
If I died first, he would
throw my body whole

239
00:09:43,525 --> 00:09:45,125
into the fountain at the Bellagio.

240
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,660
I don't care. I'm coming with you.

241
00:09:46,661 --> 00:09:48,095
Well, you're not going to sit with me.

242
00:09:48,096 --> 00:09:49,697
Oh, come on. If I don't, I'll get stuck

243
00:09:49,698 --> 00:09:51,448
next to that guy with the heavy hands.

244
00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:53,100
Hi, doggy.

245
00:09:54,336 --> 00:09:55,719
Serves you right.

246
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,004
And a baby.

247
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,642
I can hear you following me.

248
00:10:27,643 --> 00:10:29,181
- Good.
- I swear to God,

249
00:10:29,182 --> 00:10:30,538
do not take one step further,

250
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:32,091
or I<i> will</i> hit you.

251
00:10:33,323 --> 00:10:34,341
That's it!

252
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,156
Leave! Me! Alone! Murderer!

253
00:10:38,157 --> 00:10:39,513
Stewie, stop! Stop, all right?

254
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:42,057
Look, why are you being such
a jerk over a stupid bear?

255
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,051
Don't you disrespect the dead!

256
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:50,558
Aah!

257
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:54,028
Aah!

258
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:57,948
He's not dead! He was never alive!

259
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,296
You take those words back!

260
00:10:59,297 --> 00:11:01,669
He wouldn't care! He didn't
hear them! He's a doll!

261
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,121
He was my best friend!

262
00:11:04,338 --> 00:11:06,465
<i>I'm</i> supposed to be your best friend.

263
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:07,507
Well, you're not!

264
00:11:07,508 --> 00:11:10,002
You're a bloodthirsty,
cold-hearted murderer!

265
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,345
Fine. You're right.

266
00:11:11,346 --> 00:11:12,963
You know what? It wasn't an accident.

267
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,631
I knew he wasn't a chew toy.

268
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,550
I was sick of you talking
to him all the time.

269
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:18,452
I was sick of you
complaining to him about me

270
00:11:18,453 --> 00:11:19,720
when I'm right there in the room.

271
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,690
And I was sick of always playing
second fiddle to that bear!

272
00:11:22,691 --> 00:11:24,918
He's not even real!

273
00:11:25,627 --> 00:11:27,094
You did it...

274
00:11:27,712 --> 00:11:29,214
on purpose?

275
00:11:40,213 --> 00:11:41,451
Stewie!

276
00:11:43,785 --> 00:11:45,363
Oh, my God, Stewie!

277
00:11:47,995 --> 00:11:49,918
Ah, I didn't know we were blowing it up.

278
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,743
Rupert! Where...

279
00:11:59,744 --> 00:12:00,824
Oh, there you are.

280
00:12:01,413 --> 00:12:03,304
- Stewie, you're hurt.
- It's just my ankle.

281
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:05,483
- It's not a big deal.
- It's already swelling up.

282
00:12:05,484 --> 00:12:07,051
- Just let me...
- Back off!

283
00:12:07,052 --> 00:12:09,085
I'm doing this on my own. For Rupert.

284
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,749
Damn it, Stewie, just...

285
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,219
just sit there, will ya?

286
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,403
I'll-I'll get us up.

287
00:12:18,895 --> 00:12:20,498
I didn't want your help.

288
00:12:20,499 --> 00:12:22,117
Well, you need it, so it's happening.

289
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,805
This isn't going to make
me forgive you, you know.

290
00:12:27,806 --> 00:12:28,823
That's fine.

291
00:12:28,824 --> 00:12:30,441
I'm going to say uncomplimentary things

292
00:12:30,442 --> 00:12:33,243
- about your ass the whole way.
- Go ahead.

293
00:12:33,244 --> 00:12:35,847
You know, maybe it's appropriate
that you're my ride up.

294
00:12:35,848 --> 00:12:38,081
Rupert always called you my "bitch."

295
00:12:38,082 --> 00:12:40,017
Want to know some of the
other things he called you?

296
00:12:40,018 --> 00:12:41,419
Fat Lassie.

297
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,753
Scooby-Don't.

298
00:12:42,754 --> 00:12:44,121
Rin Tin Twink.

299
00:12:44,122 --> 00:12:45,355
Poopy Snoopy.

300
00:12:45,356 --> 00:12:46,990
Marma-dookie.

301
00:12:46,991 --> 00:12:49,660
Clifford the Big Red Sphincter
That We See All the Time

302
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:51,662
Because You Don't Put Your Tail Down.

303
00:12:51,663 --> 00:12:53,616
Snoop Doggy Dick.

304
00:12:57,237 --> 00:12:58,237
Hey, guys.

305
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:06,944
- What the hell is that?
- My Boo Berry hand.

306
00:13:06,945 --> 00:13:08,546
I swore I'd never wash it again,

307
00:13:08,547 --> 00:13:10,113
even though Lois keeps telling me to.

308
00:13:10,114 --> 00:13:11,549
You should listen to her.

309
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,117
Yeah, Peter, that's disgusting.

310
00:13:13,118 --> 00:13:15,121
- Oh, yeah? Take that!
- Aah!

311
00:13:15,122 --> 00:13:17,301
That started happening yesterday.

312
00:13:17,302 --> 00:13:19,557
To the bathroom!

313
00:13:19,558 --> 00:13:21,291
We got to get him to wash that hand.

314
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:22,693
Yeah. I'll text Lois,

315
00:13:22,694 --> 00:13:24,695
see if we can't all
come up with something.

316
00:13:24,696 --> 00:13:26,363
Just reply to that last GIF she sent

317
00:13:26,364 --> 00:13:28,165
of the sloth putting on the headphones.

318
00:13:29,401 --> 00:13:30,902
I love that one.

319
00:13:30,903 --> 00:13:32,837
Is it weird that we're in a group text

320
00:13:32,838 --> 00:13:34,872
with our friend's wife
but not our friend?

321
00:13:34,873 --> 00:13:37,375
No, what's weird is that
your Bitmoji can walk.

322
00:13:37,376 --> 00:13:40,411
I'm allowed to have legs
in the phone world!

323
00:13:47,232 --> 00:13:50,105
You know, once we're done here,
I'm never speaking to you again.

324
00:13:50,106 --> 00:13:51,738
Well, how the hell was
I supposed to know

325
00:13:51,739 --> 00:13:53,039
it was gonna upset you so much?

326
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,075
How? How?!

327
00:13:55,076 --> 00:13:57,632
You saw me spend almost
every single minute

328
00:13:57,633 --> 00:14:00,380
of every single day with
Rupert since I was born!

329
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,141
And you don't... up-up,
hang on, hang on.

330
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:03,167
Another hiker going by.

331
00:14:03,168 --> 00:14:04,835
One of us is going the wrong way. Heh.

332
00:14:04,836 --> 00:14:07,704
Ha-ha-ha! When are they gonna
put in the elevator, right?

333
00:14:07,705 --> 00:14:08,805
Ha-ha-ha.

334
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:09,840
I loved Rupert!

335
00:14:09,841 --> 00:14:11,776
He was the most important
thing in my life,

336
00:14:11,777 --> 00:14:14,111
and you willfully violated
the sanctity and trust

337
00:14:14,112 --> 00:14:16,247
of our friendship when
you destroyed him!

338
00:14:16,248 --> 00:14:18,690
Stewie... I just don't get it.

339
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,611
You're so mature in so many ways.

340
00:14:20,612 --> 00:14:22,353
You're... you're the smartest
person in the house.

341
00:14:22,354 --> 00:14:24,104
You're incredibly perceptive.

342
00:14:24,105 --> 00:14:26,823
You're wiser than people
40 times your age.

343
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,776
Why is Rupert the one baby
thing you're hanging onto?

344
00:14:29,777 --> 00:14:31,511
Why are you so upset over a doll

345
00:14:31,512 --> 00:14:33,246
when I'm real and I'm still here?

346
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,874
Because Rupert was going
to be with me forever!

347
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,835
He wasn't ever going to leave!

348
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:41,046
So what? I'm not leaving you, either.

349
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,006
Oh, really? Brian, let's be honest.

350
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,382
You're a middle-aged dog.

351
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,051
You don't have that many years left.

352
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,637
And one day, all too soon,
I'm gonna be crying

353
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,376
at your funeral in an Armani suit,

354
00:14:50,377 --> 00:14:52,268
and people are gonna be
like, "Oh, nice suit,"

355
00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:53,674
and I'm gonna be like,
"Why are you talking

356
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:56,786
about my awesome $2,000
suit... my friend's dead!"

357
00:14:56,787 --> 00:14:58,122
Feels like that story is less about me

358
00:14:58,123 --> 00:14:59,490
and more about your suit.

359
00:14:59,491 --> 00:15:01,691
Go to hell! Besides,
if you don't believe

360
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,261
Rupert was real, why are
you so jealous of him?

361
00:15:04,262 --> 00:15:06,797
Why does it bother you how upset I am?

362
00:15:06,798 --> 00:15:07,864
That...

363
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,599
is a very good point.

364
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,703
Damn right it is, you joyless,
fake-wisdom-spouting...

365
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:15,539
Hey. Heh. When are they gonna put
in the elevator, right? Heh.

366
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,808
Yeah. That other guy said that to me.

367
00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:19,068
Nice shorts.

368
00:15:23,865 --> 00:15:25,849
For the record, I would have preferred

369
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,550
to dress as Frankenburry.

370
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,884
- That doesn't make any sense.
- And this does?

371
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:31,722
If anything, we all three should've been

372
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:33,490
Snap, Crackle and Pop.

373
00:15:33,491 --> 00:15:36,576
Yeah, we missed an opportunity there.

374
00:15:36,577 --> 00:15:38,395
- It's fine.
- We did this wrong!

375
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,689
Joe, it's fine. It's...
Cleveland, just ring the bell.

376
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,816
Oh, I wonder who that could be.

377
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:44,886
I'll get it.

378
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,919
- Oh, my God!
- Count Chocula!

379
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,074
That's right.

380
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:54,978
Silly rabbit, Count
Chocula tastes grrreat!

381
00:15:54,979 --> 00:15:57,714
Oh, it's an honor to meet you, sir.

382
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,918
Aah!

383
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,020
- Wh-What's happening?
- We got you, Peter.

384
00:16:03,021 --> 00:16:04,855
Yeah, there's a golf
ball scrubber in there.

385
00:16:04,856 --> 00:16:06,145
Just relax and let it happen.

386
00:16:06,146 --> 00:16:07,758
No! No!

387
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,412
My miraculous tiny life-forms!

388
00:16:28,063 --> 00:16:29,680
Where are we going, Father?

389
00:16:29,681 --> 00:16:32,116
To a place better than this, son.

390
00:16:33,635 --> 00:16:35,285
Yay!

391
00:16:48,483 --> 00:16:50,601
Well, Rupert, we made it.

392
00:16:50,602 --> 00:16:51,953
It's beautiful up here.

393
00:16:52,937 --> 00:16:55,221
So should... should we just...

394
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,040
sprinkle him around randomly, or...?

395
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,610
Oh, don't be a savage,
Brian. What is your problem?

396
00:16:59,611 --> 00:17:01,464
We have to have the ceremony first.

397
00:17:02,831 --> 00:17:04,555
Dearest Rupert,

398
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:05,647
we're here.

399
00:17:06,494 --> 00:17:08,285
I never wanted this to happen,

400
00:17:08,286 --> 00:17:10,703
and it happened far, far too soon.

401
00:17:10,704 --> 00:17:11,955
But...

402
00:17:11,956 --> 00:17:13,187
I can't.

403
00:17:14,092 --> 00:17:15,959
You... you do it.

404
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,227
Wha... What?

405
00:17:17,228 --> 00:17:20,097
You give the eulogy. I'm
too upset. I can't.

406
00:17:20,098 --> 00:17:21,632
What am I supposed to say?

407
00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:24,067
I don't know, Just...
just tell the truth.

408
00:17:24,068 --> 00:17:27,638
Let-let Rupert know how important he is.

409
00:17:27,639 --> 00:17:29,458
Okay, um...

410
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,975
Rupert was...

411
00:17:31,976 --> 00:17:33,977
a-a great bear,

412
00:17:33,978 --> 00:17:36,413
uh, a great, uh...

413
00:17:36,414 --> 00:17:38,782
- Power bottom.
- Right, right, okay.

414
00:17:38,783 --> 00:17:42,653
But most importantly of
all, he was a great friend.

415
00:17:42,654 --> 00:17:45,355
He was always there
whenever Stewie needed him.

416
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,524
He was understanding.

417
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:48,781
He always listened.

418
00:17:49,362 --> 00:17:51,287
He made Stewie a better person.

419
00:17:52,555 --> 00:17:53,597
Stewie...

420
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,967
and I are both...

421
00:17:56,434 --> 00:17:59,436
incredibly grateful for all
the time we had with you,

422
00:17:59,437 --> 00:18:02,039
and we wouldn't change a single moment.

423
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,774
Except the end.

424
00:18:03,775 --> 00:18:04,975
Sorry about that.

425
00:18:04,976 --> 00:18:07,445
Um, rest in peace, Rupert.

426
00:18:17,872 --> 00:18:19,498
Thank you, Brian.

427
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:21,333
That was...

428
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:23,294
