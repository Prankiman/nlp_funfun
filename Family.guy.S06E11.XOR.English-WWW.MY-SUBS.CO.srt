4
00:00:39,776 --> 00:00:41,309
Hey, Stewie, you ready to go home?

5
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,302
About an hour ago.

6
00:00:42,303 --> 00:00:43,535
This party sucks.

7
00:00:43,536 --> 00:00:44,602
What happened to your face?

8
00:00:44,603 --> 00:00:46,012
I'a ttcat.

9
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:48,684
Stupid face-painters apparently
never heard of Darth Maul.

10
00:00:48,685 --> 00:00:51,205
This party's worse than
a Mexican funeral.

11
00:00:51,355 --> 00:00:55,808
Es con mucho dolor que digamos
adios a Javier..

12
00:00:56,065 --> 00:01:01,660
y Pepe y Carlos y Lupe, y otra Lu.

13
00:01:01,664 --> 00:01:05,369
Ivor Faan, Jesus, Maria,

14
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:09,004
Vincente, y los perros de Vincente.

15
00:01:17,956 --> 00:01:19,451
Come on. Let's get out of here, Ban.

16
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:20,981
Wait. Hang on a second.

17
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:22,163
Who's that?

18
00:01:25,276 --> 00:01:26,491
That's Jared's mom.

19
00:01:26,496 --> 00:01:27,980
Her husband died in Iraq.

20
00:01:27,985 --> 00:01:28,842
Really?

21
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:31,511
No, wait. He was either
wounded or killed.

22
00:01:31,515 --> 00:01:32,151
don't remember.

23
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:33,872
Well, which is it, Stewie,
wounded or killed?

24
00:01:33,878 --> 00:01:34,620
I can work with either.

25
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:35,660
No, no, he's dead.
He's dead.

26
00:01:35,668 --> 00:01:36,981
Just like the Pink Panther.

27
00:01:37,688 --> 00:01:39,121
What's wrong with him, Doctor?

28
00:01:39,126 --> 00:01:41,480
Well, it seems his lungs
are completely filled

29
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,051
with Owens-Corning fiberglass insulation.

30
00:01:44,056 --> 00:01:44,772
What?!

31
00:01:44,936 --> 00:01:45,971
Will he be okay?

32
00:01:45,977 --> 00:01:47,653
Noheon bok.

33
00:01:47,658 --> 00:01:51,623
One-third of his body weight is
Owens-Corning fiberglass insulation.

34
00:01:53,806 --> 00:01:55,221
llth'st.

35
00:01:55,226 --> 00:01:58,503
But don't worry, he won't
burn in hell thanks to all that

36
00:01:58,505 --> 00:02:00,962
Owens-Corning fiberglass insulation.

37
00:02:03,087 --> 00:02:05,690
How about at gianhu Yeah, he's great.

38
00:02:05,746 --> 00:02:06,960
I love magicians.

39
00:02:07,056 --> 00:02:10,130
I don't know why, but I've
always found magic very sexy.

40
00:02:10,136 --> 00:02:10,972
I'm a magician.

41
00:02:10,986 --> 00:02:11,673
You are?

42
00:02:11,885 --> 00:02:13,190
How long have you been doing magic?

43
00:02:13,196 --> 00:02:14,412
Oh, long time.

44
00:02:14,415 --> 00:02:15,761
I used to work with Doug Henning.

45
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:16,471
Wow.

46
00:02:16,576 --> 00:02:18,460
Yeah. Want to e Dg nng?

47
00:02:19,026 --> 00:02:20,872
Welcome to the wonderful world of magic.

48
00:02:20,876 --> 00:02:22,641
Hope I don't get AIDS.

49
00:02:23,506 --> 00:02:25,990
Oh, God, that is so my humor.

50
00:02:25,998 --> 00:02:29,052
You know, my son's birthday party
is next weekend.

51
00:02:29,195 --> 00:02:31,332
Any chance I can hire you
to do your act?

52
00:02:31,335 --> 00:02:32,630
Absolutely!

53
00:02:32,665 --> 00:02:34,961
I think the magis arngo pp already.

54
00:02:36,215 --> 00:02:37,890
Brian, this is painful.

55
00:02:37,895 --> 00:02:39,893
It's like listening to those
two foreign guys

56
00:02:39,925 --> 00:02:42,202
down at the coffee shop o' bn vi ithU.

57
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:44,082
almost long enough to sound American.

58
00:02:44,267 --> 00:02:47,922
Oh, man, what a good bunch of
partying at that discotheque.

59
00:02:47,928 --> 00:02:49,740
eylad e mauence requests.

60
00:02:49,746 --> 00:02:50,741
Way awesome.

61
00:02:50,756 --> 00:02:53,340
I myself drank, like,
five liters of beer.

62
00:02:53,346 --> 00:02:55,932
Any more and I would have
ended up in hospital, man.

63
00:02:55,935 --> 00:03:00,510
Ohyosa ifrnd to stay 'cause I
almost hadsex on this girl.

64
00:03:00,516 --> 00:03:02,841
Oh, yeah! But itwas soxpsive.

65
00:03:02,845 --> 00:03:05,233
Each drink was, like,x lls.

66
00:03:08,507 --> 00:03:09,771
And if I've donethis right,

67
00:03:09,925 --> 00:03:12,572
then this isyour car Swi

68
00:03:12,747 --> 00:03:14,732
Really, Brian?Card tricks?

69
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,713
That's what's gonna close
the deal with this woman?

70
00:03:16,717 --> 00:03:17,890
Well, yeah.Why not?

71
00:03:17,905 --> 00:03:19,772
You need more than t u need an act.

72
00:03:19,776 --> 00:03:22,602
Listen, I'll beyour assistant,
and we'll put on a whole big show.

73
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:23,102
Really?

74
00:03:23,107 --> 00:03:24,440
Yeah, we'll doall the great tricks.

75
00:03:24,446 --> 00:03:25,971
You can evensplit me in half.

76
00:03:25,976 --> 00:03:27,261
What?w iha.

77
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:29,302
Well, I am still a little
shaky on some of this stuff.

78
00:03:29,306 --> 00:03:30,683
I guess I coulduse the help.

79
00:03:30,687 --> 00:03:33,440
Great. And we'll get youa wand,
a top hat and a cape.

80
00:03:33,525 --> 00:03:36,582
In fact, you can use Peter's cape
from last year'sHaeen costume.

81
00:03:36,798 --> 00:03:37,620
Hi, Brian.

82
00:03:37,726 --> 00:03:40,802
I'm Count Crotchula,the bulging vampire.

83
00:03:40,847 --> 00:03:44,301
I'll bite your neck,
but also look w gamowthe.

84
00:03:44,337 --> 00:03:45,771
That costume doesn'tmake any sense.

85
00:03:45,776 --> 00:03:47,700
Don't stiflemy creativity!

86
00:03:47,718 --> 00:03:49,360
See that bulgedown there, Brian.

87
00:03:49,368 --> 00:03:51,432

88
00:03:51,478 --> 00:03:54,613
Can't be my pointy teeth, 'cause
those areall the way up here.

89
00:03:55,097 --> 00:03:57,051
I'll let you inon a little secret.

90
00:03:57,986 --> 00:03:59,802
Happy Halloween.

91
00:04:02,996 --> 00:04:05,090
Okay, kids, it's time forthe magic show.

92
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:09,312
Hoabt birod applause for The Amazing Brian?!

93
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:11,503
Yay!I love magic!

94
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:14,390
I can't believe I agreedto four costume changes.

95
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:17,540
Oh, who am I kidding?I insisted on it.

96
00:04:17,556 --> 00:04:19,420
Brian thanks so muchfor doing this.

97
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,070
Paul and I are so excitedto see your act.

98
00:04:22,077 --> 00:04:23,612
Oh, thank...Wait. What?

99
00:04:23,616 --> 00:04:25,093
Paul, my boyfriend.

100
00:04:25,226 --> 00:04:26,541
Paul, this is Brian.

101
00:04:26,547 --> 00:04:28,191
Boyfriend?!Oh, come on!

102
00:04:28,276 --> 00:04:30,142
I id80foalth crap!

103
00:04:30,148 --> 00:04:31,320
You have a boyfriend?!

104
00:04:31,326 --> 00:04:31,812
Yeah.

105
00:04:31,817 --> 00:04:32,921
And I'm a great guy.

106
00:04:32,926 --> 00:04:35,761
I'm unemployed, but that makes her feel
useful in the relationship.

107
00:04:35,766 --> 00:04:36,902
m nnfihi

108
00:04:36,906 --> 00:04:39,160
Our relationshipwill do fine on that basis.

109
00:04:39,197 --> 00:04:41,363
If he had his life together,
I wouldn'tbe into it.

110
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:42,141
But I don't.

111
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:44,181
God! I am so sickof this crap!

112
00:04:44,287 --> 00:04:45,532
Is this the show?

113
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:47,230
You know what?
The hell withboth of you!

114
00:04:47,237 --> 00:04:48,012
I'm outta here!

115
00:04:49,057 --> 00:04:50,503
Are we doing this thing or what?

116
00:04:50,508 --> 00:04:52,860
Brian? Brian?

117
00:04:53,337 --> 00:04:55,442
Well, this was a lot of effortfor nothing...

118
00:04:55,518 --> 00:04:58,581
like trying to tell
Matthew McConaughey how much he sucks.

119
00:04:58,586 --> 00:05:02,050
You know, Matthew, I-I may not
ever get otr an to say this,so I

120
00:05:02,055 --> 00:05:04,151
just want to get this offmy chest.

121
00:05:04,356 --> 00:05:06,442
You are just awful.

122
00:05:06,457 --> 00:05:09,750
You're one of the worst actors t hto ofi..

123
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:12,240
...and I think that you needto go away.

124
00:05:12,246 --> 00:05:13,092
Oh, thanks, man.

125
00:05:13,095 --> 00:05:16,483
The truth is I spend at least
90% of my year going away

126
00:05:16,486 --> 00:05:19,150
exploringexotic places,
having sex with mybeautiful

127
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:20,381
girlfriend,just doing sit-ups.

128
00:05:20,418 --> 00:05:22,253
I mean, I really...And then counting money.

129
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:25,220
Money that I made off thteib fmsat
I put out into the American

130
00:05:25,257 --> 00:05:27,252
populacebecause they just love to see me

131
00:05:27,297 --> 00:05:28,853
doing whatit is that I do.

132
00:05:28,857 --> 00:05:29,851
Yes, but you'renot hearing me.

133
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:32,852
Dazed anCous wathonthgthat was passable.

134
00:05:32,858 --> 00:05:34,030
After that...Oh, thanks, man.

135
00:05:34,076 --> 00:05:35,172
That actuallylaunched my care

136
00:05:35,215 --> 00:05:37,863
After that, everything elsewas awful.

137
00:05:37,898 --> 00:05:40,530
Contact, they didn't even need u
tt vi They could have donethe

138
00:05:40,536 --> 00:05:41,453
whole movie without you.

139
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:42,630
I know. I know. I saidthe same thing.

140
00:05:42,638 --> 00:05:44,623
but they're just, like,
"Oh, we need agood-looking guy "

141
00:05:44,628 --> 00:05:47,471
with a greaasanso thtbs "to just provide

142
00:05:47,506 --> 00:05:49,381
some down-home enthusiasmin this picture.

143
00:05:49,387 --> 00:05:51,222
Something to counterbalanceJodie Foster."

144
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:54,870
They took her to be,uh,
slightlyd, apoaab, you know?

145
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:55,720
So they put mein there.

146
00:05:55,724 --> 00:05:56,919
I said it didn'tmake any sense.

147
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:59,904
Said the, saidthe same thing about
hat Bill Murrayelephant movie,

148
00:05:59,946 --> 00:06:02,241
but they were just, like,"Oh, theudnc nd u.

149
00:06:03,109 --> 00:06:05,072
You make me physicallysick to my stomach,

150
00:06:05,106 --> 00:06:07,040
and I wish that you would get aheart attack.

151
00:06:07,047 --> 00:06:08,143
I totally feel you, man.

152
00:06:08,147 --> 00:06:11,112
Truth of the mte is I n'li my
movies either, but, man, they

153
00:06:11,117 --> 00:06:13,083
just keep offering me money

154
00:06:13,108 --> 00:06:14,982
and I do it and I get to go
around the world.

155
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:16,290
I mean, didyou see Sahara?

156
00:06:17,145 --> 00:06:19,232
te you whatthe move gave me was
an opportunity to take an

157
00:06:19,237 --> 00:06:20,803
Airstreamall across the country

158
00:06:20,846 --> 00:06:23,011
and sell that picture
one person at a time.

159
00:06:23,017 --> 00:06:24,480
You suck donkey ass.

160
00:06:24,488 --> 00:06:25,712
Now, you can'tprove that.

161
00:06:28,798 --> 00:06:30,403
That was so humiliating!

162
00:06:30,408 --> 00:06:33,562
I mean, look atall the stuff
I t se toujust to get laid.

163
00:06:33,566 --> 00:06:34,670
Oh, don't worry, my friend.

164
00:06:34,678 --> 00:06:36,403
One day you'll find your soul mate.

165
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:39,181
The sad thing is
I already did...years ago.

166
00:06:39,757 --> 00:06:44,001
Try anan She was the greatest
girl I ever met,and I blew it.

167
00:06:44,345 --> 00:06:45,283
You should look her up.

168
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:46,130
Oh, am I boring you?

169
00:06:46,137 --> 00:06:48,280
No, it's just...long day.

170
00:06:48,356 --> 00:06:50,023
Well, I suppose I could look her up.

171
00:06:50,106 --> 00:06:51,922
I just wonder if she'd even
want to see me.

172
00:06:52,018 --> 00:06:54,182
I wasn't exactly the nicest
guy in the world.

173
00:06:54,578 --> 00:06:58,591
And then, inghchl, I was
violated sexuallyby my father.

174
00:06:58,596 --> 00:07:02,060
It happened onnumerous occasions,
and I was too idto tell

175
00:07:02,107 --> 00:07:05,283
anyone because I felt like
somehow it w mfat.

176
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:09,503
So... you do goall the way.

177
00:07:15,905 --> 00:07:17,493
Well, here goes.

Analheanis to kiss you just one more time.

183
00:07:37,118 --> 00:07:40,920
Wow, you sure look...different than the last timeI saw you.

184
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:42,562

189
00:07:53,898 --> 00:07:55,230
From the lookat those toenails,

190
00:07:55,235 --> 00:07:57,592
I bet it's thatlittle Lamisil
monster.

191

00:08:35,995 --> 00:08:36,993
Oh, okay.

207
00:08:36,997 --> 00:08:38,210
That's kind of anodd thing to say.

208
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:40,770
Yeah, sort of a weird commentrit fntf

209
00:08:40,815 --> 00:08:42,413
l u Kinda thoughtthis was a team effort.

210
00:08:42,428 --> 00:08:45,492
Yeah, yeah.Really, really glad I risked my lifeand everything.

211
00:08:45,497 --> 00:08:48,323
Yeah, you're, like,five minutes from
gone and you leave with that?

212
00:08:48,335 --> 00:08:51,632
You know, it's likecutting a huge fart and then walkingout of the room.

213
00:08:51,717 --> 00:08:54,773
And that's how we'll remember you,as a big fart.

214
00:08:54,905 --> 00:08:56,453
Good-bye, big fart.

215
00:08:59,718 --> 00:09:03,213
So, Dylan, um, shouldn'tyou be in school?

216
00:09:03,225 --> 00:09:04,061
I doknow.

217
00:09:04,068 --> 00:09:05,813
It's Wednesday.Up yours!

218
00:09:05,817 --> 00:09:08,040
Nice kid. Say, Brian,now that I think about it,

219
00:09:08,088 --> 00:09:12,333
how can you possible havea 13-year-old son enouourselfare only seven?

220
00:09:12,338 --> 00:09:13,682
Well, those are dog years.

221
00:09:13,705 --> 00:09:14,893
That doesn't makeany sense.

222
00:09:14,898 --> 00:09:15,691
You know what, Stewie?

223
00:09:15,695 --> 00:09:17,653
If you don't like it, go on the Internetand complain.

224
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:22,063
Oh, it was awful.

225
00:09:22,068 --> 00:09:23,510
That kid was acomplete thug.

226
00:09:23,526 --> 00:09:25,570
I'm telling you, I couldn't get outof there fast enough.

227
00:09:25,575 --> 00:09:28,362
Boy, Brian, youdodged a bullet not having toraise that kid.

228
00:09:28,365 --> 00:09:30,003
Your life would havebeen more miserable

229
00:09:30,005 --> 00:09:31,153
than a lonely old widow

230
00:09:31,165 --> 00:09:32,933
livingin a downstairs apartment.

231
00:09:35,687 --> 00:09:37,623
Quiet! Keep itdown up there!

232
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,901

233
00:09:39,927 --> 00:09:41,130

234
00:09:42,096 --> 00:09:43,361

321
00:13:32,335 --> 00:13:33,363
The are.

322
00:13:33,366 --> 00:13:37,231
That's it. I'mtelling Brian he has to reign Dylan inonce and for all.

323
00:13:37,238 --> 00:13:38,621
Hey, where isBrian anyway?

324
00:13:46,035 --> 00:13:47,250
Oh, thanks, Lois.

325
00:13:47,256 --> 00:13:49,500
Dylan put this
paperbaony ad and I could not,

326
00:13:49,546 --> 00:13:51,753
for the life of me,
figure out howto get it off.

327
00:13:51,757 --> 00:13:53,150
The kid's a sociopath.

328
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:55,252
Well, it's time yoiddown
the law with him.

329
00:13:55,256 --> 00:13:56,440
I couldn't agree more.

330
00:13:56,447 --> 00:13:59,162
I am gonna kick him out of this house
faster than NASA kicked

331
00:13:59,168 --> 00:14:00,702
out the Cocoa Puffs bird.

332
00:14:00,856 --> 00:14:02,971
Okay, your physical exam
was within range.

333
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:04,800
You aced the flight simulator.

334
00:14:04,805 --> 00:14:07,061
I guess all that's left is
the psychological screening.

335
00:14:07,245 --> 00:14:08,002
Okay.

336
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:09,391
How do youfeel about this?

337
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,501
Ah, oh, my God,Cocoa Puffs.

338
00:14:11,506 --> 00:14:12,773
No, that's not me anymore.

339
00:14:12,775 --> 00:14:14,041
I'm just here to fly, sir.

340
00:14:15,948 --> 00:14:17,422
All right, Dylan.You know what?

341
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:20,130
This isn't working out Alrit?
don't carethat I'm your father,

342
00:14:20,138 --> 00:14:21,811
and you don't care
that you're my son.

343
00:14:21,826 --> 00:14:23,192
We don't have anything
in common.

344
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,632
I think it's best if you
just get out of this house.

345
00:14:25,638 --> 00:14:27,382
Fine. I hated you anyhow.

346
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:28,542
Get out of my way.

347
00:14:29,726 --> 00:14:31,041
- My pot!
- My pot!

348
00:14:31,045 --> 00:14:32,181
- Your pot?
- Your pot?

349
00:14:32,888 --> 00:14:36,080
And then in chapter 28 of my novel,

350
00:14:36,096 --> 00:14:39,331
the other pilots finally
trust the Japanese

351
00:14:39,348 --> 00:14:41,771
pilot and let him, let him into...

352
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:44,370
their group.

353
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,230
Dude, that is an amazing story.

354
00:14:46,665 --> 00:14:50,753
Hey. Hey, what if, um,
there were a Korean pilot?

355
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,902
Yeah. Um, I'm not really
looking for notes,

356
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:55,540
but you know, Dylan, I gotta
tell you something.

357
00:14:55,676 --> 00:14:58,553
I'm sorry I wasn't around
when you were growing up.

358
00:14:58,556 --> 00:15:00,533
Don't. Just, just don't.

359
00:15:00,538 --> 00:15:01,912
If-if I had known having

360
00:15:01,925 --> 00:15:03,470
a son could be like this...

361
00:15:03,475 --> 00:15:05,301
- How dare you?
- I didn't know!

362
00:15:05,307 --> 00:15:07,010
You had no right, man.
No right.

363
00:15:07,028 --> 00:15:09,412
- It wasn't my fault.
- You weren't there for me.

364
00:15:09,415 --> 00:15:11,322
Damn it, don't you think I wanted to be?

365
00:15:14,787 --> 00:15:17,382
Shh. Shh.
It's okay.

366
00:15:17,427 --> 00:15:20,262
It's okay.
Look, I know I wasn't there

367
00:15:20,265 --> 00:15:22,601
for you man,
for all those years,

368
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,611
but...that's gonna change.

369
00:15:25,056 --> 00:15:26,471
It's gonna be different
from now on.

370
00:15:26,505 --> 00:15:29,041
And I'm gonna make you
into a better person,

371
00:15:29,075 --> 00:15:30,351
starting first thing tomorrow.

372
00:15:30,756 --> 00:15:31,590
Just passing through.

373
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,063
See anything you like, speak up.

374
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:40,392
Hey, there, everybody.

375
00:15:40,486 --> 00:15:42,273
Was somebody looking for a son

376
00:15:42,285 --> 00:15:43,771
with a bright new path to

377
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,661
adulthood and his very,
very proud Dad?

378
00:15:46,668 --> 00:15:48,900
Oh, Dylan, you got a haircut.

379
00:15:48,935 --> 00:15:50,240
Aren't you handsome?

380
00:15:50,348 --> 00:15:51,991
From now on, I plan on being

381
00:15:51,996 --> 00:15:53,581
a real father to Dylan,

382
00:15:53,587 --> 00:15:55,972
and together,
we are gonna turn his life around.

383
00:15:55,978 --> 00:15:56,633
Right champ?

384
00:15:56,638 --> 00:15:57,800
You said it, Dad.

385
00:15:57,806 --> 00:15:59,383
All right! You ready for school?

386
00:15:59,387 --> 00:16:01,382
Yeah. Hey, can I drive today?

387
00:16:01,387 --> 00:16:03,571
Oh, this kid!
He's only 13.

388
00:16:03,577 --> 00:16:05,172
I know.
I was just kidding.

389
00:16:05,186 --> 00:16:09,823
Oh. We got a young Adam
Sandler here, I think.

390
00:16:09,837 --> 00:16:10,531
Right?

391
00:16:11,475 --> 00:16:12,810
- Right?
- Yes.

392
00:16:17,146 --> 00:16:18,660
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye!

393
00:16:18,665 --> 00:16:20,891
All right, kids.
Have a good day at school.

394
00:16:22,555 --> 00:16:25,300
Hey, Dylan.
Have a great day at school.

395
00:16:25,306 --> 00:16:26,270
Thanks, Dad.

396
00:16:26,448 --> 00:16:27,783
Hey. Knock-knock.

397
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:28,552
Who's there?

398
00:16:28,707 --> 00:16:29,820
You're there.

399
00:16:30,086 --> 00:16:31,771
I'll always be there, Dylan.

400
00:16:35,645 --> 00:16:37,031
Crudely painted,
not-so-funny,

401
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,063
plywood cutout folk art.

402
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:39,433
Crudely painted,
not-so-funny,

403
00:16:39,438 --> 00:16:40,422
plywood cutout folk art.

404
00:16:40,465 --> 00:16:42,013
Crudely painted,
not-so-funny,

405
00:16:42,017 --> 00:16:43,170
plywood cutout folk art.

406
00:16:43,206 --> 00:16:44,201
Hi! I'm Al Harrington of

407
00:16:44,216 --> 00:16:45,382
Al Harrington's Wacky Waving

408
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:47,120
Inflatable,
Arm-Flailing Tube-Man

409
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,253
Warehouse and Emporium.

410
00:16:48,265 --> 00:16:49,971
As an unwanted result of
a recent lawsuit,

411
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:50,961
I am now in possession of

412
00:16:50,966 --> 00:16:52,603
hundreds of palettes of crudely

413
00:16:52,615 --> 00:16:54,153
painted,
not-so-funny plywood

414
00:16:54,188 --> 00:16:55,630
cutout folk art, and it's just

415
00:16:55,635 --> 00:16:57,182
waiting to transform your uncut,

416
00:16:57,188 --> 00:16:59,582
trash-strewn lawn into a
living canvas that tells

417
00:16:59,588 --> 00:17:03,372
passers-by, "Hey, everyone, a real
funny bugler lives here."

418
00:17:03,376 --> 00:17:04,790
Your neighbors will chuckle warmly,

419
00:17:04,795 --> 00:17:05,923
and motorists will slow down

420
00:17:05,937 --> 00:17:07,320
and applaud when they cast

421
00:17:07,325 --> 00:17:08,543
their eyes on such favorites as...

422
00:17:08,548 --> 00:17:10,150
Sort-of Ben and Jerry's-Looking Cow,

423
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:12,293
Black Silhouetted Cowboy
Leaning on Barn

424
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:13,552
and everybody's favorite,

425
00:17:13,585 --> 00:17:16,011
Fat Woman Bending Over Tending
to her Garden in Big,

426
00:17:16,018 --> 00:17:17,191
Polka-Dotted Bloomers.

427
00:17:17,197 --> 00:17:18,852
Most of this stuff is price to move

428
00:17:18,857 --> 00:17:21,110
and until it does, it's
an enormous fire hazard,

429
00:17:21,127 --> 00:17:22,430
so please, come see me,

430
00:17:22,437 --> 00:17:23,791
on Route 2 in Weekapaug.

431
00:17:23,797 --> 00:17:26,100
Look for the Sort-of Ben and
Jerry's Cow out front!

432
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:27,903
We interrupt this program to bring

433
00:17:27,907 --> 00:17:28,832
you grim news out of

434
00:17:28,866 --> 00:17:31,092
LaGuardia airport, where a 767 has been

435
00:17:31,096 --> 00:17:32,860
forced to make a crash landing.

436
00:17:32,878 --> 00:17:35,111
Oh, man, I tell you,
now that I'm a parent,

437
00:17:35,116 --> 00:17:36,940
I can't even watch stories like that.

438
00:17:37,076 --> 00:17:38,532
I just think, you know, I just think,

439
00:17:38,536 --> 00:17:40,681
"Oh, my God, what if
Dylan were on that plane?"

440
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,380
Oh, my God, oh, I just
don't know what I would do.

441
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,342
I don't know what I would do.

442
00:17:43,347 --> 00:17:44,881
Yeah, yeah, I understand.

443
00:17:44,888 --> 00:17:45,762
That'd be tough.

444
00:17:45,777 --> 00:17:47,111
Oh, oh, no.
Oh, no.

445
00:17:47,148 --> 00:17:47,802
No, no.
No, no, no.

446
00:17:47,806 --> 00:17:50,363
Quagmire, no.
You do not understand.

447
00:17:50,395 --> 00:17:54,521
Until you have a child...
Until you have a child,

448
00:17:55,155 --> 00:17:57,470
you do not understand. Okay?

449
00:17:57,608 --> 00:17:58,261
Damn it.

450
00:17:58,267 --> 00:17:59,681
It's been like this all week.

451
00:17:59,687 --> 00:18:01,752
Watch this: Hey, Brian,
what would you

452
00:18:01,766 --> 00:18:03,211
do if Dylan fell out a window?

453
00:18:03,217 --> 00:18:05,601
Oh, my God. Oh, my God I don't
even want to think about that.

454
00:18:05,607 --> 00:18:06,490
I don't even want to think about that.

455
00:18:06,537 --> 00:18:08,562
Oh, God. Oh, my God. Oh, no.

456
00:18:08,566 --> 00:18:10,320
Brian, what would you do
if Dylan was in a fire?

457
00:18:10,326 --> 00:18:12,702
Oh, my God. Oh, no. Oh, my God. Oh, that's...

458
00:18:12,747 --> 00:18:13,782
Oh, God. Oh, no, no,no.

459
00:18:13,815 --> 00:18:15,001
Knock on wood.
Knock on wood, Knock on wood.

460
00:18:15,006 --> 00:18:16,513
Oh, I can't hear any more of this.

461
00:18:17,755 --> 00:18:20,283
Peter, your dog is giving me diabetes.

462
00:18:20,317 --> 00:18:21,771
Oh, boy, you're not kidding.

463
00:18:21,807 --> 00:18:23,842
I tell you, I wish
that old hag of Brian's

464
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:25,563
had never even told him he had a kid.

465
00:18:25,566 --> 00:18:26,501
Well, wait a minute, Peter.

466
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:27,550
Maybe that's the answer.

467
00:18:27,557 --> 00:18:29,461
You just gotta get his
mother take him back.

468
00:18:29,465 --> 00:18:31,072
How the hell am I supposed to do that?

469
00:18:31,086 --> 00:18:32,592
She's an idiot redneck, Peter.

470
00:18:32,638 --> 00:18:34,393
Tricking her should be easier than

471
00:18:34,398 --> 00:18:36,052
escaping from Canadian Alcatraz.

472
00:18:37,068 --> 00:18:38,290
Can I go through here?

473
00:18:38,308 --> 00:18:39,790
Just be back by bedtime.

474
00:18:39,796 --> 00:18:40,560
Okay.

475
00:18:45,287 --> 00:18:46,891
Lunch is ready, everyone.

476
00:18:47,605 --> 00:18:49,082
Whoa, whoa, whoa,whoa. Lois, Lois.

477
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,300
This is, this is white bread.

478
00:18:50,308 --> 00:18:51,120
Yeah. So?

479
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,112
Well, don't we have any of
that whole-grain stuff?

480
00:18:53,115 --> 00:18:54,451
No. This was cheaper.

481
00:18:54,456 --> 00:18:57,242
I just, I just, I don't want
Dylan eating white bread.

482
00:18:57,245 --> 00:18:59,891
Brian, there's nothing wrong with it.

483
00:18:59,928 --> 00:19:01,441
Lois, Lois, I do not want

484
00:19:01,447 --> 00:19:02,952
Dylan eating white bread.

485
00:19:02,956 --> 00:19:04,683
Brian, I promise you, it's fine.

486
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:08,571
Lois. Lois, Lois I will decide what
is best for my child, all right?

487
00:19:08,575 --> 00:19:09,893
Look, will you take it easy?

488
00:19:09,897 --> 00:19:11,710
And, and, I do not want to have

489
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:13,890
this conversation in front of my son.

490
00:19:13,897 --> 00:19:15,981
Okay, you know what?
That's it, Brian.

491
00:19:15,986 --> 00:19:17,210
Feed him whatever you want.

492
00:19:17,218 --> 00:19:18,232
Tell, tell you what.

493
00:19:18,237 --> 00:19:19,561
Go up to my jewelry box,

494
00:19:19,565 --> 00:19:20,722
take my gold jewelry.

495
00:19:20,725 --> 00:19:22,552
Melt it down.
Make it into bread

496
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:23,503
and feed him that.

497
00:19:23,507 --> 00:19:24,453
That good enough?

498
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,671
Gold bread good enough
for your Dylan?!

499
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,663
Hey, everybody!

500
00:19:28,665 --> 00:19:30,963
Look at who's back
to pick up her son.

501
00:19:30,968 --> 00:19:32,860
This isn't The Price is Right.

502
00:19:32,878 --> 00:19:35,450
You said we were going
to The Price is Right.

503
00:19:35,468 --> 00:19:36,771
Peter. What the hell is this?

504
00:19:36,778 --> 00:19:38,352
Mom. What are you doing here?

505
00:19:38,396 --> 00:19:39,933
Tracy wants Dylan back.

506
00:19:39,976 --> 00:19:41,710
Don't you want Dylan back, Tracy?

507
00:19:42,797 --> 00:19:44,780
What a joyous family reunion.

508
00:19:44,785 --> 00:19:46,101
Isn't this great, Brian?

509
00:19:46,117 --> 00:19:47,782
Now Dylan can go back with his mom,

510
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:49,122
and you can stop acting like

511
00:19:49,128 --> 00:19:50,130
such a jackass.

512
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,902
So that's what this is all about, huh?

513
00:19:51,907 --> 00:19:54,033
I must say, you have been a little

514
00:19:54,037 --> 00:19:55,732
insufferable lately, Brian.

515
00:19:55,735 --> 00:19:57,911
We just want the old you
back, that's all.

516
00:19:57,915 --> 00:19:59,623
Look. All right. Okay, maybe I have

517
00:19:59,628 --> 00:20:01,652
been acting different lately,
all right?

518
00:20:01,858 --> 00:20:03,262
But that's only because I've truly

519
00:20:03,266 --> 00:20:04,462
connected with the one bit of

520
00:20:04,467 --> 00:20:07,253
flesh and blood that
I have on this earth.

521
00:20:07,255 --> 00:20:09,713
And I have no intention
of giving that up.

522
00:20:10,655 --> 00:20:12,292
Who wants a half-and-half?

523
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:13,843
Oh, I'll throw my hat into that ring.

524
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:14,980
Wait a minute, Dad.

525
00:20:15,185 --> 00:20:17,090
I think maybe I should
go with her.

526
00:20:17,137 --> 00:20:19,260
What? Dylan, why?

527
00:20:19,265 --> 00:20:21,192
Look at her.
She needs me-

528
00:20:21,398 --> 00:20:22,760
a lot more than you do.

529
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:25,701
But we were just starting
to make a real connection.

530
00:20:25,707 --> 00:20:26,132
Listen.

531
00:20:26,176 --> 00:20:28,083
I'll always be grateful to you for

532
00:20:28,085 --> 00:20:29,603
turning my life around, but

533
00:20:29,608 --> 00:20:31,271
now, thanks to you, I finally

534
00:20:31,277 --> 00:20:32,771
have a chance to transform

535
00:20:32,818 --> 00:20:34,633
my mom's life in the same way

536
00:20:34,638 --> 00:20:35,952
you transformed mine.

537
00:20:37,727 --> 00:20:39,602
You know, I guess a dad couldn't

538
00:20:39,608 --> 00:20:40,952
ask for more than that.

539
00:20:41,577 --> 00:20:43,012
I'm proud of you, Dylan.

540
00:20:43,687 --> 00:20:44,952
My life will never be the

541
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,020
same for knowing you.

542
00:20:46,556 --> 00:20:47,891
Good-bye and...

543
00:20:48,517 --> 00:20:49,443
good luck.

544
00:20:49,518 --> 00:20:50,533
Good-bye, Dad.

545
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,771
Come on, Mom. Let's go.

546
00:20:56,165 --> 00:20:57,322
Bye. Thanks for coming.

547
00:21:01,577 --> 00:21:03,080
I'm gonna miss that boy.

548
00:21:04,825 --> 00:21:06,653
You know, I just finally
figured it out.

549
00:21:06,658 --> 00:21:09,093
She looks like a really
hot Tim Russert.

550
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:10,172
Right?

551
00:21:10,748 --> 00:21:12,271
- Right?
- Yes.
