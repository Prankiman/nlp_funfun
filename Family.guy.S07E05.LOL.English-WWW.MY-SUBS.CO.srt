4
00:00:36,325 --> 00:00:38,174
We now return to Jackass.

5
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,690
Hello, my name is Johnny Knoxville

6
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,138
and I'm gonna take
a shot gun blast to the face.

7
00:00:43,391 --> 00:00:44,582
Okay, ready?

8
00:00:49,362 --> 00:00:51,191
Oh, God!

9
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,784
These guys are hilarious,
they do so much funny stuff.

10
00:00:56,206 --> 00:00:57,625
Hey, you know what?

11
00:00:57,792 --> 00:01:00,363
We should try some of that stuff
here, at home.

12
00:01:00,424 --> 00:01:01,622
I don't know, Peter.

13
00:01:01,652 --> 00:01:04,449
That skull and crossbones warning
before the show

14
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,281
was pretty clear about not doing that.

15
00:01:06,311 --> 00:01:07,464
Cleveland, shut up.

16
00:01:07,494 --> 00:01:09,963
I saw something on TV
that I want to imitate.

17
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,876
Peter, what are you...?

18
00:01:13,102 --> 00:01:15,503
What you boys are doing up there?
Get out of the roof!

19
00:01:15,564 --> 00:01:18,506
Go back in the house, Lois.
We're being jackass. OK, ready?

20
00:01:18,566 --> 00:01:19,895
Alright, we're rolling.

21
00:01:19,925 --> 00:01:22,665
I'm Peter Griffin
and this is shopping caught...

22
00:01:23,223 --> 00:01:24,382
... roof.

23
00:01:24,658 --> 00:01:27,593
Roof... shopping caught...

24
00:01:27,923 --> 00:01:28,984
... guys.

25
00:01:29,114 --> 00:01:30,393
Okay, go.

26
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,108
- Oh my God.
- Oh my God, are you okay?

27
00:01:37,301 --> 00:01:38,936
I don't know...

28
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:41,460
What does it look like?
What do I do?

29
00:01:42,445 --> 00:01:44,783
What is that? I feel something.

30
00:01:44,843 --> 00:01:46,170
It's your spine, dude.

31
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,582
It got like you hanged up a
bunch of notches

32
00:01:48,612 --> 00:01:50,076
I'm scared.

33
00:01:52,143 --> 00:01:53,131
Oh God!

34
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:55,057
This is get fixed with ice or heat.

35
00:01:55,087 --> 00:01:56,871
Ice now, heat later.

36
00:01:57,453 --> 00:01:58,687
I'm Glenn Quagmire.

37
00:01:58,968 --> 00:02:00,463
And this is Bee Bush.

38
00:02:00,493 --> 00:02:02,574
Alright, what did you do to yourself?

39
00:02:02,604 --> 00:02:05,724
I just covered
my entire private area with honey.

40
00:02:05,754 --> 00:02:07,890
Now we're just waiting for the bees.

41
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,371
Alright, here they come.

42
00:02:14,024 --> 00:02:15,692
Okay, they're on here. It's just...

43
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:17,306
Nobody move.

44
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,883
Alright? Nobody do nothing.

45
00:02:20,029 --> 00:02:21,611
Don't wanna make them made.

46
00:02:23,348 --> 00:02:24,886
Stop it! Knock if off!

47
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:26,814
Yeah, we don't want
the bees to get mad.

48
00:02:26,948 --> 00:02:29,352
- I hate you bees, I hate you bees.
- Stop it!

49
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:33,100
- Stop, knock it off, I'm serious.
- I hate you bees.

50
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,628
That's enough. Get them off.
Put them back to the hive.

51
00:02:36,855 --> 00:02:39,170
Alright, enough is enough.
Cleveland, open the hive.

52
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,089
Alright, bring them over here.

53
00:02:58,635 --> 00:02:59,649
Oh boy!

54
00:03:03,643 --> 00:03:04,824
What the fuck?!

55
00:03:04,954 --> 00:03:06,275
Why would you do that?

56
00:03:07,802 --> 00:03:09,784
Hey, you guys. Lois said
it's time for dinner.

57
00:03:20,131 --> 00:03:21,636
Peter, this isn't safe at all.

58
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,142
Shut up, Brian, just keep filming.

59
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,961
I'm Peter Griffin

60
00:03:24,991 --> 00:03:27,268
and I'm the greatest American hero.

61
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:30,032
My special power
is being somehow memorable

62
00:03:30,062 --> 00:03:31,787
after a very short run on TV.

63
00:03:35,446 --> 00:03:37,959
Believe it or not, I'm walking on air

64
00:03:38,121 --> 00:03:41,262
I never thought I could feel so free

65
00:03:41,923 --> 00:03:44,717
Flying away on a wing and a prayer

66
00:03:45,052 --> 00:03:46,861
Who could it be?

67
00:03:48,003 --> 00:03:50,104
Believe it or not, it's just...

68
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,371
Get some, Peter!

69
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,889
Nice job on that ramp, Joe.

70
00:03:57,116 --> 00:03:59,136
Ifthere's something I know,
it's ramps.

71
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,002
Wait a minute guys, I think
he's really hurt.

72
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,671
Help! I think my arm is broken.

73
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:18,238
My back!... I can't move.

74
00:04:33,766 --> 00:04:35,044
I thought...

75
00:04:35,196 --> 00:04:36,810
I was gonna die.

76
00:04:39,778 --> 00:04:40,625
That's good.

77
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:48,093
You know, Peter, I did expect
this kind of behavior from you

78
00:04:48,123 --> 00:04:50,690
but you have no business
endangering Brian like that.

79
00:04:50,841 --> 00:04:52,076
- Thank you.
- I mean

80
00:04:52,106 --> 00:04:54,317
he jumped to that lack
to save your life.

81
00:04:54,347 --> 00:04:56,839
And he's 8 years old, Peter. 8!

82
00:04:57,035 --> 00:04:59,167
That 56 in human years.

83
00:04:59,197 --> 00:05:00,150
Okay Lois.

84
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,379
Why do you think he almost drowned?

85
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:03,651
He's old Peter.

86
00:05:03,681 --> 00:05:06,109
Plus he drinks and he smokes
all the time.

87
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,346
So take that 56 and make it 79 at least.

88
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:11,336
Why are you making
such a big deal out of it?

89
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:12,626
I was just a little tired.

90
00:05:12,656 --> 00:05:14,443
That's how it begins, Brian.

91
00:05:14,473 --> 00:05:17,218
Then next thing you know, I'm making
Peter dig a hole in the yard

92
00:05:17,248 --> 00:05:18,789
and you're in a pillow case.

93
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:24,042
Peter, what's wrong?

94
00:05:24,072 --> 00:05:25,498
You've been so quiet all day.

95
00:05:25,528 --> 00:05:27,406
It's just what you said the other day.

96
00:05:27,436 --> 00:05:29,208
I'm starting to think
you might be right.

97
00:05:29,238 --> 00:05:30,703
Brian's getting old.

98
00:05:30,822 --> 00:05:33,962
He's not the dog he used to be
and I'll have to get used to it.

99
00:05:34,222 --> 00:05:36,389
Just like
I get used to my acrylic nails.

100
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:44,441
Scanlon, Weinstock and Riesman.

101
00:05:44,982 --> 00:05:46,433
Hey, Laronda.

102
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:49,867
No, I got 4 people on hold
but I can talk.

103
00:05:54,115 --> 00:05:55,366
Good morning, everybody.

104
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,496
Brian, I've something to say.

105
00:05:57,718 --> 00:06:00,413
I'm sorry
I've been so preocupate with your age.

106
00:06:01,016 --> 00:06:03,499
Look, Peter don't worry,
just let forget about it.

107
00:06:03,734 --> 00:06:05,911
Fantastic.
And to help us forget about it

108
00:06:06,273 --> 00:06:08,461
family, I'd like to introduce

109
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:09,901
New Brian.

110
00:06:09,931 --> 00:06:11,001
Hey, gang.

111
00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:13,748
Who's leg do I have to hump
to get a hug around here?

112
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:19,640
I like him.

113
00:06:26,175 --> 00:06:28,066
- You got a new dog?
- Yes, sir.

114
00:06:28,365 --> 00:06:30,401
But... I'm the dog.

115
00:06:30,462 --> 00:06:33,654
Now that you getting older, New Brian
is here to take some of the load off.

116
00:06:33,715 --> 00:06:34,781
Can he do tricks?

117
00:06:34,934 --> 00:06:37,582
Oh, you bet.
He's trained to fetch, roll over

118
00:06:37,612 --> 00:06:39,535
and make you feel really good
about yourself.

119
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,191
Wow, Meg and Chris.

120
00:06:41,221 --> 00:06:43,790
I can't decide which one of your hates
i like better.

121
00:06:45,676 --> 00:06:48,878
I can't believe you got a new dog.
What about me?

122
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:50,539
You still my buddy.

123
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,117
New Brian
is just a new friend for the family.

124
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:55,099
Trust me,
you guys are gonna get along better

125
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:56,761
than Abraham Lincoln and his neighbor.

126
00:06:59,512 --> 00:07:00,671
Hey, Dale.

127
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:03,383
I noticed your lands
are getting a little high.

128
00:07:03,568 --> 00:07:05,409
Yeah, I used to have a guy for that.

129
00:07:05,788 --> 00:07:06,719
Dick.

130
00:07:06,749 --> 00:07:08,189
Okay, now you've a good one.

131
00:07:20,326 --> 00:07:23,088
My word!
What a gorgeous way to wake up.

132
00:07:23,207 --> 00:07:24,431
I hope you don't mind,

133
00:07:24,461 --> 00:07:27,302
I checked the time your alarm
was set for and I shut it off.

134
00:07:27,332 --> 00:07:30,154
I figured this might be
a more gentle way to start off the day.

135
00:07:30,305 --> 00:07:32,991
That is so thoughtful, New Brian.

136
00:07:37,768 --> 00:07:39,913
I'll start up again in 9 minutes.

137
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:44,884
Hey, Meg, I know how you like
to let off steam once in a while.

138
00:07:44,914 --> 00:07:46,173
So i got you a journal.

139
00:07:46,203 --> 00:07:47,353
You got me a journal?

140
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,431
Actually I got you two of them.

141
00:07:49,648 --> 00:07:51,532
My right ear and my left ear.

142
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,067
Fire away.

143
00:07:53,312 --> 00:07:55,868
Dear diary,
today at the school library

144
00:07:55,898 --> 00:07:58,597
I saw a picture of National Geographic
of a woman

145
00:07:58,627 --> 00:08:00,983
with nipples
that covered almost of her breast too.

146
00:08:01,137 --> 00:08:03,369
And suddenly, I didn't feel so alone.

147
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,191
You know what it sounds like to me?

148
00:08:05,221 --> 00:08:07,766
Sounds like the woman on that picture
was pretty beautiful.

149
00:08:09,157 --> 00:08:10,966
Alright, I see you at dinner.

150
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:13,234
- Think fast!
- Wow, deodorant.

151
00:08:13,456 --> 00:08:15,841
- Are you sure I'm old enough?
- I think so.

152
00:08:15,982 --> 00:08:18,787
I'm gonna make you a little less gross
every day.

153
00:08:22,388 --> 00:08:23,547
Hey, New Brian.

154
00:08:24,164 --> 00:08:25,366
You have a guitar!

155
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,727
In fact, I wrote a new song today.

156
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,319
And I want hear what you think of it.

157
00:08:29,471 --> 00:08:31,420
Where did you find the time for that?

158
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,181
Peter,
inspiration doesn't have a schedule.

159
00:08:34,699 --> 00:08:37,479
I don't like fancy learning books

160
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:39,762
I don't like apple tarts

161
00:08:39,945 --> 00:08:42,491
I don't like cosy breakfast knocks

162
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:45,626
I don't like modern arts

163
00:08:46,516 --> 00:08:47,978
Well, I like farts

164
00:08:48,378 --> 00:08:49,667
Yes, I like farts

165
00:08:50,425 --> 00:08:53,005
I like long farts,
short farts, wet farts, your farts

166
00:08:53,035 --> 00:08:54,795
I like fart if you got heart

167
00:08:54,855 --> 00:08:56,672
- I've got heart.
- Let's hear those farts.

168
00:08:56,733 --> 00:08:57,798
How do I stand?

169
00:08:58,448 --> 00:09:02,195
Well, Peter, I will help you
get your fart to started...

170
00:09:13,363 --> 00:09:16,298
Hey, Brian, I went out for a run
this morning and I found this stick.

171
00:09:16,328 --> 00:09:17,743
I thought you might like it.

172
00:09:18,231 --> 00:09:20,603
- Thanks a lot.
- And I got you some of this.

173
00:09:20,771 --> 00:09:23,543
I don't smock it myself,
but I sure won't judge you

174
00:09:23,573 --> 00:09:24,745
Gosh, thanks.

175
00:09:24,775 --> 00:09:26,619
Check you later, handsome guy.

176
00:09:27,294 --> 00:09:30,121
You know I wasn't sure
about this new dog thing at first but

177
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:32,310
I got to tell you,
he's a really terrific guy.

178
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:34,779
You poor damned fool.

179
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:37,421
- What?
- You've no idea what's going on here?

180
00:09:37,805 --> 00:09:40,643
He's not just a delightful
new friend for the family,

181
00:09:40,673 --> 00:09:42,007
he's your replacement.

182
00:09:42,037 --> 00:09:43,386
Come on, that's ridiculous.

183
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,564
You're getting old, Brian,
and they know it.

184
00:09:45,594 --> 00:09:47,150
You're no longer the cover girl.

185
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,096
Look at Carol Alt, that's...
You're Carol Alt.

186
00:09:50,286 --> 00:09:51,643
I'm through listening to you.

187
00:09:51,932 --> 00:09:55,387
Fine, think what you want,
aging super model Carol Alt.

188
00:09:55,788 --> 00:09:57,179
Carol, come in here.

189
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,822
They're saying your name
on the Family Man.

190
00:09:59,852 --> 00:10:01,017
- What?
- Huh?

191
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,864
- What?
- I Forget.

192
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:07,081
And besides, the evidence
is all right in front of your nose.

193
00:10:08,137 --> 00:10:09,954
That's hilarious, New Brian.

194
00:10:10,258 --> 00:10:12,532
Now, do your impression
of Punky Brewster's father.

195
00:10:12,673 --> 00:10:13,615
Punky.

196
00:10:14,395 --> 00:10:15,619
Oh, Punky.

197
00:10:16,964 --> 00:10:18,162
Oh, Punky.

198
00:10:18,192 --> 00:10:19,714
You have a dog named Brandon.

199
00:10:21,972 --> 00:10:23,968
Hi, I'm Carol Alt for polygrip.

200
00:10:24,148 --> 00:10:25,331
They did it again!

201
00:10:25,361 --> 00:10:27,051
- Who?
- The Family Man.

202
00:10:27,081 --> 00:10:28,935
Is that the one with the fish?

203
00:10:28,965 --> 00:10:30,603
No, that's American Boy.

204
00:10:35,411 --> 00:10:37,729
Relax, Brian, there's no way
they'd replace you.

205
00:10:37,989 --> 00:10:39,811
But it probably couldn't hurt
to remind them

206
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:42,028
how much they value you
as a family member.

207
00:10:43,057 --> 00:10:45,732
OK, everybody, tonight
I got a real treat for you.

208
00:10:46,094 --> 00:10:48,434
We've all seen your compilation video.

209
00:10:48,464 --> 00:10:50,897
Shatner singing "Rocket Man",
drunk Orson Welles

210
00:10:50,927 --> 00:10:53,713
doing that commercial,
Sylvester Stallone in that porno,

211
00:10:53,743 --> 00:10:55,518
and Bill Cosby beating up that midget.

212
00:10:55,548 --> 00:10:57,126
Wait, I don't remember that last one.

213
00:10:57,327 --> 00:10:59,449
Oh yes, freaking brutal for no reason.

214
00:10:59,749 --> 00:11:02,456
You know, the poor little guy
just sit there eating a snack pack,

215
00:11:02,486 --> 00:11:05,529
Bill Cosby just runs in out of nowhere
and just starts whaling on him

216
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,803
Didn't that guy die?

217
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,144
No, these are home movies from
when I was a puppy.

218
00:11:09,205 --> 00:11:10,056
He died.

219
00:11:10,223 --> 00:11:11,490
Okay look, just watch.

220
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:32,396
Oh, look at him sleep.

221
00:11:32,598 --> 00:11:35,374
I wonder what is dreaming about.

222
00:11:35,508 --> 00:11:36,715
Shut up, Meg.

223
00:11:37,975 --> 00:11:39,503
Oh, Oh! Did you hear that?

224
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:42,004
- He farted.
- Just like in the song.

225
00:11:45,151 --> 00:11:47,122
Oh, what the hell is
the matter with you?

226
00:11:47,152 --> 00:11:49,068
Outside, outside! Now!

227
00:11:51,989 --> 00:11:54,174
Well, I hate to say I told
you so but...

228
00:11:54,361 --> 00:11:56,371
Wait a minute, I love
say "I told you so".

229
00:11:57,251 --> 00:11:59,256
Hey, Stewie Griffin, meet
Stewie Griffin.

230
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:01,799
Nice to meet you,
charmed I'm sure, great outfit.

231
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:03,239
Oh God. No it is.

232
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:06,576
So, what is if there's a new dog?
Lots of families have two dogs.

233
00:12:06,606 --> 00:12:09,320
Hey Brian, I thought maybe
we could spend the afternoon together.

234
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,626
Really? That'll be great.

235
00:12:10,656 --> 00:12:12,767
Awesome, 'cause I got
this new gun...

236
00:12:12,797 --> 00:12:14,289
- Here we go...
- And I thought

237
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:17,561
we could go deep in the woods.
Where no one would ever think to look.

238
00:12:17,591 --> 00:12:19,806
- Oh boy...
- And, just shoot it.

239
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:21,822
- Awkward.
- You know, like so far in that

240
00:12:21,852 --> 00:12:24,060
no one can hear gun fire.
- A little on the nose.

241
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:27,299
- Or screaming.
- Uh, I don't think so, Peter.

242
00:12:27,359 --> 00:12:29,569
Geez, it's like he thinks
I'm gonna shoot him.

243
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:32,763
He's acted all crazy like Quagmire
when he drunk-dials me.

244
00:12:35,986 --> 00:12:36,839
Allo?

245
00:12:36,869 --> 00:12:39,102
Hey, what are you doing?

246
00:12:39,795 --> 00:12:41,334
Quagmire, I'm sleeping.

247
00:12:41,401 --> 00:12:42,879
Yeah, I was just out with joe.

248
00:12:42,909 --> 00:12:44,333
What are you doing?

249
00:12:44,581 --> 00:12:46,735
- I just told you.
- Oh, that's right,

250
00:12:46,936 --> 00:12:48,359
I just asked that.

251
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:51,597
I forgot... Hey, hey this
song makes me think of you,

252
00:12:51,627 --> 00:12:53,909
so let... wait,
listen to the song.

253
00:12:57,511 --> 00:13:00,180
- Isn't that awesome?
- You said you weren't gonna call him.

254
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,753
It's not him, you big bully.

255
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:04,297
Joe... told me not to call you.

256
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:07,225
So, so what... So what are you doing?

257
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:15,848
Everyone, I have an
announcement to make.

258
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:17,308
I've decided I'm leaving.

259
00:13:17,474 --> 00:13:20,227
What? Leaving? Brian, why?

260
00:13:20,446 --> 00:13:24,486
Well, you know, I feel like
I've sort of run my course here, and

261
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,606
you know, besides,
there's a all big world

262
00:13:26,636 --> 00:13:28,110
out there, and it's time I saw it.

263
00:13:28,324 --> 00:13:30,169
But, Brian, you live here.

264
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:31,279
This is your home.

265
00:13:31,309 --> 00:13:33,157
I know but I thought about this long

266
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,474
and hard...
- Ah-ah, long and hard.

267
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:37,786
Oh, I'm sorry Brian, please,
please continue.

268
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:40,091
And this is, just something
I have to do.

269
00:13:40,192 --> 00:13:41,702
Well, where will you go?

270
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:45,361
Well, I haven't decided that yet,
but I promess I'll be in touch.

271
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,609
- Wait, how is that one dirty?
- It's, uh, I was

272
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:49,924
remenbering long and hard.

273
00:13:50,118 --> 00:13:53,195
Well, if your mind is made up
about this, Brian, then,

274
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:55,257
I wish you the best of luck.

275
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,539
I hope this move
won't be a boner for you.

276
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,801
- Peter?
- Hm?

277
00:14:01,359 --> 00:14:03,505
- What?
- I was just saying to Brian I hope

278
00:14:03,535 --> 00:14:05,162
this move won't be a boner.

279
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:07,718
I would agree, I hope he'll find what he
is looking for.

280
00:14:07,748 --> 00:14:09,521
Okay, well...

281
00:14:09,941 --> 00:14:11,438
We're gonna miss you, Brian.

282
00:14:18,016 --> 00:14:20,058
Hey, everybody, let's watch this tape.

283
00:14:20,088 --> 00:14:22,181
Okay, now there's the midget
just sitting there.

284
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:24,103
Now watch the left side
of the screen.

285
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:27,471
I'm in a bad mood and I'm gonna
take it out on you.

286
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,908
Oh my God, well, he's obviously drunk.

287
00:14:30,172 --> 00:14:32,162
Oh, Oh! You're hurting me!

288
00:14:32,192 --> 00:14:34,898
About which I do not care very much.

289
00:14:41,932 --> 00:14:43,908
- Pancake?
- Oh, just a small one, thanks.

290
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:48,357
My God, these are the best
pancakes I've ever had.

291
00:14:48,562 --> 00:14:50,962
I bet Brian would love these pancakes.

292
00:14:51,235 --> 00:14:54,229
- I wonder where he is.
- He's next door with Cleveland.

293
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:56,115
I saw him on my morning paper route.

294
00:14:56,566 --> 00:14:59,108
You know, I appreciate you let
me be staying with you but

295
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,035
I'm... perfectly capable of going to
the bathroom by myself.

296
00:15:02,161 --> 00:15:04,672
Sorry, but there's a leash law
in this neighbourhood

297
00:15:04,702 --> 00:15:06,500
and you never know who's watching.

298
00:15:10,865 --> 00:15:14,022
I'm watching you make stool.

299
00:15:18,611 --> 00:15:21,032
Hey, New Brian. Oh, I see,
you having pie.

300
00:15:21,346 --> 00:15:23,788
You know, pie isn't really
pie without Cool H-Whip.

301
00:15:25,249 --> 00:15:26,830
Everything's better with Cool H-Whip.

302
00:15:28,473 --> 00:15:30,541
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yeah, what about it?

303
00:15:30,571 --> 00:15:32,482
It doesn't bother you the way
I prononce it?

304
00:15:32,853 --> 00:15:34,714
- Cool H-Whip.
- No, why would it?

305
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,313
Cool H-Whip,
I'm putting emphasis in the H.

306
00:15:37,343 --> 00:15:38,408
Sound right to me.

307
00:15:38,686 --> 00:15:40,310
Nothing ever bother you, does it?

308
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,578
No, not really. I like everything.

309
00:15:42,766 --> 00:15:45,414
God, he's a bigger buzz-kill
than Buzz Killington.

310
00:15:45,753 --> 00:15:46,842
Stewie...

311
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:51,615
Do you know why W. S. Gilbert was
frequently drunk

312
00:15:51,645 --> 00:15:54,087
on his Trans-Atlantic crossings?

313
00:15:54,325 --> 00:15:56,363
- No...
- Because...

314
00:15:56,835 --> 00:15:59,585
He was quartered on the port side.

315
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,773
Now that I've got you.

316
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,387
Let's both revisit the birth of

317
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:08,573
The Doyle Carte Opera Company.

318
00:16:14,696 --> 00:16:19,323
Everybody hurts

319
00:16:19,384 --> 00:16:24,176
Two... three... Sometimes.

320
00:16:25,756 --> 00:16:27,790
Okay, New Brian, you're next.

321
00:16:28,511 --> 00:16:30,583
Oh no, oh boy, alright.

322
00:16:30,613 --> 00:16:32,095
Well, I can't do this alone.

323
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,171
Lois, I'm gonna need your help here.

324
00:16:35,025 --> 00:16:37,268
My God, uh-ho, okay.

325
00:16:37,401 --> 00:16:40,186
Rita Coolidge's less-talented
sister here.

326
00:16:41,947 --> 00:16:43,806
In what way is that a joke?

327
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,396
Okay, then you start.

328
00:16:46,426 --> 00:16:48,528
Alright, I don't know, am I blue
or am I red?

329
00:16:48,558 --> 00:16:50,286
- You're blue, you're blue.
- Okay.

330
00:16:50,316 --> 00:16:52,051
Okay, I'll do it then.

331
00:16:52,081 --> 00:16:56,060
Summer loving had me a blast,

332
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:59,635
Summer loving happened so fast,

333
00:16:59,665 --> 00:17:03,527
I met a girl, that's you!, crazy for me

334
00:17:03,557 --> 00:17:06,696
I met a boy he's cute as can be

335
00:17:07,206 --> 00:17:13,285
Summer days drifting away to oh oh
the summer nights

336
00:17:13,315 --> 00:17:15,337
Uh well uh well uh well uh.

337
00:17:15,397 --> 00:17:17,171
<i>Tell me more, tell me more...</i>

338
00:17:19,275 --> 00:17:22,010
Thanks for letting my stay here, Glenn,
I hope I'm not in the way.

339
00:17:22,177 --> 00:17:26,437
No, no, should be fine. Uh,
but... listen, Brian,

340
00:17:27,102 --> 00:17:30,476
I'm gonna be bringing
a Puertoricain girl over here later, and

341
00:17:30,506 --> 00:17:32,983
she's super hot and real nice, but

342
00:17:33,518 --> 00:17:35,051
when we she was five years old,

343
00:17:35,205 --> 00:17:37,974
her dad run over
one of her leg with a van.

344
00:17:38,226 --> 00:17:40,133
And, it's still kind of messed up

345
00:17:40,163 --> 00:17:43,715
in a pretty
obvious instantly visible way,

346
00:17:44,028 --> 00:17:47,274
please don't say anything and,
try to make eye contact with her

347
00:17:47,304 --> 00:17:49,581
when she wobbles in
because I want this to work.

348
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:51,856
Uh, yeah, sure, no problem.

349
00:17:51,886 --> 00:17:54,090
I'm serious Brian.
That leg is a train wreck.

350
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,742
I mean, she herself is so pretty, but

351
00:17:56,965 --> 00:17:59,548
that thing just looks like
a string of sausages

352
00:17:59,609 --> 00:18:01,611
- with one empty casing in it.
- I get it.

353
00:18:01,641 --> 00:18:04,126
I mean, it's quite a sight,
you know? When she's not looking,

354
00:18:04,156 --> 00:18:06,711
you should take a look at her, but,
but good God be discreet.

355
00:18:06,811 --> 00:18:08,228
Yeah, I'll...

356
00:18:08,563 --> 00:18:09,658
I'll check that out.

357
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:14,846
Stewie, what are you doing here?

358
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:16,926
- Brian, you gotta come back.
- Why?

359
00:18:17,032 --> 00:18:19,928
Because... New Brian is such a tool.

360
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:22,020
I mean, he's so damn sweet

361
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,640
and saccharine and perfect

362
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,111
and he's turning the family
into a bunch of douches.

363
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:28,744
No, big deal, you always
told me I was a douche.

364
00:18:28,805 --> 00:18:29,827
Yeah...

365
00:18:29,857 --> 00:18:31,536
but you were my douche, Brian.

366
00:18:32,016 --> 00:18:32,943
My douche...

367
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,545
Come back and be my douche again.

368
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:38,124
Hi, I'm looking for Glenn.

369
00:18:38,246 --> 00:18:39,746
Oh! What happened to your leg?!

370
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,759
Damnit Brian!

371
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,484
Come back home, Brian.

372
00:18:45,514 --> 00:18:47,791
I tell you what, when this is all over,
I'll make you some

373
00:18:47,821 --> 00:18:49,604
some pie
with a nice dollop of Cool H-Whip.

374
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,104
Here it is again, why you put so
much emphasis on the H?

375
00:18:53,577 --> 00:18:55,596
That's exactly why I miss you Brian.

376
00:18:55,803 --> 00:18:58,632
Forget it, I'm not going back as long
as that new dog is there.

377
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:01,045
Long as he's a part of
that family,

378
00:19:01,338 --> 00:19:02,567
there's no place for me.

379
00:19:02,877 --> 00:19:04,325
Well, I can't say I blame you.

380
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,083
I hate him as much as you do, Brian.

381
00:19:06,329 --> 00:19:07,643
He's a bad fit.

382
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,879
Like a crocodile at an alligator rally.

383
00:19:10,294 --> 00:19:13,075
Yeah! Lurking in the water with our eyes
poking out.

384
00:19:13,105 --> 00:19:14,315
Yeah!

385
00:19:14,345 --> 00:19:16,000
Sneaking up on a crane
or an egret

386
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,368
and snapping our jaws on it!

387
00:19:17,398 --> 00:19:18,743
Yeah!

388
00:19:18,773 --> 00:19:20,515
And sometimes walking on

389
00:19:20,545 --> 00:19:22,555
to a dry plain or a dusty field

390
00:19:22,691 --> 00:19:25,333
because it's nice to get out
of the swamp now and then!

391
00:19:25,363 --> 00:19:26,533
Yeah!

392
00:19:26,563 --> 00:19:27,820
- What?
- What, what?

393
00:19:28,587 --> 00:19:30,713
Dry plain, dusty field.

394
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:33,100
Nice to get out of the swamp.

395
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,309
What a croc!

396
00:19:34,858 --> 00:19:36,811
And that's where we get the term.

397
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,075
Hey! New Brian!

398
00:19:44,301 --> 00:19:45,863
Bad news, you gotta leave!

399
00:19:46,623 --> 00:19:48,532
What are you talking about?
This is my home.

400
00:19:48,592 --> 00:19:49,992
Nobody likes you here, man.

401
00:19:50,212 --> 00:19:52,536
Well, I disagree, I think
everybody likes me.

402
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:54,996
No, we don't! We don't like
your cooking, you're

403
00:19:55,026 --> 00:19:57,793
stupid karaoke nights, and
we especially don't like

404
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,753
the way you hump that chair in the den.

405
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:01,962
Well, Ruppert seems to like my humping.

406
00:20:02,987 --> 00:20:04,413
- What did you say?
- Ruppert,

407
00:20:04,674 --> 00:20:06,551
I humped him for two hours yesterday.

408
00:20:06,843 --> 00:20:08,677
He just laid there and took it.

409
00:20:09,395 --> 00:20:11,597
- Did he?
- Yeah, and now everytime

410
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,433
you're sleeping with him. He's gonna
be thinking of me.

411
00:20:27,157 --> 00:20:29,134
And that is why I killed myself,

412
00:20:29,164 --> 00:20:31,697
shot myself up and put
myself in the garbage.

413
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,671
Wow, he must had some demons.

414
00:20:34,142 --> 00:20:36,165
My God, suicide.

415
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,639
How could we have misjudged him
so severely?

416
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:41,001
Often time, it's the one
who seems the happiest.

417
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,199
Well, the upside is,

418
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:43,879
at least we have our old Brian back.

419
00:20:44,065 --> 00:20:45,202
From now on, buddy,

420
00:20:45,434 --> 00:20:47,624
you're the only animal I care about.

421
00:20:47,867 --> 00:20:51,061
Hey everybody! I'm Bernie the hampster!

422
00:20:51,182 --> 00:20:52,934
Would you like to be my friend?

423
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:54,480
Oh my God!

424
00:20:55,617 --> 00:20:56,694
It's okay, Peter.

425
00:20:56,925 --> 00:20:59,310
Yeah, oh my God, oh my
God, it's a hampster!

426
00:21:03,381 --> 00:21:05,558
We'll talk about it,
when you want to talk about it.

427
00:21:06,623 --> 00:21:07,706
I don't blame you.

428
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,526
I... I don't blame you.
