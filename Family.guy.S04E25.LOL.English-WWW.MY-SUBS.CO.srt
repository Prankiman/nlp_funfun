3
00:00:33,572 --> 00:00:36,467
Oh, Brian, we're so thrilled
your gay cousin Jasper

4
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:38,176
finally decided to come visit.

5
00:00:38,194 --> 00:00:39,780
Me, too. It's been way too long.

6
00:00:39,812 --> 00:00:42,049
- Anyway, thanks for putting him up.
- No problem, Brian.

7
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,327
It's great to have visitors.

8
00:00:43,348 --> 00:00:45,254
Except for that time
Moby Dick stayed with us.

9
00:00:45,328 --> 00:00:47,180
Do you have any Raisin Bran?

10
00:00:47,582 --> 00:00:49,801
Uh... oh, no. Sorry.

11
00:00:51,008 --> 00:00:52,943
Can you go get me some?

12
00:00:53,337 --> 00:00:55,534
Uh... boy, that's kind of a pain in the...

13
00:00:55,568 --> 00:00:57,251
Well, we do have...

14
00:00:57,278 --> 00:00:59,682
we got Total, and we got some
raisins. I mean, you could,

15
00:00:59,707 --> 00:01:02,573
like, mix those together. It'd be...
it'd be kinda like Raisin Bran.

16
00:01:02,598 --> 00:01:03,783
Yeah, but it's not.

17
00:01:03,827 --> 00:01:06,170
It'd be like Raisin Bran,
but it's not Raisin Bran.

18
00:01:06,195 --> 00:01:08,203
That'd be like Total with raisins in it.

19
00:01:08,228 --> 00:01:10,362
It's not really doing it for me.

20
00:01:11,317 --> 00:01:13,011
What time did you say your flight was?

21
00:01:16,665 --> 00:01:19,821
Oh, no locks.
Thank you, Homeland Security.

22
00:01:21,287 --> 00:01:24,040
Hey, bud, take a break.
I'll take over. Go smoke a fatty.

23
00:01:24,088 --> 00:01:25,192
Thanks.

24
00:01:25,927 --> 00:01:29,601
<i>This is Sierra Tango 817,
Matthew McConaughey's private jet,</i>

25
00:01:29,628 --> 00:01:31,072
<i>requesting permission to land.</i>

26
00:01:31,096 --> 00:01:32,433
Matthew McConaughey?

27
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:35,571
Oh, sorry, Sierra Tango 817.
All our runways are filled.

28
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:38,251
<i>But it looks empty from up here.
We're almost out of fuel.</i>

29
00:01:38,268 --> 00:01:40,623
No, no. No room at all.
But, lucky for you, there's

30
00:01:40,646 --> 00:01:42,693
a big new airport out in
the middle of the ocean.

31
00:01:42,705 --> 00:01:44,730
<i>- Keep going. You can't miss it.
- Roger that.</i>

32
00:01:46,967 --> 00:01:48,543
Oops! Well, look at it this way.

33
00:01:48,556 --> 00:01:51,162
I just got you on next
year's Oscar telecast.

34
00:01:51,196 --> 00:01:53,001
You'll be right after Ron Howard!

35
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:55,082
Just messing with you, Ron.

36
00:01:55,095 --> 00:01:56,233
Or maybe not!

37
00:01:56,637 --> 00:01:58,100
No, seriously, I am.

38
00:01:58,125 --> 00:01:59,230
Or am I?!

39
00:01:59,256 --> 00:02:00,082
No.

40
00:02:00,686 --> 00:02:02,642
- Oh, there's Jasper's plane.
- Where?

41
00:02:02,646 --> 00:02:03,651
Third one in line.

42
00:02:03,668 --> 00:02:05,650
Oh, it's one of those
new "niche" airlines.

43
00:02:11,828 --> 00:02:13,283
Hey, cousin!

44
00:02:13,515 --> 00:02:14,943
Hey, Jasper!

45
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:18,583
Everybody, this is Ricardo, from
the Philippines and my kitchen floor.

46
00:02:18,608 --> 00:02:19,722
How was your flight?

47
00:02:19,837 --> 00:02:20,871
Oh, torture!

48
00:02:20,896 --> 00:02:22,951
Five hours on my moneymaker,
sitting across

49
00:02:22,966 --> 00:02:25,133
from a gaggle of sailors
flying home on leave,

50
00:02:25,147 --> 00:02:26,963
here I am in a committed relationship,

51
00:02:26,978 --> 00:02:29,082
and all I can think about is
having a piece of Navy cake.

52
00:02:29,117 --> 00:02:31,802
Hello. Who's that on the phone?
Temptation!

53
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:33,713
How does he always get
my number? I don't know.

54
00:02:33,755 --> 00:02:36,052
Anyway, I got big news,
and I'll tell you over dinner.

55
00:02:36,095 --> 00:02:38,660
Greek. On me.
But enough about last weekend.

56
00:02:38,698 --> 00:02:40,060
Oh, I'm terrible!

57
00:02:40,148 --> 00:02:42,932
Ugh! This idiot will fit in
with our family as badly as

58
00:02:42,977 --> 00:02:44,732
Peter fit in with The Proclaimers.

59
00:02:44,825 --> 00:02:48,322
<i>But I would walk 500 miles</i>

60
00:02:48,355 --> 00:02:51,933
<i>And I would walk 500 more</i>

61
00:02:51,976 --> 00:02:56,422
<i>Just to be the man who
walked a thousand miles</i>

62
00:02:56,485 --> 00:02:59,300
<i>To fall down at your door</i>

63
00:03:04,595 --> 00:03:06,333
I'm singing! I'm singing!

64
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:15,210
Hey, Chris, this field trip is your
chance, man. Alyssa's all alone.

65
00:03:17,025 --> 00:03:20,753
She's so pretty that, if your
hacky sack were my private parts,

66
00:03:20,786 --> 00:03:22,682
I'd let her do that to them.

67
00:03:22,716 --> 00:03:24,581
What? Kick them around?

68
00:03:24,636 --> 00:03:26,210
Um... wait.

69
00:03:26,885 --> 00:03:27,710
Yes.

70
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:29,383
Welcome, citizens.

71
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:33,243
Today we commemorate those
brave Quahog soldiers who perished

72
00:03:33,276 --> 00:03:35,140
in the recent Gulf conflict.

73
00:03:35,175 --> 00:03:37,912
I can think of no greater
tribute to their memories

74
00:03:37,957 --> 00:03:40,230
than this solid gold statue

75
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:43,422
of Dig 'Em, the Sugar Smacks frog.

76
00:03:44,896 --> 00:03:49,441
The spirit of America is epitomized
by his inspiring motto:

77
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:51,881
"Smack, smack, Sugar Smack. "

78
00:03:51,926 --> 00:03:53,963
"Gimme a smack,
and I'll smack you back. "

79
00:03:55,796 --> 00:03:59,652
I'd also like to take this opportunity
to announce extreme budget cutbacks

80
00:03:59,687 --> 00:04:03,160
having almost nothing to
do with this solid-gold statue.

81
00:04:04,947 --> 00:04:07,970
Have you ever seen such a
waste of the taxpayers' money?

82
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,582
You're talking to me!

83
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:12,990
This is more exciting than that time
me and my friends did mushrooms.

84
00:04:13,168 --> 00:04:14,951
This is gonna be awesome!

85
00:04:14,995 --> 00:04:16,212
You said it.

86
00:04:17,865 --> 00:04:19,932
Man, you guys feel anything yet?

87
00:04:19,976 --> 00:04:21,500
I feel kinda funny.

88
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:24,670
- I got a bellyache.
- We shouldn'ta did this, man.

89
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,492
Lois, darling, those
earrings are delicious.

90
00:04:30,527 --> 00:04:32,942
Total kitsch.
Like an Andy Warhol wet dream.

91
00:04:32,988 --> 00:04:35,910
I'm opening a museum and putting
you in it, they're that fabulous.

92
00:04:35,945 --> 00:04:39,161
You think it's clever talking like
that, do you? You think it's funny?

93
00:04:39,187 --> 00:04:41,362
Talking about earrings,
and using words like

94
00:04:41,408 --> 00:04:43,512
"fabulous" and "delicious" and "wet. "

95
00:04:43,555 --> 00:04:45,743
Oh, what's next? A workout
followed by a romp

96
00:04:45,788 --> 00:04:47,871
around a crowded room
while the music goes...

97
00:04:52,757 --> 00:04:54,283
Oh, why did you stop?

98
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:57,653
Hey, Jasper, let me ask you something.
When you're in the shower at the "Y,"

99
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,690
is that just like Supermarket Sweep

100
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:01,570
for you guys, or is there
some kind of etiquette?

101
00:05:01,598 --> 00:05:05,080
Peter, stop it. God! You're
more clueless than Popeye.

102
00:05:05,157 --> 00:05:07,961
Sir, I think you should know
these growths on your forearms

103
00:05:08,006 --> 00:05:09,513
they're giant tumors.

104
00:05:11,538 --> 00:05:13,431
Yeah, I'm surprised you haven't realized

105
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,612
this is not how a human
being is supposed to look.

106
00:05:17,936 --> 00:05:20,540
And the speech thing, and what
you're doing with your eye...

107
00:05:20,575 --> 00:05:23,000
uh, you had a stroke
about seven years ago.

108
00:05:25,085 --> 00:05:27,512
That you've managed to be
walking around all this time

109
00:05:27,526 --> 00:05:29,161
is nothing short of a miracle.

110
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:32,011
I'd say about two months.

111
00:05:32,107 --> 00:05:34,242
Okay, all right, time for
the big announcement.

112
00:05:34,386 --> 00:05:37,881
Everyone, Ricardo and I
are getting married!

113
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:41,070
Oh, that is terrific! It's about
time you two settled down.

114
00:05:41,127 --> 00:05:44,981
Oh, you hear that, Meg? Guys can
marry other guys now. So... um...

115
00:05:45,156 --> 00:05:48,062
this is awkward, but, uh...
I mean, if they can do that,

116
00:05:48,287 --> 00:05:50,242
that's pretty much it for you, isn't it?

117
00:05:50,277 --> 00:05:52,472
I mean, you might as well
pack it in. Game over.

118
00:05:55,878 --> 00:05:57,532
Alyssa, hi.

119
00:05:57,586 --> 00:06:00,123
I was wondering if maybe you wanted to

120
00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:02,650
- do something sometime?
- Sure, Chris.

121
00:06:02,705 --> 00:06:05,640
I have a Young Republicans meeting
after school. You wanna come?

122
00:06:05,655 --> 00:06:08,983
Sure. What do you do at a
Young Republicans meeting?

123
00:06:09,037 --> 00:06:11,923
We help those who already have
the means to help themselves.

124
00:06:11,947 --> 00:06:15,040
Also, we perpetuate the
ideal that Jesus chose America

125
00:06:15,078 --> 00:06:17,231
to destroy nonbelievers
and brown people.

126
00:06:17,255 --> 00:06:20,591
I don't understand what you're
saying, but somehow I feel safer.

127
00:06:25,365 --> 00:06:27,863
Karl, this is Chris.
He wants to join our club.

128
00:06:27,897 --> 00:06:29,401
Karl is our chancellor.

129
00:06:29,425 --> 00:06:31,192
Well, Chris, we'd be happy to have you.

130
00:06:31,226 --> 00:06:33,741
There's just one
little rite of initiation.

131
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:39,893
<i>Oh, this is one fine day to be nude</i>

132
00:06:40,336 --> 00:06:43,442
<i>Yeah, this is one
fine day to be nude</i>

133
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:47,910
<i>The birds are saying
"Clinton, have a wonderful spring"</i>

134
00:06:48,115 --> 00:06:51,433
<i>And people walking by
can stop and look at my thing</i>

135
00:06:51,475 --> 00:06:53,361
<i>Oh, this is one fine day...</i>

136
00:06:53,378 --> 00:06:55,520
Liberal chubby chaser!

137
00:06:56,627 --> 00:06:58,592
Well, if you can't laugh at yourself...

138
00:07:03,446 --> 00:07:06,742
I'm here at the parking lot outside
City Hall, where hundreds of citizens

139
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:08,950
have come out in protest
of the Mayor's decision

140
00:07:08,967 --> 00:07:11,172
to spend the town's
treasury on a gold frog.

141
00:07:11,278 --> 00:07:16,172
I don't like it. And I don't like
the contraction, apostrophe E-M.

142
00:07:16,248 --> 00:07:19,613
As far as I'm concerned,
his name is "Dig Them. "

143
00:07:19,632 --> 00:07:21,871
You're not welcome here, Dig Them.

144
00:07:21,928 --> 00:07:25,693
I stand behind my decision.
This press conference is over.

145
00:07:25,747 --> 00:07:28,944
I can't see you now. I can't hear
you now. You're not here now.

146
00:07:31,955 --> 00:07:34,052
Well, there you have it.
Back to you, Tom.

147
00:07:37,635 --> 00:07:41,073
Thanks, Tom. Some damn
fine reporting. Damn fine. Diane?

148
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:43,932
Well, it's encouraging
to know that I'm not

149
00:07:43,957 --> 00:07:46,663
the only Mayor West
who's facing difficulties.

150
00:07:46,715 --> 00:07:50,272
But what I need now
is a diversion. Let's see.

151
00:07:57,536 --> 00:07:59,371
Jingle keys.

152
00:08:04,646 --> 00:08:07,193
My God! I'm a tomato!

153
00:08:09,467 --> 00:08:11,632
And now back to The Sound of Music.

154
00:08:19,955 --> 00:08:23,022
Oh, thank heaven.
The Von Trapp family escaped!

155
00:08:23,066 --> 00:08:27,121
- Reverend Mother, I have sinned.
- What is this sin, my child?

156
00:08:28,385 --> 00:08:31,713
- Oh, well. No harm done.
- I too have sinned, Mother.

157
00:08:31,787 --> 00:08:36,101
- Oh, my God! That's Rolfe!
- What the hell is wrong with you?

158
00:08:36,147 --> 00:08:38,371
Hey, I didn't start
this war, but it's on!

159
00:08:39,855 --> 00:08:41,462
Oh, Lois, there you are.

160
00:08:41,476 --> 00:08:44,812
Listen, Ricardo and I want to thank you
for letting us have the wedding here.

161
00:08:45,787 --> 00:08:47,773
You're having the wedding here?

162
00:08:47,808 --> 00:08:50,071
Yeah. I hope that's okay, Lois.
I offered them the house.

163
00:08:51,225 --> 00:08:53,052
Sure. No problem.

164
00:08:53,328 --> 00:08:55,242
Hey, McButt the Crime Dog,

165
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:58,743
I heard you and your little chew toy
getting it on last night. Keep it down.

166
00:08:58,815 --> 00:09:01,491
Sorry, little man.
Ricardo and I were playing Clue,

167
00:09:01,546 --> 00:09:03,692
and he got me in the
bedroom with a lead pipe.

168
00:09:04,005 --> 00:09:07,541
Peter, I'm not sure I'm comfortable
having this wedding at the house.

169
00:09:07,587 --> 00:09:10,060
Lois, I don't know what the
big deal is. So they're gay.

170
00:09:10,106 --> 00:09:12,752
It's not like we're gonna have a
gay sex orgy in the living room.

171
00:09:16,546 --> 00:09:18,243
That's not what I'm talking about.

172
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,732
I've got nothing against
homosexuals. I mean,

173
00:09:20,766 --> 00:09:22,732
I'll watch anything
with David Schwimmer.

174
00:09:22,757 --> 00:09:26,071
But the idea of two men
actually getting married.

175
00:09:26,116 --> 00:09:27,980
It just doesn't seem right.

176
00:09:28,058 --> 00:09:29,590
Hey, I say who cares, you know?

177
00:09:29,605 --> 00:09:31,043
If gays wanna get married and be

178
00:09:31,055 --> 00:09:33,183
miserable like the rest of us,
I say we should let 'em.

179
00:09:33,207 --> 00:09:34,633
<i>Oh, no!</i>

180
00:09:34,738 --> 00:09:36,201
- What's wrong?
- Look.

181
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:39,013
Some breaking news today when
Mayor West announced he will sign

182
00:09:39,047 --> 00:09:41,583
a citywide ban on gay
marriages next week.

183
00:09:41,616 --> 00:09:44,363
While controversial, it has
nonetheless effectively distracted

184
00:09:44,398 --> 00:09:46,163
all of us from the Dig 'Em fiasco.

185
00:09:46,187 --> 00:09:48,263
- The what?
- I don't know. Something about a lizard.

186
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,412
And now this.

187
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:50,600
Look at that.

188
00:09:50,746 --> 00:09:53,460
In the '30s, they called this
an Uncle Spinny Dervish.

189
00:09:53,517 --> 00:09:55,260
- Really?
- I don't know. I'm just bored.

190
00:09:55,338 --> 00:09:58,052
A ban on gay marriage?!
Oh, my God!

191
00:10:00,325 --> 00:10:01,822
Matthew McConaughey?

192
00:10:01,847 --> 00:10:03,762
Yeah. I'm looking for
a guy named Stewie.

193
00:10:04,586 --> 00:10:06,553
Chris, grab his legs.
I gotta bury this thing.

194
00:10:06,575 --> 00:10:08,230
- But I.
- Grab his legs!

195
00:10:13,576 --> 00:10:15,752
I can't believe the wedding's off.

196
00:10:15,987 --> 00:10:19,003
All I ever wanted was to get married
and make a home with a skinny,

197
00:10:19,027 --> 00:10:21,923
hairless Filipino boy.
Isn't that the American dream?

198
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:23,402
Don't give up yet, Jasper.

199
00:10:23,426 --> 00:10:25,280
Mayor West only banned
gay marriage so

200
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,133
he could distract from the Dig 'Em scandal.

201
00:10:27,165 --> 00:10:28,491
He won't get away with it.

202
00:10:28,575 --> 00:10:30,940
Ah, Jasper, where'd you
get these brownies?

203
00:10:30,976 --> 00:10:33,440
They're from a bakery in
the West Quahog gay district.

204
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,220
I thought they'd help my depression.

205
00:10:35,258 --> 00:10:36,690
Oh, I can see why.

206
00:10:36,718 --> 00:10:40,010
Oh, my God, they pack
so much fudge into these.

207
00:10:40,047 --> 00:10:42,532
And look at this, there's even
a couple of nuts lodged in there.

208
00:10:42,555 --> 00:10:43,911
I'm going upstairs.

209
00:10:44,015 --> 00:10:45,500
I've got to do something.

210
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:47,840
Jasper's always been there
for me when I've needed him.

211
00:10:47,907 --> 00:10:50,432
I am going to make
Mayor West change his mind.

212
00:10:50,477 --> 00:10:54,232
But, Brian, the Bible says gay
marriage is an abomination.

213
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:56,473
Oh, don't give me that
Young Republican crap, Chris.

214
00:10:56,518 --> 00:10:58,680
The Bible also says a
senior citizen built an

215
00:10:58,705 --> 00:11:00,653
ark and rounded up two of every animal.

216
00:11:04,827 --> 00:11:06,471
What the hell is this?

217
00:11:07,447 --> 00:11:10,162
you didn't really give any
specific guidelines about mating.

218
00:11:10,218 --> 00:11:11,671
- Did you name it?
- What?

219
00:11:11,728 --> 00:11:14,272
- Did you name it?
- Uh, yeah, he's Paul.

220
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:16,412
Yeah, it's going to be a hell
of a lot harder for you now,

221
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,152
'cause he's going the **** overboard.

222
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,173
Hi, Glenn.

223
00:11:21,207 --> 00:11:24,922
Hey, will you sign a petition to overturn
Mayor West's ban on gay marriage?

224
00:11:24,956 --> 00:11:26,590
Gay marriage?
Oh, come on,

225
00:11:26,628 --> 00:11:28,532
two halves can't make
a whole without a hole.

226
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:37,962
You get off my property, you pervert.

227
00:11:38,428 --> 00:11:40,892
Uh, Mr. Bottomtooth, would
you like to sign the petition?

228
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,142
Uh, I don't...

229
00:11:45,165 --> 00:11:47,193
wha-wha-what's the problem?

230
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:52,812
Uh, okay. Thank you.

231
00:12:10,098 --> 00:12:12,933
Chris, did you hear?
Some dog is going around town

232
00:12:12,957 --> 00:12:14,893
trying to get support for gay marriage.

233
00:12:14,926 --> 00:12:17,300
Oh, that's Brian. He's got a petition.

234
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:20,432
Really? Chris, you've got
to destroy that petition.

235
00:12:20,457 --> 00:12:21,170
Why?

236
00:12:21,196 --> 00:12:23,893
Because if you do, I'll
let you touch my boobs.

237
00:12:24,006 --> 00:12:25,801
Is... is that good?

238
00:12:25,835 --> 00:12:28,592
- Do I want that?
- Oh, yeah, you want that.

239
00:12:28,645 --> 00:12:30,231
Well, fantastic then.

240
00:12:32,508 --> 00:12:34,260
How can I help you, Mrs. Griffin?

241
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,481
Well, I'm having a bit of a crisis.

242
00:12:36,526 --> 00:12:38,502
I'm a very open-minded person,

243
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:41,521
and I've never had any
problem with gays before, but

244
00:12:41,575 --> 00:12:46,483
something about two gay people getting
married, I just don't think it's right.

245
00:12:46,538 --> 00:12:49,903
Well, these questions are too big
to be decided by human beings.

246
00:12:49,947 --> 00:12:52,192
Which is why God made this film.

247
00:12:56,955 --> 00:13:00,302
You know, there's been a lot
of talk lately about homosexuals,

248
00:13:00,356 --> 00:13:02,483
but how do you know what to believe?

249
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,870
Well, here are a few tips
that may help you tell

250
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,700
when you've got a gay.

251
00:13:06,968 --> 00:13:09,361
So what's your favorite Madonna album?

252
00:13:09,385 --> 00:13:10,670
I like her early work.

253
00:13:10,686 --> 00:13:12,463
<i>If his answer is anything but</i>

254
00:13:12,488 --> 00:13:14,003
<i>"I've never bought one,"</i>

255
00:13:14,157 --> 00:13:15,712
<i>you've got a gay.</i>

256
00:13:15,957 --> 00:13:18,171
Let's take a blood sample, Mr. Braga.

257
00:13:18,846 --> 00:13:20,510
<i>If instead of human blood,</i>

258
00:13:20,546 --> 00:13:22,672
<i>you find a deadly corrosive acid,</i>

259
00:13:22,937 --> 00:13:24,590
<i>you've got a gay.</i>

260
00:13:32,328 --> 00:13:34,603
<i>Not this time, Nancy boy.</i>

261
00:13:36,936 --> 00:13:38,912
Wow, that was interesting.

262
00:13:38,936 --> 00:13:41,662
I also have My Giant with Billy Crystal.

263
00:13:41,686 --> 00:13:43,282
Oh, God, no, no.

264
00:13:46,848 --> 00:13:50,341
Well, we almost have enough signatures,
thanks to Ouahog's gay district.

265
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:53,293
Lois, how'd you like to be
signature number 10,000?

266
00:13:53,337 --> 00:13:55,231
Brian, I can't sign this.

267
00:13:55,265 --> 00:13:56,102
Why not?

268
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,943
Well, because I don't
believe in gay marriage.

269
00:13:58,987 --> 00:14:00,201
You don't believe...?

270
00:14:00,225 --> 00:14:03,082
Lois, that's ridiculous. Gay people
have every right to get married.

271
00:14:03,127 --> 00:14:06,102
Well, they certainly have every
right to be together, but marriage

272
00:14:06,147 --> 00:14:07,942
should be between a man and a woman.

273
00:14:07,967 --> 00:14:10,090
Well, that's not how they
do it in West Quahog.

274
00:14:10,236 --> 00:14:12,272
By the way, Lois, I got
a piercing over there.

275
00:14:12,308 --> 00:14:14,423
I'm not going to tell you
where, but I'll give you a hint.

276
00:14:14,505 --> 00:14:17,383
It wasn't my nose or my ear
and it was one of my balls.

277
00:14:17,428 --> 00:14:19,013
Well, regardless of what you think,

278
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:20,802
this is going to change
Mayor West's mind,

279
00:14:20,815 --> 00:14:22,722
and we are going to have
Jasper's wedding here.

280
00:14:22,755 --> 00:14:25,851
Fine. Then until this is all over,
I'll stay somewhere else.

281
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:28,121
Come on, Stewie, we're going
to Grandma and Grandpa's.

282
00:14:28,147 --> 00:14:30,730
Fine I'll go, but I'm not
missing that gay wedding.

283
00:14:30,756 --> 00:14:33,621
I still kick myself for missing
that Topless Cheerleader Parade

284
00:14:33,635 --> 00:14:35,262
with the hundred-foot
chocolate teddy bear

285
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:38,890
and the F-16s doing aerial acrobatics
choreographed to the music of Queen.

286
00:14:39,048 --> 00:14:40,982
Oh, I remember that day.

287
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:44,380
Should have gone to that thing.

288
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:52,201
My petition!
What the hell are you doing?

289
00:14:52,257 --> 00:14:55,060
I'm going to get to touch
right-wing boob because of this.

290
00:14:55,096 --> 00:14:58,023
You idiot! Now I'm going to have
to get 10,000 more signatures

291
00:14:58,068 --> 00:15:00,120
before tomorrow morning.
What were you thinking?!

292
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:02,092
You don't understand, Brian.

293
00:15:02,128 --> 00:15:04,511
When was the last time you
were even with a woman?

294
00:15:04,645 --> 00:15:06,852
Uh... when did the Challenger blow up?

295
00:15:06,876 --> 00:15:07,801
'86.

296
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:09,741
Yeah, it was like
three years before that.

297
00:15:12,568 --> 00:15:15,301
Mayor West, here's the gay
marriage ban for your approval.

298
00:15:15,337 --> 00:15:17,301
Excellent.
This is so important,

299
00:15:17,337 --> 00:15:20,651
I'm going to sign it with all
capital letters. it's going to say,

300
00:15:20,815 --> 00:15:22,821
"ADAM WEST."

301
00:15:23,008 --> 00:15:24,841
That's what it's going
to say, you'll see.

302
00:15:25,136 --> 00:15:26,863
Hey, buddy, you can't go in there.

303
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:29,790
Mayor West, you have to look at this.

304
00:15:29,806 --> 00:15:31,352
10,000 signatures.

305
00:15:31,385 --> 00:15:33,823
I've been up for 24 hours,
I paid off a few people

306
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:36,590
and I did a few things in
West Quahog I'm not proud of.

307
00:15:42,517 --> 00:15:45,592
So, it's a show about three
hookers and their mom?

308
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:47,042
This is very impressive,

309
00:15:47,107 --> 00:15:49,011
but my decision stands.

310
00:15:49,927 --> 00:15:50,600
No!

311
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,302
Come on, buddy, you're leaving.

312
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,411
No, I can't let Jasper down.

313
00:15:55,857 --> 00:15:57,533
I'm not going to let you sign that.

314
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:58,722
Go on, get out of here.

315
00:16:01,277 --> 00:16:02,482
I should warn you,

316
00:16:02,497 --> 00:16:06,623
I have a tiny bullet-proof
shield the exact size of a bullet

317
00:16:06,645 --> 00:16:09,390
somewhere on my body.
And if you hit it,

318
00:16:09,447 --> 00:16:12,952
I'll be unharmed and
your plan will be foiled.

319
00:16:13,007 --> 00:16:15,633
You'll be the laughingstock of me.

320
00:16:15,657 --> 00:16:17,363
I don't want to shoot you, Mayor West.

321
00:16:17,408 --> 00:16:19,560
Good, because I'm incredibly crafty.

322
00:16:19,595 --> 00:16:21,233
Hey, what's that on the ceiling?

323
00:16:22,545 --> 00:16:24,130
Now I'm over here.

324
00:16:28,275 --> 00:16:30,321
Look, this has gotten
out of hand, I know.

325
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:32,302
I don't want anyone to get hurt.

326
00:16:32,335 --> 00:16:35,971
You can put an end to this right now
by tearing up that gay marriage ban.

327
00:16:36,027 --> 00:16:38,990
You won't break me.
15 years ago I swallowed

328
00:16:39,026 --> 00:16:42,310
everything I needed to
escape from a hostage situation.

329
00:16:49,285 --> 00:16:50,453
A wall!

330
00:16:50,536 --> 00:16:54,693
Well, no matter. I'm prepared
for a lengthy captivity as well.

331
00:16:57,368 --> 00:17:01,011
I swallowed this People magazine in 1989.

332
00:17:01,098 --> 00:17:05,693
All right, Paul Hogan, tell me
about the real Crocodile Dundee.

333
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:11,030
It's so nice to have you home, dear.

334
00:17:11,045 --> 00:17:12,391
I can take it or leave it.

335
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,822
God, this is such an old
people house, you know.

336
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:16,342
I mean, look at this candy jar.

337
00:17:16,376 --> 00:17:18,511
Let's take a look in here.
Let's see what you got here.

338
00:17:18,556 --> 00:17:19,523
You got, uh...

339
00:17:19,565 --> 00:17:20,812
Oh, you got licorice.

340
00:17:20,825 --> 00:17:23,041
Oh, that's, uh, that's, uh...
Oh, Freedent.

341
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:24,031
Oh, that's good.

342
00:17:24,058 --> 00:17:27,153
Yeah, yeah, I got a sweet tooth,
I think I'll have some Freedent.

343
00:17:28,116 --> 00:17:29,863
Oh, what's this?
Oh, a cough drop.

344
00:17:29,897 --> 00:17:32,230
A Luden's cough drop.
Is that candy?

345
00:17:32,277 --> 00:17:34,670
No, I don't think that's candy.
I think it's a cough drop!

346
00:17:35,147 --> 00:17:37,362
Uh, what else we got?
Oh, look, look at this.

347
00:17:37,407 --> 00:17:39,081
There's a fishing lure in here.

348
00:17:39,288 --> 00:17:42,001
There's a fishing lure in the candy jar.

349
00:17:42,526 --> 00:17:44,853
What, am I supposed to eat this?

350
00:17:45,228 --> 00:17:46,553
Eat a fishing lure?

351
00:17:46,628 --> 00:17:48,233
Hey, look, Brian's on TV.

352
00:17:48,305 --> 00:17:50,940
And now, some Channel 5
exclusive footage of the

353
00:17:50,976 --> 00:17:53,920
crazed homosexual gunman
who's taken Mayor West hostage.

354
00:17:53,957 --> 00:17:57,023
Oh, my God! Brian's taken
the Mayor hostage?!

355
00:17:57,057 --> 00:17:59,123
Is this an eyeglass lens?

356
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:01,962
I didn't realize how
strongly he feels about this.

357
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,912
Gay marriage. Next thing you
know, they'll want to vote.

358
00:18:04,948 --> 00:18:07,113
Oh, oh, look at this.
A spare key

359
00:18:07,168 --> 00:18:09,231
for a Volkswagen Scirocco.

360
00:18:09,295 --> 00:18:11,171
They don't even make this anymore.

361
00:18:11,218 --> 00:18:13,351
They don't even make this car anymore.

362
00:18:13,407 --> 00:18:15,531
Whose key could this possibly be?

363
00:18:15,577 --> 00:18:17,532
What if Brian's right? I mean,

364
00:18:17,565 --> 00:18:20,750
certainly the love between a man and
a woman should be sacred, but...

365
00:18:20,786 --> 00:18:23,003
Who's talking about love?
We're talking about marriage.

366
00:18:23,025 --> 00:18:24,582
Well, don't you love Mom?

367
00:18:24,606 --> 00:18:26,031
Come on, Lois, look at her.

368
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:29,541
So two straight people who hate each
other have more of a right to be together

369
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,511
than two gay people who love each other?

370
00:18:31,536 --> 00:18:33,670
That's what we raised you to believe.

371
00:18:33,748 --> 00:18:36,541
Oh, my God!
I've made a terrible mistake!

372
00:18:36,598 --> 00:18:39,232
I've been brainwashed
like Elizabeth Smart.

373
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:41,723
It's so wonderful having her home again.

374
00:18:41,758 --> 00:18:45,072
She's brought music back into the
house. Playing songs on the harp.

375
00:18:45,515 --> 00:18:47,890
Of course, most of them are
about rape, but it's still nice.

376
00:18:49,678 --> 00:18:51,782
I think I made Brian crazy.

377
00:18:51,828 --> 00:18:53,771
Maybe I shouldn't have
burned that petition.

378
00:18:53,797 --> 00:18:55,892
Oh, no, Chris, you did the right thing.

379
00:18:55,928 --> 00:18:58,433
It's only a matter of time
before Mayor West signs

380
00:18:58,466 --> 00:19:00,750
that bill, and you'll
get to touch these.

381
00:19:00,795 --> 00:19:03,913
Oh, boy, I got a feeling that
before the end of the day,

382
00:19:03,948 --> 00:19:05,781
I'm going to be burying my dog.

383
00:19:05,807 --> 00:19:08,713
Whoa, whoa, I said you could
touch my boobs. Let's start with that.

384
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:11,312
Look, Peter, if you can't
get Brian to come out

385
00:19:11,328 --> 00:19:13,160
peacefully, we're going to
have to take him down.

386
00:19:13,178 --> 00:19:15,563
Don't worry, Joe, I'm
good with tight situations.

387
00:19:15,585 --> 00:19:17,650
Like when I saved Luke Skywalker's life.

388
00:19:18,327 --> 00:19:19,702
Okay, Luke,

389
00:19:19,728 --> 00:19:22,322
this will keep you warm
until I get the shelter built.

390
00:19:25,936 --> 00:19:28,740
- You sure this is okay?
- Yeah, you're just cutting into the fat.

391
00:19:28,808 --> 00:19:31,121
All right, Brian, Peter's coming in.

392
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:34,573
I'll relax him by using my catchphrase.

393
00:19:35,665 --> 00:19:38,202
Hey, whassa happa witchu?

394
00:19:40,996 --> 00:19:42,991
- What the hell was that?
- My catchphrase.

395
00:19:43,006 --> 00:19:44,242
You don't have a catchphrase.

396
00:19:44,256 --> 00:19:46,062
Why you gotta sayya like a-dat?

397
00:19:48,408 --> 00:19:49,370
Excuse me.

398
00:19:51,397 --> 00:19:54,770
Would anyone like to play
Stratego? I have Stratego.

399
00:19:55,078 --> 00:19:57,211
Peter, I never meant for this to happen.

400
00:19:57,236 --> 00:20:00,311
This whole situation is
totally spiraled out of control.

401
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,033
Brian, listen to me.

402
00:20:02,087 --> 00:20:04,792
I was wrong. If two
people love each other,

403
00:20:04,815 --> 00:20:06,961
they should have the
right to get married.

404
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,793
But you have to come
down and give yourself up.

405
00:20:09,866 --> 00:20:13,670
If you drag this out any longer,
you're only hurting your own cause.

406
00:20:15,268 --> 00:20:16,532
She's right.

407
00:20:16,587 --> 00:20:18,142
I'm sorry, Mayor West.

408
00:20:18,168 --> 00:20:20,902
Well, you were only doing what
you thought was right, Brian.

409
00:20:20,926 --> 00:20:24,040
And, hey, you've distracted
everyone from the Dig 'Em statue,

410
00:20:24,086 --> 00:20:26,812
so I guess we don't
need this bill anymore.

411
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:32,883
Evera-bodah ha-ppy!

412
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:45,973
Well, it sure was nice of Mayor West
to drop the kidnapping charges.

413
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:49,921
Amazing. All he asked for in return
was the key to a Volkswagen Scirocco.

414
00:20:49,946 --> 00:20:51,113
You're welcome.

415
00:20:51,148 --> 00:20:52,380
Listen, Lois, I...

416
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,711
I really appreciate you
putting your discomfort aside,

417
00:20:54,727 --> 00:20:56,131
so we can have the wedding here.

418
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:58,270
Please, I'm over all that now.

419
00:20:58,328 --> 00:21:01,021
Two men getting married
doesn't bother me in the least.

420
00:21:01,056 --> 00:21:02,482
They deserve happiness.

421
00:21:02,525 --> 00:21:04,262
Everybody gay!

422
00:21:04,747 --> 00:21:07,270
