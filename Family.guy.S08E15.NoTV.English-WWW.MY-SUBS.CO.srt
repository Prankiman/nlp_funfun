3
00:00:07,315 --> 00:00:09,502
Fully eight months on patrol and nothin'.

4
00:00:09,627 --> 00:00:11,995
You know, Rupert,
I miss the Earth so much.

5
00:00:12,063 --> 00:00:13,196
I miss my wife.

6
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:14,364
It's lonely out in spac...

7
00:00:18,135 --> 00:00:19,902
Uh-oh, Rupert,
we've got company,

8
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,970
and I don't think
it's the Avon lady.

9
00:00:24,173 --> 00:00:25,508
Strap yourself in.

10
00:00:25,576 --> 00:00:26,957
No matter what happens,

11
00:00:27,025 --> 00:00:29,209
it's been a privilege
to serve under you.

12
00:01:05,408 --> 00:01:06,917
Don't relax yet, Rupert,

13
00:01:06,993 --> 00:01:09,371
those fighters had to have
been coming from somewhere.

14
00:01:11,554 --> 00:01:14,109
Oh, my God.

15
00:01:34,484 --> 00:01:37,124
Wait a minute, Rupert,

16
00:01:37,193 --> 00:01:38,597
there's a weapons
systems cooling duct

17
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,308
on the far side
of the hull.

18
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:42,385
If we can get just
one good shot at it,

19
00:01:42,453 --> 00:01:44,997
we can blow that fat
bastard out of the cosmos.

20
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,761
Uh-oh, Rupert, our
main blasters are gone.

21
00:02:20,828 --> 00:02:23,235
Looks like this is
a suicide mission.

22
00:02:32,306 --> 00:02:35,453
Got you! Got you! Got you!
Got you! Got you!

23
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,794
Stewie, get lost. Daddy's
trying to watch the ball game.

24
00:02:37,862 --> 00:02:40,035
You can't talk. I've knocked
out your communication systems.

25
00:02:40,103 --> 00:02:41,340
Hey, hey, look, Stewie,

26
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,813
Rupert wants to go play
down in the basement.

27
00:02:42,881 --> 00:02:44,184
Hey, hey, Stewie,

28
00:02:44,252 --> 00:02:45,758
I'm gonna go play
down in the basement.

29
00:02:45,826 --> 00:02:46,929
Here I go.
♪ Do-do-do-do-do. ♪

30
00:02:46,996 --> 00:02:48,299
What? Why, Rupert?

31
00:02:48,367 --> 00:02:49,471
Why do you want to play
in the basement?

32
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:51,108
I don't know, I just feel like

33
00:02:51,176 --> 00:02:52,579
there might be some
fun stuff down there.

34
00:02:52,646 --> 00:02:53,849
I'm not following
your logic.

35
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,522
And why are you talking
different than usual?

36
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:56,625
Here I go.

37
00:02:56,693 --> 00:02:57,928
Rupert, get back here.

38
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:00,369
Rupert?

39
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,775
Oh, there you are.

40
00:03:01,843 --> 00:03:04,452
Wow, look at all
the old stuff down here.

41
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,722
Hello, what's this?

42
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:11,038
"What I Learned
on Jefferson Street.

43
00:03:11,106 --> 00:03:13,345
Written by H. Brian Griffin."

44
00:03:13,413 --> 00:03:15,218
Oh, yes.

45
00:03:22,775 --> 00:03:23,976
What's this?

46
00:03:24,043 --> 00:03:25,112
What the hell...

47
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,349
Where the hell
did this come from?

48
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:27,587
What is it, Brian?

49
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:29,225
It's the first thing
I ever wrote.

50
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,131
It's a script for a
television show, a drama.

51
00:03:31,198 --> 00:03:32,970
I had an idea for a script once.

52
00:03:33,038 --> 00:03:35,177
It's basically <i>Jaws,</i> except
when the guys in the boat

53
00:03:35,245 --> 00:03:36,682
are going after Jaws,

54
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,955
they look around and there's
an even bigger Jaws,

55
00:03:39,023 --> 00:03:42,365
so the guys have to team up
with Jaws to get bigger Jaws.

56
00:03:42,432 --> 00:03:44,104
I call it <i>Big Jaws.</i>

57
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:45,943
God, I haven't looked
at this in years.

58
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,382
I don't even remember
if it's any good or not.

59
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,557
Oh, wait a minute.

60
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,663
Yeah, yeah, this is all
coming back to me.

61
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:55,638
You know, this is actually
not too bad a piece of work.

62
00:03:55,706 --> 00:03:58,178
This was... this was kind
of deep as I recall.

63
00:03:58,245 --> 00:04:00,283
You know, Lois, you...
you might actually be interested

64
00:04:00,351 --> 00:04:02,456
in reading this.

65
00:04:02,523 --> 00:04:04,094
You... you...
you might actually...

66
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:06,668
You... you might like this.

67
00:04:06,736 --> 00:04:08,607
You should look at it.

68
00:04:14,757 --> 00:04:16,727
All right, damn it!

69
00:04:19,664 --> 00:04:22,131
So, have you read
the script yet?

70
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,833
Oh, I'm sorry, Brian,
I haven't gotten around to it.

71
00:04:24,901 --> 00:04:26,268
Why not now, you know?

72
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:27,469
Just get it
off your plate.

73
00:04:27,537 --> 00:04:29,038
Oh, gosh, you know what?

74
00:04:29,106 --> 00:04:31,040
I don't even know what I did
with the copy that you ga...

75
00:04:31,108 --> 00:04:32,915
Oh, (bleep), there it is.

76
00:04:32,983 --> 00:04:34,450
Hey, you know what else
would be great?

77
00:04:34,518 --> 00:04:36,518
Why... why don't you put check
marks next to scenes you like?

78
00:04:36,586 --> 00:04:38,652
- Well, I don't have a...
- Here's a pen.

79
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,254
You know, I'll... I'll just
leave it for you right here.

80
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,822
Okay. Thank you, Brian.

81
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,757
Hey, you know what I'll do
to make it even easier?

82
00:04:45,824 --> 00:04:47,891
I'll just go ahead and
place this in your hand.

83
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,326
There we are.

84
00:04:49,393 --> 00:04:51,694
And now when you go,
"Oh, where's that crazy pen?"

85
00:04:51,762 --> 00:04:53,096
Well, there it is.

86
00:04:53,163 --> 00:04:54,530
It's in your hand.

87
00:04:54,598 --> 00:04:56,899
Brian, I'm not gonna read this
with you standing here.

88
00:04:56,966 --> 00:04:58,968
Oh, it's okay,
I don't mind.

89
00:04:59,036 --> 00:05:00,537
Go for a ride in the car?

90
00:05:05,342 --> 00:05:06,542
Come on!

91
00:05:10,681 --> 00:05:13,782
Why the hell's it taking her
so long to read that thing?

92
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,851
I don't know, I saw
her giving Joe notes

93
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:16,985
on his pilot this morning.

94
00:05:17,053 --> 00:05:18,019
What?

95
00:05:18,087 --> 00:05:19,287
Brian, your script...

96
00:05:20,823 --> 00:05:23,057
It was enchanting.

97
00:05:23,124 --> 00:05:24,891
This Brian Griffin...

98
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,693
I've never met this
Brian Griffin.

99
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,161
I would have told you
last night,

100
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:30,563
but I was 100% sure
you ripped it off.

101
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,398
But after spending
the last eighteen hours

102
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:33,732
on the Internet
and in libraries

103
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,134
trying to find traces
of it somewhere,

104
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:37,172
I couldn't find a thing.

105
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,475
Well, I... I'm...
I'm so happy you liked it.

106
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:40,976
Look, I don't want
to get your hopes up,

107
00:05:41,043 --> 00:05:43,444
but Daddy's got some
connections over at CBS,

108
00:05:43,512 --> 00:05:46,514
and I think he could
help you get this on TV.

109
00:05:46,582 --> 00:05:48,616
That's amazing, Lois!
Thank you!

110
00:05:48,684 --> 00:05:51,385
Oh, I am very proud of you.

111
00:05:51,453 --> 00:05:53,219
My God, a TV pilot.

112
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:55,682
Wow, Brian, you must
feel like Hitler did

113
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,784
after he wrote <i>Mein Kampf.</i>

114
00:05:57,852 --> 00:06:00,052
Well, we read it and
we don't like it.

115
00:06:01,188 --> 00:06:02,255
We love it!

116
00:06:03,858 --> 00:06:05,559
You got me!

117
00:06:05,628 --> 00:06:07,997
I could have killed you,
Mr. Weinberg!

118
00:06:22,111 --> 00:06:25,914
"Dear Diary, still no sign
of that tampon from last week,

119
00:06:25,981 --> 00:06:28,115
but the headaches
are getting worse."

120
00:06:29,651 --> 00:06:31,985
Chris, what are you doing?!
Give me that!

121
00:06:38,326 --> 00:06:40,756
Well, I'm off to buy
imaginary groceries.

122
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,391
Do you think he's okay?

123
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:50,794
I don't know.

124
00:06:50,862 --> 00:06:52,230
You idiot,
this is your fault.

125
00:06:52,297 --> 00:06:53,398
My fault?

126
00:06:53,465 --> 00:06:54,899
You were the one
chasing me.

127
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:56,467
You were the one
reading my diary.

128
00:06:56,534 --> 00:06:57,568
Kids, breakfast.

129
00:06:57,635 --> 00:06:58,635
What do we do?

130
00:06:58,703 --> 00:06:59,736
Is he breathing?

131
00:06:59,804 --> 00:07:00,870
It... it looks like it.

132
00:07:00,938 --> 00:07:02,038
That's a good sign, right?

133
00:07:12,648 --> 00:07:14,506
Brian, I'm afraid I'm going
to have to be blunt with you.

134
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,951
- Yeah?
- We love this pilot!

135
00:07:18,018 --> 00:07:21,453
Oh, my God,
I felt like Hitler just then.

136
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:23,189
- What?
- It was a joke.

137
00:07:23,257 --> 00:07:24,557
I just... I just said
I felt like Hitler.

138
00:07:26,293 --> 00:07:29,060
What?
Nobody here's Jewish, right?

139
00:07:29,127 --> 00:07:32,194
Uh, gee, I don't know,
are you Jewish, Gordon?

140
00:07:32,262 --> 00:07:34,262
Gee, I don't know,
Jeremy, are you?

141
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,063
I... I had no idea.

142
00:07:36,131 --> 00:07:37,364
I'm... I'm sorry.

143
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:40,065
Hey, Brian.
We're both Italian.

144
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:41,933
You're in.

145
00:07:44,703 --> 00:07:46,403
That's a good one.
That's a good one.

146
00:07:53,892 --> 00:07:55,059
Chris, I'm worried.

147
00:07:55,156 --> 00:07:56,456
Stewie's still unconscious.

148
00:07:56,523 --> 00:07:57,756
Maybe he's just sleeping.

149
00:07:57,824 --> 00:07:59,091
Is Stewie in here?

150
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:00,358
Ye... yes.

151
00:08:00,426 --> 00:08:01,659
Well, can you
give him to me?

152
00:08:01,727 --> 00:08:03,060
It's time
for his dinner.

153
00:08:03,128 --> 00:08:04,728
Oh, don't worry, Mom,
we'll bring him down.

154
00:08:04,796 --> 00:08:07,300
Anything I can do to make
your life a little easier.

155
00:08:07,368 --> 00:08:09,370
Well, you could always
grab the vacuum

156
00:08:09,438 --> 00:08:11,173
and clean up the
living room floor.

157
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,841
Oh sure,
I'll take care of that.

158
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,111
Are you, uh,
running off to your job?

159
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:17,546
- Oh.
- Yeah.

160
00:08:17,614 --> 00:08:19,248
- Okay.
- Yeah.

161
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:25,920
Kids, what is taking so long?

162
00:08:25,988 --> 00:08:26,954
Dinner's ready.

163
00:08:30,925 --> 00:08:34,526
Oh, look at my little cowboy.

164
00:08:34,594 --> 00:08:37,296
Come on, Stewie,
up in your high chair.

165
00:08:39,265 --> 00:08:40,698
Boy, he must be starving.

166
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:43,768
Yeah, he's really
chowing down.

167
00:08:43,836 --> 00:08:45,436
Hey, how's the food,
Stewie?

168
00:08:45,504 --> 00:08:47,471
Oy, blimey,
it's right delicious,

169
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:49,473
I do declare.
Wacka wacka.

170
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,376
Brian, have you decided
who's gonna star in your show?

171
00:08:52,443 --> 00:08:53,944
Well, it's a tough role.

172
00:08:54,012 --> 00:08:56,080
I mean, Byron is a
twenty-five-year-old single father

173
00:08:56,147 --> 00:08:57,714
going back to finish college

174
00:08:57,782 --> 00:08:59,549
so he can do right
by his four-year-old daughter.

175
00:08:59,617 --> 00:09:01,485
So it's got to be somebody
who can project

176
00:09:01,552 --> 00:09:03,853
a certain amount of
world-wizened sophistication,

177
00:09:03,921 --> 00:09:05,388
while at the same time retaining

178
00:09:05,456 --> 00:09:07,256
a certain youthfully
passionate idealism.

179
00:09:07,324 --> 00:09:09,058
You know who'd be good?
Big Jaws.

180
00:09:09,126 --> 00:09:10,726
Actually, in my mind,
there's only one actor

181
00:09:10,793 --> 00:09:13,060
who could do this role:
Elijah Wood.

182
00:09:13,128 --> 00:09:14,562
Oh, Elijah Wood.

183
00:09:14,629 --> 00:09:17,397
I got a little bit
of a crush on him, I have.

184
00:09:17,465 --> 00:09:19,565
Oh, oh, look, Lois, wishbone.

185
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:20,799
Okay, ready?

186
00:09:20,867 --> 00:09:23,168
One, two, three.

187
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,203
Yes!

188
00:09:25,271 --> 00:09:26,138
I got five seconds.

189
00:09:31,544 --> 00:09:33,776
Hah! No gravity.

190
00:09:38,348 --> 00:09:40,450
There he is!

191
00:09:40,518 --> 00:09:41,585
Oh, go on.

192
00:09:41,652 --> 00:09:43,085
No, really, go on.

193
00:09:45,088 --> 00:09:47,158
Hi, I'm Todd Goldstein,

194
00:09:47,226 --> 00:09:49,498
senior executive of programming
here at the network.

195
00:09:49,566 --> 00:09:51,468
We are so happy
to be working with you.

196
00:09:51,536 --> 00:09:53,636
I hope you brought the magic
wand you wrote this with.

197
00:09:53,704 --> 00:09:55,171
Yep, it's right here.

198
00:09:55,239 --> 00:09:57,440
Watch, I'll turn this beautiful
princess into a toad.

199
00:09:57,507 --> 00:09:58,775
- Bing.
- Ribbit.

200
00:10:00,444 --> 00:10:01,644
Oh, all right,
I can tell

201
00:10:01,712 --> 00:10:03,346
this is gonna be
a fun process.

202
00:10:03,414 --> 00:10:05,719
You know, Brian, you've spun
gold into these pages,

203
00:10:05,787 --> 00:10:08,291
and it's our job to bring
that gold to the screen.

204
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:10,864
So, what do you say we get this
casting session started, huh?

205
00:10:10,932 --> 00:10:12,533
Let's do it.

206
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,602
- All right!
- Yeah!

207
00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:17,837
Okay, now obviously,
we love Elijah Wood

208
00:10:17,904 --> 00:10:20,238
for the part of Byron
as much as you do.

209
00:10:20,306 --> 00:10:21,904
The audition
is just a formality.

210
00:10:21,972 --> 00:10:23,071
Let's bring him in.

211
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:24,739
Elijah?

212
00:10:24,806 --> 00:10:25,973
Hi, everyone.

213
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,709
- Hey, Elijah, how are you?
- How you doing?

214
00:10:28,777 --> 00:10:30,076
So should I just
jump into this?

215
00:10:30,144 --> 00:10:31,811
Whenever you're ready.

216
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:33,512
Okay, I'll read you in, Elijah.

217
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,613
Now, this is the scene where
Byron's professor fails him

218
00:10:35,681 --> 00:10:37,148
for missing the
chemistry midterm

219
00:10:37,215 --> 00:10:39,516
to take his daughter
to the doctor.

220
00:10:39,584 --> 00:10:42,918
I'm sorry, Byron, missing the
midterm is an automatic failure.

221
00:10:42,986 --> 00:10:45,287
Go ahead, Professor Watkins,
fail me if you want.

222
00:10:45,355 --> 00:10:47,188
Give me an "F" on the exam.

223
00:10:47,256 --> 00:10:49,557
I don't care because
I got an "A" today...

224
00:10:49,624 --> 00:10:51,025
as a dad.

225
00:10:51,092 --> 00:10:52,493
Maybe this is news to you,

226
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,861
but love isn't some element
on your periodic table.

227
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:56,129
So, you know what?

228
00:10:56,196 --> 00:10:58,163
Keep your chromium
and magnesium,

229
00:10:58,231 --> 00:11:00,798
because I discovered
a much more precious element.

230
00:11:00,866 --> 00:11:02,402
I discovered Dadmium.

231
00:11:03,606 --> 00:11:05,340
Wow.

232
00:11:05,408 --> 00:11:07,843
Does that audition come
with a box of tissues?

233
00:11:07,911 --> 00:11:09,078
That was a great read.

234
00:11:09,145 --> 00:11:11,513
Thanks, everybody.

235
00:11:11,581 --> 00:11:13,114
I mean, come on.
How great is he?

236
00:11:13,182 --> 00:11:15,749
Wow. He's amazing.
That's our guy.

237
00:11:15,817 --> 00:11:17,017
That's our Byron.

238
00:11:17,084 --> 00:11:18,218
Great. Then we're
good to go.

239
00:11:18,285 --> 00:11:20,252
Look, since we're playing
with house money,

240
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,754
we do have
one more guy.

241
00:11:22,822 --> 00:11:24,189
- What?
- Oh, don't worry.

242
00:11:24,257 --> 00:11:25,257
He's not Byron.

243
00:11:25,325 --> 00:11:26,892
Somebody upstairs
threw out a name,

244
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,927
got real excited about it,

245
00:11:27,994 --> 00:11:29,328
so we're just
playing the game.

246
00:11:29,395 --> 00:11:31,530
Okay, so who?

247
00:11:31,597 --> 00:11:33,798
Hey, what's up, douche bags?

248
00:11:33,865 --> 00:11:35,532
I'm here to audition
for this stupid pilot.

249
00:11:37,801 --> 00:11:38,968
James Woods?

250
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:40,803
Thanks for
coming in, Jimmy.

251
00:11:40,871 --> 00:11:42,138
Do you need
a copy of the scene?

252
00:11:42,206 --> 00:11:43,673
Nah, I got it memorized.

253
00:11:43,741 --> 00:11:44,975
Just like
your wife's phone number.

254
00:11:47,011 --> 00:11:48,211
No, he didn't!

255
00:11:48,278 --> 00:11:49,745
I do, though.
I have it memorized.

256
00:11:49,813 --> 00:11:50,946
Wait a second.
I don't want this guy

257
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:52,147
anywhere near this show!

258
00:11:52,215 --> 00:11:53,882
He's been harassing
my family for years!

259
00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:56,351
He stalked my best friend and
then he stole his identity!

260
00:11:58,453 --> 00:12:00,187
Oh, my God.
That's an episode!

261
00:12:00,255 --> 00:12:01,555
Brian, will you
read him in?

262
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:05,125
I'm sorry, Byron.

263
00:12:05,193 --> 00:12:07,393
Missing the midterm
is an automatic failure.

264
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:09,595
Hey, science face,
I got an "F" for you.

265
00:12:09,663 --> 00:12:11,030
It stands for "(bleep) you."

266
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,565
There he is!

267
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:14,733
Hey, and guess what?

268
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,934
I discovered a new element.

269
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:21,873
Okay, thanks a lot,
everybody. I got to go.

270
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,775
I got some school
bus seats to sniff.

271
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,511
Seriously, stop it!

272
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:28,312
Okay, did everyone else
feel that?

273
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,280
I felt it.

274
00:12:29,347 --> 00:12:30,814
Oh, I felt it, too.

275
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:32,615
I felt whatever the most senior
executive in this room felt.

276
00:12:32,683 --> 00:12:34,083
Okay, good.
So we all felt it.

277
00:12:34,151 --> 00:12:36,051
Wait, you're not seriously
considering him, are you?

278
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:37,953
James Woods is insane.

279
00:12:38,021 --> 00:12:39,588
And on top of that,
he's, like, sixty.

280
00:12:39,655 --> 00:12:41,522
The character of Byron
is twenty-five years old.

281
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,690
I know, I know.

282
00:12:42,758 --> 00:12:45,259
But what if he wasn't?

283
00:12:45,327 --> 00:12:46,360
What? But he is.

284
00:12:46,428 --> 00:12:47,461
...n't.

285
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:48,963
My God,
this is a nightmare.

286
00:12:49,031 --> 00:12:50,865
I thought you said you weren't
gonna mess with my show.

287
00:12:50,932 --> 00:12:52,366
It's a small change, Brian.

288
00:12:52,434 --> 00:12:53,701
You won't even notice it.

289
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:55,303
You guys aren't gonna
(bleep) believe this.

290
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,537
Call a tow truck.

291
00:12:56,605 --> 00:12:58,805
I just banged
into some homo's Prius.

292
00:13:01,508 --> 00:13:03,876
This is Rob, our director.

293
00:13:03,944 --> 00:13:06,809
Hey, Brian. Really looking
forward to making your show.

294
00:13:06,876 --> 00:13:09,344
What's, uh, wha...
what's with all those empty seats?

295
00:13:09,412 --> 00:13:10,946
Well, that's where the audience
is gonna sit.

296
00:13:11,013 --> 00:13:12,280
Audience?

297
00:13:12,348 --> 00:13:13,781
This isn't a sitcom.
It's a drama.

298
00:13:13,849 --> 00:13:17,217
Well, we thought it would be a
lot funnier if it was a sitcom.

299
00:13:17,285 --> 00:13:18,952
It's... It's... It's not supposed
to be funny.

300
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,054
It's a serious drama
about a single father

301
00:13:21,121 --> 00:13:22,555
raising his
four-year-old daughter.

302
00:13:22,622 --> 00:13:24,490
Oh, right.
That's the other thing.

303
00:13:24,557 --> 00:13:26,657
Now, this is just a thought,
but we're doing it.

304
00:13:26,725 --> 00:13:28,092
- She's eighteen.
- What?

305
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,826
It was James Woods' idea

306
00:13:29,894 --> 00:13:31,528
and we thought it was
just the right hook.

307
00:13:31,596 --> 00:13:33,098
I mean,
how great is that?

308
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:36,334
A father and a daughter,
both in college together?

309
00:13:36,402 --> 00:13:38,402
Hey, do you guys think this
outfit is too revealing?

310
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,670
What... what do
you think, Brian?

311
00:13:39,738 --> 00:13:40,738
I mean, what...
what do you think

312
00:13:40,805 --> 00:13:42,039
of the ta-tas,
you know what I mean?

313
00:13:42,106 --> 00:13:44,274
Can we do better?
I think we can do better, right?

314
00:13:44,342 --> 00:13:45,909
Who is this?
Where'd you get this girl?

315
00:13:45,977 --> 00:13:48,044
Oh, by the way,
I need a chimp sidekick.

316
00:13:52,482 --> 00:13:54,083
Maybe we should take him
to the hospital.

317
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,550
I think the maggots
have evolved

318
00:13:55,618 --> 00:13:57,485
to the point that they've
developed space travel.

319
00:14:01,489 --> 00:14:03,523
We just gotta clean
the wound, Meg.

320
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,024
Hand me that
scrub brush.

321
00:14:06,293 --> 00:14:07,326
Hey, Chris.

322
00:14:07,394 --> 00:14:09,227
Hey... Hey, Dad.

323
00:14:11,063 --> 00:14:13,931
So, question: How long has
Stewie been unconscious?

324
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:15,266
Oh my God,
Chris, he knows!

325
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,768
Dad, I am so sorry.

326
00:14:17,835 --> 00:14:20,203
We should have told somebody,
but we were too scared,

327
00:14:20,271 --> 00:14:22,672
and... and... and I wanted
to take him to the hospital,

328
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:23,706
but Chris wouldn't let me.

329
00:14:23,774 --> 00:14:24,874
Good, Chris.

330
00:14:24,941 --> 00:14:26,075
I've taught you well.

331
00:14:26,142 --> 00:14:27,242
You've got
the right instincts.

332
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,610
When you were babies,

333
00:14:28,678 --> 00:14:30,078
I used to knock you kids out
every month or so,

334
00:14:30,146 --> 00:14:32,614
sometimes by accident,
sometimes when the Patriots lost.

335
00:14:32,681 --> 00:14:34,916
You just gotta cover it up,
and eventually it all works out.

336
00:14:34,983 --> 00:14:36,484
Meg, this is
a list of hats.

337
00:14:36,551 --> 00:14:37,618
I need these by 4:00.

338
00:14:37,685 --> 00:14:39,186
Good idea.

339
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:41,121
One of those hats would have
helped him at the park today.

340
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:44,291
Chris, did you put a
coonskin cap on Stewie?

341
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:45,425
No, why?

342
00:14:48,495 --> 00:14:50,894
They look like little robbers.

343
00:14:55,098 --> 00:14:56,665
Hey, good evening, everyone,

344
00:14:56,733 --> 00:14:59,801
and welcome to the first taping
of CBS's new hit comedy,

345
00:14:59,869 --> 00:15:01,102
<i>Class Holes!</i>

346
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:04,705
Wait a minute.
That's not the title.

347
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:06,607
It's called
"What I Learned on Jefferson Street."

348
00:15:06,675 --> 00:15:08,742
Yeah, it didn't make
a lot of sense

349
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,110
now that he lives
on Boner Street.

350
00:15:10,178 --> 00:15:11,812
And... action!

351
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:14,148
Okay, Hillary,
you know the bet.

352
00:15:14,216 --> 00:15:16,016
You have to sleep
with the next guy

353
00:15:16,084 --> 00:15:17,284
that walks
through that door.

354
00:15:17,352 --> 00:15:18,685
Got it.

355
00:15:18,753 --> 00:15:19,853
Dad?!

356
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:22,889
Hillary?

357
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:25,190
You're in college?

358
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:28,960
You're my new
college roommate?!

359
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:31,996
We're gonna be
living together?

360
00:15:33,398 --> 00:15:34,899
In the same dorm?

361
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,601
For the whole year?!

362
00:15:39,103 --> 00:15:40,970
With my chimp sidekick?!

363
00:15:42,306 --> 00:15:44,640
Brian, they love it.

364
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,476
Wha... what is this?
This isn't my script.

365
00:15:46,543 --> 00:15:47,777
What the hell'd
you do to it?!

366
00:15:47,845 --> 00:15:49,479
And I've got
great news for you.

367
00:15:49,546 --> 00:15:51,814
We just got an e-mail
from the network heads.

368
00:15:51,882 --> 00:15:54,350
They want to pick up <i>Class Holes!</i>
for twenty-two episodes!

369
00:15:54,418 --> 00:15:55,984
- Really?
- Yeah, aren't you thrilled?

370
00:15:56,052 --> 00:15:59,054
I, uh...
I'm not sure.

371
00:15:59,122 --> 00:16:02,090
Hey, guys, the chimp just ripped
the other girl's boob off.

372
00:16:02,158 --> 00:16:04,125
Please tell me
you got that on camera.

373
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,987
Lois, I... I wish you hadn't
gone through all this trouble.

374
00:16:11,055 --> 00:16:12,155
Are you kidding?

375
00:16:12,223 --> 00:16:13,756
I'm so excited.

376
00:16:13,824 --> 00:16:15,524
From the first time
I read that script,

377
00:16:15,592 --> 00:16:17,526
I just knew it was
gonna make it on TV.

378
00:16:17,594 --> 00:16:18,727
I could see it.

379
00:16:18,794 --> 00:16:20,295
Well, yeah, I mean,

380
00:16:20,362 --> 00:16:23,798
but the real victory is just
having a show make it to TV.

381
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:25,801
I mean, we almost don't
even need to watch.

382
00:16:25,868 --> 00:16:27,903
Hey, what's the cast of
<i>Two and a Half Men</i> doing here?

383
00:16:27,971 --> 00:16:30,005
Well, you're always
saying our show sucks.

384
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,173
Let's see yours.

385
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:33,275
Come on, Peter!
Come on, kids!

386
00:16:33,343 --> 00:16:34,845
The show's about to start!

387
00:16:34,913 --> 00:16:37,181
I'm coming.
I was just gettin' Stewie.

388
00:16:37,249 --> 00:16:39,217
All right, got the little
guy up from his nap.

389
00:16:39,285 --> 00:16:42,350
Say hello to everyone, Stewie.

390
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,016
Aww.

391
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,084
Oh, oh, look, everybody.

392
00:16:45,151 --> 00:16:47,353
It's starting.

393
00:16:49,588 --> 00:16:51,122
♪ There was a man. ♪

394
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,856
♪ He dropped out. ♪

395
00:16:52,923 --> 00:16:54,522
♪ Now he's back. ♪

396
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,857
♪ He had a daughter. ♪

397
00:16:56,925 --> 00:16:58,292
♪ Now she's in college with him. ♪

398
00:16:58,359 --> 00:17:01,528
What a pain in my class!

399
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:17,040
Well, Dad,
I owe you an apology.

400
00:17:17,107 --> 00:17:19,507
You said you'd win that
talent show and you did.

401
00:17:19,575 --> 00:17:21,542
Now everyone's doing
the Charleston.

402
00:17:22,777 --> 00:17:23,877
Not everyone.

403
00:17:23,945 --> 00:17:25,545
Someone's doing
The Monkey.

404
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,581
Mr. Nubbins.

405
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:30,750
Well, if you
can't beat 'em...

406
00:17:37,693 --> 00:17:39,627
So, uh...
what'd you guys think?

407
00:17:39,695 --> 00:17:41,729
Not the worst thing
in the world, right?

408
00:17:43,131 --> 00:17:44,498
Oh, ha-ha.

409
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:46,333
Time for bed, Stewie.

410
00:17:49,037 --> 00:17:51,570
So, really, everybody,
what... what'd you think?

411
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:53,037
You want to know
what I think?

412
00:17:53,104 --> 00:17:54,271
Well, yeah.

413
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:55,437
You son of a bitch!

414
00:17:55,505 --> 00:17:56,604
Oh! Oh my God!

415
00:17:56,672 --> 00:17:57,705
- It's a travesty!
- Joe, stop it!

416
00:17:57,772 --> 00:17:58,905
And I will kill you!

417
00:17:58,973 --> 00:18:00,172
- Okay, okay.
- Come on, Joe.

418
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,841
You bastard,
we hired a sitter for this!

419
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:03,077
- Come on, come on, Joe!
- Okay, come on.

420
00:18:03,144 --> 00:18:05,412
Guys, keep his anus
above his head!

421
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,780
Okay, okay.
All right, all right.

422
00:18:06,847 --> 00:18:07,680
- Okay, careful.
- Careful, Peter.

423
00:18:08,816 --> 00:18:10,383
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

424
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,251
Look, I'm sure you're
disappointed, Lois,

425
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:13,552
but it wasn't my fault.

426
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:15,353
There... there were so
many people interfering.

427
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,687
Of course
it's gonna be bad.

428
00:18:16,755 --> 00:18:19,122
I'm not disappointed
because it was bad.

429
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,724
I'm disappointed
because you sold out.

430
00:18:21,792 --> 00:18:23,826
You had something really
special there, Brian.

431
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,028
You had a vision and
you let them change it

432
00:18:26,096 --> 00:18:27,696
because you didn't
believe in yourself.

433
00:18:27,763 --> 00:18:29,430
Lois, what was I gonna do?

434
00:18:29,498 --> 00:18:31,432
It was either do it their way
or get cancelled.

435
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,502
Well, at least then you would
have had your integrity.

436
00:18:41,908 --> 00:18:43,308
You guys wanted
to see me?

437
00:18:43,376 --> 00:18:45,910
Look, Brian, we're really
excited about the ratings.

438
00:18:45,977 --> 00:18:48,045
We're just really disappointed
with how low they are.

439
00:18:48,112 --> 00:18:49,746
We did some testing
this morning,

440
00:18:49,814 --> 00:18:51,248
and we think we've
discovered the problem.

441
00:18:51,315 --> 00:18:54,751
People want something
more real, more grounded.

442
00:18:54,818 --> 00:18:56,685
That's exactly
what I think, too.

443
00:18:56,753 --> 00:18:58,820
We need to get back
to the original script.

444
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,122
Byron wants to do right
by his daughter,

445
00:19:01,189 --> 00:19:03,157
and I think that everyone
can relate to that.

446
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,791
That's what America
wants to see.

447
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:06,993
The simple love within a family

448
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,128
that conquers all
and makes life worth living.

449
00:19:09,196 --> 00:19:12,932
What if I'm a cop and the chimp
is my reincarnated partner?

450
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,066
Yes!

451
00:19:14,134 --> 00:19:15,301
That's perfect!

452
00:19:15,368 --> 00:19:17,069
See? That's relatable!

453
00:19:17,136 --> 00:19:18,603
How the hell is that relatable?

454
00:19:18,671 --> 00:19:20,538
And every month,
he's got a story

455
00:19:20,606 --> 00:19:22,239
for why he doesn't have
his half of the rent.

456
00:19:22,307 --> 00:19:24,274
I'm not doing this!

457
00:19:24,342 --> 00:19:26,175
What do you mean,
you're not doing it?

458
00:19:26,243 --> 00:19:27,812
I'm drawing the line.

459
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,680
I wrote a script that really
meant a lot to me,

460
00:19:29,748 --> 00:19:31,115
and you guys took it

461
00:19:31,183 --> 00:19:32,917
and turned it into something
cheap and ridiculous.

462
00:19:32,984 --> 00:19:34,151
I've had enough.

463
00:19:34,219 --> 00:19:35,986
I'm not selling out anymore.
I quit.

464
00:19:37,889 --> 00:19:40,023
Do you guys have a
studio lawyer or something,

465
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,490
'cause I banged
that chick,

466
00:19:41,558 --> 00:19:43,993
and I think she is
well under eighteen years old.

467
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,363
All right,
he's not waking up.

468
00:19:48,431 --> 00:19:49,898
I think we gotta take
these bandages off

469
00:19:49,966 --> 00:19:51,532
and see what we're
dealin' with here.

470
00:19:54,037 --> 00:19:55,705
Oh, crap,
you smell that?

471
00:19:55,772 --> 00:19:56,772
That's brain smell.

472
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,407
Okay, I don't care
what you say.

473
00:19:58,475 --> 00:20:00,108
He's really hurt,
and I'm gonna do

474
00:20:00,176 --> 00:20:01,610
what I should have done
in the first place.

475
00:20:01,678 --> 00:20:02,978
I'm taking him
to the hospital.

476
00:20:03,046 --> 00:20:05,780
No, no. I got one
last plan, Meg.

477
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,584
Oh, my God!

478
00:20:15,651 --> 00:20:17,118
Stewie!

479
00:20:17,186 --> 00:20:19,520
Oh, God.
What have I done?!

480
00:20:19,588 --> 00:20:21,387
Looks like you
ran over him, Lois.

481
00:20:21,455 --> 00:20:24,256
Oh, no!
He's unconscious!

482
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:26,190
Peter, Peter,
we have to cover this up!

483
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:27,791
Yeah, but...
What?!

484
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,859
Let's put a hat on him
to cover the wound,

485
00:20:29,927 --> 00:20:31,127
and... and then let's
get some makeup

486
00:20:31,195 --> 00:20:32,662
and draw eyeballs
on his eyelids

487
00:20:32,729 --> 00:20:34,997
and find a way to pin
this on someone else.

488
00:20:35,064 --> 00:20:37,665
I love you
so much right now.

489
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:38,966
Let's go to the hospital.

490

491
00:20:47,975 --> 00:20:50,242
Well, Brian,
I'm proud of you.

492
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,049
You went in there and you stood
up for what you believed in.

493
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:54,036
Yeah, now I don't have
a TV show anymore.

494
00:20:54,347 --> 00:20:56,167
Oh who cares about that.

495
00:20:56,286 --> 00:20:58,620
You made the right choice
for your own integrity

496
00:20:58,688 --> 00:21:00,021
and that's what matters.

497
00:21:00,089 --> 00:21:01,389
Well, I suppose
you're right.

498
00:21:01,457 --> 00:21:03,858
And hey, at least I got
something on the air.

499
00:21:03,926 --> 00:21:05,459
I mean, not everyone
can say that.

500
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,730
Announcer:
We now return to <i>Big Jaws</i>.

501
00:21:09,798 --> 00:21:13,605
Aah! Stop eating
our boat, Jaws!

502
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:15,313
Rrr. I'm gonna
eat your boat,

503
00:21:15,381 --> 00:21:16,859
and then I'm gonna
eat you guys!

504
00:21:16,926 --> 00:21:18,753
Rarr!

505
00:21:18,821 --> 00:21:19,997
Oh, my God, what's that?

506
00:21:20,065 --> 00:21:21,382
It's Bigger Jaws!

507
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,561
Oh, my God!

508
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:23,839
Now we have
a common enemy.

509
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:24,984
We have
to work together.

510
00:21:25,052 --> 00:21:26,537
I already got
a sequel in mind.

511
00:21:26,605 --> 00:21:28,189
It's called
<i>Way Bigger Jaws.</i>

512
00:21:28,256 --> 00:21:30,611
Hey, I just found
out it's November!

513
00:21:30,678 --> 00:21:33,097
What the (bleep)
happened?!
