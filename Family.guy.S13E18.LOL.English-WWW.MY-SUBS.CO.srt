Okay, I call.
What do you got?

13
00:00:36,921 --> 00:00:39,489
Boom. Full house, jokers
over instruction cards.

14
00:00:39,524 --> 00:00:41,557
I do not enjoy
playing with you.

15
00:00:41,593 --> 00:00:43,393
Everything's so silly.

16
00:00:43,428 --> 00:00:45,428
You guys, you'll
never guess what.

Randy Jackson was just
a big sea turtle

18
00:00:47,432 --> 00:00:49,065
in human clothes,
we heard.

19
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,367
No, we all just booked
a vacation together

20
00:00:51,403 --> 00:00:53,770
to a private resort
in the Bahamas.

21
00:00:53,805 --> 00:00:55,371
Well, that's a lot
of my money,

22
00:00:55,407 --> 00:00:57,006
but I used to have
sex with you,

23
00:00:57,042 --> 00:00:58,341
so that's
the trade-off.

24
00:00:58,376 --> 00:01:00,443
Look, it's not as
expensive as it sounds.

25
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:03,212
We found a great group rate
on a discount Web site.

26
00:01:03,248 --> 00:01:05,014
Wow, the Bahamas.

27
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:08,251
I can't wait to get down there
and dip my fingers in the water.

28
00:01:08,286 --> 00:01:10,353
Yeah, it'll be awesome
to nail a hotel masseuse

29
00:01:10,388 --> 00:01:12,588
and then watch<i> Nanny</i>
<i>McPhee</i> in the room.

30
00:01:12,624 --> 00:01:13,823
So, when do we leave?

31
00:01:13,858 --> 00:01:15,758
Oh. Sorry, Glenn.

32
00:01:15,794 --> 00:01:17,727
The deal was
for couples only.

33
00:01:17,762 --> 00:01:19,662
I... I'm afraid
you can't come.

34
00:01:19,697 --> 00:01:21,898
All right, fine.
Since you'll all be gone,

35
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:24,600
I'll just walk around my yard
naked, pee anywhere I want.

36
00:01:24,636 --> 00:01:25,768
I don't care.

37
00:01:31,576 --> 00:01:32,875
I think it's great
that Peter and Lois

38
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:34,243
are getting away together.

39
00:01:34,279 --> 00:01:36,746
Yeah, I think Dad's actually
kind of excited about it.

40
00:01:36,781 --> 00:01:39,415
Yes, very. He even bought
some sort of language tapes,

41
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:41,818
although I don't think
he's using them properly.

42
00:01:41,853 --> 00:01:43,820
MAN: I would like
to hear the specials.

46
00:01:51,529 --> 00:01:53,396

hear the specials.

I'm sorry I'm late.

49
00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:00,136
I shoved an employee at Wendy's
and they called the cops.

50
00:02:00,171 --> 00:02:02,939
You got to warn somebody before
you hand him a square burger.

51
00:02:02,974 --> 00:02:05,641
Thanks again for watching the
kids while we're gone, Daddy.

52
00:02:05,677 --> 00:02:07,157
Yeah, but how come
Babs couldn't come?

53
00:02:07,178 --> 00:02:10,046
Oh, she wanted to be here, but
she got hired to be the stuffy

54
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:13,916
old woman who slowly comes
around to it in a rap video.

haven't traveled with me,

Hey, guys. Say, Lois, I-I
know you said this trip

63
00:02:39,644 --> 00:02:41,410
was couples only,
but great news.

Oh. Who's this?

This is Kimmie.
I met her in a pop-up window

67
00:02:46,718 --> 00:02:48,584

She was in my area.

Oh, right on.

70
00:02:51,456 --> 00:02:53,890
All right, well,
I suppose I could look into

71
00:02:53,925 --> 00:02:55,558
adding you two
to the reservation.

72
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:57,660
Yeah, you guys
should definitely come.

73

Yeah, this
is gonna be awesome.

00:02:59,197 --> 00:03:00,263
Relax, Peter.

Geez, I haven't
seen you this excited

76
00:03:01,966 --> 00:03:04,734
since you got that letter
sent by carrier owl.

77
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:07,737
Oh, my God. Is this my
acceptance to Hogwarts?

78
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:09,739
No, it's a letter
asking you

79
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:11,641
to stop throwing rocks
at my nest.

80
00:03:11,676 --> 00:03:14,343
You hit one of my kids,
and now he can't fly right.

00:06:48,493 --> 00:06:50,826
We had to trick you guys
or you wouldn't have come.

155
00:06:50,862 --> 00:06:52,228
No. You can't
make me.

156
00:06:52,263 --> 00:06:54,964
I'll get hit with a coconut
so I lose my memory of this.

157
00:06:56,033 --> 00:06:58,734
Aah! I remember
everything!

158
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,303
I was abused
by my dad!

159
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,976
Lois, I can't believe
you tricked us

160
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,045
into coming on a couples
counseling retreat.

161
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,913
I do not like
being lied to.

162
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:16,316
Me neither.
I mean, wives conspiring

163
00:07:16,351 --> 00:07:18,118
against their husbands.
What's next, huh?

164
00:07:18,153 --> 00:07:20,754
Freakin' Cheney
back in the White House?

165
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:23,523
(exclaims)
Hmm, that didn't link up.

166
00:07:23,558 --> 00:07:25,358
Trust me,
you won't regret this.

167
00:07:25,394 --> 00:07:29,029
I'll see you all in the morning
for our first session.

168
00:07:29,064 --> 00:07:30,764
Sheesh, couples counseling?

169
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:33,767
This is the worst thing
that's ever happened to anyone.

170
00:07:33,802 --> 00:07:37,537
Wives, huh?
He gets it.

171
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,610
Hey there,
buckaroos!

172
00:07:43,645 --> 00:07:45,311
Who's ready for
some old-timey fun?

173
00:07:45,347 --> 00:07:47,681
I thought we could go down
to the old swimmin' hole

174
00:07:47,716 --> 00:07:48,948
and swim in a hole.

175
00:07:48,984 --> 00:07:50,784
Ugh.
That sounds lame.

176
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:51,851
Who-whose hole is it?

177
00:07:51,887 --> 00:07:53,453
I'm potentially in.

178
00:07:53,488 --> 00:07:55,855
Grandpa, can I just
have my video games back?

179
00:07:55,891 --> 00:07:57,524
I want to play
<i>Call of Duty.</i>

180
00:07:57,559 --> 00:08:00,493
Oh, I've got the original
<i>Call of Duty</i> right here.

181
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:03,296
It's called jacks.

182
00:08:03,331 --> 00:08:04,798
Got one!

183
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,267
Will I get two?
Come get in on this.

184
00:08:07,302 --> 00:08:09,803
Wait, this-this game
is cleaning up toys?

185
00:08:09,838 --> 00:08:11,805
Carter, read the room.
They're not into it.

186
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,073
All right,
fair enough.

187
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:14,174
I just don't want
you kids sitting

188
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:16,242
around here glued
to your screens.

189
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:19,312
So let's get the blood pumping
with my Jack LaLanne record.

190
00:08:21,616 --> 00:08:23,316
(jaunty, light intro plays)

191
00:08:23,351 --> 00:08:24,784
Bend to the left.

192
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,586
Bend to the right.

193
00:08:26,621 --> 00:08:28,188
Get the big spring.

194
00:08:28,223 --> 00:08:30,023
Stretch the
big spring.

195
00:08:30,058 --> 00:08:31,858
Stop to smoke.

196
00:08:31,893 --> 00:08:33,526
Get a big towel.

197
00:08:33,562 --> 00:08:35,195
Put it behind
your neck.

198
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,996
Tuck it in
your shirt.

199
00:08:37,032 --> 00:08:38,798
Looks like boobs.

200
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:40,533
Put on a wig.

201
00:08:40,569 --> 00:08:42,435
Dance with a man.

202
00:08:42,471 --> 00:08:44,037
Don't tell your wife.

203
00:08:44,072 --> 00:08:46,239
Take it to your grave.

204
00:08:46,274 --> 00:08:47,507
(music stops)

205
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:48,775
Okay, good workout.

206
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,177
I got to go call
somebody and hang up.

207
00:08:55,751 --> 00:08:58,084
All right, our first
counseling exercise will be

208
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,221
speaking to each other
with "I feel" statements.

209
00:09:01,256 --> 00:09:02,856
Lois, please begin.

210
00:09:02,891 --> 00:09:06,259
(sighs) I feel
unappreciated,

211
00:09:06,294 --> 00:09:08,428
like you don't want
to spend time with me.

212
00:09:08,463 --> 00:09:12,198
Okay. I feel a numbness
radiating down my left arm.

213
00:09:12,234 --> 00:09:15,535
I feel like you should help
out more around the house.

214
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,904
I feel like salty<i> and</i> sweet.

215
00:09:17,939 --> 00:09:20,173
You got white chocolate
French fries?

216
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,175
I feel like my cervix hurts.

217
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,377
I feel pride.

218
00:09:26,448 --> 00:09:28,047
Okay, for our next exercise,

219
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,216
let's play
The Oldlywed Game.

220
00:09:30,252 --> 00:09:33,253
(chuckles) Relax,
it's just a questionnaire.

221
00:09:33,288 --> 00:09:34,687
(laughs)

222
00:09:34,723 --> 00:09:35,723
Really?

223
00:09:35,724 --> 00:09:38,258
Whatever, I like
likin' things.

224
00:09:38,293 --> 00:09:40,393
Peter, when
is Lois's birthday?

225
00:09:40,428 --> 00:09:42,362
Uh, let's see, when
is Hitler's birthday?

226
00:09:42,397 --> 00:09:43,863
April 20.

227
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:46,566
Wow. Okay, Noel.
Yikes.

228
00:09:46,601 --> 00:09:48,668
Joe, what is Bonnie's
favorite food?

229
00:09:48,703 --> 00:09:50,103
Well, she must like
ground glass,

230
00:09:50,138 --> 00:09:52,272
because I keep
finding it in my food.

231
00:09:52,307 --> 00:09:53,940
Cleveland...
Pass.

232
00:09:53,975 --> 00:09:56,409
Quagmire, what color
are Kimmie's eyes?

233
00:09:56,444 --> 00:09:58,478
Shaved.
Sor-sorry, what-what is it?

234
00:09:58,513 --> 00:09:59,879
What's the question?

235
00:10:04,886 --> 00:10:07,520
Okay, last night I did some
personality assessments

236
00:10:07,556 --> 00:10:09,756
based on yesterday's session,
and what I found

237
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,257
was none of
you couples

238
00:10:11,293 --> 00:10:13,626
are compatible with
each other at all.

239
00:10:17,098 --> 00:10:18,932
No, no, no, that's
not a good thing.

240
00:10:18,967 --> 00:10:21,334
But, interestingly,
you have high compatibility

241
00:10:21,369 --> 00:10:23,069
with other people
in this group.

242
00:10:23,104 --> 00:10:24,904
Oh, my God.
That is crazy.

243
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,806
More mac and cheese.
Here, just keep it going.

244
00:10:26,842 --> 00:10:28,408
Keep it going... don't be
afraid of the burned edges.

245
00:10:28,443 --> 00:10:29,443
Just give me the tray.

246
00:10:29,444 --> 00:10:30,543
Wait, so what happened?

247
00:10:30,579 --> 00:10:32,579
Anyway, I'd like
to do an exercise.

248
00:10:32,614 --> 00:10:34,614
Just for the morning,
you'll all be paired

249
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:36,082
with your
more compatible match.

250
00:10:36,117 --> 00:10:38,017
And hopefully,
you'll bring some lessons back

251
00:10:38,053 --> 00:10:40,486
from that experience
into your marriages.

252
00:10:40,522 --> 00:10:42,455
Okay, so the new
couple pairings

253
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,524
are as follows:
Cleveland and Lois...

254
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:48,394
Oh, cool! My FICO score
just went up a hundred points.

255
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,129
...Quagmire
and Bonnie,

256
00:10:50,165 --> 00:10:51,798
Joe and Donna,

257
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,199
and Peter
and Kimmie.

258
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,768
Yay! I win
couples counseling!

259
00:10:55,804 --> 00:10:58,338
(groans)

260
00:11:01,376 --> 00:11:03,676
Look at those
hairless shins.

261
00:11:03,712 --> 00:11:05,178
They're magnificent.

262
00:11:05,213 --> 00:11:06,813
Decades of black
dress socks

263
00:11:06,848 --> 00:11:09,282
have rendered them
smooth and mirror-like.

264
00:11:09,317 --> 00:11:11,484
Grandpa, what are we
even doing out here?

265
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,453
Looking for shapes
in the clouds.

266
00:11:13,488 --> 00:11:15,922
That one looks like the Thompson
Throat Lozenge girl!

267
00:11:15,957 --> 00:11:18,157
See? She's got the boater on
and everything!

268
00:11:18,193 --> 00:11:20,126
I'm bored. Can't we
do something else?

269
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:21,995
Well, back when
I was your age,

270
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,197
there was nothing better
than knocking on doors

271
00:11:24,232 --> 00:11:26,633
and throwing paper bags
full of flour at people.

272
00:11:26,668 --> 00:11:28,902
That's a thing?
What, flour facin'?

273
00:11:28,937 --> 00:11:31,471
It's the best thing!
We used it to keep Italians

274
00:11:31,506 --> 00:11:34,207
from going to the polls.

275
00:11:37,445 --> 00:11:39,145
Stay home today, Guido!

276
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,880
(laughter)

277
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:44,150
Yay! Old-fashioned things
are the best!

278
00:11:44,185 --> 00:11:47,186

So, this is the second vacation
that I've watched

296
00:12:32,968 --> 00:12:34,567
every<i> Jurassic Park.</i>

297
00:12:34,602 --> 00:12:36,836
Peter, you're awesome.
You're so funny.

298
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:38,871
Hey, Kimmie, I'll pay you
a thousand dollars

299
00:12:38,907 --> 00:12:40,974
for one whole handful
of your butt.

300
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:43,042
For two handfuls,
I'll give you my car.

301
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:44,444
All right,
that's enough!

302
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:45,878
I have had it, Peter!

303
00:12:45,914 --> 00:12:48,047
So, how are the new
pairings working out?

304
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,049
Are you all gaining
lots of insights?

305
00:12:50,085 --> 00:12:51,484
No! I can see now

306
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,686
that coming here
was a huge mistake!

307
00:12:53,722 --> 00:12:55,355
You're hopeless, Peter!

308
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,056
Your feet look old.

309
00:12:57,092 --> 00:12:59,025
This retreat is over!

310
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,728
Fire up the boat--
we're going home!

311
00:13:04,165 --> 00:13:05,898
Mrs. Griffin, please,

312
00:13:05,934 --> 00:13:07,333
I urge you to finish
the program.

313
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,668
No, thank you.

314
00:13:08,703 --> 00:13:10,203
I never should've
come here.

315
00:13:10,238 --> 00:13:11,871
Or at least
not with<i> him.</i>

316
00:13:11,906 --> 00:13:13,373
Is there anything
I can do to change...

317
00:13:13,408 --> 00:13:15,408
(gunfire)

318
00:13:15,443 --> 00:13:16,843
(screaming)

319
00:13:20,115 --> 00:13:21,514
Oh, my God!

320
00:13:21,549 --> 00:13:23,383
We're taking this
island back.

321
00:13:23,418 --> 00:13:26,319
Yeah! Kill the whites!
Race war!

322
00:13:26,354 --> 00:13:27,453
(grunts

323
00:13:28,456 --> 00:13:30,523
Run! Everybody run!

324
00:13:40,902 --> 00:13:42,535
(gasps)
What the hell is happening?!

325
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,270
Somebody do something!

326
00:13:46,574 --> 00:13:50,143
Look! We got to get
the attention of that plane!

327
00:13:59,754 --> 00:14:01,754
You got to help us!

328
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:09,425
Man, those natives
are pissed!

329
00:14:09,461 --> 00:14:11,427
This is like
a full-blown revolution!

330
00:14:11,463 --> 00:14:14,163
Do you think me throwing
full sodas into the garbage

331
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:16,266
had anything
to do with this?

332
00:14:18,236 --> 00:14:20,236
Quick!
Into the jungle!

333
00:14:25,277 --> 00:14:27,143
What are we gonna do?

334
00:14:27,178 --> 00:14:29,145
Wait a minute-- yesterday,
near the north beach,

335
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,147
I saw a small
landing strip, giggity.

336
00:14:31,182 --> 00:14:34,083
It might be our best chance
to get off, giggity, the island.

337
00:14:34,119 --> 00:14:36,753
Did you really see that,
or was it just an excuse

338
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:37,800
to say "giggity"?

339
00:14:37,824 --> 00:14:39,523
I don't know, baby--
I'm crazy with the heat.

340
00:14:39,524 --> 00:14:40,990
Take your pants off.

341
00:14:41,026 --> 00:14:42,859
Oh, my God,
this is legit ridic.

342
00:14:42,894 --> 00:14:44,360
I got to post this.

343
00:14:44,396 --> 00:14:48,097
(laughs) Josh Radnor's
twitter feed is<i> so</i> funny!

344
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:49,766
That's impossible.

345
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:51,768
Geez, coming here
was a bad idea.

346
00:14:51,803 --> 00:14:54,604
Like when I brought
museum behavior into my home.

347
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,140
(footsteps echoing)

348
00:14:58,143 --> 00:15:00,209
(echoing footsteps approaching)

349
00:15:01,613 --> 00:15:04,781
Excuse me, we do ask that
you don't touch anything.

350
00:15:08,186 --> 00:15:11,421
(imitating airplane engine)

351
00:15:11,456 --> 00:15:13,856
I got to say, Carter,
you've done a good job.

352
00:15:13,892 --> 00:15:15,625
We'd become slaves
to our electronics.

353
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,660
But you know what
we're doing here?

354
00:15:17,696 --> 00:15:19,128
We're reclaiming
our lives.

355
00:15:19,164 --> 00:15:21,331
You're kind of an egghead,
aren't you, Brian?

356
00:15:21,366 --> 00:15:24,567
Vroom! Everyone on this plane
is wearing a suit.

357
00:15:24,602 --> 00:15:26,102
Say, that reminds me.

358
00:15:26,137 --> 00:15:28,237
Everyone,
time to dress for dinner.

359
00:15:28,273 --> 00:15:30,173
Ooh! I want to light
the candles, Pop-Pop!

360
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,108
Oh, boy,
I haven't had this much fun

361
00:15:32,143 --> 00:15:34,410
since I played
with that Bublé wrap.

Oh, my God, this is bad.

373
00:15:59,604 --> 00:16:01,871
I know. If we die,
what's gonna happen

374
00:16:01,906 --> 00:16:03,606
to my mail?
What?

375
00:16:03,641 --> 00:16:06,442
I'm just sayin', how's the post office
supposed to know?

376
00:16:06,478 --> 00:16:08,978
And my DVR!
It'll be full in a week!

377
00:16:09,013 --> 00:16:10,813
I record<i> Ellen</i> every day!

378
00:16:10,849 --> 00:16:13,015
I know I shouldn't,
but whenever she dances,

379
00:16:13,051 --> 00:16:16,419
I'm like, "Go ahead, girl,
it's your world!"

380
00:16:16,454 --> 00:16:18,588
I heard she gay.

381
00:16:18,623 --> 00:16:21,691
Well, it seems like
we're pretty talked out.

382
00:16:23,328 --> 00:16:27,263
Thanks for changing your mind
about drowning me in that river.

383
00:16:29,968 --> 00:16:31,167
(phone rings)

384
00:16:31,202 --> 00:16:33,403
Hey. Did you see
those pictures of me

385
00:16:33,438 --> 00:16:35,338
doing ducklips
by a pool?

386
00:16:35,373 --> 00:16:37,373
I don't know,
some island.

387
00:16:37,409 --> 00:16:38,409
Shh!

388
00:16:38,443 --> 00:16:40,443
(rifles cocking)

389
00:16:40,478 --> 00:16:42,645
You rebel scum!

390
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,147
(chuckles)

391
00:16:44,182 --> 00:16:46,649
Ah, you're too young.
You don't know.

392
00:16:52,457 --> 00:16:54,424
So, how did you guys
get captured?

393
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:56,426
Quagmire screams
when he urinates.

394
00:16:56,461 --> 00:16:57,794
How about you?

395
00:16:57,829 --> 00:17:00,563
Cleveland kept stopping
to scratch his back on trees.

396
00:17:00,598 --> 00:17:02,331
Lois don't
do it right.

397
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:03,599
Come here, baby.

398
00:17:03,635 --> 00:17:05,635
You need them Lee Press-Ons.

399
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,537
Mmm. There it is.

400
00:17:07,572 --> 00:17:09,071
Mmm.

401
00:17:11,576 --> 00:17:12,642
Ah, Peter!

402
00:17:12,677 --> 00:17:14,477
I was so worried
about you.

403
00:17:14,512 --> 00:17:17,547
Lois, when we got captured,
I said, "You rebel scum,"

404
00:17:17,582 --> 00:17:19,549
and Kimmie didn't get it.
(laughs)

405
00:17:19,584 --> 00:17:20,650
That's funny!

406
00:17:20,685 --> 00:17:22,151
From<i> The Star Wars!</i>

407
00:17:22,187 --> 00:17:25,755
Well, just<i> Star Wars.</i>
But I missed you, sweetheart!

408
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,824
Why are you doing this?
Let us go!

409
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:30,827
Every year we have to deal
with you American tourists!

410
00:17:30,862 --> 00:17:34,063
Stuffing your slob faces,
taking video you'll never watch,

411
00:17:34,098 --> 00:17:37,333
and asking if I'm
the<i> Captain Phillips</i> guy.

412
00:17:37,368 --> 00:17:38,801
I'm not!

413
00:17:38,837 --> 00:17:40,703
Take the couples out,
two by two,

414
00:17:40,738 --> 00:17:42,271
and execute them.

415
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,310
Oh, my God!

416
00:17:47,345 --> 00:17:50,746
Well, at least I ain't going out
with a itchy back.

417
00:17:52,817 --> 00:17:55,284
(two gunshots)

418
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,786
Oh, no!
This is terrible!

419
00:17:56,821 --> 00:17:59,989
Now, now, maybe
they just shot Donna twice.

420
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:02,658
Bonnie, quick,
lock my wheels!

421
00:18:02,694 --> 00:18:05,027
We don't have
to make it easy for them!

422
00:18:08,733 --> 00:18:12,802
JOE: Scuffin' up those floors
pretty good!

423
00:18:12,837 --> 00:18:15,137
(two gunshots)

424
00:18:15,173 --> 00:18:17,340
Boy, they're really
going at Donna.

425
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:21,544
Any last words?

426
00:18:21,579 --> 00:18:23,079
Moist.

427
00:18:24,883 --> 00:18:26,816
(two gunshots)

428
00:18:26,851 --> 00:18:31,053
Oh, Peter, I'm so sorry
I lied to get you to come here.

429
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:33,189
I should've been
honest with you.

430
00:18:33,224 --> 00:18:35,625
Please forgive me?
I do, Lois.

431
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,761
I know you were just trying
to do something good for our marriage.

432
00:18:38,796 --> 00:18:42,131
And I'm sorry I've been
such a jerk about it.

433
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,466
I need you, Lois.

434
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:44,634
I always will.

435
00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:47,303
And if I got to get shot
by ooga-booga people,

436
00:18:47,338 --> 00:18:49,205
I want it to happen
with you.

437
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,740
Oh, Peter.

438
00:18:56,681 --> 00:18:59,048
I love you so much, Lois.

439
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,716
I love you,
too, Peter.

440
00:19:00,752 --> 00:19:02,718
Lois, I think
you should know,

441
00:19:02,754 --> 00:19:05,454
I never cared for your
most recent haircut.

442
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,190
Peter, I've had the same
haircut for 20 years.

443
00:19:08,226 --> 00:19:09,559
We're ready now.

444
00:19:09,594 --> 00:19:11,193
(two gunshots)

445
00:19:16,834 --> 00:19:19,035
Congratulations,
Griffins-- you did it!

446
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,270
You've successfully
completed the program.

447
00:19:21,306 --> 00:19:22,505
What?!
What?!

448
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,874
(whooping, cheering)

449
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:27,743
We just found out, too!
The whole thing was staged.

450
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:30,079
Noel dying,
the uprising, all of it.

451
00:19:30,114 --> 00:19:32,815
Oh-ho,<i> that's</i> what they
meant on their Web site:

452
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,651
"Staged Revolution
Marital Counseling."

453
00:19:35,687 --> 00:19:37,653
It all makes sense.

454
00:19:37,689 --> 00:19:40,056
(happy shouts)

455
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:41,891
Yes, sorry to deceive you all,

456
00:19:41,926 --> 00:19:44,093
but we find that when couples
don't respond

457
00:19:44,128 --> 00:19:46,796
to traditional counseling,
the stress of extreme danger

458
00:19:46,831 --> 00:19:49,532
reminds them of what
matters most in their lives--

459
00:19:49,567 --> 00:19:51,567
their love for each other.

460
00:19:51,603 --> 00:19:53,603
I feel like I
should be mad, but...

461
00:19:53,638 --> 00:19:54,837
I guess you're right.

462
00:19:54,872 --> 00:19:56,939
Lois and I have
never felt closer.

463
00:19:56,975 --> 00:19:59,342
And I did get to kill a guy.
What?!

464
00:19:59,377 --> 00:20:00,943
Thanks for
everything, Noel.

465
00:20:00,979 --> 00:20:02,211
(slurps)

466
00:20:06,017 --> 00:20:07,750
Well, kids,
it's Dyngus Day.

467
00:20:07,785 --> 00:20:09,552
Here are your
pussy willow branches.

468
00:20:09,587 --> 00:20:11,754
Find your sweetie
and give her a tap.

469
00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:14,824
Looks like I found
<i>my</i> sweetie.

470
00:20:14,859 --> 00:20:16,058
Oh, sarsaparilla!

471
00:20:16,094 --> 00:20:18,060
<i>I</i> was going to take sister!

472
00:20:18,096 --> 00:20:20,162
Hey, you little rats.

473
00:20:20,198 --> 00:20:22,064
All right, Lois, let's
just leave our bags here

474
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,433
and wonder where our clothes
are for the next two days.

475
00:20:24,469 --> 00:20:25,868
How was your trip, Father?

476
00:20:25,903 --> 00:20:27,536
We've prepared
a song for you.

477
00:20:27,572 --> 00:20:28,804
Nope.

478
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,973
Ah, boy, it's nice
to be home.

479
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:33,876
Sure is, Lois.
Now, shush. TV.

480
00:20:33,911 --> 00:20:35,711
Television?
How pathetic.

481
00:20:35,747 --> 00:20:37,046
(chuckles):
Yeah.

482
00:20:37,081 --> 00:20:39,682
You know where the
most interesting stuff is, Dad?

483
00:20:39,717 --> 00:20:41,651
The human hat.

484
00:20:41,686 --> 00:20:43,686
TV ANNOUNCER: We now return
to<i> Police Chases...</i>

485
00:20:43,721 --> 00:20:46,789
No, thank you-- we are
a screen-free family.

486
00:20:46,824 --> 00:20:48,691
<i>...That End in Fire.</i>

487
00:20:48,726 --> 00:20:50,826
(bleep)
That's awesome!

488
00:20:52,964 --> 00:20:54,730
(groans)

489
00:20:54,766 --> 00:20:57,199
Nobody look at him,
and maybe he'll just leave.

490
00:21:00,672 --> 00:21:02,238
Good job, people.

491
00:21:02,812 --> 00:21:09,312
