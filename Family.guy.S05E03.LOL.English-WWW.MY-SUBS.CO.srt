1
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,162
Oh, yes!

2
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:39,547
I slam it, and you can suck it!

3
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:41,912
Joe, that was our last ball.

4
00:00:41,913 --> 00:00:42,607
Eh, don't worry.

5
00:00:42,608 --> 00:00:43,992
Mr. Moose will help us out.

6
00:00:43,993 --> 00:00:45,190
Won't you, Mr. Moose?

7
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:46,465
Fine.

8
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,544
Knock-knock.

9
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:48,589
Ping pong balls!

10
00:00:51,628 --> 00:00:53,048
Hey, hey, guys, look at me.

11
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:54,171
I'm covered in balls.

12
00:00:54,176 --> 00:00:55,641
- Just like...
- Just like Sharon Stone.

13
00:00:55,645 --> 00:00:56,822
Ah, you beat me to it.

14
00:00:56,826 --> 00:01:00,041
Man, I haven't had this much fun
since I was in that Broadway show.

15
00:01:03,736 --> 00:01:06,060
<i>I'm a wolverine</i>

16
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:09,391
<i>And my hatred keeps me warm</i>

17
00:01:09,395 --> 00:01:14,802
<i>A wolverine, so you Russians
best be warned</i>

18
00:01:14,995 --> 00:01:16,811
<i>Shooting Commies, drinking deer blood</i>

19
00:01:16,816 --> 00:01:18,232
<i>Peeing in the radiator</i>

20
00:01:18,235 --> 00:01:21,243
<i>Look up there, here comes
a really angry Russian helicopter</i>

21
00:01:25,525 --> 00:01:27,413
It has been...

22
00:01:27,535 --> 00:01:29,683
a red dawn.

23
00:01:29,685 --> 00:01:32,992
Hey, Peter, Lois called to remind you
to pick up Meg at the roller rink.

24
00:01:32,997 --> 00:01:34,592
- No!
- We're just getting started!

25
00:01:34,597 --> 00:01:37,480
Oh, Meg is my least favorite of
all your children.

26
00:01:37,487 --> 00:01:40,010
It's all right, we'll just move
the party to the skating rink.

27
00:01:40,018 --> 00:01:41,582
Who's sober enough to drive?

28
00:01:42,676 --> 00:01:45,460
Ah, okay, who's drunk,
but that special kind of drunk

29
00:01:45,465 --> 00:01:47,571
where you're a better driver
because you know you're drunk?

30
00:01:47,576 --> 00:01:49,430
You know, the kind of drunk
where you probably shouldn't

31
00:01:49,437 --> 00:01:51,791
drive, but you do anyway,
because, I mean, come on,

32
00:01:51,795 --> 00:01:53,021
you got to get your car home.

33
00:01:53,028 --> 00:01:56,020
Right? I mean, I mean, what do
they expect me to do, take a bus?

34
00:01:56,027 --> 00:01:57,402
Is-is that what they want?

35
00:01:57,407 --> 00:01:58,820
For me to take a bus?

36
00:01:58,825 --> 00:02:00,070
Well, screw that.

37
00:02:00,628 --> 00:02:01,803
You take a bus.

38
00:02:02,068 --> 00:02:03,783
I'm that kind of drunk.

39
00:02:03,798 --> 00:02:04,580
Shotgun.

40
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:11,500
Dad, where have you been?

41
00:02:11,505 --> 00:02:13,382
I've been waiting for over an hour.

42
00:02:13,386 --> 00:02:14,630
Grab some wood there, bub.

43
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:16,133
Daddy and his friends have been drinking.

44
00:02:16,138 --> 00:02:18,462
And we're gonna keep on drinking
until we each uncover

45
00:02:18,468 --> 00:02:21,953
repressed memories of sexual abuse
by a trusted religious official.

46
00:02:21,987 --> 00:02:24,733
Oh, that's crazy tal...
Oh, my God.

47
00:02:24,735 --> 00:02:27,351
Minister Washington, how could you?!

48
00:02:27,466 --> 00:02:29,321
Man, look at all these chicks!

49
00:02:29,327 --> 00:02:30,560
Oh, wow.

50
00:02:30,565 --> 00:02:33,833
Wow. If I were a woman,
I would press my bare boobs

51
00:02:33,838 --> 00:02:35,623
up against glass in public

52
00:02:35,826 --> 00:02:40,221
just for the sexual thrill!
The sexual thrill!

53
00:02:41,655 --> 00:02:42,781
How do I stop?!

54
00:02:42,786 --> 00:02:45,283
Use the rubber stoppers on the front.

55
00:02:46,877 --> 00:02:49,581
Hey, baby, how'd you like
to share a pair of skates?

56
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,742
Sure!

57
00:02:50,936 --> 00:02:51,922
Never mind.

58
00:02:51,926 --> 00:02:53,881
Boy, you look a lot better
from the back.

59
00:02:53,885 --> 00:02:54,973
You jerk!

60
00:02:55,207 --> 00:02:57,570
Oh, hey, baby,
you want to go somewhere?

61
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:58,511
No, no, no, no, no.

62
00:02:58,516 --> 00:03:01,102
Wait, wait, Quagmire, remember
what's on the other side.

63
00:03:32,466 --> 00:03:33,610
That was awesome!

64
00:03:33,616 --> 00:03:36,000
Oh, my God, that was
completely by accident.

65
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,261
That was great fun.

66
00:03:37,265 --> 00:03:39,551
I don't even remember why we came,
but I had a ball.

67
00:03:39,555 --> 00:03:41,743
I look forward to reminiscing
about this tomorrow.

68
00:03:42,615 --> 00:03:44,011
Dad! Wait!

69
00:03:44,017 --> 00:03:45,720
You forgot me again!

70
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:47,103
You need a lift?

71
00:03:47,106 --> 00:03:48,712
Oop, didn't answer
me quick enough.

72
00:03:57,418 --> 00:04:00,282
Remember those sweet,
warm New England summers?

73
00:04:00,287 --> 00:04:03,573
Remember sipping lemonade
underneath a shady tree?

74
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,992
Remember when you hit
that pedestrian with your car

75
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,330
at the crosswalk
and then just drove away?

76
00:04:08,366 --> 00:04:10,453
Pepperidge Farm remembers.

77
00:04:10,456 --> 00:04:12,231
But Pepperidge Farm ain't
just gonna keep it

78
00:04:12,237 --> 00:04:14,331
to Pepperidge Farm's
self free of charge.

79
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:15,793
Maybe you go outand buy yourself

80
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:17,583
some of these distinctive
Milano cookies,

81
00:04:17,586 --> 00:04:19,302
maybe this whole thing
just disappears.

82
00:04:20,056 --> 00:04:21,670
Meg, what happened?

83
00:04:21,676 --> 00:04:24,763
Fat Ass and his drunk friends
left me at the roller rink.

84
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:27,500
You know, this wouldn't have
happened if I had my own car.

85
00:04:27,508 --> 00:04:29,223
Meg, people have always found ways

86
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:30,612
to get around without a car.

87
00:04:30,618 --> 00:04:31,640
Look at Iceman.

88
00:04:33,018 --> 00:04:34,982
Honey, where'd you go
when you went out last night?

89
00:04:34,988 --> 00:04:36,780
Uh, just over to Tom's house.

90
00:04:36,787 --> 00:04:39,021
Played some poker,
had some brewskis, you know.

91
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:39,780
Really?

92
00:04:39,786 --> 00:04:41,910
Then would you mind explaining that?

93
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:47,992
At least they know
how to touch a man.

94
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,990
Oh, walk away.

95
00:04:50,098 --> 00:04:52,400
You know, Peter, maybe Meg
having her own car

96
00:04:52,408 --> 00:04:55,210
- isn't such a bad idea.
- Yeah, I guess so.

97
00:04:55,216 --> 00:04:58,713
What?! I have been trying to get
a sewing machine for months,

98
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:00,870
but she gets a freakin' car
just like that?!

99
00:05:01,186 --> 00:05:02,560
I hate this place.

100
00:05:05,265 --> 00:05:06,593
Look at all these Hummers.

101
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,673
What kind of jerk
would drive one of those?

102
00:05:10,016 --> 00:05:11,890
Dude, this car kicks ass!

103
00:05:11,898 --> 00:05:14,470
And I can watch Madagascar
while I'm driving!

104
00:05:15,147 --> 00:05:16,980
What kind of music
do you like, Gloria?

105
00:05:16,987 --> 00:05:18,083
Hippo-hop.

106
00:05:21,305 --> 00:05:23,700
Dude, those animals are so fucking funny,

107
00:05:23,706 --> 00:05:25,782
they make me want to merge
without looking!

108
00:05:28,247 --> 00:05:30,031
Yeah! Rumsfeld!

109
00:05:30,035 --> 00:05:31,783
Hi, there, can I help you folks?

110
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,540
Yeah, uh, my daughter's looking for a car

111
00:05:33,546 --> 00:05:34,943
that goes with her personality.

112
00:05:34,946 --> 00:05:37,753
Yes, are the new bulimic
cutting mobiles in yet?

113
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,780
This is a 1996 sedan.

114
00:05:39,785 --> 00:05:42,960
Excellent gas mileage,
air bags and AM/FM cassette.

115
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:43,882
I love it!

116
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,300
Dad, this is the car.

117
00:05:45,308 --> 00:05:47,030
Eh, hang on a second, Meg.

118
00:05:47,035 --> 00:05:48,551
What can you tell me about this one?

119
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,301
Oh, that's just an old tank I use

120
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:53,133
for those commercials where
I declare war on high prices.

121
00:05:53,138 --> 00:05:54,622
Now, about that sedan...

122
00:05:55,295 --> 00:05:56,493
Hang on there, slick.

123
00:05:56,497 --> 00:05:57,730
Now I see your game.

124
00:05:57,737 --> 00:05:59,782
We come in here
wanting a practical car,

125
00:05:59,788 --> 00:06:01,530
but then you dangle this tank
in front of me

126
00:06:01,538 --> 00:06:02,910
and expect me to walk away.

127
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:04,130
Now, I may be an idiot,

128
00:06:04,138 --> 00:06:06,031
but there is one thing I am not, sir,

129
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:08,013
and that, sir, is an idiot.

130
00:06:08,018 --> 00:06:10,481
Now, I demand you tell me
more about this tank.

131
00:06:13,357 --> 00:06:15,770
Well, if you're looking for
quality, then look no further.

132
00:06:15,778 --> 00:06:16,791
That's more like it.

133
00:06:16,795 --> 00:06:18,713
Tell me, what are the tank's
safety features?

134
00:06:18,717 --> 00:06:20,363
What a good-looking question.

135
00:06:20,367 --> 00:06:22,021
Three inches of reinforced steel

136
00:06:22,025 --> 00:06:24,500
protects your daughter from
short-range missile attacks.

137
00:06:24,507 --> 00:06:27,050
I see. And does the sedan
protect against missiles?

138
00:06:27,056 --> 00:06:27,760
It does not.

139
00:06:27,768 --> 00:06:29,140
Ah, you hear that, Meg?

140
00:06:29,146 --> 00:06:30,990
Yeah, it does not protect
against missiles.

141
00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:32,825
See, these... these are the questions.

142
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,733
This is why I'm here.

143
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,028
Peter, you can't be serious.

144
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:36,913
This is a 30-ton war machine.

145
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,872
I'm still not sure.

146
00:06:38,877 --> 00:06:40,440
Did I mention the tank is a tank?

147
00:06:40,446 --> 00:06:41,250
Sold.

148
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,882
Okay, Lois, you can open your eyes.

149
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:47,823
Boccie balls!

150
00:06:47,826 --> 00:06:49,072
I bought a tank!

151
00:06:49,078 --> 00:06:50,450
Are you out of your mind?!

152
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:51,900
Let me show you how the gun works.

153
00:06:57,346 --> 00:06:58,752
What the hell?!

154
00:06:59,257 --> 00:07:02,203
No, no, no, no, no, no...!

155
00:07:03,096 --> 00:07:06,342
Hey, Peter, can you blow
that towel rack down here?

156
00:07:07,338 --> 00:07:08,533
Thank you.

This half of the apartment is mine.

163
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,892
But if you want to come over here,
that's okay, too.

164
00:07:23,898 --> 00:07:25,770
This isn't spaghetti, it's linguini.

165
00:07:25,775 --> 00:07:26,980
You're right, it is!

166
00:07:26,986 --> 00:07:28,523
I always get those confused.

167
00:07:28,527 --> 00:07:29,693
Hey, all of us are human.

168
00:07:29,707 --> 00:07:30,861
I'm glad we're friends.

169
00:07:30,865 --> 00:07:32,220
Yeah, this is really working out.

170
00:07:32,227 --> 00:07:34,491
There's no conflict in this movie!

171
00:07:35,757 --> 00:07:37,603
When are you gonna get rid of that stump?!

172
00:07:37,607 --> 00:07:40,171
I've been asking you for months
to get rid of that stump!

173
00:07:40,175 --> 00:07:42,180
I'll do it, all right?!
Just get off my back!

174
00:07:45,755 --> 00:07:46,961
She's gone.

175
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,701
We can finally be together.

176
00:07:48,705 --> 00:07:50,741
But, Tim, I'm rooted to the ground.

177
00:07:50,745 --> 00:07:53,213
We'll find a way.
We'll find a way.

178
00:07:56,897 --> 00:07:58,563
My God, it's hot.

179
00:07:58,565 --> 00:08:00,692
Brian, did you turn off
the air conditioner?

180
00:08:00,696 --> 00:08:01,742
Just open a window.

181
00:08:01,745 --> 00:08:03,730
Air conditioners are harmful
to the ozone layer.

182
00:08:03,825 --> 00:08:04,763
Brian, please.

183
00:08:04,765 --> 00:08:07,331
Save your hippie B.S.
for the winter months, okay?

184
00:08:07,335 --> 00:08:10,001
Hey, Brian. I'm not gonna recycle
this aluminum can.

185
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:11,580
I'm just gonna throw it in the trash.

186
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:21,930
Ha! you are earth's bitch!

187
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,162
Morning, civilians.

188
00:08:23,175 --> 00:08:25,253
General Griffin reporting for breakfast.

189
00:08:25,258 --> 00:08:26,710
Dad, it's not fair.

190
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:28,362
My money paid for that tank,

191
00:08:28,368 --> 00:08:30,392
and I haven't even gotten to drive it yet.

192
00:08:30,408 --> 00:08:32,760
Jeez, Meg, you always got to ruin
my good time.

193
00:08:32,768 --> 00:08:34,092
Just like basic cable.

194
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,361
<i>We now return to Showgirls.</i>

195
00:08:36,367 --> 00:08:38,052
<i>- Yeah!
- On TBS.</i>

196
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:38,810
Aw.

197
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,670
All right, Meg, you got a feel
for the controls.

198
00:08:42,675 --> 00:08:44,123
Now give it a little gas.

199
00:08:47,805 --> 00:08:49,113
Oh, great, it's here.

200
00:08:49,115 --> 00:08:50,931
That mirror I bought on eBay.

201
00:08:51,618 --> 00:08:53,053
Oh, my God!

202
00:08:56,928 --> 00:08:59,032
Joe, my God, what happened?

203
00:08:59,036 --> 00:09:01,300
You just ran over me, you bastard.

204
00:09:01,305 --> 00:09:04,593
I don't know where you got that
thing, but I'm impounding it!

205
00:09:05,286 --> 00:09:06,242
Look at you.

206
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:08,132
You look like a half-empty toothpaste.

207
00:09:10,796 --> 00:09:13,402
<i>We now return to The Ghost Whisperer.</i>

208
00:09:13,405 --> 00:09:14,703
I don't understand.

209
00:09:14,707 --> 00:09:16,551
Why do all you ghosts come to me?

210
00:09:16,558 --> 00:09:17,771
You're-you're really...

211
00:09:17,776 --> 00:09:19,222
Um, you have a knack f...

212
00:09:19,227 --> 00:09:20,353
We-we just trust you.

213
00:09:20,356 --> 00:09:23,032
I can't believe you let Mr. Swanson
confiscate

214
00:09:23,035 --> 00:09:25,143
the closest thing I had to a car.

215
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,651
Relax, Meg, it's not the worst thing
I've ever done.

216
00:09:27,656 --> 00:09:30,110
You remember that favor
I did for that park ranger?

217
00:09:30,116 --> 00:09:33,293
Hey, Boo Boo, let's see what
we got in this pic-a-nic basket.

218
00:09:40,056 --> 00:09:42,471
Tell the other bears what you just saw.

219
00:09:42,746 --> 00:09:43,790
Well, I don't care.

220
00:09:43,795 --> 00:09:45,152
'Cause you know what I'm gonna do?

221
00:09:45,155 --> 00:09:47,631
I'm gonna get a job and buy a real car.

222
00:09:47,638 --> 00:09:51,622
Hey, Meg, I'll pay you a dollar a day
to smell my sneakers.

223
00:10:10,316 --> 00:10:12,001
Oh! I peed and pooped.

224
00:10:12,006 --> 00:10:15,741
You know, I read that they're opening
a Superstore USA across town.

225
00:10:15,745 --> 00:10:17,201
Maybe you could get a job there.

226
00:10:17,206 --> 00:10:19,280
No, no, no way.
You cannot work there, Meg.

227
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,583
Giant mega-stores like Superstore USA

228
00:10:21,586 --> 00:10:22,780
are ruining this country.

229
00:10:22,798 --> 00:10:24,652
They don't pay their employees
a decent wage

230
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:25,872
or give them health benefits.

231
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,962
Oh, yeah, all gay guys hate
Superstore USA.

232
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:28,811
- What?
- Hmm?

233
00:10:28,815 --> 00:10:30,150
Hey, I'm just trying to be ethical.

234
00:10:30,156 --> 00:10:31,962
Yeah, right. You hate all megastores,

235
00:10:31,968 --> 00:10:33,813
ever since you were petted way too hard

236
00:10:33,817 --> 00:10:36,102
by that special boy in front of Kmart.

237
00:10:37,507 --> 00:10:38,523
Doggie!

238
00:10:39,207 --> 00:10:40,252
Doggie!

239
00:10:40,617 --> 00:10:42,221
- Doggie!
- Too hard.

240
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,200
- I like doggie!
- Too hard.

241
00:10:44,207 --> 00:10:47,462
- Doggie!
- Gonna bite.

242
00:10:47,466 --> 00:10:48,402
Doggie!

243
00:10:51,975 --> 00:10:53,320
Oh, Jeez.

244
00:10:59,788 --> 00:11:01,623
Welcome to the
Superstore family, Meg.

245
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,022
- Glad to have you.
- Thanks.

246
00:11:03,027 --> 00:11:04,783
I'm really excited to get to work.

247
00:11:04,787 --> 00:11:06,791
Now, let me just go over a few basics.

248
00:11:06,798 --> 00:11:08,732
You'll earn minimum wage, no overtime,

249
00:11:08,738 --> 00:11:11,062
no health benefits, and every day at 3:00,

250
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:13,463
you'll need to give Sloth a Baby Ruth.

251
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:15,290
Oh, it's nearly 3:00, now.

252
00:11:18,665 --> 00:11:19,732
Here you go.

253
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:21,942
You're beautiful.

254
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:23,761
I would go out with you

255
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:27,281
if I wasn't already in a
committed relationship.

256
00:11:36,506 --> 00:11:37,900
Hey, guys, what's going on?

257
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:41,770
Oh, Peter, Superstore USA has taken
all my business.

258
00:11:41,776 --> 00:11:42,880
Mine, too.

259
00:11:42,888 --> 00:11:45,662
In fact, the only guy in town
making any money

260
00:11:45,665 --> 00:11:47,913
is that guy who makes tumbleweeds.

261
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:50,681
Y'all laughed at me.
Y'all laughed at me.

262
00:11:50,685 --> 00:11:53,052
Well, who's laughing now?

263
00:11:54,776 --> 00:11:56,082
What do you think of this?

264
00:11:56,096 --> 00:11:58,153
That makes you attractive.

265
00:11:58,158 --> 00:11:59,043
Yeah!

266
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:03,353
Well, maybe now, you guys are seeing
what I've been trying to explain to you.

267
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:05,782
That mega store is a big,
evil corporation

268
00:12:05,785 --> 00:12:07,720
that means nothing but trouble
for this town.

269
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,243
Aw, man, this is the worst thing
to happen to this town since

270
00:12:10,245 --> 00:12:12,532
that roving gang of Tom Brokaws.

271
00:12:16,305 --> 00:12:19,361
Looks like someone's a little lost.

272
00:12:21,156 --> 00:12:23,453
Everyone, I have some bad news.

273
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:26,271
Superstore USA has their
own brewery on-site

274
00:12:26,276 --> 00:12:28,512
and can sell beer at a much
cheaper price.

275
00:12:28,516 --> 00:12:30,952
So management has decided
to close down.

276
00:12:30,956 --> 00:12:33,893
- You mean, I'm out of a job again?
- I'm sorry, Peter.

277
00:12:33,908 --> 00:12:37,412
Man, this sucks worse than
Easter Sunday at Richard Gere's house.

278
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,453
Okay, find the Easter egg.

279
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:42,062
I know where it is. It's in your butt.

280
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:42,953
No.

281
00:12:42,957 --> 00:12:45,551
Yeah, I know the story, it's in your butt.

282
00:12:45,555 --> 00:12:48,511
Mr. Griffin, if you'd just look
on the ground for five seconds

283
00:12:48,526 --> 00:12:50,290
- I'm sure you'd find it.
- Nope, in your butt.

284
00:12:50,298 --> 00:12:52,513
- Look, I'm tired of this stupid rumor.
- In your butt.

285
00:12:52,536 --> 00:12:54,322
- Mr. Griffin.
- Butt.

286
00:12:54,325 --> 00:12:56,161
You know what, just get
the hell out of here.

287
00:12:56,165 --> 00:12:57,912
Fine. Weirdo.

288
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:05,662
So, how was work
today, Meg?

289
00:13:05,948 --> 00:13:07,742
Oh, Peter, you lost your job

290
00:13:07,747 --> 00:13:10,321
because of the Superstore,
you shouldn't blame Meg.

291
00:13:10,448 --> 00:13:12,500
And you can stop making that fart sound

292
00:13:12,505 --> 00:13:14,193
every time someone says "Meg. "

293
00:13:14,238 --> 00:13:17,082
So, how was your day exploiting
the town's resources, Meg?

294
00:13:18,758 --> 00:13:19,792
Meg.

295
00:13:20,128 --> 00:13:21,552
Meg.

296
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:25,593
Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg,
Meg, Meg, Meg.

297
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:28,712
Meg.

298
00:13:30,087 --> 00:13:31,931
I'm not going to sit here and take this.

299
00:13:31,948 --> 00:13:34,332
I'm the only one in this family
who has a job.

300
00:13:34,976 --> 00:13:36,680
Yeah, like she'd get paid for that.

301
00:13:36,688 --> 00:13:37,941
What did he just say to you?

302
00:13:37,947 --> 00:13:39,331
Nothing,th-there was...

303
00:13:39,426 --> 00:13:41,153
Well, it-it's like if you were...

304
00:13:41,158 --> 00:13:42,572
F- Forget it, it's nothing, Meg.

305
00:13:45,975 --> 00:13:48,451
- Hello. I'm Tom Tucker.
- And I'm Diane Simmons.

306
00:13:48,457 --> 00:13:52,123
At the top of the news, Quahog is suffering
it's worst heat wave in a century.

307
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,040
That's right, Diane.

308
00:13:53,045 --> 00:13:55,901
We now go live to Ollie Williams
with the Blaccu-weather report.

309
00:13:55,908 --> 00:13:57,210
How are you beating the heat, Ollie?

310
00:13:57,217 --> 00:13:58,672
- Swimmin' hole.
- Thanks, Ollie.

311
00:13:58,675 --> 00:14:01,533
In other news, Quahog will be
experiencing rolling blackouts

312
00:14:01,538 --> 00:14:04,822
to help meet Superstore USA's
extensive power demands.

313
00:14:04,826 --> 00:14:07,452
Oh, in fact, Channel Five
has just received

314
00:14:07,455 --> 00:14:09,383
this message from the Electric Company.

315
00:14:09,386 --> 00:14:12,600
Hey, you guys!

316
00:14:14,496 --> 00:14:17,272
<i>We're gonna turn it on</i>

317
00:14:17,516 --> 00:14:20,682
<i>We're gonna bring you the power</i>

318
00:14:20,868 --> 00:14:26,730
<i>It's coming down the line, Strong as it
can be, Through the courtesy</i>

319
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:33,650
<i>The Electric Company.
The Electric Company.</i>

320
00:14:34,937 --> 00:14:36,592
Contrary to those
upbeat lyrics,

321
00:14:36,605 --> 00:14:38,462
the Electric Company
would like us to emphasize

322
00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:40,513
it will not be bringing you the power.

323
00:14:41,155 --> 00:14:42,891
Great, rolling blackouts.

324
00:14:42,895 --> 00:14:45,913
Now, Superstore USA is siphoning off
all the city's power.

325
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,550
And they cost me my job.

326
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:48,571
Mine, too.

327
00:14:48,577 --> 00:14:51,623
Superstore USA has their own paper route.

328
00:14:54,948 --> 00:14:59,061
That new paper boy done gone
and broke my sternum.

329
00:15:13,147 --> 00:15:14,141
Ah, this sucks.

330
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,311
That damn Superstore's ruining everything.

331
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,073
You know, instead of sitting
around complaining,

332
00:15:18,076 --> 00:15:19,750
why don't we go down there and protest?

333
00:15:19,757 --> 00:15:21,422
That's a great idea, Brian.

334
00:15:21,428 --> 00:15:24,392
All we need is some magic markers,
posterboard, some plywood...

335
00:15:24,395 --> 00:15:27,441
Actually, Superstore USA has
all that stuff. We can just get it there.

336
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:39,092
There's one of them now.

337
00:15:39,096 --> 00:15:42,172
Take that for stealing jobs
from hardworking people.

338
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,902
Dad, what the hell are you doing?

339
00:15:45,905 --> 00:15:47,451
We got a message for you.

340
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:50,031
We're here, we're queer, get used to it.

341
00:15:50,038 --> 00:15:52,802
- Uh, actually, Peter...
- Gattaca, Gattaca!

342
00:15:52,807 --> 00:15:55,813
Peter, I don't think it's working.
People are still going into the store.

343
00:15:57,608 --> 00:16:01,433
Well, fine, then I guess I got to go
in there and drag 'em out one by one.

344
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:05,893
All right, who the hell is in charge...

345
00:16:05,896 --> 00:16:09,281
Ah... ah, wha-what is that I'm feeling?

346
00:16:09,285 --> 00:16:11,541
That's our industrialsized
air conditioner.

347
00:16:11,545 --> 00:16:12,313
Wow.

348
00:16:12,317 --> 00:16:15,481
When I walk into Superstore USA,
I get the sensation...

349
00:16:15,807 --> 00:16:17,923
that I'm standing on a mountain top

350
00:16:17,927 --> 00:16:20,243
with the wind blowing through my hair.

351
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:24,020
My God, look at this wonderland
of treasures.

352
00:16:24,027 --> 00:16:27,653
What would a guy like me have to do
to be part of this magical world?

353
00:16:27,836 --> 00:16:31,693
You are trespassing on private property
and I must ask you to leave.

354
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,612
What? Are you out of your mind?

355
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,952
Leave this lot, losers.

356
00:16:35,957 --> 00:16:37,641
Unless you want a licking.

357
00:16:37,645 --> 00:16:40,541
And we'd love to deliver that licking,
right, fellas?

358
00:16:40,547 --> 00:16:42,011
- Yeah. Love it.
- A lot.

359
00:16:42,016 --> 00:16:45,732
I'd love to lick a lemon lollipop
in Lillehammer.

360
00:16:50,216 --> 00:16:52,722
God, I wish the power would come back on.

361
00:16:52,726 --> 00:16:55,222
Boy, Meg, I am so looking forward
to this job.

362
00:16:55,235 --> 00:16:57,921
Peter, I can't believe you're
working for Superstore USA.

363
00:16:57,926 --> 00:16:59,472
How could you sell out like that?

364
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:02,582
Because, Brian, they have an
industrialsized air conditioner.

365
00:17:02,587 --> 00:17:04,773
And I'm tired of sitting in balls soup.

366
00:17:04,776 --> 00:17:07,191
Look, Dad, this isn't going
to be a cakewalk, all right?

367
00:17:07,198 --> 00:17:08,483
I'm your supervisor.

368
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:12,212
Meg, Meg, I promise I'll do better
at this job than I did on the SAT's.

369
00:17:19,478 --> 00:17:20,602
Come on.

370
00:17:21,316 --> 00:17:22,630
Do math.

371
00:17:25,008 --> 00:17:26,260
Dad, I need you to...

372
00:17:26,268 --> 00:17:28,333
Dad, what are you doing?

373
00:17:28,335 --> 00:17:29,841
Meg, Meg, look, Meg look.

374
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:32,082
I am so freaking good at coloring.

375
00:17:32,088 --> 00:17:34,222
I know I'm not supposed to go
outside the lines,

376
00:17:34,235 --> 00:17:36,642
but I do anyway because I like
being myself.

377
00:17:38,776 --> 00:17:39,670
Dad?

378
00:17:42,677 --> 00:17:43,861
Dad?

379
00:17:45,997 --> 00:17:47,100
Dad?

380
00:17:54,277 --> 00:17:56,491
Oh, God, it's so hot.

381
00:17:56,595 --> 00:17:59,203
Uh, Brian, spit on me.

382
00:17:59,677 --> 00:18:01,303
Oh, that's nice.

383
00:18:01,485 --> 00:18:03,162
Now, tell me I'm scum.

384
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,162
- How will that cool you off?
- Hmm?

385
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,203
God, it's awful in here.

386
00:18:07,205 --> 00:18:10,081
This is even worse than getting
herpes from a toilet seat.

387
00:18:10,097 --> 00:18:12,113
Joanie, it's me.

388
00:18:12,265 --> 00:18:13,412
Oh, hey.

389
00:18:13,455 --> 00:18:16,382
You know, I had such a great
time with you last night.

390
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:18,680
Listen, there's something
I have to tell you.

391
00:18:18,688 --> 00:18:20,702
I just got back from the doctor.

392
00:18:20,706 --> 00:18:21,942
I have herpes.

393
00:18:21,946 --> 00:18:23,812
I think you should get yourself
checked out.

394
00:18:23,818 --> 00:18:25,862
- Oh, my God.
- Will you stay?

395
00:18:25,865 --> 00:18:26,640
What?

396
00:18:26,645 --> 00:18:29,902
Will you stay with me,
even knowing that I have herpes?

397
00:18:30,657 --> 00:18:32,573
Yes, I will.

398
00:18:32,616 --> 00:18:34,441
- Joanie?
- Yeah?

399
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:35,880
I don't have herpes.

400
00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:38,053
I just needed to know that you'd stay.

401
00:18:38,745 --> 00:18:40,611
<i>You say...</i>

402
00:18:41,908 --> 00:18:44,492
<i>I only hear what I want to...</i>

403
00:18:44,577 --> 00:18:47,963
I've had it, the only place in town
that's got power is Superstore USA,

404
00:18:47,966 --> 00:18:50,050
while the rest of us are left
to bake in the heat.

405
00:18:50,058 --> 00:18:52,681
There's got to be something we
can do to take that place down.

406
00:18:52,686 --> 00:18:55,940
Don't worry, Brian,
I think I've got an idea.

407
00:18:59,425 --> 00:19:01,173
Oh, yeah.

408
00:19:04,887 --> 00:19:07,681
Excuse me, can you tell me where
I can find a assault rifles?

409
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:08,600
Aisle 6.

410
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,842
How about a list of known
local homosexuals?

411
00:19:10,847 --> 00:19:11,863
Aisle 4.

412
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:13,870
Meg, you're doing a great job.

413
00:19:13,885 --> 00:19:16,951
In fact, I'm promoting you
to assistant manager.

414
00:19:16,957 --> 00:19:18,773
Really? Oh, my God.

415
00:19:18,776 --> 00:19:20,283
Thank you so much.

416
00:19:20,286 --> 00:19:24,440
Now, your first responsibility
is to fire that employee.

417
00:19:24,486 --> 00:19:27,462
Boy, I'm a little chilly.
I hope no one notices.

418
00:19:30,598 --> 00:19:31,872
But that's my dad.

419
00:19:31,877 --> 00:19:34,552
What's more important to you,
your job or your family?

420
00:19:34,568 --> 00:19:36,223
And don't pick the obvious one.

421
00:19:36,238 --> 00:19:38,831
Oh, hey, guys, I was just catching up
on some plunger nipples.

422
00:19:38,835 --> 00:19:40,691
Dad, um...

423
00:19:40,697 --> 00:19:41,793
Go on, Meg.

424
00:19:41,795 --> 00:19:43,242
What are you waiting for?

425
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,641
Dad, I'm sorry I have to say this,

426
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:54,521
but you're a fat ass who's
completely incapable

427
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,763
of performing the simplest tasks.

428
00:19:56,888 --> 00:20:00,002
But... you're also my father.

429
00:20:00,108 --> 00:20:02,753
And you're the only one I'll ever have.

430
00:20:02,988 --> 00:20:06,020
So, I'm not going to fire you.

431
00:20:06,135 --> 00:20:08,351
Mr. Penisberg, I quit.

432
00:20:08,396 --> 00:20:09,830
Penisberg?

433
00:20:09,837 --> 00:20:12,543
Yeah, yeah, get it all out of your system.

434
00:20:12,547 --> 00:20:15,911
Meg, that was a wonderful
thing you just did for me.

435
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:18,713
I can't believe this is
coming out of my mouth, but...

436
00:20:18,948 --> 00:20:19,873
I love y...

437
00:20:53,898 --> 00:20:55,323
So, you got a tank.

438
00:20:55,335 --> 00:20:56,960
Big whoop.
Want to fight about i...

439
00:21:17,348 --> 00:21:20,202
Huh, well, I'm glad
that Superstore USA is gone.

440
00:21:20,207 --> 00:21:22,010
That place was nothing but trouble.

441
00:21:22,018 --> 00:21:23,522
And I think we learned something.

442
00:21:23,528 --> 00:21:26,990
Any problem caused by a tank
can be solved by a tank.

443
00:21:26,997 --> 00:21:29,763
Dad, you were about to say
something in the store.

444
00:21:29,767 --> 00:21:30,912
No, I don't think so.

445
00:21:30,917 --> 00:21:32,570
No, I'm sure of it.

446
00:21:32,578 --> 00:21:35,342
Oh, I don't know, something
about Hardcastle and McCormick?

447
00:21:35,348 --> 00:21:37,922
No, you were going to say you loved me.

448
00:21:37,925 --> 00:21:40,343
You love me and you know it.

449
00:21:40,378 --> 00:21:42,762
Hey, hey, mouth, young lady.

450
00:21:42,837 --> 00:21:45,300
Well, you think you'll look
for another job, Meg?

451
00:21:46,645 --> 00:21:47,731
Meg!

452
00:21:48,105 --> 00:21:49,073
Meg.

453
00:21:49,388 --> 00:21:50,282
Meg.

454
00:21:51,087 --> 00:21:52,033
Uh-oh.

455
00:21:53,028 --> 00:21:54,392
Pardon me.
