Ow, the piping hot gravy!

478
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:49,914
Oh! And one of the peas went inside!

479
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,124
It's so burned,

480
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,585
I can't tell what's chicken
and what's me!

481
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,962
Oh, God! Not gonna stop though!

482
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,006
Happy anniversary, Mom and Dad,

483
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,966
from your teenage son

484
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:03,846
getting busy with a 400-degree pot pie!
