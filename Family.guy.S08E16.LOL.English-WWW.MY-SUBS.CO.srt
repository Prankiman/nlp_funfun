00:00:35,566 --> 00:00:36,874
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.

12
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:39,135
Our top story tonight,
scientists at NASA

13
00:00:39,184 --> 00:00:40,947
have made a fascinating
new discovery:

14
00:00:41,118 --> 00:00:43,987
The first directly observable
instance of a black hole,

15
00:00:43,988 --> 00:00:46,552
which appears to be located
just outside our solar system.

16
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:48,794
Tricia Takanawa
has the story.

17
00:00:48,795 --> 00:00:52,037
Tom, I'm standing here
with Stephen Hawking,

18
00:00:52,038 --> 00:00:53,972
the first white
man I've ever met

19
00:00:53,973 --> 00:00:55,838
who knows math
better than me.

20
00:00:56,221 --> 00:00:59,027
Mr. Hawking, what does the
discovery of this black hole

21
00:00:59,028 --> 00:01:00,826
mean to you and
your research?

22
00:01:01,524 --> 00:01:02,772
I am overjoyed.

23
00:01:02,773 --> 00:01:06,438
This is the crowning
achievement of my career.

24
00:01:06,516 --> 00:01:09,715
It validates the work
of a lifetime.

25
00:01:10,011 --> 00:01:11,506
It certainly does.

26
00:01:11,507 --> 00:01:12,773
Back to you, Tom.

27
00:01:13,132 --> 00:01:14,164
All right, we're clear.

28
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:15,375
I'm telling you, man,

29
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:16,436
this shtick is
getting so old.

30
00:01:16,437 --> 00:01:17,736
That chair smells, dude.

31
00:01:17,748 --> 00:01:19,013
Hey, Steve, surf's up!

32
00:01:19,494 --> 00:01:20,460
All right!

33
00:01:20,492 --> 00:01:22,058
See you, bitch!

34
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:24,435
Everyone, guess what.

35
00:01:24,924 --> 00:01:25,486
What?

36
00:01:25,487 --> 00:01:27,856
I have been selected.

37
00:01:28,481 --> 00:01:29,228
For what?

38
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:32,089
Oh, nothing too important,
just jury duty!

39
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:33,477
They have summoned me.

40
00:01:33,597 --> 00:01:35,655
I am part of an elite group
of individuals

41
00:01:35,656 --> 00:01:37,156
deemed intelligent enough
to decide

42
00:01:37,157 --> 00:01:39,022
the fate of a fellow citizen.

43
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,706
Ah, the amused laughter
of the envious.

44
00:01:44,707 --> 00:01:46,764
You know, they don't just
pick anybody for this job.

45
00:01:46,765 --> 00:01:47,898
Yeah, they do.

46
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:50,383
Brian, perhaps I have not
made myself clear.

47
00:01:50,384 --> 00:01:53,651
I have been entrusted
to pass judgment upon others.

48
00:01:53,815 --> 00:01:56,483
Everybody gets called for
jury duty, you stupid idiot!

49
00:01:56,811 --> 00:01:57,994
I've been called!

50
00:01:57,995 --> 00:01:59,306
The only reason you've
never been called

51
00:01:59,307 --> 00:02:01,117
is that they use the
voter registration list,

52
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:03,185
and this past election is the
first time you ever voted.

53
00:02:03,488 --> 00:02:04,654
I voted before.

54
00:02:04,673 --> 00:02:06,573
I stuffed the ballot box
at the Oscars.

55
00:02:06,983 --> 00:02:10,538
And the nominees for Best Actor
in a Leading Role are:

56
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:13,506
Grover, Bluto from <i>Popeye,</i>

57
00:02:13,537 --> 00:02:14,969
a Red Guy, a Boob

58
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,703
and Daniel Day Lewis.

59
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:19,888
And the Oscar goes to...

60
00:02:20,023 --> 00:02:21,056
a Red Guy!

61
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,565
Wait a second.
Y... You're saying that

62
00:02:27,824 --> 00:02:30,195
everyone is asked
to do jury duty?

63
00:02:30,196 --> 00:02:31,262
Yes, Peter.

64
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,752
So then, I'm not special?

65
00:02:33,814 --> 00:02:35,997
Everyone's special,
Peter.

66
00:02:35,998 --> 00:02:37,056
Rock Drummer
Tommy Lee?!

67
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:39,996
And if your wife ever tells you
that you're not special,

68
00:02:40,116 --> 00:02:42,365
punch her really hard
right in her hepatitis.

69
00:02:42,366 --> 00:02:44,426
Thanks, Rock
Drummer Tommy Lee!

70
00:02:44,546 --> 00:02:45,980
Hey, and you know
what else is cool?

71
00:02:45,981 --> 00:02:48,048
Having sex
with sunglasses on.

72
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:50,401
I've got a lot of
things to try now!

73
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,591
I don't want
to go to jury duty.

74
00:02:56,592 --> 00:02:58,274
Turns out it's not a special
honor at all. It's lame.

75
00:02:58,275 --> 00:03:01,024
And the worst part is,
they try and trick you

76
00:03:01,035 --> 00:03:03,212
into getting excited
by putting "duty" in the title.

77
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,666
So, you were excited
when you thought

78
00:03:04,702 --> 00:03:06,302
there was fecal
matter involved?

79
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:07,689
What the hell
is fecal matter?

80
00:03:07,763 --> 00:03:08,696
- Waste.
- Huh?

81
00:03:08,757 --> 00:03:09,443
- Doody.
- Ha-ha!

82
00:03:09,444 --> 00:03:12,007
Peter, jury duty is an
important cornerstone

83
00:03:12,013 --> 00:03:13,856
in our democratic society.

84
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,040
Yeah, that's what separates us
from the monkeys.

85
00:03:16,058 --> 00:03:18,259
That and the armed guards
at the zoo.

86
00:03:18,306 --> 00:03:20,907
Man, they got some
sexy monkeys down there.

87
00:03:20,925 --> 00:03:22,929
I don't care,
jury duty sounds boring.

88
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:24,482
I'm gonna get myself kicked out.

89
00:03:24,483 --> 00:03:26,383
Just like I got
kicked out of Coldplay.

90
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:29,098
Guys, guys, I got an idea!

91
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:32,201
How 'bout we do a song
that's not whiny bull crap?

92
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,276
All right,
ladies and gentlemen.

93
00:03:37,277 --> 00:03:39,770
We're gonna ask you a series
of questions to determine

94
00:03:39,771 --> 00:03:42,151
whether or not you can
be impartial jurors.

95
00:03:42,271 --> 00:03:44,872
First off, do any of
you have any prejudices

96
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,684
you feel the court
should know of?

97
00:03:47,074 --> 00:03:48,009
Yes, you sir.

98
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,759
Ants. I hate ants.

99
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:50,378
What?

100
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:51,252
That's right, you heard me.

101
00:03:51,253 --> 00:03:52,387
I'm an ant hater.

102
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:54,539
Just like my daddy
and his daddy before him.

103
00:03:54,748 --> 00:03:56,494
So, if this is
an ant trial, forget it.

104
00:03:56,495 --> 00:03:58,196
No way I'm gonna be fair.

105
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,765
Always making those
cocky little hills.

106
00:04:00,801 --> 00:04:03,402
Moving around
all single file and stupid.

107
00:04:03,483 --> 00:04:06,785
All ganging up and walking
my pie off the picnic blanket.

108
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:14,512
'Twas my pie gone missing!

109
00:04:14,632 --> 00:04:16,240
Sir, this is not
an ant trial.

110
00:04:16,275 --> 00:04:16,960
Oh.

111
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:18,714
Is there anything else
we should know about?

112
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:19,834
Oh, have you not heard?

113
00:04:19,894 --> 00:04:20,644
Heard what?

114
00:04:20,645 --> 00:04:22,079
♪ A well-a-bird-bird-bird ♪

115
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,382
♪ B... bird's the word,
a well-a-bird-bird-bird ♪

116
00:04:24,502 --> 00:04:26,026
♪ B... bird's the word,
a well-a... ♪

117
00:04:28,163 --> 00:04:30,429
All right, now the prosecution
is about to show you

118
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:32,002
items pertinent to this case

119
00:04:32,026 --> 00:04:33,310
that have been entered
into evidence.

120
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:36,180
It is vitally important
that you look but don't touch,

121
00:04:36,203 --> 00:04:38,410
as any fingerprints
could contaminate them.

122
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:40,784
Exhibit A,
one bloody Slinky.

123
00:04:40,904 --> 00:04:41,798
Oh.

124
00:04:41,799 --> 00:04:42,735
Exhibit B,

125
00:04:42,736 --> 00:04:44,646
one semen-covered
View-Master.

126
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:45,769
Oh!

127
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,791
With the reel of
the Grand Canyon.

128
00:04:47,911 --> 00:04:49,158
Oh!

129
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:51,512
And a blood-splattered
Mr. Potato Head.

130
00:04:51,531 --> 00:04:52,798
Oh!

131
00:04:52,904 --> 00:04:54,471
And these socks
you really need.

132
00:04:54,591 --> 00:04:55,985
Oh!

133
00:04:58,272 --> 00:05:01,041
All right, everyone, we're going
to take a ten-minute recess.

134
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:03,448
I would like to remind members
of the jury that you are

135
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:06,452
forbidden to discuss details of
the case outside the courtroom.

136
00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:12,497
Hey, how about this trial, huh?

137
00:05:12,498 --> 00:05:13,428
And all its details.

138
00:05:13,497 --> 00:05:14,494
Let's discuss them.

139
00:05:14,619 --> 00:05:15,806
He said not to!

140
00:05:15,807 --> 00:05:17,240
Aw, hey, you know
how the judge told us

141
00:05:17,241 --> 00:05:18,668
not to make up
our minds beforehand?

142
00:05:18,675 --> 00:05:19,854
Let's make up our minds.

143
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:20,826
Griffin, shut up!

144
00:05:20,859 --> 00:05:21,919
Hey, I know the judge said

145
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,617
not to run in the hall,
but check this out!

146
00:05:29,752 --> 00:05:31,591
Griffin! Knock it off!

147
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:33,338
Hey, come on, Judge,
tell us the answer.

148
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:34,971
The Mexican guy
did it, right?

149
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,905
We now return to <i>How Henry
Kissinger Met Your Mother</i>.

150
00:05:42,165 --> 00:05:44,758
I was walking with my professor

151
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,260
when I saw this
woman who was...

152
00:06:03,105 --> 00:06:04,289
Stewie, can you please move?

153
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,162
You're blocking the TV.

154
00:06:05,163 --> 00:06:06,864
No! And I'll thank
you to quiet down.

155
00:06:06,877 --> 00:06:08,414
I'm playing
action figures.

156
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,599
Prepare to be bested
on the battlefield, Lion-O.

157
00:06:10,622 --> 00:06:12,183
Oh, I don't think so, He-Man.

158
00:06:12,303 --> 00:06:13,025
Ow!

159
00:06:13,026 --> 00:06:14,336
Oh, I'm sorry,
did I punch you too hard?

160
00:06:14,337 --> 00:06:15,770
Yes, I suppose you don't know
your own strength.

161
00:06:15,788 --> 00:06:17,083
I mean, look at your muscles.

162
00:06:17,084 --> 00:06:19,220
Oh, stop it, you're the one
with the sick abs.

163
00:06:19,455 --> 00:06:22,089
God, my mouth is watering
just looking at you.

164
00:06:22,387 --> 00:06:23,320
Yeah, that's right.

165
00:06:23,321 --> 00:06:25,557
You buy your kids
ridiculously homoerotic dolls

166
00:06:25,582 --> 00:06:26,940
and then ask what happened?

167
00:06:26,941 --> 00:06:29,443
Yep. Your gay son
is on you, buddy.

168
00:06:29,687 --> 00:06:31,321
Explain that to your God.

169
00:06:31,665 --> 00:06:33,804
Off to another day
of jury duty, sweetie?

170
00:06:33,805 --> 00:06:35,054
Yeah, and it sucks.

171
00:06:35,055 --> 00:06:37,022
Even the vending machines
are out of order.

172
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,500
I don't want to go back
to stupid jury duty.

173
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,724
There's got to be some
way I can get out of it.

174
00:06:44,725 --> 00:06:46,892
This is Tom Tucker
with some breaking news.

175
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,843
NASA has made
the alarming announcement

176
00:06:48,844 --> 00:06:50,377
that the newly discovered
black hole

177
00:06:50,401 --> 00:06:53,275
at the edge of our solar system
appears to be expanding.

178
00:06:53,276 --> 00:06:55,458
Neptune and Pluto have
already been consumed,

179
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:57,392
and scientists estimate
that the event horizon

180
00:06:57,393 --> 00:06:59,054
will reach Earth by tomorrow.

181
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,013
That's right, Tom.

182
00:07:00,014 --> 00:07:01,503
Which means that
all life on Earth

183
00:07:01,512 --> 00:07:03,922
will be destroyed
within twenty-four hours.

184
00:07:04,195 --> 00:07:05,878
Oh, my God!

185
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:08,124
Mom, is... is this for real?

186
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,129
Well, it sure looks
that way, sweetie.

187
00:07:10,145 --> 00:07:12,617
It's the end
of the world!

188
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,179
Holy crap!

189
00:07:17,985 --> 00:07:20,252
Seems like I've run out
of waiting time.

190
00:07:25,468 --> 00:07:27,151
...but it looks like
Nicole Ritchie's baby

191
00:07:27,152 --> 00:07:28,820
is gonna be just fine.

192
00:07:28,901 --> 00:07:31,207
Also in the news,
the doomsday clock is ticking

193
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,576
with less than ninteen hours
to go before our planet

194
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:35,914
is consumed by
an expanding black hole.

195
00:07:36,201 --> 00:07:39,006
As Americans everywhere
face their last day on Earth,

196
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,042
one can only imagine
how they're spending it.

197
00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:44,123
Hey, Mort.

198
00:07:44,124 --> 00:07:45,495
Now that the end
of the world is here,

199
00:07:45,496 --> 00:07:47,731
I just wanted to say
no hard feelings, huh?

200
00:07:48,392 --> 00:07:49,739
Ow!

201
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,738
Psych! Ha-ha!

202
00:07:50,739 --> 00:07:52,549
Embedded in the hand.

203
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,051
Have fun where you're going.

204
00:07:55,419 --> 00:07:57,166
Well, it's become clear,

205
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:59,038
the only way
to avert this disaster

206
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,342
is by writing a strongly-worded
letter to the black hole.

207
00:08:02,784 --> 00:08:04,092
"Dear space.

208
00:08:04,093 --> 00:08:06,878
"Well, you're just full
of surprises, aren't you?

209
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,936
"You think you're so good
'cause you went to Choate.

210
00:08:10,086 --> 00:08:11,621
"Well, you're not
gonna be so tough

211
00:08:11,642 --> 00:08:13,264
"when I put a fish bowl
on my head

212
00:08:13,265 --> 00:08:16,811
and a rocket pack on my back and
come up there and punch you."

213
00:08:25,732 --> 00:08:27,860
Take that, Orion!

214
00:08:30,536 --> 00:08:31,285
That's right.

215
00:08:31,286 --> 00:08:34,216
All you are is a failed
production company.

216
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:37,905
Joe, Joe,
you got to help me.

217
00:08:37,965 --> 00:08:39,148
You got to help
me get laid!

218
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:40,494
What are you
talking about, Quagmire?

219
00:08:40,518 --> 00:08:41,554
I got to get laid!

220
00:08:41,674 --> 00:08:42,581
You got to help
me get laid!

221
00:08:42,582 --> 00:08:43,765
I've never had sex!

222
00:08:43,766 --> 00:08:45,755
What do you mean?
You've had sex a million times.

223
00:08:45,763 --> 00:08:46,823
Aw, that's all bluster.

224
00:08:46,835 --> 00:08:48,319
I just talk big
for the fellas.

225
00:08:48,508 --> 00:08:49,974
I'm a virgin, Joe!

226
00:08:50,006 --> 00:08:51,510
I don't want to
die a virgin!

227
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,030
Help me, please!

228
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,997
Let me have sex
with Bonnie!

229
00:08:56,122 --> 00:08:57,621
I guess so.

230
00:08:57,622 --> 00:09:00,355
For my friend,
on our last day on Earth.

231
00:09:00,615 --> 00:09:02,749
You're a good
man, Joe Swanson.

232
00:09:03,983 --> 00:09:05,230
How was your first time?

233
00:09:05,231 --> 00:09:06,730
Ah, I've had sex
lots of times.

234
00:09:06,731 --> 00:09:08,110
I just wanted to
have it again!

235
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,951
Screw you!

236
00:09:11,974 --> 00:09:13,977
Who else but Quagmire?

237
00:09:14,594 --> 00:09:16,400
Well, Diane, now that
our time is almost up,

238
00:09:16,401 --> 00:09:18,708
just to lighten the mood,
we introduce a new feature

239
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,836
called Tom's Crank Calls.

240
00:09:20,956 --> 00:09:23,389
Let's dial that number,
shall we?

241
00:09:23,703 --> 00:09:25,697
Hello, is this Megan Fox?

242
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,598
I will kill you,
do you understand?

243
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:29,200
If I can't have you,
no one can.

244
00:09:29,255 --> 00:09:30,189
I will kill you.

245
00:09:30,254 --> 00:09:32,222
This is Tom Tucker.

246
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,005
Well, I know who <i>you</i> are.

247
00:09:35,246 --> 00:09:37,780
It's fun to see how people react
when they're on the spot.

248
00:09:38,304 --> 00:09:40,301
Look, since these
are our final hours,

249
00:09:40,302 --> 00:09:42,111
I want you kids
to know how much

250
00:09:42,112 --> 00:09:43,613
your father
and I love you

251
00:09:43,734 --> 00:09:45,868
and how important
this family is to us.

252
00:09:46,107 --> 00:09:47,407
Oh, I'm scared.

253
00:09:47,414 --> 00:09:49,272
I wonder what it's like to die.

254
00:09:49,286 --> 00:09:52,032
I don't know, but from the
look in a stray cat's eyes

255
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:53,593
when you're pushing
on its windpipe,

256
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:55,119
I think it's
pretty terrifying.

257
00:09:55,402 --> 00:09:56,774
Like, panicky.

258
00:09:56,775 --> 00:09:58,743
Hey, Brian, what do you
think is gonna happ...

259
00:09:59,145 --> 00:10:00,206
What was that...

260
00:10:00,207 --> 00:10:01,306
You were praying.

261
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:02,462
Come on, no, I wasn't.

262
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:03,512
Yes, you were.

263
00:10:03,513 --> 00:10:05,053
You were
praying, I saw!

264
00:10:05,073 --> 00:10:06,273
No, man, it was a joke!

265
00:10:06,322 --> 00:10:07,483
You were praying!

266
00:10:07,508 --> 00:10:09,253
It was a goof!
I was goofing on you!

267
00:10:09,254 --> 00:10:11,689
You're... you're...
you're disingenuous.

268
00:10:13,748 --> 00:10:14,619
Hello, everybody.

269
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,654
This is Montecore.
He's my lion.

270
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,678
I have a lion now.

271
00:10:19,114 --> 00:10:20,528
Peter, what the hell?!

272
00:10:20,548 --> 00:10:21,796
You know, I went
to the zoo last week

273
00:10:21,797 --> 00:10:23,699
and asked if I could do it,
and they told me to scram.

274
00:10:23,735 --> 00:10:24,769
Went to the zoo this morning

275
00:10:24,855 --> 00:10:26,446
with a shotgun
and now I have a lion.

276
00:10:26,664 --> 00:10:28,712
- Does it bite?
- Of course it bites, it's a lion.

277
00:10:28,725 --> 00:10:30,158
Peter, get off the lion.

278
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:32,217
We should spend some time
together as a family.

279
00:10:32,218 --> 00:10:33,773
I don't think so, Lois.

280
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:35,211
But the world is ending.

281
00:10:35,212 --> 00:10:36,713
We should be spending
these final hours

282
00:10:36,774 --> 00:10:38,441
with the people we love most.

283
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:40,806
Lois, a day ago,
I was stuck on jury duty.

284
00:10:40,828 --> 00:10:43,554
Today, I have a golden ticket
to do whatever the hell I want.

285
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:44,509
I feel like an old guy

286
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,654
who's reliving
his youthful shenanigans.

287
00:10:46,944 --> 00:10:48,940
Tell me about when
you were young, Grandpa.

288
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:51,479
Oh, sonny,
those were crazy times.

289
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,496
My friends and I
were out of control.

290
00:10:53,497 --> 00:10:56,099
We used to give each other
wet-willies and funny arms.

291
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,148
We'd play dandy-balls and
legs-a-spread and penis-butt.

292
00:10:59,614 --> 00:11:01,046
Sounds kind of gay, Grandpa.

293
00:11:01,047 --> 00:11:02,986
It was gay. Everyone was.

294
00:11:03,106 --> 00:11:05,441
But, back then, we were
called pole-fancies.

295
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,098
It was real,
good old-fashioned

296
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,967
"grab the nearest tree and
hold on for dear life" gay,

297
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:12,902
not today's fancy, featherbed,
thread-count gay.

298
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,265
People got hurt back then!

299
00:11:14,651 --> 00:11:15,397
That's gay.

300
00:11:15,398 --> 00:11:16,431
Yeah, it was pretty gay.

301
00:11:20,393 --> 00:11:21,887
What the hell are you
doing with a musket?

302
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:22,886
Last day on Earth.

303
00:11:22,887 --> 00:11:25,254
I've always wanted to save
a Native American family

304
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,560
from rapacious cavalrymen.

305
00:11:34,682 --> 00:11:37,315
<i>Yeah...</i>
this one'll do <i>nicely.</i>

306
00:11:39,174 --> 00:11:41,175
Let her go.

307
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:45,924
You don't have to be afraid
of him anymore.

308
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,465
Stay with us as the
countdown to Doomsday continues

309
00:11:51,466 --> 00:11:53,532
with just six more hours to go.

310
00:11:53,652 --> 00:11:55,461
The only thing that's nice
about this is

311
00:11:55,462 --> 00:11:56,896
even though it's a Tuesday,

312
00:11:56,897 --> 00:11:58,864
it feels kinda like
it's a Friday.

313
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,449
Peter, where are
you going?

314
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,446
Last day on Earth,
last chance to do this.

315
00:12:03,447 --> 00:12:04,693
I'm gonna find
a black neighborhood

316
00:12:04,694 --> 00:12:05,629
and see what happens

317
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,997
if I yell
the you-know-what word.

318
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:13,231
They respected me
for saying it.

319
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:19,352
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
this is it,

320
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:20,399
our final minutes.

321
00:12:20,422 --> 00:12:22,266
Any moment now,
the Earth will be sucked

322
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,286
into the gaping maw
of the black hole.

323
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:26,222
We here at Channel Five would
like to leave you

324
00:12:26,223 --> 00:12:28,849
with some highlights of
mankind's brief existence,

325
00:12:28,969 --> 00:12:30,654
like the Battle of Hastings.

326
00:12:30,655 --> 00:12:33,529
Guys, if we win this,
we get Hastings!

327
00:12:33,538 --> 00:12:34,771
Yeah, let's do it!

328
00:12:34,772 --> 00:12:35,459
Let's go!

329
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,094
All right, Hastings!

330
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:38,803
The Ottoman Empire.

331
00:12:38,822 --> 00:12:40,263
Ah, I could get
used to this.

332
00:12:40,264 --> 00:12:41,200
You know what?

333
00:12:41,201 --> 00:12:43,599
This is what I want
our empire to be about.

334
00:12:43,885 --> 00:12:45,986
The first television broadcast.

335
00:12:59,108 --> 00:13:00,856
And with only
thirty seconds to go,

336
00:13:00,857 --> 00:13:02,324
we thank you
for choosing Channel Five

337
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:03,855
as your Armageddon network.

338
00:13:03,975 --> 00:13:05,442
Mom, where's Dad?!

339
00:13:05,474 --> 00:13:06,908
I don't know, Chris.

340
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,905
Sorry I'm late, guys.

341
00:13:07,906 --> 00:13:09,514
Peter, where
have you been?!

342
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:11,163
Look, you try scheduling
a haircut today.

343
00:13:11,276 --> 00:13:12,898
You know, you'd think
you'd wanna spend

344
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:14,692
your last day on Earth
with your family!

345
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:15,741
Hey, I'm here, aren't I?

346
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,578
With only seconds left!

347
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:18,912
Don't you love me?!

348
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:20,261
Of course I love you, Lois!

349
00:13:20,262 --> 00:13:22,263
You're the most important person
in the world to me!

350
00:13:22,946 --> 00:13:24,067
You promise?

351
00:13:24,068 --> 00:13:25,201
I promise!

352
00:13:26,814 --> 00:13:29,437
Ten, nine, eight...

353
00:13:29,557 --> 00:13:31,048
I just hate bein'
around the kids.

354
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:31,825
What?!

355
00:13:31,993 --> 00:13:33,490
...six, five,

356
00:13:33,491 --> 00:13:34,624
Sorry, I just thought
I'd be honest

357
00:13:34,926 --> 00:13:35,859
since we're gonna die.

358
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:38,919
...three, two, one.

359
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,747
April Fools!

360
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,103
What?!

361
00:13:42,104 --> 00:13:43,718
You gotta be kiddin' me!

362
00:13:43,724 --> 00:13:44,892
We're not gonna die?!

363
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,907
No, we're not gonna die!

364
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:52,940
Wait, what did
Dad just say?

365
00:13:56,276 --> 00:13:57,878
Yes, April Fools!

366
00:13:57,897 --> 00:13:59,416
We at Channel Five News
concocted

367
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,638
the whole black hole story
as part of our commitment

368
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:03,306
to being festive
around the holidays.

369
00:14:03,326 --> 00:14:06,009
And with only eighty-seven suicides
and widespread looting,

370
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,127
we think this was a pretty
successful practical joke.

371
00:14:09,565 --> 00:14:11,624
You dicks!

372
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,542
Hey, how do ya like
that, Lois?

373
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:14,556
We're gonna live!

374
00:14:14,557 --> 00:14:16,489
Peter, what did you mean
by what you said,

375
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,978
you hate bein'
around the kids?

376
00:14:18,986 --> 00:14:20,420
Yeah, Dad,
what did you mean?

377
00:14:20,421 --> 00:14:21,614
Don't you like us?

378
00:14:21,734 --> 00:14:22,782
Yeah, what gives?

379
00:14:22,794 --> 00:14:23,980
Well... Oh, come on.

380
00:14:23,981 --> 00:14:25,980
I... I didn't mean that.
I was just jokin' around.

381
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,353
Hey, gimme a big hug.

382
00:14:27,473 --> 00:14:29,707
How about a big hug for old Dad?

383
00:14:30,032 --> 00:14:31,466
Kids, why don't you
go upstairs

384
00:14:31,467 --> 00:14:33,101
so your father
and I can talk.

385
00:14:33,103 --> 00:14:35,107
Yeah, come on, Meg and Chris.

386
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:36,382
Let's get outta here.

387
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:40,577
Well, I'm off to serve food
at the soup kitchen.

388
00:14:40,578 --> 00:14:41,933
Now that I lived
through this,

389
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,365
I kinda have to keep

390
00:14:43,386 --> 00:14:44,323
a promise I made
to someone.

391
00:14:44,324 --> 00:14:45,191
It's God!

392
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,441
Peter, what did you mean?

393
00:14:47,442 --> 00:14:48,502
All right,
you want the truth?

394
00:14:48,503 --> 00:14:50,178
They bore the hell
outta me, Lois.

395
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,599
Bore the hell
outta you?!

396
00:14:51,622 --> 00:14:52,560
They're your kids!

397
00:14:52,561 --> 00:14:54,006
I know,
and I love 'em,

398
00:14:54,308 --> 00:14:56,489
but don't you just sometimes
wish they'd run away

399
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,358
or get kidnapped
and be made to work

400
00:14:58,363 --> 00:14:59,236
in a Temple of Doom?

401
00:15:03,854 --> 00:15:05,475
How can you
even say that?!

402
00:15:05,476 --> 00:15:07,074
Because, Lois.
Meg tells a story

403
00:15:07,099 --> 00:15:08,465
that makes you wanna blow
your brains out,

404
00:15:08,471 --> 00:15:09,722
Stewie just sits there

405
00:15:09,723 --> 00:15:11,971
and Chris is always leaving
his Russian mice around.

406
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:13,090
Get outta here!

407
00:15:13,091 --> 00:15:15,058
Okay, okay, you don't have to yell.

408
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,643
Let us go find
<i>das vaginya.</i>

409
00:15:17,644 --> 00:15:18,687
Listen to you!

410
00:15:18,704 --> 00:15:19,888
You don't know your own kids!

411
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:21,020
That's the problem!

412
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,696
It's not them, it's you!

413
00:15:22,697 --> 00:15:23,301
Me?!

414
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:24,487
Yes, you!

415
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:25,630
And you know what?

416
00:15:25,631 --> 00:15:28,069
You've hurt your kids worse
than any black hole could!

417
00:15:28,189 --> 00:15:29,569
Lois, you're overreacting.

418
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,222
This'll all blow over
by tomorrow.

419
00:15:35,616 --> 00:15:37,249
Morning, (bleep).

420
00:15:37,274 --> 00:15:38,235
Ha-ha, I'm just kiddin'!

421
00:15:38,236 --> 00:15:40,231
So what do we got,
pancakes? Cool!

422
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:42,165
Hey, what's on tap
for school today, kids?

423
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,356
- Shut up, Dad.
- Whatever.

424
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:45,708
So, Chris, how, uh,

425
00:15:45,723 --> 00:15:47,034
how are all your friends
at school?

426
00:15:47,035 --> 00:15:47,968
What do you care?

427
00:15:47,969 --> 00:15:49,888
You don't know
who my friends are.

428
00:15:49,904 --> 00:15:50,907
Sure, I do.

429
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,387
Um, Chandler...

430
00:15:53,836 --> 00:15:55,303
Fonzie...

431
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,066
and Remington Steele?

432
00:15:57,642 --> 00:15:59,512
You got lucky, Dad.

433
00:15:59,513 --> 00:16:01,822
So, Stewie, how's everything
goin' in Lego Land?

434
00:16:01,823 --> 00:16:03,131
Oh, pretty good.
I made a spaceship...

435
00:16:03,132 --> 00:16:05,066
Wait a minute.
I'm not talkin' to you.

436
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:07,286
Come on, guys. Let's go eat
in the living room.

437
00:16:07,313 --> 00:16:08,711
It stinks in here.

438
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:12,056
Oh, no, does it stink
'cause I farted?

439
00:16:12,057 --> 00:16:13,688
'Cause sometimes
I can suck 'em back up.

440
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:15,927
I think we can make up
some of these losses

441
00:16:15,928 --> 00:16:17,061
in the third quarter.

442
00:16:20,295 --> 00:16:20,918
What was that?

443
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:21,729
What was what?

444
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,930
Oh, nothing.

445
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,602
I thought I smelled a fart,
but now I don't.

446
00:16:25,849 --> 00:16:28,843
They, uh, they're really pissed
at me, aren't they?

447
00:16:28,844 --> 00:16:31,011
Oh, look who's
startin' to get it.

448
00:16:31,088 --> 00:16:33,356
Peter, they heard you say
you hate being around them.

449
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:34,644
They, they know
you have no interest

450
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:35,520
in getting to know them.

451
00:16:35,521 --> 00:16:37,145
I mean, how... how would you feel?

452
00:16:37,265 --> 00:16:39,566
Well, right now
I feel like a jerk.

453
00:16:39,575 --> 00:16:41,893
Peter, if you really
do care about your kids,

454
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:44,346
you're gonna have to earn back
their respect and affection.

455
00:16:44,358 --> 00:16:45,109
How do I do that?

456
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,664
You gotta spend
time with them

457
00:16:46,688 --> 00:16:49,065
and make their interests
your interests.

458
00:16:49,185 --> 00:16:51,187
I guess
you're right, Lois.

459
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:52,616
I'm always screwin' up.

460
00:16:52,617 --> 00:16:54,385
Like that time
with Jason Mraz.

461
00:16:55,488 --> 00:16:57,712
Oh, my God!
You're Jason Mraz!

462
00:16:57,733 --> 00:16:58,357
No, I'm not.

463
00:16:58,358 --> 00:16:59,667
I'm just some
guy with a hat.

464
00:16:59,668 --> 00:17:01,690
Yeah, that's who
Jason Mraz is!

465
00:17:06,347 --> 00:17:08,915
Hey, buddy.

466
00:17:09,901 --> 00:17:11,506
What's goin' on?

467
00:17:13,272 --> 00:17:14,707
You having your period?

468
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:15,517
What?!

469
00:17:15,518 --> 00:17:16,266
I'm just trying

470
00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:17,638
to take an interest
in your interests.

471
00:17:17,639 --> 00:17:18,906
My period's
not an interest.

472
00:17:19,386 --> 00:17:20,508
It's something
that happens to me

473
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:21,888
that I cannot control.

474
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:23,254
Gross.

475
00:17:23,255 --> 00:17:24,877
All right, I'm gonna
go talk to Chris.

476
00:17:27,115 --> 00:17:28,069
Hi, Chris.

477
00:17:28,092 --> 00:17:29,668
Hello... Peter.

478
00:17:29,684 --> 00:17:31,283
You know,
I was just thinkin',

479
00:17:31,305 --> 00:17:34,441
when I was your age, my Uncle
Roy shared a beer with me.

480
00:17:34,612 --> 00:17:37,166
I drank it, and I was so
excited, I fell asleep.

481
00:17:37,647 --> 00:17:39,467
I must have tossed
and turned somethin' fierce,

482
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,514
'cause when I woke up,
my pants were off.

483
00:17:41,664 --> 00:17:43,765
Never saw much of
Uncle Roy after that.

484
00:17:43,787 --> 00:17:45,388
Turns out we weren't
even related.

485
00:17:45,906 --> 00:17:47,904
Anyway, I thought him sharing
that beer with me was

486
00:17:47,905 --> 00:17:49,573
the coolest thing ever.

487
00:17:49,837 --> 00:17:51,584
And I know nowadays
things are different...

488
00:17:51,585 --> 00:17:52,919
so I got some crystal meth.

489
00:17:53,021 --> 00:17:55,374
I figured we could do it
together as father and son.

490
00:17:55,391 --> 00:17:56,525
I don't know about that.

491
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:58,144
Tell you what,
I'll get us started.

492
00:18:00,572 --> 00:18:04,314
Ah... That feels...
that feels better.

493
00:18:04,315 --> 00:18:06,047
You sure
that stuff is okay?

494
00:18:06,063 --> 00:18:08,498
All I know is the guys
who made it are dead.

495
00:18:08,872 --> 00:18:11,473
Why is there no hole
in this wall?

496
00:18:11,593 --> 00:18:13,487
You know, this thing
is buggin' me.

497
00:18:14,985 --> 00:18:16,816
All right, I'm gonna
take a hike.

498
00:18:20,603 --> 00:18:23,205
So you gonna introduce me
to your pals?

499
00:18:23,222 --> 00:18:24,344
That's Trapjaw.

500
00:18:24,345 --> 00:18:25,515
That's Optimus Prime.

501
00:18:25,531 --> 00:18:26,630
That's Destro.

502
00:18:26,654 --> 00:18:28,020
And that's a Care Bear.

503
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:29,524
You havin' a tea party?

504
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,593
No, we're working out
a land deal.

505
00:18:31,648 --> 00:18:33,332
Trapjaw is trying
to get a variance

506
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,319
to build an unpermitted
structure within ten feet

507
00:18:35,328 --> 00:18:37,115
of Optimus Prime's
property line.

508
00:18:37,138 --> 00:18:39,487
Destro is the City Councilman
who's telling Trapjaw

509
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,504
that he has to file it
as an accessory structure,

510
00:18:41,505 --> 00:18:44,190
and even then it can only be
built at the rear of the lot.

511
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:46,372
And the Care Bear is
just a Care Bear.

512
00:18:46,373 --> 00:18:48,608
I am so (bleep) ready!

513
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,303
I don't know, Lois,
I tried my best.

514
00:18:55,423 --> 00:18:57,730
I don't know what else
I possibly could have done.

515
00:18:57,731 --> 00:18:59,601
Peter, you're just gonna
have to do better.

516
00:18:59,602 --> 00:19:01,402
Somehow you've gotta
let those kids know

517
00:19:01,411 --> 00:19:02,959
that they matter to you.

518
00:19:02,973 --> 00:19:04,638
I'll try, Lois.

519
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:09,896
Kids, come in here!

520
00:19:09,897 --> 00:19:11,597
Your father's got
somethin' to say!

521
00:19:15,576 --> 00:19:17,387
Look, I know you
kids ain't too happy

522
00:19:17,388 --> 00:19:18,447
with your dad right now,

523
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:21,479
but I hope at least you could
see that I'm tryin'.

524
00:19:21,941 --> 00:19:25,039
I mean, I know sometimes we
don't get along with each other.

525
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,496
Hell, if we weren't all related,

526
00:19:26,497 --> 00:19:28,306
this would be like the worst
table at the wedding.

527
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:30,493
But we're...
we're part of a family.

528
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,672
And I'm still your father.

529
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:34,545
And I promise I love you.

530
00:19:34,546 --> 00:19:38,105
Well, then how come you said
you hated spending time with us?

531
00:19:38,106 --> 00:19:40,540
Look, I may not have said
exactly what I meant.

532
00:19:40,598 --> 00:19:42,846
But I... I can still be your dad

533
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:45,114
even if we don't have any
of the same interests.

534
00:19:45,154 --> 00:19:48,012
So what do you say,
are we a family again?

535
00:19:49,336 --> 00:19:50,019
I don't buy it.

536
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,706
Me neither.

537
00:19:50,707 --> 00:19:51,891
When you jumped
through my ceiling,

538
00:19:51,892 --> 00:19:53,146
you let an owl in.

539
00:19:53,266 --> 00:19:54,451
I know they're supposed
to be wise,

540
00:19:54,452 --> 00:19:55,699
but all it did was shriek

541
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,646
and poop out
half-digested mice.

542
00:19:57,766 --> 00:19:59,304
Well, then, I guess
there's only one thing

543
00:19:59,321 --> 00:20:01,221
I can do to regain your love.

544
00:20:01,939 --> 00:20:03,687
Who wants a brand new Xbox?

545
00:20:03,688 --> 00:20:05,789
- Yay!
- Oh, Daddy!

546
00:20:05,811 --> 00:20:08,480
Oh, my God,
you're the best father ever!

547
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,918
Well, I guess if you can't earn
your kids' respect,

548
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:16,215
you can always buy it.

549
00:20:20,161 --> 00:20:22,729
There's some awesome stuff
in the garbage.

550
00:20:29,393 --> 00:20:32,031
Dad, can we please have
a turn at the Xbox?

551
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:34,034
Just a second, Meg. I'm still
trying to get the hang of this.

552
00:20:34,154 --> 00:20:35,549
Okay, guys, tell me again,

553
00:20:35,563 --> 00:20:37,730
uh, now, which one
do I press to shoot now?

554
00:20:38,122 --> 00:20:40,056
Damn it! Ah, crap.

555
00:20:40,057 --> 00:20:41,970
Who's the douchebag
who keeps dyin'?

556
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:44,212
I'm not a douchebag.
I'm new.

557
00:20:44,237 --> 00:20:45,359
Look, if you're no good,

558
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,982
why don't you just go
hide till the end?

559
00:20:46,983 --> 00:20:48,784
All right, I'll go
crouch behind the, uh...

560
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,201
Is this
a crouch button?

561
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,659
Ah! Who dropped
a grenade?!

562
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,971
- Idiot!
- Learn how to play!

563
00:20:53,972 --> 00:20:55,740
- Moron!
- You suck!
