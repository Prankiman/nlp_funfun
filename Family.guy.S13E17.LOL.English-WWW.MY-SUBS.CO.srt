And that is why chest hair

13
00:00:37,585 --> 00:00:41,450
is on its way... back.

14
00:00:41,492 --> 00:00:42,722
Hey, guys.
I got something for you,

15
00:00:42,756 --> 00:00:45,123
an invitation for each
of you to Quagfest.

16
00:00:45,157 --> 00:00:47,325
- Quagfest?
- What's that?

17
00:00:47,367 --> 00:00:48,998
"You and a guest
are cordially invited

18
00:00:49,032 --> 00:00:52,201
"to witness Glenn Quagmire's
1,000th sexual conquest

19
00:00:52,242 --> 00:00:55,272
"at Quagfest,
a three-day festival celebrating

20
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:57,440
the three F's:
food, fun, and..."

21
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,439
Oh, my.

22
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:01,647
Yeah, they almost wouldn't print
that at Kinko's.

23
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:03,310
Damn! 1,000 women?

24
00:01:03,344 --> 00:01:05,582
Well, 1,000
sexual conquests.

25
00:01:05,616 --> 00:01:07,581
(chuckles)
No further questions.

26
00:01:07,615 --> 00:01:09,254
Sounds like fun, Glenn!

27
00:01:09,287 --> 00:01:10,751
Yeah, I'm closing down
the whole street.

28
00:01:10,793 --> 00:01:12,088
It's gonna be
like a block party

29
00:01:12,122 --> 00:01:14,927
but with way more weirdos
grinding up against your wives.

30
00:01:14,961 --> 00:01:16,358
That sounds awesome!

31
00:01:16,392 --> 00:01:18,437
There hasn't been that kind
of excitement on our street

32
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:21,013
since we had that big Dumpster
in our front yard.

33
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:23,290
Can someone take out
the garbage?

34
00:01:23,324 --> 00:01:24,954
I will!

35
00:01:24,988 --> 00:01:27,690
(ascending stairs)

36
00:01:27,724 --> 00:01:29,691
PETER:
Yeah!

37
00:01:29,725 --> 00:01:32,027
Yeah! Smash! Boom!

38
00:01:32,061 --> 00:01:33,365
Someone stop him.

39
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:36,038
Last time, he threw out
our whole bedroom.

40
00:01:36,072 --> 00:01:38,376
STEWIE:
I'm still in here!

41
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:39,913
Oh, big Dumpster--
that-that reminds me,

42
00:01:39,947 --> 00:01:42,515
Ice-T's wife is also coming
to Quagfest.

43
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:43,980
And in local news,

44
00:01:44,022 --> 00:01:46,117
Hollywood comes to Quahog,
almost,

45
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,526
as three hours from here
in Waterbury, Connecticut,

46
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,528
Liam Neeson has begun shooting
his latest film.

47
00:01:51,562 --> 00:01:54,464
His new project is reportedly
an historical epic,

48
00:01:54,498 --> 00:01:56,064
in which Mr. Neeson stars

49
00:01:56,098 --> 00:01:58,601
as a vengeance-crazed
Albert Einstein.

50
00:01:58,635 --> 00:02:01,076
Channel Five News
has this exclusive first look

51
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,249
that I taped off my VCR
from<i> Entertainment Tonight.</i>

52
00:02:04,283 --> 00:02:06,587
All right,
I'll give you the formula.

53
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:10,261
My foot equals
your balls squared.

54
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:14,398
Pfft. Liam Neeson. What a fraud.

55
00:02:14,432 --> 00:02:16,536
Oh, come on, Peter.
Not this again.

56
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,578
What? He's a fake tough guy.
I could totally kick his ass.

57
00:02:19,612 --> 00:02:20,842
Knock it off.
We've had to hear

58
00:02:20,876 --> 00:02:22,579
this same speech
a million times.

59
00:02:22,613 --> 00:02:24,714
Yeah, every time you get
a couple of beers in you,

60
00:02:24,748 --> 00:02:27,314
we have to hear all about
how you can beat up Liam Neeson.

61
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:29,187
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

62
00:02:29,221 --> 00:02:32,492
What about that time we
snuck beers into the opera?

63
00:02:32,526 --> 00:02:34,524
(singing)

64
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:48,410
(continues singing)

65
00:02:55,191 --> 00:02:57,189
(crescendoes)

66
00:02:59,191 --> 00:03:01,997
PETER (slurred): I could
totally beat up Liam Neeson.

67
00:03:02,031 --> 00:03:04,030
(resumes singing)

68
00:03:12,682 --> 00:03:14,480
Hey, you know this old woman
who lived in a shoe,

69
00:03:14,514 --> 00:03:16,744
she had so many children,
she didn't know what to do?

70
00:03:16,786 --> 00:03:18,080
I got something
she could do.

71
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,752
Get your tubes tied,
you kook!

72
00:03:19,787 --> 00:03:21,585
Hey, how you doing
on that chocolate milk?

73
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:22,921
You need
a little freshen-up?

74
00:03:22,955 --> 00:03:25,193
There's
my little sweetie.

75
00:03:25,227 --> 00:03:26,690
Are you ready
to go home, Stewie?

76
00:03:26,724 --> 00:03:28,501
Oh, Lois,
I'm glad you're here.

77
00:03:28,535 --> 00:03:30,903
I noticed that you're one
of the moms who hasn't yet

78
00:03:30,937 --> 00:03:32,569
signed up to be
a classroom volunteer.

79
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,580
Oh, I-I just assumed after
that incident in the parking lot

80
00:03:35,614 --> 00:03:38,118
with that bitch in the Lexus,
you wouldn't want me to.

81
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:41,424
But, yeah, I'd be happy
to help out in the class.

82
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,689
What? I don't want you here.
This is my turf.

83
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,026
I don't bother you when you're
sitting on the washing machine,

84
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,194
screaming Aaron Eckhart's name.

85
00:03:48,236 --> 00:03:50,868
Great! We'd love to have you
start tomorrow, if you're free.

86
00:03:50,902 --> 00:03:53,404
Sure, let me just
check my schedule.

87
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:57,609
Hmm, I guess I could
just get the mail at night.

88
00:03:57,643 --> 00:03:59,641
(indistinct chatter,
music playing)

89
00:04:03,485 --> 00:04:06,989
Wow, Quagfest is a bigger deal
than I thought.

90
00:04:07,023 --> 00:04:08,790
Oh, look, here's a simulation

91
00:04:08,824 --> 00:04:11,893
of what it's like to have sex
with Quagmire.

92
00:04:15,326 --> 00:04:16,892
Hi.

93
00:04:16,926 --> 00:04:18,595
(sips)

94
00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:22,669
Bye!

95
00:04:24,335 --> 00:04:26,341
(marching band playing)

96
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:30,478
All right, kids,
now pay attention, all right?

97
00:04:30,512 --> 00:04:33,615
These are all of Quagmire's
women organized by country.

98
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,647
There's Brazil.

99
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:38,424
There's Italy.

100
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,424
And there's Thailand. Wow.

101
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:44,056
Wow, they're young.
We should go.

102
00:04:44,098 --> 00:04:46,727
I'd like to thank you all
for coming to Quagfest.

103
00:04:46,761 --> 00:04:49,262
Now, no celebration
of my 1,000th would be complete

104
00:04:49,296 --> 00:04:50,933
without first meeting
number one.

105
00:04:50,968 --> 00:04:54,069
Here she is, all the way from
Weathersfield Elementary School,

106
00:04:54,103 --> 00:04:56,101
Miss Eleanor!
(applause)

107
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:05,144
Do I still get
a piece of candy after?

108
00:05:05,186 --> 00:05:06,416
(laughter)

109
00:05:08,122 --> 00:05:09,751
Nice lady.

110
00:05:09,785 --> 00:05:11,422
All right, we've met number one.

111
00:05:11,457 --> 00:05:14,087
Now let's meet number 1,000!

112
00:05:14,121 --> 00:05:16,128
(dramatic rock music playing)

113
00:05:22,058 --> 00:05:26,023
Ladies and gentlemen,
my 1,000th sexual conquest is...

114
00:05:26,065 --> 00:05:28,063
this largemouth bass!

115
00:05:29,065 --> 00:05:30,695
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

116
00:05:30,737 --> 00:05:32,502
I'm weird.

117
00:05:32,536 --> 00:05:34,502
I thought I was here
to watch normal intercourse

118
00:05:34,536 --> 00:05:36,165
on a residential street.

119
00:05:36,207 --> 00:05:38,373
Children, we're leaving!

120
00:05:44,646 --> 00:05:45,876
Oh, this'll be so fun

121
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,876
volunteering in
your class, Stewie.

122
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:49,547
Eat my button,
you whore.

123
00:05:49,581 --> 00:05:51,548
Oh, Lois, I'm so
glad you're here.

124
00:05:51,582 --> 00:05:53,420
I got to run out
to the parking lot.

125
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:55,420
I'm buying cigarettes
from some guy on Craigslist.

126
00:05:55,454 --> 00:05:57,819
Go ahead.
I'll handle the kids.

127
00:05:57,853 --> 00:05:59,824
(crying)

128
00:05:59,858 --> 00:06:02,153
Oh, Landon,
what's the matter?

129
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,191
Aw, did you spill juice
on yourself, sweetheart?

130
00:06:05,225 --> 00:06:07,527
"Sweetheart"? Slow your roll
there,<i> Cougar Town.</i>

131
00:06:07,561 --> 00:06:10,262
Well, let's get you cleaned up.
And you know what?

132
00:06:10,296 --> 00:06:12,998
For today,
you can be my little helper.

133
00:06:13,032 --> 00:06:15,870
What the hell?! If anyone should
be her helper, it should be me.

134
00:06:15,904 --> 00:06:18,071
She's my mother.
We're supposed to be a team.

135
00:06:18,105 --> 00:06:20,639
Like the Lone Ranger and Tonto.

136
00:06:20,673 --> 00:06:22,776
Well, Tonto, the bad guys
are going to jail.

137
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,049
Looks like this little town
is safe again.

138
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,650
Yes, Kemosabe.

139
00:06:26,684 --> 00:06:27,915
So, uh, what do you say?

140
00:06:27,956 --> 00:06:29,921
Want to grab a drink,
maybe dinner?

141
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,954
Sorry. Me no like to
hang with work people.

142
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,130
Well, I got to hand
it to you, Quagmire.

143
00:06:41,163 --> 00:06:43,130
That Quagfest
was some party.

144
00:06:43,171 --> 00:06:45,864
Yeah, except I got molested
in the House of Mirrors

145
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,870
by either one man
or 100 identical men.

146
00:06:48,904 --> 00:06:51,270
Could've used a
heads-up on that one.

147
00:06:51,304 --> 00:06:54,270
Yeah, I'll tell you who might
want a heads-up: Liam Neeson.

148
00:06:54,312 --> 00:06:55,877
Oh, for God's sake!

149
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:58,277
'Cause someday,
I'm gonna kick his ass.

150
00:06:58,311 --> 00:06:59,446
Damn it, Peter,
I'm sick of this!

151
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,182
- I've had it!
- Me, too.

152
00:07:01,216 --> 00:07:03,350
I mean, we just had a
great day of fun and rides

153
00:07:03,384 --> 00:07:04,981
and finger-sniffing,
and all you can talk about

154
00:07:05,016 --> 00:07:06,717
is fighting some guy
you've never even met!

155
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,588
Yeah, he's lucky
we've never met.

156
00:07:08,622 --> 00:07:10,524
I'd knock his teeth
down his throat

157
00:07:10,558 --> 00:07:12,523
and out his stupid
Irish fudge knot.

158
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:14,187
You know what?
You're full of it.

159
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:15,996
If you were ever face-to-face
with Liam Neeson,

160
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,060
you'd crap your pants.

161
00:07:17,094 --> 00:07:18,195
No, I wouldn't.

162
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,531
Well, fine.
Let's prove it.

163
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:21,468
Put up or shut up.
Right now.

164
00:07:21,502 --> 00:07:23,268
What? What are
you talking about?

165
00:07:23,302 --> 00:07:25,465
Well, we know where
Liam Neeson is.

166
00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:28,071
That's right! He's shooting
a movie in Connecticut!

167
00:07:28,105 --> 00:07:30,269
We could be there
in three hours.

168
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,604
All right, great.

169
00:07:31,638 --> 00:07:34,098
Liam Neeson has three more hours
to live.

170
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,433
Let's do this.

171
00:07:35,467 --> 00:07:36,504
- All right!
- Yeah!

172
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:38,967
I've never been
to Connecticut!

173
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:40,376
Hang on, fellas.

174
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,975
I actually have been
to Connecticut one time.

175
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:45,446
To meet Loretta
at a McDonald's parking lot

176
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,774
to pick up my son,
Cleveland, Jr.

177
00:07:47,816 --> 00:07:50,646
I cried in my sedan,
in front of my boy.

178
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,782
It was sad.
That's why I fibbed on it.

179
00:07:53,816 --> 00:07:55,990
I'm sorry.
Can we do a happy yell again

180
00:07:56,024 --> 00:07:58,190
to get the taste out
of my mouth? All right!

181
00:07:58,225 --> 00:08:00,254
- Yeah! Yeah!
- I've been to Connecticut!

182
00:08:07,262 --> 00:08:08,564
All right, Peter,
Liam Neeson must be

183
00:08:08,598 --> 00:08:10,037
on the other side
of that barrier.

184
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:12,940
We just got to get you on that
set, so you can kick his ass.

185
00:08:12,974 --> 00:08:16,371
We're so close, I can
almost taste his ass.

186
00:08:16,405 --> 00:08:17,970
Can I help you?

187
00:08:18,004 --> 00:08:19,978
Hello, sir.
We're here to see Liam Neeson,

188
00:08:20,012 --> 00:08:22,642
the guy who wears the same
long jacket in all his movies.

189
00:08:22,676 --> 00:08:24,778
Sorry, this is
a closed set.

190
00:08:24,812 --> 00:08:27,179
Peter, you're never gonna
get close enough to Liam Neeson

191
00:08:27,221 --> 00:08:28,787
to throw a punch
at the guy.

192
00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:31,323
That's why I got to lure
him out here to come to me.

193
00:08:31,357 --> 00:08:33,259
Remember, Liam
Neeson's Irish.

194
00:08:33,293 --> 00:08:35,595
That's why I'm dressing
up as the one woman

195
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:39,828
no Irishman can resist:
Mrs. Potato Head.

196
00:08:39,862 --> 00:08:42,163
PETER (high-pitched):
Ooh, Mrs. Potato Head here!

197
00:08:42,197 --> 00:08:45,772
Any Irish actors around
who might be interested in me?

198
00:08:45,806 --> 00:08:47,437
You're damn right, darlin'.

199
00:08:47,471 --> 00:08:49,572
Colin Farrell?
What are you doing here?

200
00:08:49,606 --> 00:08:51,043
Shoo! Shoo! Get away!

201
00:08:51,077 --> 00:08:53,948
Oh-ho, you're
a feisty potato.

202
00:08:56,182 --> 00:08:59,182
(normal voice): The back is all
mashed potatoes now.

203
00:09:01,058 --> 00:09:03,563
Okay, guys, there's no better
way to draw out an Irishman

204
00:09:03,597 --> 00:09:06,029
than setting up
a confession booth.

205
00:09:11,244 --> 00:09:13,244
LIAM NEESON: Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

206
00:09:13,246 --> 00:09:15,885
It has been one day
since my last confession.

207
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:17,222
Go on, my son.

208
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,888
I killed
200 wolves.

209
00:09:18,921 --> 00:09:21,024
After the movie,
I got the taste for it.

210
00:09:21,058 --> 00:09:22,425
Did you kill them quickly?

211
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:24,362
No. Wolves
must be tortured.

212
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:26,836
The best way to kill wolves
is to kill their leader,

213
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,771
wear his skin, kiss some of
the wolves, then kill them.

214
00:09:30,805 --> 00:09:33,372
I also steal small
items from 7-Eleven.

215
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,444
SweeTarts, Jolly
Ranchers, and the like.

216
00:09:35,478 --> 00:09:36,981
Sometimes
a lighter.

217
00:09:37,015 --> 00:09:38,581
I don't
even smoke.

218
00:09:38,615 --> 00:09:40,918
Sometimes I roll up
those tattoo magazines,

219
00:09:40,952 --> 00:09:42,519
stuff 'em
up my sleeve.

220
00:09:42,553 --> 00:09:45,191
If I get caught, I just
tell the man I forgot.

221
00:09:45,225 --> 00:09:47,863
Then, of course, it's
back to murdering wolves.

222
00:09:47,897 --> 00:09:50,328
All right.
Uh, that'll be, uh...

223
00:09:50,362 --> 00:09:52,064
three Hail Marys.

224
00:09:52,098 --> 00:09:53,536
Tough but fair.

225
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,873
Thank you, Father.

226
00:09:56,907 --> 00:09:58,273
Uh, hey, not so fast!

227
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:00,775
Excuse me, sir. We were sent
here by the production.

228
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,839
Are you the guy who's been
looking for Liam Neeson?

229
00:10:02,873 --> 00:10:05,247
I am.
Do you mind if we ask what for?

230
00:10:05,281 --> 00:10:07,376
Yeah, I was hopin'
to inflict violence upon him.

231
00:10:07,417 --> 00:10:09,511
All right,
you're coming with us.

232
00:10:09,553 --> 00:10:10,847
Don't worry, Peter!

233
00:10:10,881 --> 00:10:13,718
We'll raise your bail money
as soon as we can!

234
00:10:14,753 --> 00:10:16,391
Uh, excuse me, sir.

235
00:10:16,425 --> 00:10:17,855
My phone's not working.

236
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:21,191
Do you mind if I follow
you home and use yours?

237
00:10:24,433 --> 00:10:26,737
All right, kids,

238
00:10:26,771 --> 00:10:28,740
Miss Tammy's in her car
yelling at her boyfriend

239
00:10:28,774 --> 00:10:32,541
on the phone again, so it
looks like I'm doing lunch.

240
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,418
Okay, Landon,
time to sabotage you

241
00:10:37,452 --> 00:10:40,490
with the most dangerous thing
in the world for a toddler:

242
00:10:40,524 --> 00:10:42,923
a whole, uncut grape.

243
00:10:45,302 --> 00:10:47,435
God, look how fat
kids are getting.

244
00:10:47,469 --> 00:10:49,299
Oh, Landon, no!

245
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,203
Uh-uh, you could
choke on that!

246
00:10:51,237 --> 00:10:53,770
Did your mommy forget to
slice your grapes for you?

247
00:10:53,804 --> 00:10:55,443
Here, let me help.

248
00:10:55,477 --> 00:10:57,643
Ugh, there's nothing
to cut these with.

249
00:11:01,352 --> 00:11:03,086
Oh, that's it, Landon!

250
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,822
If you're gonna
seduce my mother,

251
00:11:04,856 --> 00:11:06,887
then I shall seduce yours.

252
00:11:06,921 --> 00:11:10,424
I'll be as irresistible to her
as wood is to a woodchuck.

253
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:13,193
Mom, Dad, I've done
a lot of thinking,

254
00:11:13,235 --> 00:11:16,101
and I've decided I don't want
to go into the family business.

255
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,910
I want to be
a doctor.

256
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:20,247
Hmm. Let's try that on
for size.

257
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:23,880
How much disease could
a woodchuck doctor cure

258
00:11:23,914 --> 00:11:26,783
if a woodchuck doctor
could cure disease?

259
00:11:26,817 --> 00:11:28,614
Is that sounding right to you?

260
00:11:28,656 --> 00:11:30,421
No.

261
00:11:30,455 --> 00:11:32,253
- Hey, Jimmy?
- Yeah, Dad?

262
00:11:32,287 --> 00:11:34,188
Next time, if you have an idea,

263
00:11:34,222 --> 00:11:37,555
run it through the test
before you embarrass yourself.

264
00:11:41,165 --> 00:11:43,964
(door creaks open,
footsteps approach)

265
00:11:43,998 --> 00:11:45,196
Wake up, Griffin.

266
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:47,533
Your bail's been posted.

267
00:11:47,575 --> 00:11:49,372
What time is it?

268
00:11:51,638 --> 00:11:53,740
<i>I</i> did.

269
00:11:53,774 --> 00:11:56,812
Oh, sorry. I thought you were
gonna ask something else.

270
00:11:56,846 --> 00:11:59,646
Liam Neeson?!
<i>You</i> posted my bail?!

271
00:11:59,687 --> 00:12:01,950
That's right. I hear
you've been all over town

272
00:12:01,984 --> 00:12:04,189
saying you could kick my arse.

273
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,756
Well, there's no time
like the present.

274
00:12:10,726 --> 00:12:14,595
Go ahead, take...
your best... shot.

275
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:16,163
Oh, no, no, no,
Mr. Neeson,

276
00:12:16,197 --> 00:12:17,427
you heard wrong.

277
00:12:17,469 --> 00:12:19,803
There's nobody who
respects you more than I do.

278
00:12:19,837 --> 00:12:22,602
May I offer you the most
sincere, honest apology I...?

279
00:12:22,636 --> 00:12:24,035
Ha, ha!

280
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:25,675
Ow! Ah, damn it!

281
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:28,275
My hands are stinging
from the vibrations!

282
00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:29,675
My turn.

283
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:30,907
Aah!

284
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:32,979
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Will Liam Neeson punch Peter?</i>

285
00:12:33,013 --> 00:12:35,650
<i>Will Stewie stop being jealous</i>
<i>of his mom or something?</i>

286
00:12:35,685 --> 00:12:38,417
<i>Stay tuned for the thrilling</i>
<i>conclusion of this story,</i>

287
00:12:38,452 --> 00:12:41,289
<i>and the just-regular conclusion</i>
<i>of the other story.</i>

288
00:12:46,863 --> 00:12:48,564
Oh, please don't hurt me!

289
00:12:48,598 --> 00:12:51,500
I was just trying to seem
tough in front of my friends!

290
00:12:51,535 --> 00:12:53,229
Well, you're in trouble
now, lad.

291
00:12:53,271 --> 00:12:56,300
I've been a world-famous
tough guy since I was 55.

292
00:12:56,334 --> 00:12:57,614
Please, please,
I'll do anything!

293
00:12:57,637 --> 00:12:59,570
Anything you want,
just don't kill me!

294
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:01,305
What could you possibly
do for me?

295
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:02,966
I'll-I'll-I'll
shine your shoes,

296
00:13:03,008 --> 00:13:04,301
or scrub your toilets!

297
00:13:04,335 --> 00:13:05,668
Or coil your penis!

298
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:06,836
The Internet tells
me that's something

299
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,476
you might have
a need for.

300
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:11,845
Hmm... well, that could save me
some time in the morning.

301
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:14,508
Whatever it takes for
you to not beat me up.

302
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,843
All right, it's a deal.

303
00:13:15,877 --> 00:13:17,683
You can help me
with some chores.

304
00:13:17,717 --> 00:13:20,219
But one slip-up,
and you'll be deader

305
00:13:20,253 --> 00:13:23,355
than the first man to die
in the Battle of the Boyne.

306
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:24,587
(men shouting, weapon firing)

307
00:13:24,621 --> 00:13:25,755
(groans)

308
00:13:25,789 --> 00:13:27,122
(gagging)

309
00:13:27,156 --> 00:13:29,154
(weaponry firing in distance)

310
00:13:33,735 --> 00:13:37,208
Normally when we do those,
there's-there's, like, a joke.

311
00:13:37,242 --> 00:13:39,675
I'm not your clown.

312
00:13:47,088 --> 00:13:49,494
All right, Landon,
let's see how<i> you</i> like it

313
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,591
when someone moves in
on your territory.

314
00:13:51,632 --> 00:13:56,000
Let's just say your mom's about
to see a diaper rashy scrotum.

315
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:00,507
Wow, I didn't know Landon
had a younger sister.

316
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:03,243
Oh, hi. Aren't you a cutie.

317
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:05,244
Oh my God,
this is gonna happen.

318
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:07,452
Okay, go run along
with your teacher.

319
00:14:07,486 --> 00:14:09,020
Time for me to go.

320
00:14:09,054 --> 00:14:10,653
W-Wait, wait,
don't leave!

321
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,885
Ow! My knee!

322
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:14,052
(crying)

323
00:14:14,094 --> 00:14:16,461
Oh, sweetie,
did you get a boo-boo?

324
00:14:16,495 --> 00:14:18,494
Here, let me kiss it
and make it better.

325
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:22,504
Okay, that's
more like it.

326
00:14:24,202 --> 00:14:28,672
Oh, I certainly hope no one sees
Landon's mom bobbing for Stew.

327
00:14:30,546 --> 00:14:32,679
Yeah, get in there.

328
00:14:32,713 --> 00:14:34,143
Damn it, she's
not watching.

329
00:14:34,177 --> 00:14:35,511
You keep going, though.

330
00:14:35,545 --> 00:14:37,950
Don't forget about the
underneath part of my knee.

331
00:14:41,985 --> 00:14:44,391
Okay, Peter, I've got
a list of chores here.

332
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,559
Um, first, I've been summoned
to be a potential juror,

333
00:14:47,593 --> 00:14:49,223
but I don't want to go,

334
00:14:49,265 --> 00:14:51,358
so I need you to report
in my name.

335
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,597
Prospective juror number 17,
the defendant is a kraken.

336
00:14:54,631 --> 00:14:57,367
Would you have any problem
convicting a kraken?

337
00:14:57,401 --> 00:15:00,736
Um, I would try to be fair,
but, uh, I am on record,

338
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:03,439
you know, very famously,
as having released a kraken.

339
00:15:03,473 --> 00:15:06,646
Your Honor, we'd like to thank
and excuse juror number 17.

340
00:15:07,944 --> 00:15:09,310
Hey, man, thanks.

341
00:15:09,344 --> 00:15:10,919
Yeah, good luck, man.

342
00:15:13,017 --> 00:15:15,583
Okay, I have another
important job for you.

343
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:17,623
I want you to take
over my Twitter feed

344
00:15:17,657 --> 00:15:19,927
and tweet back
to my fans.

345
00:15:22,865 --> 00:15:24,263
(typing)

346
00:15:27,634 --> 00:15:29,504
See? Like that.

347
00:15:29,538 --> 00:15:32,304
You get the gist of
what my Twitter is about.

348
00:15:34,305 --> 00:15:36,744
Peter, I was
at an outdoor mall today,

349
00:15:36,778 --> 00:15:39,882
and there was a kiosk selling
little remote control cars.

350
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,882
One of them drove
right up to me.

351
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,282
(laughs)

352
00:15:43,316 --> 00:15:46,756
It was very funny and enjoyable,
so what I need you to do is

353
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:50,028
to go to a local gym and ask men
to pee in your hands.

354
00:15:50,062 --> 00:15:52,763
I-I don't see the
connection there.

355
00:15:52,797 --> 00:15:54,698
Do I need
to repeat myself?

356
00:15:54,732 --> 00:15:56,562
The car came
right up to me.

357
00:15:56,595 --> 00:16:00,099
It... it did spins
and had flashing lights.

358
00:16:00,141 --> 00:16:01,837
I enjoyed it.

359
00:16:01,871 --> 00:16:04,245
Go to the gym,
kneel down in the shower,

360
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:07,445
and ask strange men
to pee in your cupped hands.

361
00:16:07,479 --> 00:16:09,118
(sighs)

362
00:16:09,152 --> 00:16:10,551
(water running)

363
00:16:10,585 --> 00:16:12,655
Hey, man, did Liam
Neeson send you?

364
00:16:12,689 --> 00:16:14,287
(chuckles)

365
00:16:14,321 --> 00:16:16,886
Yeah, he loves
them little cars.

366
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,535
All right, guys, how are
we doing on Peter's bail money?

367
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:27,431
I got my whole family
praying on it.

368
00:16:27,473 --> 00:16:28,671
Well, that's
very helpful.

369
00:16:28,705 --> 00:16:30,103
How about you, Joe?

370
00:16:30,138 --> 00:16:32,704
Oh, Bonnie won't let me
spend any more money on Peter

371
00:16:32,745 --> 00:16:34,712
because he's not
very nice to me.

372
00:16:34,746 --> 00:16:36,176
- Hey, guys.
- What the hell?!

373
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,177
You're out of jail!
How'd you get out?

374
00:16:38,219 --> 00:16:40,311
With my smooth
talki... ta...

375
00:16:40,345 --> 00:16:42,517
My... I used...
I... My... word...

376
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:44,582
My... I words...
I used words.

377
00:16:44,616 --> 00:16:46,055
Wow. Glad you're back.

378
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:47,551
So, you ready to admit

379
00:16:47,593 --> 00:16:49,792
you're never gonna kick
Liam Neeson's ass?

380
00:16:49,826 --> 00:16:52,927
It just so happens,
Joe, that I already did.

381
00:16:52,961 --> 00:16:54,231
You<i> what?!</i>

382
00:16:54,265 --> 00:16:55,631
If you beat up
Liam Neeson,

383
00:16:55,665 --> 00:16:57,263
how come it wasn't
in the papers?

384
00:16:57,297 --> 00:16:58,903
Oh, you know, he's a big star.

385
00:16:58,937 --> 00:17:00,535
He had the whole thing
covered up.

386
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:02,702
Everybody knows Irish Catholics
control the media.

387
00:17:02,736 --> 00:17:04,903
(phone buzzing)

388
00:17:08,313 --> 00:17:10,373
Oop, uh, oh, Chris
was shot at school.

389
00:17:10,407 --> 00:17:13,213
(chuckles) If it's not
one thing, it's another.

390
00:17:17,214 --> 00:17:19,050
You know what?
I-I've thought about it.

391
00:17:19,084 --> 00:17:20,482
Do what you want
with Landon.

392
00:17:20,516 --> 00:17:22,818
Just don't do it
in front of me, all right?

393
00:17:22,852 --> 00:17:24,187
Oh, hi, Landon.

394
00:17:24,221 --> 00:17:25,893
How are you today, cutie?

395
00:17:25,927 --> 00:17:28,127
Aah! What did I
just tell you?!

396
00:17:28,161 --> 00:17:29,894
I hate this! I hate you!

397
00:17:29,928 --> 00:17:31,165
I hate everything!

398
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:33,595
(sobbing)

399
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,532
Oh, Stewie, you're upset.

400
00:17:35,566 --> 00:17:37,866
Are... are you jealous?

401
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,137
Yes! You've destroyed us!

402
00:17:40,171 --> 00:17:42,136
Were you at least safe?

403
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,440
Oh, don't worry, sweetie.

404
00:17:44,474 --> 00:17:46,671
You'll always be
my favorite little boy.

405
00:17:46,705 --> 00:17:49,406
I will?

406
00:17:53,142 --> 00:17:56,778
And besides, my week
as a helper mommy is done now,

407
00:17:56,812 --> 00:18:00,713
so when you come home today,
you'll have me all to yourself.

408
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,552
Oh. Ok... Okay.

409
00:18:02,586 --> 00:18:04,247
(sniffles)

410
00:18:04,282 --> 00:18:06,215
Hey, you-you hear that,
Landon?

411
00:18:06,257 --> 00:18:09,150
That's how you keep
your bitch in line.

412
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,060
So, you know, Jar Jar
wasn't there the whole time.

413
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,828
It was just a
green screen.

414
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,659
Yes, I heard you
say that earlier.

415
00:18:18,693 --> 00:18:19,962
(knocking on door)
QUAGMIRE: Peter?

416
00:18:19,996 --> 00:18:22,866
Quagmire? Cleveland?!

417
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,602
And me.
I'm here, too.

418
00:18:24,635 --> 00:18:26,233
You're wh...?
What are you doing here?

419
00:18:26,267 --> 00:18:28,337
Well, you were acting weird,
so we followed you.

420
00:18:28,371 --> 00:18:29,737
We want to know
what's going on.

421
00:18:29,771 --> 00:18:31,273
Well, h-how'd you
guys get on the set?

422
00:18:31,307 --> 00:18:33,273
I bit the security guard
in the nards.

423
00:18:33,307 --> 00:18:36,610
I don't like to do it a lot,
but you're my friend, Peter.

424
00:18:36,644 --> 00:18:37,977
Who are these
two idiots?

425
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:38,913
JOE: Three.
Three idiots.

426
00:18:38,947 --> 00:18:39,913
Big fan.

427
00:18:39,947 --> 00:18:41,481
And what's up
with Liam Neeson?

428
00:18:41,515 --> 00:18:42,945
You said
you kicked his ass.

429
00:18:42,987 --> 00:18:44,153
(sighs)

430
00:18:44,187 --> 00:18:45,187
Look, you guys, I...

431
00:18:45,188 --> 00:18:47,089
I lied about that.

432
00:18:47,123 --> 00:18:48,089
What?!

433
00:18:48,123 --> 00:18:49,825
I acted like such a big man,

434
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:52,426
and I didn't want to admit
I was a coward.

435
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,992
I was too scared
to fight Liam Neeson.

436
00:18:55,026 --> 00:18:57,160
That's why he's
my big fat houseboy now.

437
00:18:57,193 --> 00:18:59,128
Now, Peter,
I'm out of crackers,

438
00:18:59,169 --> 00:19:00,432
and I'm gluten-free,

439
00:19:00,466 --> 00:19:02,736
so what I need you to
do is go to a local gym

440
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:04,272
and ask men to
pee in your hands.

441
00:19:04,306 --> 00:19:05,840
What the hell?!

442
00:19:05,906 --> 00:19:08,240
Come on, what are you
waiting for, Griffin?

443
00:19:08,274 --> 00:19:11,713
No, Liam, I'm not doing
your stupid chores anymore.

444
00:19:11,747 --> 00:19:13,713
And there's something else
I got to tell you.

445
00:19:13,747 --> 00:19:15,218
Your story thread
in<i> Love, Actually</i>

446
00:19:15,252 --> 00:19:17,218
is the second worst.

447
00:19:17,252 --> 00:19:18,818
You better take that back.

448
00:19:18,852 --> 00:19:22,658
No way your son would learn the
drums in that amount of time.

449
00:19:22,692 --> 00:19:24,226
Oh, that tears it!

450
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,529
(groans)

451
00:19:28,531 --> 00:19:30,761
(grunting)

452
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:32,633
(grunting)

453
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:34,001
Aah!
(grunts)

454
00:19:34,035 --> 00:19:35,999
(grunts)

455
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,501
(grunting)

456
00:19:40,535 --> 00:19:42,341
(Peter whimpers,
Liam grunts)

457
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,077
(groans, glass squeaking)

458
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:47,340
(groans)

459
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:55,589
(both grunting)

460
00:19:57,558 --> 00:19:59,155
(gasping)

461
00:19:59,189 --> 00:20:00,386
(groans)

462
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:03,393
(groaning)

463
00:20:03,427 --> 00:20:04,336
(groaning)

464
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,458
JOE: Hey, Peter, you're
up there, now?

465
00:20:05,459 --> 00:20:06,887
Who's winning?

466
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:07,929
Aah!

467
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:09,929
(coughs)

468
00:20:14,603 --> 00:20:18,273
(whimpering)

469
00:20:18,307 --> 00:20:19,808
(screaming)

470
00:20:21,739 --> 00:20:23,377
(yells in pain)

471
00:20:29,992 --> 00:20:31,990
Now, if you'll excuse me,

472
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:34,622
I'm off to get a free
movie set haircut.

473
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:37,228
Damn it!

474
00:20:37,262 --> 00:20:40,164
I was stupid to think I
could beat up Liam Neeson.

475
00:20:40,945 --> 00:20:42,910
You guys must
think I'm pathetic.

476
00:20:42,944 --> 00:20:45,412
Are you kidding?
You took on the star of<i> Kinsey!</i>

477
00:20:45,415 --> 00:20:46,916
Yeah, and more
importantly,

478
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,552
you followed through
on your drunken ravings.

479
00:20:49,719 --> 00:20:51,848
Wow. I guess
you're right.

480
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,319
Thanks, guys.

481
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,918
You know, I guess
the lesson here is,

482
00:20:55,952 --> 00:20:57,253
Oskar Schindler
wasn't real.

483
00:20:57,287 --> 00:20:58,885
And neither was
anything in that movie.

484
00:20:58,927 --> 00:21:00,989
I-I-I don't think
that's the lesson.

485
