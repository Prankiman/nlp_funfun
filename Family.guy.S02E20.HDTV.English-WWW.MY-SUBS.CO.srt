00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:05,100
It seems today that all you see

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,400
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,000
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,200
On which we used to rely?

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,400
Lucky there's a family guy

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:23,200
Lucky there's a man who positively
can do all the things that make us

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,100
Laugh and cry

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,200
He's a family guy

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,400
Hey, guys. Guys, check it out.
Quagmire's tryin' to get lucky.

10
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,600
Hey, gorgeous.
You wanna come home with me?

11
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,200
- I'm with my husband.
- Lose the zero, get with the hero.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,200
A little violent for you, don't you think?

13
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,300
Huh! I'll be right over there.

14
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,100
We interrupt for breaking news.
After years of isolation,

15
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,000
the mysterious and
eccentric brewmeister, Pawtucket Pat,

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,600
has said that he's opening his
never-before-seen brewery to a lucky few.

17
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,000
Pawtucket Pat has placed
four silver scrolls in four random beers.

18
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,700
Each lucky scroll winner and a guest of their
choice will take a magical tour of the brewery,

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,800
and walk away with
a lifetime's supply of beer.

20
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,500
What? Don't complain.
This is actually makin' you look attractive.

21
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,700
Oh, man, did you guys hear that?

22
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,600
Imagine seein' the inside
of the Pawtucket Patriot brewery!

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,200
- Forget it, Peter. You don't have a chance.
- Yeah. You never win anything.

24
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,500
Remember when you went on Password?

25
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,300
This one is for Peter Griffin
and Tony Randall.

26
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,900
The password is...

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You...

28
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,400
Actor.

29
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,500
You...

30
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,100
Tony?

31
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,700
You...

32
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,400
Very good, Jonas. Oh, my! Look at the time.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,300
Mrs Griffin, I practised just like you said.

34
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,100
- Oh, far be it from me to call you a liar.
- Huh?

35
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,200
Nothing, nothing. See you next week.

36
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,600
- Mom, how come all your students suck?
- I don't know, honey.

37
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,000
All I want is one pupil who's
good enough to win the piano competition.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,400
I'm sick of comin' in second
to that awful Alexis Radcliffe.

39
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,000
Every year she wins and rubs it in my face.

40
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,900
Don't worry, sweetheart.
There's always next year.

41
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,300
Congratulations on second place, Lois.

42
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Oh, Lois, thank God it's you. The last
three houses I went to were very rude.

43
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,600
- Have you been drinkin'?
- Why, yes, I have. Thank you.

44
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,300
I gotta find a silver scroll.
Everyone's lookin'.

45
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,400
All right, listen to me,
you long-necked bastard.

46
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,800
You give me the scroll, and I make you head
of sanitation services for the entire city.

47
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,900
It's a do-nothing job, sweetcake.

48
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,400
Two more dead from alcohol poisoning. Hm.

49
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,200
Lookin' for that scroll, huh?
Wouldn't mind findin' that thing myself.

50
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,800
Ah, jeez.

51
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,700
Oh, man. I hope I don't get pulled over.

52
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
OK, be cool. Maintain.

53
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,000
C'mon, Death. You can do this.

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,200
Why do you care so much
about touring a stupid brewery?

55
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,000
Everyone has their sanctuary.
The Catholics have churches,

56
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,800
fat people have Wisconsin,
and I have the Pawtucket Brewery.

57
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,900
Now help me drink these beers.

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,200
- Peter, I'm not drinkin' this.
- OK, OK. All right, all right.

59
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,400
Lois, uh, I'm gonna go to the store now, OK?

60
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,200
Here I go. Duh-duh-nuh-duh-duh-duh-nuh...

61
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,300
Stop it! What if the kids
were to see you drinkin' like this?

62
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,900
Especially Stewie. He's so impressionable.

63
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,500
Oh, my God! Please tell me we didn't do it.

64
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,800
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

65
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,000
Huh. Nothin'.

66
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,300
- Peter, it's seven in the mornin'.
- Thanks for the update, Big Ben.

67
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,600
- You're drunk again!
- No, exhausted. I've been drinkin' all night.

68
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,200
Peter, if you keep this up,
somethin' terrible's gonna happen.

69
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,500
Yeah, somethin' terrible...
all the way to the bank!

70
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,000
- Nice.
- Oh, I don't have time for this.

71
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,100
I'm late for my checkup.

72
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,800
Wheeee! Whoo-hoo!

73
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,600
Yeah! All right!

74
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,200
- What's goin' on?
- It seems Joe has found the first scroll.

75
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,800
He's tastin' victory. I bet it tastes good.

76
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,200
Like saltwater taffy or a Chunky.

77
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:03,600
Oh, no! If there's four tickets
and one of 'em's gone, that... that leaves...

78
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,000
this many!

79
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,800
Good morning, Mrs Griffin.
Hello! Hello! Hello!

80
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,100
Hello! Ha, ha! Just kidding.

81
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,700
- So, uh, any problems?
- No, everything's fine, Doctor.

82
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,100
- Lois?
- Oh. Hello, Alexis.

83
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,500
Heard you might not enter
the competition this year. Smart move.

84
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,400
Yes, well, there are more important things
in life than a piano competition.

85
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,100
Oh, yes. Especially for those who
have no-oh, that's cold! - Chance.

86
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:49,300
For your information,
I have a student that could whip you.

87
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,200
Well, I guess I'll see you there.
Fred, this is not a date!

88
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,200
- All right, you're all done, Alexis.
- What do you know?

89
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,300
Once again, I finish first.

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,800
Don't let her get to you. She asked for
"Pine Forest". I gave her "New Car".

91
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,300
Did you hear? It's over!
Somebody found the last scroll!

92
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,100
- Oh, my God! No!
- It's true. The final scroll has been recovered.

93
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,500
The recipient declines
to be interviewed for safety reasons,

94
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,200
but I'm sure you're all with me when
I say "Congratulations, you son of a bitch."

95
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,800
Oh, what am I gonna do now?

96
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,200
- Hello, dumb-dumb.
- Not now, Gazoo. I wanna be alone.

97
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,600
It's not always about you, fatso.

98
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,600
Maybe I wanted to talk.

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I guess wantin' it more than anyone
just wasn't enough.

100
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,200
Hey, you guys! It's a fake!
There's still a scroll out there!

101
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,400
That's right. I made it up. I figured if
people thought the last scroll was found,

102
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,700
everyone would stop looking,
giving me the edge to find it myself.

103
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,400
But what I did was wrong.
And as an act of contrition,

104
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,800
I will now insert this
carnivorous earwig into my brain.

105
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
Huh. Kinda tickles.

106
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Aaah!

107
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,700
Oh God! It's eating out
the back of my eyes! Aah!

108
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,600
In other news, chocolate may be better for you
than once thought. In a recent 12-day study...

109
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,100
Ah, my last beer. Here goes.

110
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,000
I bet that scroll makes the beer taste terrible.

111
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,300
Oh, God.

112
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,400
What the hell...?

113
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,500
I've found it! I've found the last scroll!

114
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,400
- He found it!
- Oh, my God!

115
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,600
Run home, Peter! Run as fast as you can!

116
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,300
Aah!

117
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Aah!

118
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
Aah!

119
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Aah!

120
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,900
Aah!

121
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,200
Aah!

122
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Aah!

123
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,800
Aah!

124
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,100
Oh, man, this is the happiest day of my life.

125
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,700
Now I know how Barbra Streisand felt
the day she married James Brolin.

126
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,200
- I love you.
- I love you too.

127
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,700
Oh! I'm so glad I married
a regular person and not a celebrity.

128
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,200
Professional ninja Jerry Nelson,
how did you find your silver scroll?

129
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,500
I was at home nursing this throwing-star
wound, my wife Janey gives me a beer,

130
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,600
and bam, there it was.

131
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,300
Honey, I'm sorry. You know
you can't sneak up on me.

132
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,300
Ladies and gentlemen,
in his first public appearance ever,

133
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,900
Pawtucket Pat!

134
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,700
That's for my brother Luis! He drank
himself to death on your crappy beer!

135
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,100
Gotcha!

136
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,700
A big hand for Cheech Marin, everybody.

137
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,400
Let the tour begin.

138
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,500
- Hey, look!
- Oh, those are the Chumbawambas.

139
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,300
- They live here with me.
- Hey, Pat. Where's the wheelchair ramp?

140
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,200
Oh, we don't have one.
I guess this is where you get off.

141
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,300
Chumbawamba, gobbledy-goo

142
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,600
Life isn't fair, it's sad but it's true

143
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,200
Chumbawamba, gobbledy-gee

144
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,100
When your poor legs are stiff as a tree

145
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,800
What do you do
when you're stuck in a chair

146
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,100
Finding it hard to go up and down stairs?

147
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,500
What do you think of the one you call God

148
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,400
Isn't his absence slightly odd?

149
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,000
Maybe he's forgotten you

150
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,300
Chumbawamba, gobbledy-gorse

151
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,600
Count yourself lucky you're not a horse

152
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,100
They would turn you into dog food

153
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,900
Or to Chumbawamba gobbledy-glue!

154
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,400
I'm glad I'm not takin' your stupid tour!
I'm a Coors man anyway! Silver Bullet!

155
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,500
Gobbledy-glue!

156
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
Very good, Jimmy.

157
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,100
- Trying to watch the History Channel.
- Try it again.

158
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Uh. Not talking to myself.

159
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,700
You're good enough
to tackle a Beethoven sonata!

160
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,800
Let me grab the sheet music. Keep playing!

161
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,100
I got the mu... Oh, my God!

162
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,800
- Jimmy, what happened?
- Yes, Jimmy. What happened?

163
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,900
I... I fell.

164
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,200
It's all behind this door.

165
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,700
Lady and gentlemen, the beer room!

166
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,900
Take a drink and you'll sink

167
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,900
To a state of pure inebriation

168
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You'll be tanked

169
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:54,200
Like the whole Irish nation

170
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,700
Yeah!

171
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,100
When you drink enough of my beer

172
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,900
You will find this magic rule

173
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,800
Make your every joke a jewel

174
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:18,200
You'll drive drunker than Oksana Baiul

175
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Go on, buds, drink my suds

176
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Till you've reached that pure inebriation

177
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,700
Though the beer may be free

178
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:43,000
You're just renting it from me

179
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,800
Ah. It's like I died and went to heaven.

180
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:53,400
But then they realised it wasn't my time,
and so they sent me back to a brewery.

181
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,700
We're still working some of the bugs
out of our latest invention, Permasuds.

182
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,200
Beer that never goes flat. No matter
how old it gets, it stays carbonated.

183
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,800
Ooh! Aah!

184
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,300
- Brian, wait.
- Maybe we should stick with the group.

185
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,700
Beer that never goes flat!
Do you know what that means, Brian?

186
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,200
This beer will still be carbonated
long after you die of old age

187
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,300
and we buy another dog
to help the kids, you know, forget about you.

188
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,500
- Peter, I wouldn't...
- Wow! That's incredible.

189
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,300
Ah, what the hell. Cheers!
I don't know why he said it wasn't ready.

190
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,500
- It tastes pretty good to me... Whoa!
- Oh, my God! What the hell's happening?

191
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,700
Must be the beer. Hey! Hey, check this out.

192
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,300
And look at this!

193
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,600
Oh, yeah? Watch this!

194
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,300
- Oh, my God!
- Relax, Brian, it's just a trick.

195
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,700
- See, look, my thumb is fine.
- I'm talking about that!

196
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,900
Holy crap! There's nothing to grab onto!

197
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,600
- Oh, this is it, pal. We're goners.
- Peter, I've really cherished our friendship.

198
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,600
Me too, buddy. That's why I was holdin'
this in, but, if we're gonna die anyway...

199
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,600
Peter, that's it!

200
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,500
- Hey! Hey, pull my finger.
- My pleasure.

201
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,000
Hey, Peter, this next one
you can blame on the dog.

202
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,600
Ah! Silent but life-saving.

203
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
What the hell is this?
Didn't you see that sign?

204
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,000
You've sullied my factory
and disobeyed my rules.

205
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,000
- I want you to leave immediately!
- Oh, come on!

206
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,000
- Don't I at least get a Chumbawamba song?
- Oh, fine.

207
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,000
Chumbawamba, gobble...

208
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,100
Aah!

209
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,400
Aah!

210
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,800
Aah!

211
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,800
Come on, Meg. The competition is this
Sunday, and you're not even close to ready.

212
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,800
- Maybe if you loosened my chains?
- We tried that, remember, honey?

213
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,100
- You can't be trusted.
- Lois, take a letter.

214
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,800
"Dear Pawtucket Pat, I hate you!
You are a bad man!"

215
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,300
"And you made me cry. Furthermore..."

216
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,000
Not now, Peter.
Meg and I are havin' a little girl time,

217
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,000
- Help me!
- Go on. No boys allowed.

218
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,500
Jeez, Lois. Still with the piano? What's a guy
gotta do to get a little attention around here?

219
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,900
Peter, that's incredible!
I don't understand how...

220
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,200
You're like the idiot from Shine!

221
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,500
Meg, you're free. Try the clarinet.

222
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,600
Keep playin'. Keep playin'!

223
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,100
No, no, no. Play it like you did last night.

224
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,500
- I... I can't!
- Peter, talent doesn't disappear just like that.

225
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,300
Well, sometimes it does. I mean,
you were pretty bad in bed Saturday night.

226
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,500
Come on, Lois, move or somethin'!
Jeez, it's like doin' it with a pillow.

227
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,400
- Peter, I stayed at my mother's that night.
- Oh.

228
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,600
Oh, jeez, this hangover's killin' me. I haven't
felt this crappy since I went to that museum.

229
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Why did all the dinosaurs die out?

230
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,200
Because you touch yourself at night.

231
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,900
Here, this'll make you feel better.

232
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,900
Huh. I think we've found his muse.

233
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,400
Oh, my God. You can only
play the piano when you're drunk!

234
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,000
That's not true. I can also vomit, fall down

235
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,500
and make dirty calls
to your sister when I'm drunk.

236
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,200
Get a case of beer.
We've got a lot of practising to do.

237
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,900
- Practisin'? What for?
- The competition.

238
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,400
- You're gonna be my first champion.
- Oh, play that sad walking-away song

239
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,800
From The Incredible Hulk.

240
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,700
Hey! Everyone! Look at me!
Look, look! Look at me.

241
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,100
Hey, thanks! You think
that was great? Watch this!

242
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,500
Uh-oh! Lois! I'm losin' my buzz!

243
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,600
- I need more talent juice.
- Another beer already?

244
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,400
Oh, well, I guess I don't have
to be prepared for the competition...

245
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,900
I need another pitcher over here.

246
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,300
Wow. Lois must've written
the book on man-pleasin'.

247
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,800
Too bad Loretta doesn't allow
white literature in our household.

248
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,700
Well, how much harm
can one more pitcher do?

249
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,400
- This is all for the sake of art, right?
- Don't start with me, Brian.

250
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,100
This may not be my proudest moment,
but damn it, I wanna win.

251
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,000
You're not the first person
to do whatever it takes to win.

252
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,600
You come to me and ask me
to kill a man I do not know.

253
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,400
Now I ask you, why should
I kill this... Count Chocula?

254
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,900
That son of a bitch has been spreading lies.

255
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,500
My cereal does not
cut the roof of your mouth!

256
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,600
With all respect.

257
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,600
I can't believe I'm missing
Ronnie's party for this.

258
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,700
That Ronnie's a bad influence.

259
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,200
Yeah. That little bastard
sold me some bad crack.

260
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,500
Stay out of it, Herb.
You're not even his real father.

261
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,300
Yes, we're checking in.
The student's name is Peter Griffin.

262
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,500
- Oh, yes. He's on in an hour.
- Where's the nearest liquor store?

263
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,100
They're all closed on Sundays.
This is a dry county.

264
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,400
I can't do it without booze.

265
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,000
Maybe this is a sign that we need to stop this.

266
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,500
I've been keeping you ripped out of
your head for my own selfish needs.

267
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,100
I'm ashamed. Let's just go home.

268
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,400
No, no, Lois, we can't stop now
after all we've put into this.

269
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,400
Yo, Fresh? How do I get to Ronnie's party?

270
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,200
Oh, Peter, we're not goin'
to a high-school party.

271
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,400
- Lois.
- Alexis.

272
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,800
- Loser says "what".
- What?

273
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,200
Oh! I'll drive.

274
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,200
Consume.

275
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,600
- I love you so much.
- This sucks.

276
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,100
Well, you know, when I was your age,
we had way better drinkin' games.

277
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,800
- Ow.
- Ha, ha! You drink.

278
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,700
- It's the cops!
- Run!

279
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,800
Hold it, you two. Aren't you
a little old to be drinking illegally?

280
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,600
Uh... uh... Lois, look over there!

281
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,400
Run!

282
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,800
I wanna make you feel beautiful, Lois.

283
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,100
Oh, Peter, stop. Try to stay focused.

284
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,600
OK. You're on. Wait!

285
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,000
Here's a little something for good luck.

286
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,700
Make your trills clean and watch
the legato in the fourth measure. Go!

287
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,600
Ha, ha, ha, ha! Ha!

288
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,500
We did it, Brian!

289
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,100
- Congratulations, Lois.
- For what?

290
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,300
Winnin' a trophy at the expense
of my husband's health?

291
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,900
Oh, God knows how many
of his brain cells I killed,

292
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,100
pourin' all that alcohol down his throat.

293
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,500
Lois, you don't get it.
The lesson here is that abusing alcohol

294
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,900
has absolutely no negative consequences.

295
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,600
You have the trophy
and my brain cells are just fine.

296
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,100
Hello? Where... where is everybody?

297
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,400
I'm... I'm the only brain cell left!

298
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,500
Well, at least I have my books.

299
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,900
No! No, that... that's not fair.

300
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,200
