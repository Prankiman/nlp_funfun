00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:31,965
Hi there. It's me, Peter.

12
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:34,733
You know, when it comes to
making dreams come alive,

13
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:36,899
there used to be nothing
like the movies.

14
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,471
So we thought it would be fun to ask

15
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:41,874
a few visionary Hollywood
directors to create his...

16
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,309
Let's be honest, his...

same Family Guy story,

18

"Peter Gets Fired."

00:00:47,874 --> 00:00:50,116
Of the countless
directors we contacted,

20
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:52,384
three did not say no immediately,

21
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,887
and I got a weird message
from Paul Verhoeven

22
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,822
that I could not understand.

I'm still here in front
of the Hollywood Sign,

but I've asked the cameraman
to adjust the shot

114
00:07:25,596 --> 00:07:27,349
so that you can only see "wood."

115

is Wes Anderson,

like you ate a pot brownie

00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:06,081
my father lost his position

124

happen to my play?

With no discernible reaction,

my father made his way home to
deliver the news to my mother.

134
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,224
Let me tell you about my house.

135
00:08:49,225 --> 00:08:50,859
We lived in a New England cottage

136
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,295
that was inside a vintage Army tent,

137
00:08:53,296 --> 00:08:55,698
that was inside a
decommissioned submarine,

138
00:08:55,699 --> 00:08:59,485
that was all inside an
old airplane hangar.

139
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:03,573
I've lost my position

140
00:09:03,574 --> 00:09:05,640
with the Pawtucket
Brothers Brewery Company.

141
00:09:05,641 --> 00:09:07,209
And the play is off.

142
00:09:08,623 --> 00:09:11,177
We have to inform the children.

143
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,050
My brother Chris had spent his life

144
00:09:15,051 --> 00:09:16,818
conjoining his twin loves,

145
00:09:16,819 --> 00:09:18,820

146
00:09:18,821 --> 00:09:20,488

Do you want to do a Spider-Man kiss?

149
00:09:35,893 --> 00:09:38,707
Our dog Brian had been
making a name for himself

150
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,530
on the pickleball court.

151
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,970

Are those marking sole shoes?

153
00:09:55,975 --> 00:09:58,193
I'd like to officially
file a grievance.

154
00:09:58,194 --> 00:10:00,529
Brian had quietly become
the most successful

155

Peter, you're alive.

324
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,458
But-but how?

325
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:45,694
You were blown into a million pieces.

326
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:49,283
Luckily, I know a couple
of pretty good welders.

327
00:20:52,366 --> 00:20:54,539
Wait, they-they welded
you back together?

328
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,738
A-And they knew you were
alive the whole time?

329
00:20:56,739 --> 00:21:00,326
You want to ask questions or you
want to do it in a cemetery?

330
00:21:05,214 --> 00:21:07,883
Is... is everything all right?

331
00:21:07,884 --> 00:21:09,384
Yeah, no, I-I think I'm just tired

332
00:21:09,385 --> 00:21:11,571
from all the flying back and forth.

333
00:21:11,572 --> 00:21:13,221
Maybe we just talk
here for a little bit,

334
00:21:13,222 --> 00:21:16,291
and then you can tell everyone
that I functioned as I should.

335
00:21:16,292 --> 00:21:18,260
Yeah, uh, okay.

336
00:21:18,261 --> 00:21:20,758
So, which director thing
was your favorite?

337
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:22,018
Mine was this one.

338
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:25,085
Oh, honestly, I-I didn't
care for the episode.

339
00:21:25,087 --> 00:21:28,666
