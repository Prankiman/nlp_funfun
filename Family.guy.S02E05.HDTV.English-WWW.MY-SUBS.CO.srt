1
00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:04,391
Good evening. I'm Diane Simmons.

2
00:00:04,564 --> 00:00:07,931
A stunning development tonight
as O.J. Simpson is proven innocent.

3
00:00:08,067 --> 00:00:11,093
We have the identity of the real killer.
But first...

4
00:00:11,237 --> 00:00:14,900
It's fall. The time of year when the leaves
turn a pretty, purpley orange...

5
00:00:15,007 --> 00:00:17,976
...and Quahog prepares
for its annual Harvest Festival Parade.

6
00:00:18,077 --> 00:00:20,602
Asian reporter Trisha Takanawa
joins us live...

7
00:00:20,713 --> 00:00:23,705
...from the ceremony where
they are choosing this year's theme.

8
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:27,183
Diane, behind me are 1,000 beautiful doves.

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,483
Gently tied to each of their delicate legs
is a parade theme...

10
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,218
...suggested by
ordinary citizens of Quahog.

11
00:00:33,326 --> 00:00:35,658
And here to pick
this year's winning theme...

12
00:00:35,761 --> 00:00:38,161
...is Ten Commandments star,
Charlton Heston.

13
00:00:38,264 --> 00:00:40,323
Let my pigeons go!

14
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,434
He nailed one! We have our theme!

15
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,834
I submitted "togetherness."
A simple theme.

16
00:00:50,943 --> 00:00:52,808
But powerful, nonetheless.

17
00:00:52,912 --> 00:00:56,814
Come on, "overcoming adversity"!
Let's go, "overcoming adversity"!

18
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:59,282
Show me "women I gave the clap to"!

19
00:00:59,485 --> 00:01:02,477
And the Harvest Festival Parade theme is:

20
00:01:02,588 --> 00:01:05,022
"The episode of Who's the Boss?

21
00:01:05,124 --> 00:01:07,991
"...where Tony sees Angela
naked in the shower."

22
00:01:08,094 --> 00:01:10,892
Yes! That's mine! Un-freaking-believable!

23
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:17,734
Clumsy oaf! Michael Flatley
must be turning over in his grave.

24
00:01:18,404 --> 00:01:20,804
Wait a minute. He's not dead yet.

25
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,898
"Michael Flatley."

26
00:01:23,175 --> 00:01:26,975
It's great they picked your theme,
but isn't it a little esoteric?

27
00:01:27,146 --> 00:01:28,545
Esoteric?

28
00:01:28,814 --> 00:01:31,180
- Could it mean "sexy"?
- I think it's a science term.

29
00:01:31,284 --> 00:01:33,718
Fellas, esoteric means "delicious."

30
00:01:34,353 --> 00:01:37,083
Who's the Boss? Is not a food.

31
00:01:37,323 --> 00:01:38,585
Swing and a miss.

32
00:01:39,025 --> 00:01:42,153
"It seems today that all you see

33
00:01:42,662 --> 00:01:45,790
"is violence in movies and sex on TV

34
00:01:45,965 --> 00:01:48,957
"But where are those good,
old-fashioned values

35
00:01:49,602 --> 00:01:51,695
"on which we used to rely?

36
00:01:52,638 --> 00:01:54,799
"Lucky there's a family guy

37
00:01:55,841 --> 00:01:59,174
"Lucky there's a man who'll
positively tell you

38
00:01:59,278 --> 00:02:00,802
"all the things that make us

39
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:02,403
"laugh 'n' cry

40
00:02:02,648 --> 00:02:06,607
"He's a family guy"

41
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:12,554
I have no friends,
and it's all because of this stupid purse!

42
00:02:12,858 --> 00:02:16,521
What did you do to my daughter?
I swear to God, if you touched her...

43
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:18,895
Honey, what happened?

44
00:02:19,832 --> 00:02:21,265
It was lunchtime and...

45
00:02:21,734 --> 00:02:23,998
I love the color of your Prada bag.

46
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:27,869
- Yeah, but yours has that great clasp.
- Hey, Meg, you want to come to lunch?

47
00:02:28,074 --> 00:02:32,101
You know what? There's no room
in my car for your big, ugly purse.

48
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,911
Meg, let me tell you about popularity.

49
00:02:37,016 --> 00:02:39,416
Mrs. Canner? Are you coming?
Bye!

50
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,311
Daddy, if you really loved me,
you'd buy me a Prada bag.

51
00:02:43,422 --> 00:02:46,550
I can't say no to you, honey.
What are they, like, $10?

52
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:48,752
More like $1,100.

53
00:02:50,463 --> 00:02:52,727
You wish I loved you that much!

54
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,760
We'll never finish the float
in time for the parade.

55
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:58,268
Pick up the pace, guys!

56
00:02:58,371 --> 00:02:59,929
Peter, your theme is a dud.

57
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:02,405
Yeah. I've never even seen
Who's the Boss?

58
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:07,035
Tuesdays in the '80s I was always
in bed by 8:00 and home by 11:00.

59
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:11,639
But I can't do it without you guys,
because I'll tell you who's the boss.

60
00:03:11,751 --> 00:03:13,548
It's not Tony or Angela.

61
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:16,746
It's not even man-crazy Mona. It's all of us.

62
00:03:17,223 --> 00:03:20,590
You're the boss because you never
give up, like with the ladies.

63
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,120
Gemini.

64
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:23,787
Capricorn.

65
00:03:24,864 --> 00:03:26,764
I know you're not a Virgo!

66
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:31,200
From down here, you look like a Pisces!

67
00:03:31,937 --> 00:03:35,270
And Cleveland, you're the boss
because of your attention to detail.

68
00:03:35,408 --> 00:03:39,208
Like when we play pool,
you take so long to line up your shots...

69
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:41,575
...I just want to crack you with a cue stick.

70
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,581
But I don't because that would be
a hate crime, and I love you.

71
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:49,120
And Joe, I've had new neighbors before,
but none were half the man you are.

72
00:03:49,522 --> 00:03:52,047
Since you're half a man already,
that splits them...

73
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:54,524
...into some kind of fraction
I can't even measure.

74
00:03:54,627 --> 00:03:57,790
He's right. If we work together,
we can win this thing. Who's in?

75
00:03:58,397 --> 00:04:00,092
Go, Spooner Street!

76
00:04:05,004 --> 00:04:07,495
My dad always says,
"Measure twice, cut once."

77
00:04:07,606 --> 00:04:10,803
My daddy always said,
"Cleveland Jr., quit jumping on the bed!"

78
00:04:12,445 --> 00:04:14,072
We didn't measure!

79
00:04:14,914 --> 00:04:17,974
Amazing. The whole
neighborhood is working together.

80
00:04:18,084 --> 00:04:19,745
You know what's really amazing?

81
00:04:19,852 --> 00:04:24,084
I haven't brushed my teeth in three days,
and no one has said a thing.

82
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,528
If I had a job, I could buy the bag myself.

83
00:04:31,297 --> 00:04:34,892
I have squandered my munitions budget
on that insipid Rugrats video!

84
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,831
Perhaps I should seek employment.

85
00:04:36,936 --> 00:04:39,871
Mother teaches piano.
I suppose I could as well.

86
00:04:40,372 --> 00:04:42,135
All right, try it again, Richard.

87
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:45,142
And remember,
the wrong keys are electrified.

88
00:04:48,347 --> 00:04:50,076
I don't want to play the piano!

89
00:04:50,182 --> 00:04:52,707
Indeed.
Would you rather play the bassoon?

90
00:04:55,988 --> 00:04:57,922
No experience? No, thanks.

91
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:02,417
Oh, nuts. Young lady.

92
00:05:02,895 --> 00:05:04,522
What's the little guy's name?

93
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,619
What do you care?

94
00:05:05,731 --> 00:05:09,895
I can't send an unwed teenage mother
out on the street without a job.

95
00:05:10,002 --> 00:05:12,368
Stewie. My son's name is Stewie.

96
00:05:13,806 --> 00:05:17,606
Welcome to the 83rd annual
Quahog Harvest Festival Parade.

97
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,644
Are you as excited as I am, Tom?

98
00:05:19,745 --> 00:05:21,679
Are you kidding, Diane? I've got wood...

99
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,045
...and clipped onto it
is a list of this year's float entries.

100
00:05:25,151 --> 00:05:28,348
Remember, the float that best captures
this year's theme...

101
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:30,718
...wins Quahog's coveted Golden Clam.

102
00:05:30,823 --> 00:05:32,313
And here's our first float.

103
00:05:32,424 --> 00:05:35,484
It looks like some wires
got crossed on Clover Street.

104
00:05:35,594 --> 00:05:38,461
That's not Angela.
That's Mona, Angela's mom.

105
00:05:38,564 --> 00:05:41,294
Wonderful use of tree bark
for the age spots though.

106
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:44,803
This one's got Tony bathing Jonathan.
That's just plain wrong.

107
00:05:44,904 --> 00:05:47,964
Each float possesses its own
unique charm. But none of them...

108
00:05:48,073 --> 00:05:50,041
Oh, baby! Look at that!

109
00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:53,776
The float turned out great.

110
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:57,872
Our neighborhood hasn't been this united
since Quagmire got us free cable.

111
00:06:02,254 --> 00:06:03,983
We are not bad people.

112
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:07,616
We just don't want to pay $12 a month
for Cinemax.

113
00:06:09,929 --> 00:06:12,159
First place goes to Spooner Street.

114
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,368
We won! All right!

115
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,748
Come on now! This is damn foolish!

116
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,545
My theme, my trophy!

117
00:06:33,652 --> 00:06:36,587
My aunt Fanny!
You said it yourself! I'm the boss!

118
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:41,058
He said I, too, was the boss.
And it's time Cleveland got his due.

119
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,458
Joe, my feet are starting to swell.

120
00:06:43,562 --> 00:06:46,292
You two go home.
I can stay here as long as it takes.

121
00:06:46,398 --> 00:06:49,299
You'd be amazed how little one eats
when your legs don't work.

122
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:51,301
There's only one way to settle this.

123
00:06:52,137 --> 00:06:53,229
Russian Roulette.

124
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:56,536
Three bullets, last guy standing
keeps the trophy. Me first.

125
00:06:56,842 --> 00:06:59,333
No. Wait a minute, this is crazy.

126
00:06:59,912 --> 00:07:01,004
You first.

127
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,449
There's gotta be a way for you all
to enjoy the trophy.

128
00:07:05,684 --> 00:07:08,619
Wait a minute! I got it! No, lost it.
There it is again!

129
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,147
Perfect, Peter.
Now we can all enjoy it.

130
00:07:13,726 --> 00:07:15,591
Here's to togetherness!

131
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:18,353
Car!

132
00:07:22,034 --> 00:07:23,501
Meg, order up!

133
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:26,331
Here you go, hon. From Flappy himself.

134
00:07:26,672 --> 00:07:29,766
I don't care if they're
from Kubla filthy-wretched Khan!

135
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,570
Try them. You'll like them.

136
00:07:31,677 --> 00:07:33,907
Yes, well, I rather doubt that.

137
00:07:35,347 --> 00:07:37,872
Yes! These are delectable.

138
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:41,682
Flappy, good news!
I've decided not to kill you!

139
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:46,315
What a precious little boy.

140
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:48,120
That's my son.

141
00:07:48,227 --> 00:07:51,025
Your son? But you're just a baby yourself.

142
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,826
Henry, give the little skank a nice tip.

143
00:07:55,567 --> 00:07:56,556
$20!

144
00:07:57,636 --> 00:07:58,898
Welcome to Flappy's.

145
00:07:59,004 --> 00:08:00,904
Why don't you sit next to my baby...

146
00:08:01,006 --> 00:08:03,099
...whose deadbeat dad
doesn't pay child support.

147
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:15,584
Peter, what is it?

148
00:08:15,688 --> 00:08:17,246
What's going on out here?

149
00:08:17,356 --> 00:08:19,221
Clear the way! I'm a cop!

150
00:08:19,325 --> 00:08:22,692
Oh, my God! I thought the safety was on.
I'm so sorry.

151
00:08:22,895 --> 00:08:26,422
That's okay, son.
It's your right as an American citizen.

152
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:32,026
What's all the noise?
I was just jerked out of a sound sleep.

153
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:36,699
Perhaps someone could enlighten me as
to the whereabouts of our Golden Clam?

154
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:39,744
- Maybe it fell.
- Yeah. Right into someone's pocket.

155
00:08:39,845 --> 00:08:41,642
You think one of us stole it?

156
00:08:41,747 --> 00:08:45,615
I never said the word "stole." Looks like
someone has a guilty conscience.

157
00:08:45,718 --> 00:08:47,117
Guilty conscience!

158
00:08:47,386 --> 00:08:50,412
I'm the only guy on this block
who actually pays for his cable.

159
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:55,483
Pretty high and mighty for a man
who left our nation's flag out in the rain...

160
00:08:55,594 --> 00:08:59,530
...last Fourth of July.
That's against the law, Officer!

161
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:01,891
You're one to talk.

162
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,525
Out there every trash day
picking through my garbage.

163
00:09:04,636 --> 00:09:06,035
That's an invasion of my privacy.

164
00:09:07,272 --> 00:09:10,241
He's sorting your recycling
because he loves our Mother Earth.

165
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:13,072
If you weren't so busy
trolling for booty all the time...

166
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:16,045
...you could do it yourself,
like the law says you should.

167
00:09:17,249 --> 00:09:18,216
It's on now!

168
00:09:18,317 --> 00:09:20,080
Wait a second! What about Peter?

169
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,244
He's the one
who wanted the trophy all along!

170
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:23,514
I couldn't have stolen it.

171
00:09:23,622 --> 00:09:27,388
Last night I was stealing Joe's ladder
so I could steal the trophy tonight.

172
00:09:27,493 --> 00:09:31,452
What? It's a ladder. He can't use it.
It's like taking a watch off a dead guy.

173
00:09:31,563 --> 00:09:35,431
Those Griffins always were oddballs, Joe.
Real oddballs.

174
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:36,865
I don't trust them.

175
00:09:36,969 --> 00:09:39,597
I saw them taking coupons
out of our mailbox.

176
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:41,502
I don't like the look of her!

177
00:09:41,807 --> 00:09:43,240
I offer you a recipe.

178
00:09:43,342 --> 00:09:47,108
Combine one small-town neighborhood
with a dash of missing trophy...

179
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:50,340
...and what you're left with is a gumbo
fit only for a madman.

180
00:09:50,482 --> 00:09:53,042
A gumbo served almost exclusively in The...

181
00:09:53,152 --> 00:09:55,416
Who the hell is that?
I bet he took it!

182
00:09:55,521 --> 00:09:58,149
Where are you going, Serling?
Want some of this?

183
00:09:58,323 --> 00:09:59,654
Come back here!

184
00:10:03,495 --> 00:10:04,928
I'm off to work.

185
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,088
Okay, honey.

186
00:10:06,198 --> 00:10:09,326
One of our neighbors took that trophy,
and I'll find out who.

187
00:10:09,668 --> 00:10:12,728
- I'm taking Stewie with me again.
- Fine, sweetie.

188
00:10:12,838 --> 00:10:14,806
This whole thing just makes me sick!

189
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:18,001
- We played Pictionary with them!
- Bastards!

190
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:21,602
Giddy-up, you stubby little mare!
To the pancake house!

191
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:24,079
Well, bye.

192
00:10:24,183 --> 00:10:26,777
And to think
they used to be our best friends!

193
00:10:26,885 --> 00:10:28,750
That was then and this is now!

194
00:10:28,854 --> 00:10:32,847
And this is a chair. That's a lamp.
You have boobies. I'll find that trophy!

195
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:37,555
To be honest, Peter, we were all
a little surprised you invited us over.

196
00:10:37,663 --> 00:10:41,895
We realized our friendship is a lot
more important than some stupid trophy.

197
00:10:43,068 --> 00:10:46,037
There's the tea. I'll get it, Lois.
Two sugars, right, Bonnie?

198
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,669
Damn, it's not here!

199
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,849
Not here either.

200
00:11:30,782 --> 00:11:31,976
Nothing.

201
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,088
Oh, my God! We were robbed!

202
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,658
- Is anything missing?
- No. I don't think so.

203
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:43,227
Where's that picture of me
in my two-piece?

204
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,693
Should I call the cops?

205
00:11:44,796 --> 00:11:47,526
I'm guessing a cop
had something to do with this.

206
00:11:47,633 --> 00:11:49,794
Or a pilot. Or a deli owner.

207
00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:52,098
Okay, you dirtbags!

208
00:11:52,204 --> 00:11:53,899
This means war!

209
00:11:57,743 --> 00:12:01,543
Excuse us. We're having a small problem
with home security.

210
00:12:01,713 --> 00:12:04,876
Do you have those round metal things
that you bury in the ground...

211
00:12:04,983 --> 00:12:06,644
...and, when stepped on, they explode?

212
00:12:06,752 --> 00:12:09,016
- Land mines?
- Land mines.

213
00:12:09,121 --> 00:12:10,247
It was land mines.

214
00:12:13,225 --> 00:12:14,783
- Quagmire.
- Peter.

215
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:16,517
- Cleveland.
- Joe.

216
00:12:16,628 --> 00:12:18,596
- Bonnie.
- Lois.

217
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:20,430
- Cleveland.
- Lois.

218
00:12:20,632 --> 00:12:21,599
Bonnie.

219
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,292
- Quagmire.
- Peter.

220
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,459
Loretta.

221
00:12:27,005 --> 00:12:28,495
Come on, Peter.

222
00:12:29,274 --> 00:12:30,832
That ought to slow them down.

223
00:12:33,111 --> 00:12:34,738
Being a single mother is hard.

224
00:12:34,846 --> 00:12:37,679
The real challenge is having a baby
that's addicted to crack.

225
00:12:37,783 --> 00:12:41,514
- Right, Stewie?
- What's that? Yes. I love crack.

226
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,282
I'm absolutely coo-coo for crack!

227
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:48,750
This is the first time he's eaten something
other than dog food in three weeks.

228
00:12:49,127 --> 00:12:51,254
Here's your check. God bless.

229
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,724
Here, Honey.
What's this? Blueberries?

230
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:57,035
Oh, my...

231
00:12:57,169 --> 00:12:58,693
That's better than sex!

232
00:12:59,871 --> 00:13:03,363
And could I get that waitress' address?
I'd like to help her baby.

233
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:10,775
What are they up to?

234
00:13:10,882 --> 00:13:13,248
Cleveland and Quagmire
are holding their positions...

235
00:13:13,352 --> 00:13:15,149
...but I haven't seen Joe all day.

236
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,719
Freeze!
Dad?

237
00:13:16,822 --> 00:13:19,620
Careful.
There's a bear trap two feet to your right.

238
00:13:19,725 --> 00:13:22,523
Thanks, Dad.
Look out for your mother!

239
00:13:22,628 --> 00:13:25,392
There's a sandwich
on the counter, honey.

240
00:13:25,697 --> 00:13:28,894
Cleveland, these lobster traps
aren't going to catch any intruders.

241
00:13:29,001 --> 00:13:30,161
Yes, they will.

242
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:33,704
I baited them with these plump
and tasty Fenway franks.

243
00:13:34,206 --> 00:13:35,935
Daddy, we got one!

244
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,901
Fat boy smelled a hot dog.
Couldn't help it. Went right in.

245
00:13:43,682 --> 00:13:45,946
- Hello.
- Say, get the hell off...

246
00:13:46,051 --> 00:13:48,042
Hello, lips, legs, breasts, and ass.

247
00:13:48,253 --> 00:13:51,950
Yes. I was hoping I could ask you
about your neighbors, the Griffins.

248
00:13:52,824 --> 00:13:55,850
A bunch of card-carrying Commies
if you ask me!

249
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:57,087
All right.

250
00:13:57,195 --> 00:13:58,719
No! It's not all right!

251
00:13:59,564 --> 00:14:00,656
Fat boy!

252
00:14:00,766 --> 00:14:03,234
The Griffins are not to be trusted.

253
00:14:04,403 --> 00:14:07,167
Those people are nothing
but vile, cheating, lying scum.

254
00:14:07,272 --> 00:14:09,433
And their carpet and drape scheme...

255
00:14:11,777 --> 00:14:13,039
No! No, I won't!

256
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:15,375
Get that puree of loathsomeness
away from me!

257
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,505
But you love mashed turkey and peas.

258
00:14:17,616 --> 00:14:18,981
I'm sorry. What was that?

259
00:14:19,084 --> 00:14:22,178
Sorry, I didn't quite catch that.
Did you just tell me what I love?

260
00:14:23,221 --> 00:14:27,089
Write this down, you toad-faced frump.
I love pancakes!

261
00:14:29,628 --> 00:14:30,856
Hi, little fella.

262
00:14:30,962 --> 00:14:33,089
Is Meg Griffin here?
No, she's not.

263
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:35,462
Probably out scoring more rock.

264
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:38,934
Sandy Balfour, Child Services.
We're placing this baby in a foster home.

265
00:14:39,037 --> 00:14:41,198
- What?
- For God's sake, feed me!

266
00:14:41,306 --> 00:14:43,672
Let me guess. All out of Puppy Chow?

267
00:14:43,775 --> 00:14:45,538
What an awful home for a child!

268
00:14:45,644 --> 00:14:48,112
How dare you! This is a wonderful home!

269
00:14:49,314 --> 00:14:50,872
Quagmire, you rat bastard!

270
00:14:50,982 --> 00:14:53,542
Come near my fence again,
and that'll be your head!

271
00:14:53,652 --> 00:14:54,676
Shut up!

272
00:14:54,986 --> 00:14:57,250
Honey, would you like some pancakes?

273
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,516
Oh, yes! God, yes! Take me!

274
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,118
Stewie!

275
00:15:06,064 --> 00:15:10,228
Next up is Meg Griffin,
sporting her stylishly cool, brand-new...

276
00:15:10,969 --> 00:15:14,097
A woman from Child Services
came and took Stewie!

277
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:16,333
She said we fed him dog food!

278
00:15:16,908 --> 00:15:17,966
Dog food?

279
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,405
Is that a real Prada bag?

280
00:15:20,746 --> 00:15:24,614
How in the world did you make $1,100
as a waitress in one week?

281
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,047
It's easy...

282
00:15:26,151 --> 00:15:29,450
...when you're the unwed teenage mother
of a crack-addicted baby.

283
00:15:30,789 --> 00:15:33,883
Wait a minute.
Meg, when did you become a teenager?

284
00:15:33,992 --> 00:15:35,584
She's 16, Peter.

285
00:15:35,761 --> 00:15:37,058
You knew about this?

286
00:15:37,863 --> 00:15:40,024
Welcome to your new home.

287
00:15:40,132 --> 00:15:43,659
Baby Stewie,
say hello to your new brothers and sisters.

288
00:15:45,437 --> 00:15:46,665
Hola, Stewie.

289
00:15:46,772 --> 00:15:48,239
Ni hao, Stewie.

290
00:15:48,473 --> 00:15:49,770
Stewie.

291
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:52,706
Good God!
I've been adopted by a Benetton ad!

292
00:15:56,515 --> 00:15:59,848
- I promise, it'll never happen again.
- I hope not, Mrs. Stevens.

293
00:15:59,951 --> 00:16:03,114
Because next time we won't
just take him away, we'll kill him.

294
00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:06,824
Let's see. Stanley, Starkweather, Stevens!

295
00:16:10,462 --> 00:16:12,362
So this is where babies come from?

296
00:16:12,464 --> 00:16:15,092
Yes, Chris.
This is where babies come from.

297
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:18,227
You told me I came out of your vagina!

298
00:16:18,637 --> 00:16:19,604
Next!

299
00:16:19,738 --> 00:16:21,296
Hi. Yeah, we're the Griffins.

300
00:16:22,307 --> 00:16:26,437
- I'm sorry. I can't find your paperwork.
- Look harder! I want my baby back!

301
00:16:26,545 --> 00:16:28,877
Please, let me handle this.
The name's Griffin.

302
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,643
We're the ones who fed dog food
to our crack-addicted baby.

303
00:16:33,985 --> 00:16:36,351
I never was any good
at dealing with the authorities.

304
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,558
Don't worry. I know how to handle this.

305
00:16:40,659 --> 00:16:43,059
Are you aware you were going 50 in...

306
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,991
I'm gonna have to ask you
to put your shirt down.

307
00:16:47,365 --> 00:16:50,027
Crap.
I get the one straight cop in Rhode Island.

308
00:16:52,103 --> 00:16:54,037
Damn it! I want pancakes!

309
00:16:54,372 --> 00:16:56,670
You people understand every language
except English!

310
00:16:57,175 --> 00:16:59,006
Yo quiero pancakes!

311
00:16:59,177 --> 00:17:02,203
Donnez-moi pancakes!
Click-click-bloody-click pancakes!

312
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:03,474
Poor little guy.

313
00:17:03,582 --> 00:17:06,142
"Pancakes" must be street for "crack."

314
00:17:06,251 --> 00:17:07,912
Damn those parents of his.

315
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:09,577
Sarah, forgiveness.

316
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,548
Now, Stewie,
why don't you go play with the others?

317
00:17:13,725 --> 00:17:17,058
Stewie, come complete our rainbow!

318
00:17:17,262 --> 00:17:18,752
I've got a better idea.

319
00:17:18,864 --> 00:17:21,424
Let's go play
"swallow the stuff under the sink."

320
00:17:23,101 --> 00:17:24,534
You lied to them!

321
00:17:24,636 --> 00:17:28,470
You told Child Services that we steal
lawn mowers and cheat on our taxes...

322
00:17:28,573 --> 00:17:30,734
...and worship some guy named Stan.

323
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:33,970
Actually, I said Satan. That's a typo.

324
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:36,411
We didn't know who she was!
It's not our fault!

325
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,379
No? Then whose fault is it?

326
00:17:38,483 --> 00:17:40,041
It's all of yours!

327
00:17:40,151 --> 00:17:43,882
You were all working together just fine,
but then you won that stupid trophy.

328
00:17:43,989 --> 00:17:46,924
You put some shiny hunk of metal
before your own friendships.

329
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,253
Brian's right.

330
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,956
We were so obsessed with that trophy,
we lost sight of what was really going on.

331
00:17:53,298 --> 00:17:56,495
- Now we have a real problem to deal with.
- That's right!

332
00:17:56,601 --> 00:17:59,798
Somebody tipped off the cable company
about our free Cinemax.

333
00:17:59,905 --> 00:18:00,963
Joe?

334
00:18:02,173 --> 00:18:04,437
And we have to get Stewie back!

335
00:18:04,643 --> 00:18:06,941
I remembered.
We're here to help.

336
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:08,910
And we must get our baby back.

337
00:18:09,014 --> 00:18:11,244
Right on! Let's do it!

338
00:18:11,483 --> 00:18:13,110
Rock their world!

339
00:18:16,855 --> 00:18:18,015
Yeah! Come on!

340
00:18:18,156 --> 00:18:19,987
Let's go! We can do it!

341
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:24,559
See kids? One day the world
is going to be just like our home.

342
00:18:24,663 --> 00:18:27,894
All races living together
in harmony and love.

343
00:18:30,168 --> 00:18:31,396
Pancakes!

344
00:18:31,603 --> 00:18:34,265
He must still be working the junk
out of his system.

345
00:18:34,372 --> 00:18:36,169
He needs hugs!

346
00:18:37,442 --> 00:18:38,670
Doorbell!

347
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:43,677
We're from the One World,
One People Book-of-the-Month Club.

348
00:18:43,782 --> 00:18:46,080
Is there something missing in your life?

349
00:18:46,551 --> 00:18:48,849
You know, I just bet there is.

350
00:18:49,054 --> 00:18:53,081
Sarah, we have guests!
And one of them is a homosexual!

351
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,686
They're in place!

352
00:18:56,795 --> 00:18:59,389
God, it gets me hot
when Joe lies to strangers.

353
00:18:59,497 --> 00:19:01,829
When I get him home,
I swear I'm gonna grease up...

354
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:03,628
That's fine, Debbie. Go, Chris.

355
00:19:04,202 --> 00:19:05,760
Here we go, Dad!

356
00:19:07,505 --> 00:19:10,668
Stewie, would you like
to learn how to wrap a turban?

357
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,902
Why don't you teach it to the Chinese girl?

358
00:19:13,011 --> 00:19:16,447
Or perhaps she can learn
after her people invade your country.

359
00:19:16,681 --> 00:19:19,514
Yee, would your people really do this?

360
00:19:19,651 --> 00:19:21,243
Try and stop them.

361
00:19:21,353 --> 00:19:24,516
And try and stop Pablo's people
from using drug money to buy arms...

362
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:27,750
...from Li's countrymen,
who in turn sells them to Ura's people...

363
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:30,726
...so they can ethnically cleanse
this nauseatingly diverse...

364
00:19:30,829 --> 00:19:33,491
...grab bag of genetic party favors
you call a family.

365
00:19:33,598 --> 00:19:37,090
So now you all understand, yes?
You all hate each other?

366
00:19:39,604 --> 00:19:42,198
Hosanna! It's the lesser of two evils.

367
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,668
Hey, kids. I'm Santa Claus.

368
00:19:45,844 --> 00:19:47,402
Just practicing for Christmas.

369
00:19:47,512 --> 00:19:48,945
But you're white.

370
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:51,843
Jack and Sarah told me Santa is Indian.

371
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,009
Don't be stupid! Santa is black!

372
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:56,553
Santa can't be black. We do not fear him.

373
00:19:56,688 --> 00:19:59,282
Cram it, Gandhi!
Santa is Asian.

374
00:19:59,391 --> 00:20:00,824
How can he be Asian?

375
00:20:00,925 --> 00:20:04,861
Santa doesn't drive his sled 20 miles
under the speed limit with his blinker on!

376
00:20:04,963 --> 00:20:07,261
Go back to your rice paddy, Mulan!

377
00:20:08,767 --> 00:20:10,826
Come on, Stewie.
We're out of here.

378
00:20:10,935 --> 00:20:12,630
Dance, puppets! Dance!

379
00:20:13,238 --> 00:20:15,172
Lois, we got him. It's all over.

380
00:20:15,273 --> 00:20:16,262
Careful, Peter.

381
00:20:16,374 --> 00:20:19,502
Joe and Cleveland can't stall them.
They're heading your way!

382
00:20:19,611 --> 00:20:20,669
Crap!

383
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:22,110
Hold it right there!

384
00:20:22,213 --> 00:20:23,407
Or what?

385
00:20:24,749 --> 00:20:26,114
Don't shoot!

386
00:20:26,618 --> 00:20:27,915
Now shoot!

387
00:20:29,387 --> 00:20:32,015
So, we're terribly sorry
we broke into your home.

388
00:20:32,123 --> 00:20:34,717
But we just had to
get Stewie back somehow.

389
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,989
That's a very long story.

390
00:20:37,095 --> 00:20:40,656
But we've grown attached to little Stewie.
Plus, the law's on our side.

391
00:20:40,765 --> 00:20:43,962
You people can kiss
the fattest part of my ass!

392
00:20:44,069 --> 00:20:45,366
We'll be back, Stewie.

393
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,528
Wait!

394
00:20:48,139 --> 00:20:49,800
Is that a real Prada bag?

395
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:56,806
I'd like to propose a toast to our neighbors.

396
00:20:56,915 --> 00:21:00,373
Sure they may be black, handicapped,
and a heartless sex hound...

397
00:21:00,485 --> 00:21:05,115
...but if they moved out,
some smelly Hawaiians might move in.

398
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:07,987
- Hear, hear!
- Where's Quagmire?

399
00:21:08,093 --> 00:21:10,527
If it wasn't for him,
we never would have found out...

400
00:21:10,628 --> 00:21:12,391
...where Stewie's foster family lived.

401
00:21:12,497 --> 00:21:14,556
He said he'd distract the social worker.

402
00:21:16,701 --> 00:21:21,001
Glen, honey, I have a question for you.
What do you do for a living?

403
00:21:21,339 --> 00:21:24,433
I have a question for you, too.
Why are you still here?

404
00:21:24,709 --> 00:21:26,939
What the heck happened
to that trophy anyway?

405
00:21:27,045 --> 00:21:29,445
I guess some mysteries
are better left unsolved.

406
00:21:42,393 --> 00:21:44,088
Submitted for your approval.

407
00:21:44,195 --> 00:21:48,461
A family pet with the uncontrollable urge
to bury shiny objects in the yard.

408
00:21:48,633 --> 00:21:52,694
A shameful secret that nearly buried the
peace and civility of an entire neighbor...

409
00:21:59,344 --> 00:22:02,177
Stewie seems a little feverish
after his ordeal.

410
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,510
And he keeps asking for pancakes.

411
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:06,584
Let's just let him rest.

412
00:22:07,852 --> 00:22:09,979
Flappy, what have you done to me?

413
00:22:10,088 --> 00:22:11,487
It's so hot.

414
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:13,187
Now I'm freezing!

415
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:16,419
What I wouldn't do
for one syrup-soaked bite.
