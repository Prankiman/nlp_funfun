11
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:38,121
We now return to<i> Sesame
Street,</i> now on HBO.

12
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:46,297
Oh, hi, you guys. How was school?

13
00:00:46,298 --> 00:00:48,573
Honestly, Mom, today was kind of weird.

14
00:00:48,574 --> 00:00:50,244
Every kid in school had to write a list

15
00:00:50,245 --> 00:00:52,409
of five reasons Principal
Shepherd is cool

16
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,146
and then have their parents sign it.

17
00:00:54,147 --> 00:00:56,082
What? That seems crazy.

18
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,949
One time, I saw him pee in a urinal

19
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,317
with his hands on his hips.

20
00:00:59,318 --> 00:01:00,643
That's pretty boss.

21
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:03,205
Why would the principal make
all the students do that?

22
00:01:03,206 --> 00:01:04,339
I don't know.

23
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,007
I think he's going through a tough time.

24
00:01:06,008 --> 00:01:07,542
He's in the middle of a bad divorce.

25
00:01:07,543 --> 00:01:09,110
What? How do you know that?

26
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:11,312
He's actually been pretty open about it.

27
00:01:11,313 --> 00:01:12,847
<i>Good morning, students.</i>

28
00:01:12,848 --> 00:01:14,382
<i>Today at 3:30,</i>

29
00:01:14,383 --> 00:01:17,119
<i>James Woods High will be
hosting a cross-country meet,</i>

30
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,654
<i>which also happens to be where Lorraine</i>

31
00:01:19,655 --> 00:01:22,456
<i>has threatened to take my
children, across the country.</i>

32
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,160
<i>And here's today's
"Tuesday Trivia" question:</i>

33
00:01:25,161 --> 00:01:26,795
<i>Does this sound like yelling?</i>

34
00:01:26,796 --> 00:01:27,896
<i>Because, apparently, this sounds</i>

35
00:01:27,897 --> 00:01:29,482
<i>to some people like yelling.</i>

36
00:01:35,254 --> 00:01:37,339
All right, finally some peace and quiet,

37
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,342
so I can buckle down and
get some writing done.

38
00:01:43,245 --> 00:01:45,080
- Hey, Bonnie!
- What?

39
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:48,083
Listen to this. Say, "It's
all been a pack of lies."

40
00:01:48,084 --> 00:01:49,851
What? Why?

41
00:01:49,852 --> 00:01:53,154
Just do it! Just say, "It's
all been a pack of lies."

42
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:54,989
"It's all been a pack of lies."

43
00:01:57,692 --> 00:01:59,927
That sounded really good.

44
00:01:59,928 --> 00:02:02,263
Thanks, babe. Hey, you know
what that song's about?

45
00:02:02,264 --> 00:02:06,200
Phil Collins watching some
guy watch another guy drown.

46
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:08,837
And then, the next night,
he invited the watching guy

47
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:10,671
to be in the front row of his concert

48
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,941
so he could sing it right to him
and they could arrest the guy!

49
00:02:13,942 --> 00:02:15,876
Really? Why wouldn't he have just

50
00:02:15,877 --> 00:02:17,746
helped the guy who was drowning?

51
00:02:17,747 --> 00:02:20,047
I don't know, I think he was
on a bridge or something.

52
00:02:20,048 --> 00:02:23,551
Like, he could see it, but he
couldn't get there in time.

53
00:02:23,552 --> 00:02:25,520
But he let a whole day pass?

54
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:27,254
Why didn't he call the cops?

55
00:02:27,255 --> 00:02:29,090
'Cause he was busy writing the song!

56
00:02:29,091 --> 00:02:31,225
Wait, if he just watched,

57
00:02:31,226 --> 00:02:33,194
doesn't that also make
him a little guilty?

58
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:35,196
Look, I'm not saying we
wouldn't bring Phil Collins

59
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:36,730
in for questioning.

60
00:02:36,731 --> 00:02:39,634
I feel like maybe this story is bogus.

61
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:42,136
Hang on, let me check Snopes.

62
00:02:42,137 --> 00:02:43,771
Yeah, none of that happened.

63
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,040
Hey. What's up?

64
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,409
Well, I'm trying to work on a sequel

65
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,826
to<i> The Old Man and the Sea.</i>

66
00:02:49,827 --> 00:02:51,445
Are you, are you allowed to do that?

67
00:02:51,446 --> 00:02:54,448
But I can't get anything done.
It's so damn loud around here.

68
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:56,584
Oh, yeah, that's what Hemingway
used to complain about.

69
00:02:56,585 --> 00:02:58,886
"This Spanish Civil
War is just too loud.

70
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,621
How am I supposed to get anything done?"

71
00:03:00,622 --> 00:03:02,223
No, I mean, it might sound silly,

72
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,492
but I used to daydream that by now

73
00:03:04,493 --> 00:03:06,894
I'd have my own place
by a lake somewhere,

74
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,629
an oasis where I could go to write.

75
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,898
Pay the bills by renting out the rooms.

76
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,067
Oh, like a B and B? That could be fun.

77
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:14,635
What? What are you talking about?

78
00:03:14,636 --> 00:03:16,937
I'm talking about you and
me opening a B and B.

79
00:03:16,938 --> 00:03:18,672
Are you serious? That'd be great!

80
00:03:18,673 --> 00:03:19,907
Sure. It'll be fun.

81
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,242
All right, let's give it a try.

82
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:23,811
Can't be any worse than when
I was on the Night's Watch.

83
00:03:23,812 --> 00:03:27,200
Hey, guys, you all want
to say the oath again?

84
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,355
For the watch.

85
00:03:34,356 --> 00:03:36,090
For the watch.

86
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:38,325
For the watch.

87
00:03:38,326 --> 00:03:39,861
Hi, Brian.

88
00:03:39,862 --> 00:03:41,328
I'm the boring storyline

89
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:43,030
of the fat guy that's
watching that girl.

90
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:44,798
And I'm<i> Ballers.</i>

91
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,501
Ow!

92
00:03:47,502 --> 00:03:50,456
I totally get it. You're
right to do this.

93
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,179
Well, well, if it isn't Meg Griffin.

94
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,947
Leave me alone, you guys.

95
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,616
Relax. We're taking the
day off from bullying.

96
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,236
Oh, thank God.

97
00:04:07,905 --> 00:04:10,958
Very funny. Who put the Ark
of the Covenant in here?

98
00:04:13,028 --> 00:04:14,795
Meg is so stupid.

99
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,364
She couldn't handle the
glory of God's love.

100
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:20,467
Students, faculty and staff
of James Woods High,

101
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,137
does anyone know how to push down

102
00:04:22,138 --> 00:04:23,572
the backseat of a Highlander?

103
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:26,575
I know I can make a bed in
there, I just don't know how.

104
00:04:26,576 --> 00:04:29,043
Oh, my God, Principal
Shepherd, what's wrong?

105
00:04:29,044 --> 00:04:31,680
I just listened to two
hours of butt-dialed sex

106
00:04:31,681 --> 00:04:34,149
between my wife and the ADT alarm guy.

107
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,150
Why didn't you just hang up?

108
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,752
Because I miss the sound of her voice.

109
00:04:38,753 --> 00:04:42,323
Oh, my God!

110
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:43,591
P.A.):<i> Principal Shepherd,</i>

111
00:04:43,592 --> 00:04:45,025
<i>your wife is on the line.</i>

112
00:04:45,026 --> 00:04:49,414
<i>She says, "Uh, uh, oh, God, harder."</i>

113
00:04:55,686 --> 00:04:58,772
Man, I still can't get over
how perfect this place is.

114
00:04:58,773 --> 00:05:01,508
I know, it's going to be
such a darling B and B.

115
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,577
I got the boiler up and
running, Mr. Griffin.

116
00:05:03,578 --> 00:05:04,912
Well, we don't have a boiler,

117
00:05:04,913 --> 00:05:07,381
but I can't wait to see what
you've done in the cellar.

118
00:05:07,382 --> 00:05:10,584
Oh, also, please rub the "H"
and the "C" off all the knobs,

119
00:05:10,585 --> 00:05:12,454
so people won't know what
the hell's going on.

120
00:05:12,455 --> 00:05:14,923
I want the first four
minutes of every shower

121
00:05:14,924 --> 00:05:17,076
to be confusion and anger.

122
00:05:21,212 --> 00:05:23,230
Welcome, members of
our school community.

123
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:25,299
Let's call to order
this emergency meeting

124
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,569
of the school board regarding
Principal Shepherd's meltdown.

125
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,105
I know a number of our
students have felt

126
00:05:31,106 --> 00:05:34,808
"traumatized" by the
events of this week,

127
00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:37,779
and we take those
concerns very seriously.

128
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,414
Lois, I'm done with my gum.

129
00:05:40,415 --> 00:05:41,483
I don't want it.

130
00:05:41,484 --> 00:05:42,817
But I'm done with it.

131
00:05:42,818 --> 00:05:44,318
Peter, shh.

132
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,804
I'll take it.

133
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:50,091
So, due to his erratic
behavior, we have placed

134
00:05:50,092 --> 00:05:52,894
Principal Shepherd on
indefinite paid leave.

135
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:55,796
Typically, Vice Principal
McGuire would step in.

136
00:05:55,797 --> 00:05:57,798
However, I was informed earlier today

137
00:05:57,799 --> 00:05:59,900
that she was found dead in her car.

138
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,938
Therefore, the board is
seeking a parent volunteer

139
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:06,774
to serve as interim principal

140
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:09,009
until a permanent
replacement can be found.

141
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,478
Hey, Lois, maybe I should do
it. I've always wanted a job

142
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:13,315
where I can let my dandruff go wild.

143
00:06:13,316 --> 00:06:14,649
What? No way.

144
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,784
I'm not having my dad be the principal.

145
00:06:16,785 --> 00:06:18,353
How embarrassing!

146
00:06:18,354 --> 00:06:20,255
Yeah, no offense,
Peter, but I don't know

147
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:21,822
if you should be running a school.

148
00:06:21,823 --> 00:06:23,858
What are you talking about?
I'm a natural leader.

149
00:06:23,859 --> 00:06:26,527
That's why I'm so good
at leading Simon Says.

150
00:06:26,528 --> 00:06:28,613
Simon says, "Leave the band."

151
00:06:30,282 --> 00:06:31,832
Yeah, I don't know.

152
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,702
Well, you know what? You guys are wrong.

153
00:06:33,703 --> 00:06:35,135
And I'm gonna prove it to you.

154
00:06:35,136 --> 00:06:36,837
Again, any volunteers?

155
00:06:36,838 --> 00:06:38,872
I'll be your new principal!

156
00:06:38,873 --> 00:06:41,810
Wonderful. Why don't you come
on up and introduce yourself.

157
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:45,512
All right. James Woods High
cheerleaders, give me a hand!

158
00:06:47,682 --> 00:06:48,949
Check. Him out.

159
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,351
Check. Check him out.

160
00:06:50,352 --> 00:06:52,019
- My name is Peter.
- Check.

161
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,822
- That ain't no lie.
- Check.

162
00:06:53,823 --> 00:06:57,524
I go pop, pop, fizz, fizz,
oh, how sweet it is.

163
00:06:57,525 --> 00:06:58,811
Check! Check!

164
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,720
I'm done with this gum now.

165
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:02,890
I don't want it.

166
00:07:02,891 --> 00:07:04,127
But I'm done with it.

167
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,399
Mom, why was this
Listerine in the garbage?

168
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,568
Oh, your father says he
doesn't need it anymore

169
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,337
now that he's a high school principal.

170
00:07:17,338 --> 00:07:19,571
Oh, my God, he's not
really doing that, is he?

171
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:22,075
I'm only gonna get bullied worse now.

172
00:07:22,076 --> 00:07:23,676
Hello, Breakfast Club.

173
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:26,713
As a principal, I like
to start each morning

174
00:07:26,714 --> 00:07:28,647
with a reference from last century.

175
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,582
Dad, I don't want you to do this.

176
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,051
Too late. I've already been practicing

177
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:35,054
giving students awkward and
uncoordinated high fives.

178
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:36,339
Chris, if I may?

179
00:07:38,008 --> 00:07:41,727
Yay! Two fingers and
side-of-the-palm contact.

180
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:42,895
Perfect!

181
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:45,164
All right, I got to get to work by 7:40,

182
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:47,232
'cause that's when high school
starts for some reason.

183
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:50,869
See you at the
way-too-early 10:40 lunch.

184
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,107
I feel you, Meg.

185
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:56,559
- Shut up.
- You shut up!

186
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:05,217
Wow, look at us. Running a B and B.

187
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,854
Yes, so far, all the
guests seem very happy.

188
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:09,289
Hi, we're checking out.

189
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,023
Just charge my card.

190
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,791
That's weird, that's the fifth couple

191
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,693
to check out after only an hour.

192
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,563
Hi, we'd like a room, please.

193
00:08:16,564 --> 00:08:18,464
Wait, I'm sorry, weren't
you just here a moment ago

194
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:21,100
with a different man... oh, crap.

195
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:23,269
Stewie, we have a problem.
The only people checking in

196
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,971
are here to have sex with prostitutes.

197
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:26,371
What? Nonsense.

198
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:28,308
Well, then why are they all
signing the guest book

199
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:29,741
and writing quaint things like,

200
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:32,277
"Railed Crystal good." Oh...

201
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:33,745
Damn it, this is awful.

202
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,548
How could I have not noticed sooner?

203
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:36,582
I mean, it's more obvious

204
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,218
than when George Takei
was in the closet.

205
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,786
Hey, George, how are you?

206
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:43,122
I am a heterosexual.

207
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,058
I love vaginas.

208
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,327
So, what are you doing tonight?

209
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:51,130
Hopefully, choking on
some lovely lady parts.

210
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:52,765
Oh, nummers.

211
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:54,634
All right, that sounds
fun. See you later.

212
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:57,588
I am a heterosexual.

213
00:09:01,691 --> 00:09:02,842
Good morning, children.

214
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:05,645
I am your interim
principal, Mr. Griffin.

215
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:07,646
And to show I'm a fun principal,

216
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,481
I'm gonna do the Ice Bucket Challenge.

217
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:10,683
Three years too late,

218
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:12,452
but right on time for a principal.

219
00:09:12,453 --> 00:09:15,473
And making no less sense than
it did when it was current.

220
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:21,995
You're welcome, person who's
probably already dead.

221
00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:24,429
But, hey, now I got
something even more fun.

222
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,166
How about we all do an
expertly choreographed lip-dub

223
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,800
to a popular song.

224
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:37,342

234
00:10:01,884 --> 00:10:03,902
Ladies, this is my associate.

235
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,071
Brian, bitches. Bitches, Brian.

236
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,506
What... what's all this?

237
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:10,309
This, Brian, is called diversification.

238
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,212
You see, if our guests insist on

239
00:10:12,213 --> 00:10:14,146
bringing prostitutes into our B and B,

240
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,181
we might as well provide the women, too.

241
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,384
What? Stewie, we're not
gonna become pimps.

242
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:19,651
Are you sure?

243
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,386
I'm sure. The answer is no,

244
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:22,921
so don't bother flashing a wad of money,

245
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,723
because there's no way I'm
gonna change my answer

246
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,092
in the middle of this sentence...

247
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:28,060
Okay, maybe we could try it
out and see how it goes.

248
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:29,595
Hey, what are you girls
doing standing around?!

249
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:30,563
Get to work!

250
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:33,098
Ha-ha! I'm telling you,

251
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:35,901
that dog is very easily persuaded.

252
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:38,938
Now let's see what's going
on at the old high school.

253
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:40,740
Ooh...

254
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:42,942
Doo-ooh...

255
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:44,028
Doo...

256
00:10:48,297 --> 00:10:49,915
Hey, guys, guys.

257
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,617
When Borat was making announcements

258
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:54,520
over the P.A. this morning, that was me.

259
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,722
What?! Shut the front door.

260
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:59,592
Taco Tuesday is nice.

261
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:01,727
Knock it off! Give me back my lunch.

262
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,129
What do we got here?

263
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,464
Grape juice in a Ziploc bag?

264
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:07,383
I have to make my own Capri Suns.

265
00:11:09,653 --> 00:11:11,103
Hey, stupid, what the
hell are you doing?

266
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:12,204
That's my daughter!

267
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,606
Yeah? What are you gonna do about it?

268
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:15,974
What am I gonna do about it?

269
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,376
I'll knock your teeth down your throat

270
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:19,077
and out your butt, you little bastard!

271
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,579
Oh, you think that's funny,

272
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,414
him spilling juice all over the floor?

273
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:23,949
This is gonna make
people's sneakers sticky,

274
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,450
and then we're gonna
have to listen to...

275
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:27,786
all day!

276
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:28,887
Well, I won't have it.

277
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,222
Get on your knees and lick that up!

278
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:32,558
What? A-Are you serious?

279
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,345
Yeah, I'm serious. I'm the principal!

280
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,602
Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed.

281
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,004
What are you talking about?

282
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:47,339
That jerk is finally
getting what he deserves.

283
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,308
Yeah, Meg, now that your
dad's the principal,

284
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,644
you could finally have
power over the bullies.

285
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:53,445
Now, you little punks get to class.

286
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,347
And if you see Miss
Millikan, tell her I said,

287
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:57,116
"Hey, what's up?"

288
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:58,818
Huh.

289
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:00,285
Maybe you're right.

290
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,688
Wow, Dad, that was really something.

291
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:04,089
Miss Millikan's just a friend.

292
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,491
Oh, I don't mean that.

293
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:06,925
I mean the way you handled those guys

294
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,294
that were picking on me.

295
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:10,862
Really? I felt like I kind
of lost my cool there.

296
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,164
Not at all.

297
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,966
That's what you've got to do more of.

298
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,601
- You were like a real principal there.
- I was?

299
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:19,137
Yeah. In fact, if you're
gonna lead this school,

300
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:21,473
you've got to know that
kids need discipline.

301
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,342
Especially kids like them.

302
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:24,876
And their friends, Jeremy and Bridget.

303
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,379
Oh, really?

304
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,448
Where might I find this
Jeremy and Bridget?

305
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,483
I don't know, study hall, second floor?

306
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:36,823
All right, listen up,
maggots! Fun's over!

307
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:38,857
There's gonna be some
changes around here,

308
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,693
and what better way to
show you I'm serious

309
00:12:40,694 --> 00:12:43,213
than to smash a desk
with a baseball bat?

310
00:12:58,827 --> 00:13:00,496
Oh!

311
00:13:25,422 --> 00:13:27,173
Okay, we'll pick this up on Monday.

312
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:29,107
Do any of you know my wife Lois?

313
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:30,909
Tell her I'm on the bats
and to come get me.

314
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,928
She'll know what it means.

315
00:13:37,668 --> 00:13:39,136
Let's go. Keep it moving.

316
00:13:39,137 --> 00:13:40,969
Get to class. Hey, you.

317
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,238
You salute that flag
when you walk by, kid.

318
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,940
Loads of people fought for that thing,

319
00:13:44,941 --> 00:13:46,475
including yours truly.

320
00:13:46,476 --> 00:13:48,310
Y-You were in the service?

321
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:51,379
I may have misunderstood
what "yours truly" means.

322
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,814
Hey, Dad, listen.

323
00:13:52,815 --> 00:13:54,448
The four of us got together last night,

324
00:13:54,449 --> 00:13:56,985
and we came up with a
list of 11 students

325
00:13:56,986 --> 00:13:59,287
and two teachers that you
need to do something about.

326
00:13:59,288 --> 00:14:00,889
Maybe you should start
with Mark Rutledge.

327
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,290
Why? What'd he do?

328
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,426
He wouldn't kiss Ruth at
the Sadie Hawkins dance,

329
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:05,727
even though she bought him dinner before

330
00:14:05,728 --> 00:14:07,229
at Walt's Roast Beef.

331
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,064
Well, I don't see how that's
got anything to do...

332
00:14:09,065 --> 00:14:10,264
And he called you fat.

333
00:14:10,265 --> 00:14:11,600
Oh, I'm gonna squish him!

334
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:12,801
That's right.

335
00:14:12,802 --> 00:14:14,603
Don't take any crap from anyone.

336
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:15,803
Oh, I won't.

337
00:14:15,804 --> 00:14:17,672
I'm gonna take down all these punks,

338
00:14:17,673 --> 00:14:20,475
just like I did in my
1980s crime series,

339
00:14:20,476 --> 00:14:23,078
<i>Gary Ratowski, Hockey Cop.</i>

340
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:24,446
Gimme that purse!

341
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,157
Hey, criminals.

342
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,150
Puck you!

343
00:14:32,255 --> 00:14:34,641
Get the puck out of my neighborhood.

344
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,527
Go puck yourself.

345
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:41,281
Uh-oh, here come the real cops.

346
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,819
<i>Hockey Cop,</i> not a cop.

347
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:51,706
All right, ladies, I'm going to put this

348
00:14:51,707 --> 00:14:53,341
as gently as I can,

349
00:14:53,342 --> 00:14:55,110
but it appears that someone's rectum

350
00:14:55,111 --> 00:14:56,711
fell out on the stairs.

351
00:14:56,712 --> 00:14:59,380
Now, whose is it? Be honest.

352
00:14:59,381 --> 00:15:00,682
All right, that's fine.

353
00:15:00,683 --> 00:15:02,450
But let's just agree on a rule

354
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:04,653
that if your rectum falls
out on the stairs,

355
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,054
it's on you to pick it up.

356
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:07,688
Look at that, Brian.

357
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:10,457
Our day has just begun, and
there's a line out the door.

358
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,126
I know, we're raking it in.

359
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,495
This is a hell of a lot easier

360
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,129
than when I delivered
pizza in New Orleans.

361
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:18,633

378
00:15:52,335 --> 00:15:54,568
And for Jason O'Neil,

379
00:15:54,569 --> 00:15:56,238
maybe you could pants
him during an assembly.

380
00:15:56,239 --> 00:15:57,872
Yes, good. I like that.

381
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:00,674
Oh, hi, you two. What
are you working on?

382
00:16:00,675 --> 00:16:02,009
Oh, nothing.

383
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:04,745
I, um... I'm just helping Dad

384
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:06,514
with his schedule for tomorrow.

385
00:16:06,515 --> 00:16:09,117
You know, he's really doing a great job.

386
00:16:09,118 --> 00:16:11,620
He's actually made the
school a lot better.

387
00:16:11,621 --> 00:16:14,355
Huh. Well, I got to
admit I was skeptical,

388
00:16:14,356 --> 00:16:16,758
but it sounds like things are
going pretty well down there.

389
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:18,193
You bet they are.

390
00:16:18,194 --> 00:16:20,074
They'll go even better after The Purge.

391
00:16:20,075 --> 00:16:21,034
The what?

392
00:16:21,035 --> 00:16:23,063
Hey, Meg, how about one of these?

393
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:25,734
One of them things, yeah?

394
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,402
Peter, what the hell are you doing?

395
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:30,438
Uh, he's just saying he
wants to use his key

396
00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:33,575
to drive me to school
tomorrow in his car.

397
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:36,378
Peter, what exactly are you
doing down at that school?

398
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:37,712
I'll tell you what I'm doing.

399
00:16:37,713 --> 00:16:39,480
I'm doing a great job,

400
00:16:39,481 --> 00:16:41,249
like when I was a pro football kicker.

401
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,422
Yay! Now I can fist
bump with black guys.

402
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,423
Nailed it, Peter!

403
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,491
There you go!

404
00:16:49,492 --> 00:16:50,925
Yeah! We going to the club tonight?

405
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,913
- Not you!
- Okay!

406
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,401
Hey, Brian, what's a "splat job"?

407
00:16:59,402 --> 00:17:00,802
I-I don't, I don't know, Stewie.

408
00:17:00,803 --> 00:17:02,856
I'm worried that you're seeing too much.

409
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,674
Good morning, ladies.

410
00:17:05,675 --> 00:17:08,076
Were the paramedics able
to resuscitate Lamar Odom?

411
00:17:08,077 --> 00:17:09,677
They're still working on it.

412
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:19,321
He's tall, get it?

413
00:17:19,322 --> 00:17:21,323
Okay, show's over.
Everybody back to work.

414
00:17:21,324 --> 00:17:23,491
Yeah, about that. We got to talk.

415
00:17:23,492 --> 00:17:25,260
Oh, uh, sure. What's up?

416
00:17:25,261 --> 00:17:29,130
We just realized we can keep all
the money, take your house,

417
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,833
and kill you if you try
to do anything about it.

418
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:34,135
All right, we're just gonna step outside

419
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,355
and figure out a counter.

420
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,141
And they locked us out.

421
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,277
What about my loaf of
cinnamon raisin bread?!

422
00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:44,697
It's mine! It's not for the whole house!

423
00:17:53,805 --> 00:17:56,024
Let's just go. They won.

424
00:17:56,025 --> 00:17:58,078
Oh, we'll see about that.

425
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:01,529
Hello, I'd like to report a brothel

426
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,815
operating on Route 6,
near Round Hill Road.

427
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:04,818
Thank you.

428
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:07,229
You want to eat mangled raisin bread

429
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,671
across the street and watch
the cops raid the place?

430
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:12,340
Yeah, I'd like that.

431
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,322
Oh, here comes the UPS guy.

432
00:18:26,323 --> 00:18:29,391
Oh, I bet he's delivering those
marmalade jars we ordered.

433
00:18:29,392 --> 00:18:31,559
Doesn't that feel like
a million years ago?

434
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,161
Yeah, we don't need those anymore.

435
00:18:33,162 --> 00:18:35,014
Sorry, just send them back.

436
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,235
You can just do that?

437
00:18:39,236 --> 00:18:41,318
Oh, yeah, you can just refuse delivery.

438
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,554
You've never done that?

439
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:44,997
I-I genuinely did not
know you could do that.

440
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,550
Well, you can. Anything you order.

441
00:18:46,551 --> 00:18:48,885
If you don't sign for
it, it has to go back.

442
00:18:48,886 --> 00:18:50,021
Everyone does it.

443
00:18:50,022 --> 00:18:51,655
Most of what America is now

444
00:18:51,656 --> 00:18:54,291
is just boxes going back and forth.

445
00:18:59,964 --> 00:19:03,133
Students, this is a
chair without a seat.

446
00:19:03,134 --> 00:19:06,069
Jeff Banfield, I'd like you
to please come down here,

447
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,637
take your pants off and sit.

448
00:19:07,638 --> 00:19:09,506
Me? What did I do?

449
00:19:09,507 --> 00:19:11,242
You know what you did, Jeff!

450
00:19:11,243 --> 00:19:12,976
I don't even know what's going on!

451
00:19:12,977 --> 00:19:14,477
Just go, Jeff, or he'll start

452
00:19:14,478 --> 00:19:16,246
hitting that trash can
with a spoon again.

453
00:19:16,247 --> 00:19:18,566
That means now, Mr. Banfield!

454
00:19:25,769 --> 00:19:27,570
What is going on here?

455
00:19:27,571 --> 00:19:29,274
Just a little of the three "R" s...

456
00:19:29,275 --> 00:19:32,146
Reading, writing and
wrecking this guy's sack.

457
00:19:32,524 --> 00:19:35,444
The school board received
a very serious complaint.

458
00:19:35,445 --> 00:19:38,923
Mr. Griffin, you are hereby
relieved of your duties.

459
00:19:38,924 --> 00:19:40,810
A promotion?

460
00:19:40,811 --> 00:19:42,464
No, you're fired.

461
00:19:42,465 --> 00:19:44,392
We've reinstated Principal Shepherd.

462
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:46,059
Wait,<i> he's</i> back?

463
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,563
But he had that crazy
meltdown about his divorce.

464
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:51,165
Yes, but then I went on
a sex trip to Thailand,

465
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,601
and I banged all the
goofy right out of me.

466
00:19:53,602 --> 00:19:55,336
Wait. Dad's fired?

467
00:19:55,337 --> 00:19:57,055
Who did this? Who turned him in?

468
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,968
I did.

469
00:19:58,969 --> 00:20:00,240
Hi, Mrs. Griffin!

470
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:02,093
Hi. Hi, Patty.

471
00:20:03,144 --> 00:20:04,345
Why, Mom?

472
00:20:04,346 --> 00:20:07,315
Because what you and your father
have been doing is wrong.

473
00:20:07,316 --> 00:20:09,201
We'll talk about this at home.

474
00:20:10,803 --> 00:20:13,621
Well, I guess your mom
was right all along.

475
00:20:13,622 --> 00:20:16,257
I had no business running a school.

476
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:18,526
Can I be honest with you, Dad?

477
00:20:18,527 --> 00:20:20,495
I thought you were awesome.

478
00:20:20,496 --> 00:20:22,930
You stood up for all the
kids who get picked on.

479
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:24,799
You stood up for<i> me.</i>

480
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,468
Wow, so... so you think I did
a good job being principal?

481
00:20:28,469 --> 00:20:31,791
No, you did a good job being my dad.

482
00:20:37,062 --> 00:20:39,146
Come on, Meg, let's go home.

483
00:20:39,147 --> 00:20:41,315
And next time I want to
get back at your bullies,

484
00:20:41,316 --> 00:20:42,950
I'll do it the old-fashioned way...

485
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:46,406
As a grown man beating up
teenagers in a parking lot.

486
00:20:49,341 --> 00:20:52,660
I'm planning on dying tonight.

487
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:54,813
What are your plans?

488
00:20:55,683 --> 00:20:57,684
