1
00:01:51,773 --> 00:01:57,803
How come I'm never employee of the month?
It's the worstjob since the Sand People choir.

2
00:01:57,893 --> 00:02:00,965
And a one, and a two...

3
00:02:03,173 --> 00:02:07,610
No. The altos were early.
This is the worst glee club I've ever...

4
00:02:07,693 --> 00:02:11,049
Come on. Where are you going?
The benefit's tomorrow.

5
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:15,206
Relax. They frighten easily,
but they'll be back. And in greater numbers.

6
00:02:15,293 --> 00:02:18,922
- That'll give us a richer harmony.
- It's gonna sound fantastic.

7
00:02:30,853 --> 00:02:34,766
Help! Somebody! I'm blacking out!

8
00:02:34,853 --> 00:02:37,242
Brian, help me!

9
00:02:48,893 --> 00:02:52,727
Thatjerk Opie got employee of the month
again because my boss hates me.

10
00:02:52,813 --> 00:02:55,646
Maybe you need to
brown-nose her a little bit, Peter.

11
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:59,487
Really? I thought you said she was ugly.
Oh, you mean kiss up to her.

12
00:02:59,573 --> 00:03:04,931
- That's a great idea, Joe.
- If that doesn't do it, work hard and be polite.

13
00:03:05,013 --> 00:03:07,891
That's how I won friends
when I worked for E!.

14
00:03:07,973 --> 00:03:11,761
Seabiscuit. Would you mind talking to E!?

15
00:03:11,853 --> 00:03:14,287
I'm not Seabiscuit, I'm Penélope Cruz.

16
00:03:14,373 --> 00:03:16,443
And you're just lovely.

17
00:03:16,533 --> 00:03:19,001
Would you like a carrot?

18
00:03:21,053 --> 00:03:22,532
Good girl.

19
00:03:22,613 --> 00:03:26,401
Brown-nose?
All right. I'll do something special for her.

20
00:03:31,413 --> 00:03:34,769
- Surprise!
- What the hell are you doing at my house?

21
00:03:34,853 --> 00:03:39,927
I asked around and everybody said you liked
animals, so I organised a surprise cockfight.

22
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,688
Oh, boy.

23
00:03:44,773 --> 00:03:46,809
Oh, God.

24
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:50,568
Well, it looks like they killed each other.

25
00:03:50,653 --> 00:03:54,566
That was probably
what all that racket was about an hour ago.

26
00:03:54,653 --> 00:03:58,168
Well, I will see you Monday.

27
00:04:06,093 --> 00:04:08,288
Oh, crap.

28
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:12,366
Well, looks like the good Lord
just sent me a conversation starter.

29
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:15,604
Come here, Jesse. Come get the ball.

30
00:04:36,093 --> 00:04:37,970
How unfortunate.

31
00:04:38,053 --> 00:04:42,012
Stewie's really been acting out a lot at home
and I was just wondering,

32
00:04:42,093 --> 00:04:44,561
how's he been behaving at school?

33
00:04:44,653 --> 00:04:49,363
Mrs Griffin, let me show you
some pictures he drew in class.

34
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:57,491
- Notice anything unusual?
- I sure do. His father's not in any of them.

35
00:04:57,573 --> 00:05:01,771
- Exactly.
- Peter's been preoccupied with work lately.

36
00:05:01,853 --> 00:05:07,086
I guess Stewie's been missing his father.
Thank you for letting me know.

37
00:05:07,693 --> 00:05:12,209
Damn! She moved. I suppose it's not the
first time someone's made a miscalculation.

38
00:05:16,493 --> 00:05:20,771
- What happens to us in the future?
- It's your kids. Something's gotta be done.

39
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:24,528
- What do you mean?
- Your daughter marries a black man.

40
00:05:24,613 --> 00:05:28,162
- That's actually not a big deal for me.
- Yeah. Me neither.

41
00:05:28,253 --> 00:05:31,051
Well, it... You... Really?

42
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:35,968
- Yeah. I mean, what's wrong with that?
- Nothing. It's nothing, I guess.

43
00:05:36,053 --> 00:05:40,729
- I think it's great. Congratulations.
- I don't think I'm comfortable around you.

44
00:05:40,813 --> 00:05:44,203
- Peanut butter was invented by a black man.
- Too late, Doc.

45
00:05:48,573 --> 00:05:51,041
Hi, Herbert. What brings you here?

46
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:54,887
It seems your son's baseball
broke one of my windows the other day.

47
00:05:54,973 --> 00:05:57,567
Oh, my God. I am so sorry.

48
00:05:57,653 --> 00:06:00,850
Chris, this is gonna
come out of your allowance.

49
00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:02,924
Perhaps we could work something out.

50
00:06:03,013 --> 00:06:07,052
I could use a strapping young man
to do some chores around my house.

51
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:10,409
That seems fair to me.
You have damaged this man's property.

52
00:06:10,493 --> 00:06:13,883
Until you pay off the debt,
you'll do whateverjob he wants you to.

53
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:18,808
At the end of the day, if you're exhausted and
your face is wet, it means you did a good job.

54
00:06:18,893 --> 00:06:20,690
That sounds fine.

55
00:06:20,773 --> 00:06:23,241
I don't want to spend my weekend
doing chores.

56
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:27,645
Chris, a little hard work can do wonders.
Just look at how they built the pyramids.

57
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:32,807
All peoples must go through hard times.
We Jews are getting ours out of the way early.

58
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:36,408
From hereon out,
it's gonna be nothing but smooth sailing.

59
00:06:38,373 --> 00:06:42,924
- I have an announcement to make.
- Don't you do it. Don't lose a single pound.

60
00:06:43,013 --> 00:06:46,528
I don't care what Hollywood
imagemakers say. Big women are sexy.

61
00:06:46,613 --> 00:06:52,165
I wanted to tell you Opie will not be receiving
employee of the month. He's being promoted.

62
00:06:52,253 --> 00:06:54,562
Yes! That means I'm employee of the month.

63
00:06:54,653 --> 00:06:57,486
No, you're not, Griffin.
I'm giving it to Soundwave.

64
00:06:57,573 --> 00:06:59,882
So I can just put my stuff anywhere?

65
00:07:03,573 --> 00:07:06,326
My wife, Denise.
We met in a Christian chat room.

66
00:07:08,693 --> 00:07:13,403
- We need to talk about your son.
- The fat one or the funny-looking one?

67
00:07:13,493 --> 00:07:16,690
Dad called you fat. Wait.

68
00:07:16,773 --> 00:07:20,766
Stewie's been acting out. I think
it's cos he's not spending time with you.

69
00:07:20,853 --> 00:07:26,485
It's time you take an interest. Starting today,
I want you to spend more time with Stewie.

70
00:07:26,573 --> 00:07:31,727
OK. You can make a box fort. See?
Here's a box. You can pretend it's a fort.

71
00:07:31,813 --> 00:07:35,886
Actually, that sounds like fun.
I want this. I'm king in here.

72
00:07:35,973 --> 00:07:38,931
Peter, maybe Stewie
would like to play fort too.

73
00:07:39,013 --> 00:07:42,369
No. If you need me, I'll be in space.

74
00:07:46,293 --> 00:07:48,284
Great idea bringing Stewie here.

75
00:07:48,373 --> 00:07:52,810
There's no better place for a father and son
to get to know each other than a ball game.

76
00:07:52,893 --> 00:07:54,372
Where is Stewie?

77
00:07:57,493 --> 00:08:01,725
- Is that a baby in there?
- Oh, my God. He's gonna miss the game.

78
00:08:03,693 --> 00:08:08,005
Hey, remember those hot homeless twins
who live under the overpass? Last night...

79
00:08:08,093 --> 00:08:11,563
Wait, Quagmire. Let me cover Stewie's ears.

80
00:08:23,933 --> 00:08:26,925
And this is the hand
that caused all the trouble.

81
00:08:27,013 --> 00:08:29,573
Got your nose, little guy.

82
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:37,165
Peter, did you take Stewie to a strip club?
He smells like sweat and fear.

83
00:08:37,253 --> 00:08:42,611
Let me tell you, Tuesday afternoon is not
exactly their A squad. I saw bullet wounds.

84
00:08:42,693 --> 00:08:45,765
You can'tjust take him places you want to go.
He's a baby.

85
00:08:45,853 --> 00:08:48,970
I think I know how to spend time
with my own kid, all right?

86
00:08:49,053 --> 00:08:51,442
The bond between a father and son is sacred.

87
00:08:53,413 --> 00:08:56,052
I'm sorry, Jesus, but my house, my rules.

88
00:08:56,133 --> 00:08:59,443
Up yours, Joseph. You're not my real dad.

89
00:09:01,693 --> 00:09:04,048
- Hello?
- Hey, Dad. It's me.

90
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:07,921
Listen, things here aren't working out
any more, and I was wondering,

91
00:09:08,013 --> 00:09:10,607
can I come live with you and Janet
for a while?

92
00:09:10,693 --> 00:09:15,130
Wow, kiddo. You know, I'd love that,
but I don't know if now is the best time.

93
00:09:15,213 --> 00:09:19,604
Maybe next year, OK? I'll see you Friday
night. Tell your mother I sent the cheque.

94
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:22,685
- So where were we?
- Right about here.

95
00:09:22,773 --> 00:09:27,051
- Come on, baby. It's my birthday.
- No.

96
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:32,002
All I'm saying is that you just need to find
an activity that you and Stewie can share.

97
00:09:32,093 --> 00:09:34,926
Peter, can you reach that box of rice?

98
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:37,643
Sorry, Lois.

99
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:40,805
That rice got you, bitch.

100
00:09:40,893 --> 00:09:43,851
He's laughing.
You think that's funny? You like that?

101
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:47,243
Lois, you want some beans with that rice?

102
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,528
I misjudged you, fat man.

103
00:09:49,613 --> 00:09:55,722
- Dammit. Peter, what's wrong with you?
- Wait, Lois, don't move. Stewie's loving this.

104
00:09:55,813 --> 00:09:57,531
See if she's got any cash on her.

105
00:10:01,093 --> 00:10:03,402
OK, Stewie. Get the camera ready.

106
00:10:06,013 --> 00:10:09,449
Peter, stop it. What the hell are you doing?

107
00:10:09,533 --> 00:10:13,765
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm bonding with Stewie.

108
00:10:19,213 --> 00:10:22,523
There is nothing more precious
than a baby's laughter.

109
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:12,091
- I hope she can get out.
- I'm sure she'll be fine.

110
00:11:14,293 --> 00:11:18,286
Well, hello there, young man.
I was starting to think you weren't coming.

111
00:11:18,373 --> 00:11:22,161
Sorry I'm late, Mr Herbert.
Well, I guess I'll get started.

112
00:11:22,253 --> 00:11:26,644
You know, if you get sweaty and want to
take your shirt off, that'd be just fine.

113
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:29,327
Or tie it in a knot. Your choice.

114
00:11:32,973 --> 00:11:36,204
We go live to Ollie Williams
in the Channel 5 traffic copter.

115
00:11:36,293 --> 00:11:38,523
- Ollie?
- Everybody looks like ants.

116
00:11:38,613 --> 00:11:42,925
Probably cos you're up so high.
Coming up, an interview with Andrew Shue.

117
00:11:43,013 --> 00:11:46,608
Hey, Dad. Pull my finger. Wait.

118
00:11:46,693 --> 00:11:49,890
Sounded like a peeptoad, but it's not summer.

119
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:54,807
Hey, Drippy, you're back. What's for dinner?

120
00:11:54,893 --> 00:12:00,570
Peter, when I said bond with Stewie, this is
not what I had in mind. I am furious with you.

121
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,531
You can't talk to him like that.

122
00:12:03,613 --> 00:12:05,331
Take that.

123
00:12:05,413 --> 00:12:09,008
- Stewie, you're going to your room.
- I think not. Dad's got my back.

124
00:12:09,093 --> 00:12:11,527
She looks mad. You better go to your room.

125
00:12:11,613 --> 00:12:15,811
What's the matter with you, fat man?
Stop her. Help me, you fool. You traitor.

126
00:12:15,893 --> 00:12:18,088
I trusted you, but you're a wuss.

127
00:12:18,173 --> 00:12:21,609
Don't feel bad, Peter.
Hey, I know what'll cheer you up.

128
00:12:21,693 --> 00:12:25,083
- I don't think I'm in the mood.
- Are you sure?

129
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:44,770
Sorry, Brian. It's just not doing it today.

130
00:12:57,853 --> 00:13:00,287
Stewie, got a minute for your daddy?

131
00:13:00,373 --> 00:13:05,447
Get out of here, you spineless oaf. And by
the way, I faked all those bowel movements.

132
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:10,926
I feel awful. We were getting along and now
he hates me. How do I get him to like me?

133
00:13:11,013 --> 00:13:15,052
That depends. Do you want my advice
or are you asking random questions again?

134
00:13:15,133 --> 00:13:16,612
What's a hypotenuse?

135
00:13:18,413 --> 00:13:23,203
I know you're mad, but when you see where
I'm taking you, you'll change your mind.

136
00:13:23,293 --> 00:13:25,363
Yeah, right. I'm gonna change my mind.

137
00:13:25,453 --> 00:13:28,525
We just sat on a plane for three hours
to come to Florida,

138
00:13:28,613 --> 00:13:31,207
God's waiting room, for who knows what...

139
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:35,252
Disney World!

140
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:38,848
I want to go to Disney World! Disney World!

141
00:13:39,933 --> 00:13:41,605
I'm still mad at you.

142
00:13:48,613 --> 00:13:52,891
Check it out, Stewie. Halle Berry's Wild Ride.

143
00:14:02,453 --> 00:14:07,083
Wow. It looks like Michael Jackson's
coming right at me.

144
00:14:07,693 --> 00:14:11,447
We've been puttering around
this fat farm for hours. I've had enough.

145
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:14,123
Hey, Stewie, they got... Stewie?

146
00:14:14,213 --> 00:14:17,728
Oh, my God, he's gone.
Has anyone seen my son? Hello?

147
00:14:17,813 --> 00:14:20,850
<i>Hey, it's the crows from Dumbo.
Hey, you guys seen my son?</i>

148
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:25,723
Well, I done seen about everything,
but I sure enough ain't seen your boy, nohow.

149
00:14:25,813 --> 00:14:28,532
That's good old-fashioned family racism.

150
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:39,608
Well, well. A lost child.
Looks like we've got a new recruit.

151
00:14:41,773 --> 00:14:43,843
- Now sing.
- I shall do no such thing.

152
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:49,929
You must sing. If you don't, they'll make you
do a Christmas movie with Tim Allen.

153
00:14:56,853 --> 00:14:59,321
Is Chris doing chores
for that disgusting man?

154
00:14:59,413 --> 00:15:04,885
Meg, that's not nice. Old people have a lot
to offer society. Just look at Kim Cattrall.

155
00:15:05,773 --> 00:15:09,004
Come and get it, big boy.

156
00:15:09,093 --> 00:15:11,163
Damn.

157
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:15,683
There we go.

158
00:15:21,013 --> 00:15:23,083
Thanks for buying dinner, Mr Herbert.

159
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:26,210
I wanted to thank you properly
for all your hard work.

160
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:29,205
- Souvenir photograph?
- Hell, yes.

161
00:17:35,733 --> 00:17:37,166
Are you dead?

162
00:17:51,973 --> 00:17:54,885
- I say, fat man, get me out of here.
- There you are.

163
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:57,612
Thank God. Why are you dressed like Rerun?

164
00:18:00,533 --> 00:18:04,048
You're free. Run back
to your individual countries of origin.

165
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:10,766
Those multicultural slave children belong
to the Disney Corporation. Get 'em, Achmed.

166
00:18:12,253 --> 00:18:14,813
Look over there. There's a woman learning.

167
00:18:23,693 --> 00:18:25,729
Quick, in here.

168
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:02,243
Looks like we're in the clear.

169
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,369
- Michael Eisner.
- Cover your heart.

170
00:19:04,453 --> 00:19:06,648
Kali Ma.

171
00:19:06,853 --> 00:19:08,844
Kali Ma.

172
00:19:09,053 --> 00:19:11,408
Kali Ma.

173
00:19:11,493 --> 00:19:14,087
You betrayed the shareholders.

174
00:19:22,853 --> 00:19:25,731
- You think he's dead?
- Nah, he'll be on his feet in no time.

175
00:19:25,813 --> 00:19:31,206
He'll follow Jonathan Dolgen's footsteps with
a POD deal at Touchstone. Are you all right?

176
00:19:31,293 --> 00:19:34,683
Fat man, I'm not sure how to say this
without sounding cheesy,

177
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:37,526
but, well, you really
came through for me today,

178
00:19:37,613 --> 00:19:39,729
so I...

179
00:19:39,813 --> 00:19:43,283
- What the hell.
- I love you too, buddy.

180
00:19:43,373 --> 00:19:46,046
Come on, Stewie. Let's go home.

181
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:49,808
Florida. Just think,
somewhere in this state right now,

182
00:19:49,893 --> 00:19:53,124
Jeb Bush is eating a live puppy.

183
00:19:54,413 --> 00:19:59,168
Well, Jesse, I guess we've got to find
some other way to spend our evenings.

184
00:19:59,253 --> 00:20:03,485
Now back to ESPN's exclusive coverage
of the Little League World Series.

185
00:20:03,573 --> 00:20:05,689
Jackpot.

186
00:20:25,773 --> 00:20:28,207
