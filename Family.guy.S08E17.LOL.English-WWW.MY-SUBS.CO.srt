1
00:00:01,057 --> 00:00:03,091
Good evening, America.
Tonight we present

2
00:00:03,314 --> 00:00:04,748
a full hour
of <i>Family Guy,</i>

3
00:00:04,815 --> 00:00:07,183
beginning with a very
special extended episode,

4
00:00:07,251 --> 00:00:09,686
followed by some
never-before-seen musical clips.

5
00:00:09,754 --> 00:00:10,687
That's right.

6
00:00:10,755 --> 00:00:12,122
So, without further ado,

7
00:00:12,189 --> 00:00:14,858
here's a little episode
entitled "Stewie and Brian."

8
00:00:14,925 --> 00:00:16,626
Well, actually, it's
called "Brian and Stewie."

9
00:00:16,694 --> 00:00:18,828
Really? Shouldn't it be
person before animal,

10
00:00:18,896 --> 00:00:20,130
like <i>Turner and Hooch?</i>

11
00:00:20,197 --> 00:00:21,931
I don't think that movie
is a good example.

12
00:00:21,999 --> 00:00:23,266
Of anything.

13
00:00:23,334 --> 00:00:24,534
Besides, it's
alphabetical.

14
00:00:24,602 --> 00:00:28,071
You asked to have
your name first, didn't you?

15
00:00:28,139 --> 00:00:30,340
Ladies and gentlemen,
here's "Brian and Stewie."

16
00:00:30,408 --> 00:00:31,441
Pathetic.

17
00:00:36,814 --> 00:00:38,114
Hurry up.

18
00:00:38,182 --> 00:00:40,183
We still have to swing by
Wyndham's before they close.

19
00:00:40,251 --> 00:00:41,551
Relax. I'm almost done.

20
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:43,653
And why do you have
a safety deposit box anyway?

21
00:00:43,721 --> 00:00:45,789
What's in there
that you can't bury in the yard?

22
00:00:45,856 --> 00:00:47,023
I have things.

23
00:00:47,091 --> 00:00:48,491
You have a dead bird in there?

24
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:49,993
What are you gonna do with that?

25
00:00:50,061 --> 00:00:51,227
I was gonna take it home,

26
00:00:51,295 --> 00:00:52,762
show it to Lois,
make her proud of me.

27
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,497
Hey, I'm starving.
You want to grab a late lunch?

28
00:00:54,565 --> 00:00:55,632
Can't.
I'm Jenny Craig-ing.

29
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,033
Already paid for the meals.

30
00:00:57,101 --> 00:00:59,669
And if I want to return
this sweater, we've got to get

31
00:00:59,737 --> 00:01:01,671
to Wyndham's by half 6:00.
Half 6:00?

32
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,407
Yes. You have to return it
within a fortnight for a refund.

33
00:01:04,475 --> 00:01:06,810
I love it, but I feel like
it was too much.

34
00:01:06,877 --> 00:01:07,811
Cute, right?

35
00:01:07,878 --> 00:01:08,812
It's Thom Browne.

36
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:10,347
It was over $3,000.

37
00:01:10,414 --> 00:01:12,849
You spent $3,000 on a sweater?

38
00:01:12,917 --> 00:01:13,883
What's it to you?

39
00:01:13,951 --> 00:01:15,085
That's the most idiotic thing

40
00:01:15,152 --> 00:01:16,319
I've ever heard.
You're a moron.

41
00:01:16,387 --> 00:01:17,654
A pretentious moron.

42
00:01:17,722 --> 00:01:19,255
Drop dead.
I was returning it anyway.

43
00:01:19,323 --> 00:01:20,924
Where'd you even get
that kind of money?

44
00:01:20,991 --> 00:01:22,625
None of your damn business,
that's where.

45
00:01:22,693 --> 00:01:25,095
You know, today started
as a really nice outing,

46
00:01:25,162 --> 00:01:26,629
but as usual,
you had to ruin it.

47
00:01:26,697 --> 00:01:27,630
I had to ruin it?

48
00:01:27,698 --> 00:01:28,732
Yeah, you.

49
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,166
You know,
I... I was actually hoping

50
00:01:30,234 --> 00:01:32,135
that you'd talk me
out of returning this sweater.

51
00:01:32,203 --> 00:01:34,237
So, you're right;
I guess I am a moron.

52
00:01:34,305 --> 00:01:37,006
You know, it's the one time
I ever splurged on myself,

53
00:01:37,074 --> 00:01:39,209
and you have to go
and make me feel foolish.

54
00:01:39,276 --> 00:01:40,610
- Look, I didn't...
- Save it, okay?

55
00:01:40,678 --> 00:01:43,213
I'll be waiting outside
under the porte cochere.

56
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,216
It's my own fault for thinking
I could have pretty things.

57
00:01:46,283 --> 00:01:47,784
I'm not having fun anymore.

58
00:01:47,852 --> 00:01:49,285
I feel you should know that.

59
00:01:51,389 --> 00:01:52,555
What was that?

60
00:01:54,859 --> 00:01:56,159
I don't believe this.

61
00:01:56,227 --> 00:01:58,395
Hello?! Hello?!

62
00:01:58,462 --> 00:02:00,029
We're locked in!

63
00:02:01,832 --> 00:02:04,701
Did you... did you
just crap your diaper?

64
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:07,570
I got scared when
the door closed.

76
00:02:44,842 --> 00:02:45,942
Hey!

77
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,444
Hello! Hello!

78
00:02:47,511 --> 00:02:48,445
Somebody!

79
00:02:48,512 --> 00:02:49,946
We're trapped in here!

80
00:02:50,014 --> 00:02:51,247
You're wasting
your breath.

81
00:02:51,315 --> 00:02:52,882
These bank vault doors
close automatically

82
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,217
at the end of the workday.

83
00:02:54,285 --> 00:02:55,852
This thing won't be open
again till tomorrow.

84
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,887
Well, there's got to be
some way out of here. Think!

85
00:02:57,955 --> 00:02:59,088
I don't know.
You think of something.

86
00:02:59,156 --> 00:03:00,356
Well, I have no idea!

87
00:03:00,424 --> 00:03:01,691
So, you invented a time machine,

88
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,660
but you can't get us
out of a safe?

89
00:03:03,727 --> 00:03:05,528
Yeah, that's science.
I'm not Houdini.

90
00:03:05,596 --> 00:03:06,996
I can't believe this.
We're locked in here

91
00:03:07,064 --> 00:03:08,965
until tomorrow and the
only thing I've eaten today

92
00:03:09,033 --> 00:03:10,834
was a grape Chris
dropped at breakfast.

93
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:12,335
It took me
half an hour

94
00:03:12,403 --> 00:03:14,170
just to get the damn
thing off the floor.

95
00:03:14,238 --> 00:03:16,206
I'm uncomfortable.
You have to change me.

96
00:03:16,273 --> 00:03:17,373
I'm not changing you.

97
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:18,641
We don't even
have any diapers.

98
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:20,009
Oh, my God, that smell

99
00:03:20,077 --> 00:03:21,412
is making me sick.
Ugh...

100
00:03:21,412 --> 00:03:22,612
Oh, thank you for making me
more self-conscious.

101
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,013
I'm not going to
be able to stay like this

102
00:03:24,081 --> 00:03:25,482
until tomorrow,
you know.

103
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:28,051
Well, I don't know what you
expect me to do about it.

104
00:03:28,118 --> 00:03:29,252
You don't?

105
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,054
No, I don't.

106
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:32,489
Stop looking
at me like that.

107
00:03:32,556 --> 00:03:35,258
Look, I'm going
to propose something,

108
00:03:35,326 --> 00:03:37,126
and I need you to hear me out.

109
00:03:37,194 --> 00:03:38,628
Will you promise me
you'll do that?

110
00:03:38,696 --> 00:03:39,696
I guess.

111
00:03:39,763 --> 00:03:41,130
You guess or you will?

112
00:03:41,198 --> 00:03:42,432
Yes, I'll hear you out.

113
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,835
Okay, well, I can't be
in a soiled diaper

114
00:03:45,903 --> 00:03:47,770
until tomorrow, Brian;
we both know that.

115
00:03:47,838 --> 00:03:49,239
I'll get a rash,
which could lead

116
00:03:49,306 --> 00:03:50,874
to an infection
if left like this.

117
00:03:50,941 --> 00:03:53,443
All... all right, fine,
I'll take the diaper off.

118
00:03:53,511 --> 00:03:56,312
That doesn't really solve
our problem, now, does it?

119
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,280
Yes, it does.

120
00:03:57,348 --> 00:03:59,849
No, it doesn't though, really.

121
00:03:59,917 --> 00:04:01,551
See, you're, you're not...

122
00:04:01,619 --> 00:04:02,919
you're not really
thinking this through.

123
00:04:02,987 --> 00:04:04,254
W... We would still be faced

124
00:04:04,321 --> 00:04:06,523
with the problem of the odor,
you see.

125
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,057
And... and, of course, you know,

126
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,193
then what am I gonna do
with no diaper?

127
00:04:10,261 --> 00:04:11,594
I'm... I'm not gonna
walk around here

128
00:04:11,662 --> 00:04:12,962
with... with my Tic Tac
hanging out.

129
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,330
I... I need a clean diaper.

130
00:04:14,398 --> 00:04:16,232
I told you, we don't
have any clean diapers.

131
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,635
Well, well, no, I mean,
not right now we don't, no.

132
00:04:18,702 --> 00:04:22,405
But if... if the poo
were to be removed...

133
00:04:22,473 --> 00:04:23,706
I'm not following you.

134
00:04:23,774 --> 00:04:27,944
If the poo were to be removed...

135
00:04:28,012 --> 00:04:30,113
W... What does that...?
What are you driving at?

136
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,681
Eat it.

137
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:33,550
- What?
- Eat it, Brian.

138
00:04:33,617 --> 00:04:34,851
You're out of
your fucking mind.

139
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:36,553
Now, you promised
you'd hear me out.

140
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,354
Besides, is it really
that big a deal?

141
00:04:38,422 --> 00:04:40,423
You just said yourself
that you're starving.

142
00:04:40,491 --> 00:04:42,592
And, you know, I've seen you
eat poop before, Brian.

143
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,726
Yeah, mine.

144
00:04:43,794 --> 00:04:45,094
Is that really
a huge distinction?

145
00:04:45,162 --> 00:04:46,496
It is to me!

146
00:04:46,564 --> 00:04:48,364
I can't even...
How would... You...

147
00:04:48,432 --> 00:04:49,966
That's sick!
That is sick!

148
00:04:50,034 --> 00:04:52,335
How messed up in the head are
you that y... you would even ask?

149
00:04:52,403 --> 00:04:53,970
Look, okay, okay,
just calm down, okay?

150
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:55,505
We're not, we're not...
we're just talking.

151
00:04:55,573 --> 00:04:56,739
We're not doing
anything yet.

152
00:04:56,807 --> 00:04:57,907
All right,
we're just talking.

153
00:04:57,975 --> 00:04:59,475
Nobody's doing anything
at this point.

154
00:04:59,543 --> 00:05:01,411
Dogs sometimes eat feces.

155
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:03,346
It's not a judgment;
it's just a fact.

156
00:05:03,414 --> 00:05:07,650
So what I would need you to do
is eat what's in my diaper,

157
00:05:07,718 --> 00:05:10,553
lick the diaper clean,
possibly lick my fanny

158
00:05:10,621 --> 00:05:13,089
and then put the diaper
back on me.

159
00:05:13,157 --> 00:05:14,991
Probably lick my fanny.

160
00:05:15,059 --> 00:05:17,493
Yeah, you should start wrapping
your brain around that, too.

161
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:19,395
There is no way any
of that is happening.

162
00:05:19,463 --> 00:05:21,230
Well, I don't see
a way around it, do you?

163
00:05:21,298 --> 00:05:22,565
I would shoot myself first.

164
00:05:22,633 --> 00:05:23,733
Well, how you gonna
shoot yourself?

165
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:24,701
There's no gun in here.

166
00:05:27,738 --> 00:05:30,673
There's a gun in your safety
deposit box, isn't there?

167
00:05:41,285 --> 00:05:43,119
Stewie, come on. You don't know
how to use that thing.

168
00:05:43,187 --> 00:05:45,788
Oh, really? What if I hold it
sideways like a black guy?

169
00:05:45,856 --> 00:05:47,490
Whoa, whoa, come on, man.
Take it easy, all right?

170
00:05:47,558 --> 00:05:48,458
I... I don't want any trouble.

171
00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:49,759
There's not gonna be any trouble

172
00:05:49,827 --> 00:05:51,160
as long as you eat my poo.

173
00:05:51,228 --> 00:05:52,428
That's not happening.

174
00:05:52,496 --> 00:05:53,663
Well, then I'll be
forced to shoot you.

175
00:05:53,731 --> 00:05:55,131
Go ahead. There aren't
any bullets in that gun.

176
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,332
- I don't believe you.
- Then shoot me.

177
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,500
- I will. I will!
- Do it. Then do it!

178
00:05:57,568 --> 00:05:59,068
What are you waiting for? Go on!

179
00:05:59,136 --> 00:06:00,637
I will, I'll blow
your fucking head off!

180
00:06:00,704 --> 00:06:03,072
Wait a minute. Don't you have
your cell phone with you?

181
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,208
You're right!

182
00:06:05,275 --> 00:06:07,543
Oh, no, low battery.

183
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:10,079
I have to make
this call count.

184
00:06:10,147 --> 00:06:11,280
Hurry up.

185
00:06:11,348 --> 00:06:12,248
It's ringing.

186
00:06:12,316 --> 00:06:13,282
Oh, thank God.

187
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,851
Come on, come on.

188
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:17,053
Yes, hi. Can you connect me
to men's designer wear, please?

189
00:06:17,121 --> 00:06:18,321
- Thank you.
- What are you doing?!

190
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:19,689
This will just
take a second.

191
00:06:19,757 --> 00:06:20,690
- Give me that!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

192
00:06:20,758 --> 00:06:22,425
Hi, uh, this is Stewie Griffin.

193
00:06:22,493 --> 00:06:23,993
Uh, who am I talking to?

194
00:06:24,061 --> 00:06:25,328
Hi, Matthew.

195
00:06:25,396 --> 00:06:26,929
I think you're the salesman
who helped me

196
00:06:26,997 --> 00:06:29,098
pick out a Thom Browne sweater
two weeks ago.

197
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,800
Yes, I was going to see

198
00:06:30,868 --> 00:06:32,669
<i>The Bounty Hunter</i>
that night.

199
00:06:32,736 --> 00:06:34,337
Well, I enjoyed it
very much. Thank you.

200
00:06:34,405 --> 00:06:35,471
Good memory, my word.

201
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:37,507
Anyway, it doesn't
fit properly and...

202
00:06:37,574 --> 00:06:38,675
- Give me the damn phone!
- Hey!

203
00:06:38,742 --> 00:06:39,676
Stop it.

204
00:06:39,743 --> 00:06:41,444
Um, and I don't think I'm going to

205
00:06:41,512 --> 00:06:43,813
make it to the store
before closing time today.

206
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:47,316
Is it possible to get
an extension on that refund?

207
00:06:47,384 --> 00:06:49,252
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

208
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,720
No exceptions, I see.

209
00:06:50,788 --> 00:06:53,890
So you're telling me
if I was James Franco calling,

210
00:06:53,957 --> 00:06:57,527
I would still not be able to get
an extension for one day?

211
00:06:57,594 --> 00:06:59,429
Yes, Matthew, I will hold
for your manager.

212
00:06:59,496 --> 00:07:00,963
I'm gonna
wrap this up so quickly.

213
00:07:01,031 --> 00:07:03,433
- Hey!
- Sorry, he's gonna have to call you back...

214
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,268
It's dead.

215
00:07:05,335 --> 00:07:08,237
You wasted the one phone call
we had to return a sweater?!

216
00:07:08,305 --> 00:07:11,541
A $3,000 sweater,
which I am now stuck with.

217
00:07:11,608 --> 00:07:12,608
Oh, this day.

218
00:07:13,711 --> 00:07:14,911
Ow.

219
00:07:14,978 --> 00:07:16,479
You stink! And now
I'm trapped in here

220
00:07:16,547 --> 00:07:18,514
with you and your stink
because you were too stupid

221
00:07:18,582 --> 00:07:19,816
to call somebody
who could help us!

222
00:07:19,883 --> 00:07:22,085
That really hurt.

223
00:07:22,152 --> 00:07:23,086
Just get away from me!

224
00:07:23,153 --> 00:07:24,053
I can't even look at you!

225
00:07:24,121 --> 00:07:25,221
Well, I'm... I'm sorry.

226
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:26,222
Don't be mad.

227
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,091
Don't!

228
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,577
All right, I'll do it.

229
00:07:47,644 --> 00:07:48,911
What are you talking about?

230
00:07:50,614 --> 00:07:52,115
I can't leave you like this.

231
00:07:52,182 --> 00:07:54,851
But you have to swear
never to tell anybody.

232
00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:56,586
You mean, you're gonna eat my...

233
00:07:56,653 --> 00:07:58,888
Yeah, no, no, I won't
tell anybody. I swear!

234
00:07:58,956 --> 00:08:01,090
Okay, how should
we do it?

235
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:02,925
I... I guess it's
dealer's choice, really.

236
00:08:02,993 --> 00:08:04,594
I suppose
the easiest way would be

237
00:08:04,661 --> 00:08:06,662
to use the diaper
as a... a bowl of sorts.

238
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,498
Do you know how
to take it off?

239
00:08:08,565 --> 00:08:10,633
No, I've never done it myself.
Mum does it.

240
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:12,769
All right, well, we should
get your overalls off first.

241
00:08:12,836 --> 00:08:14,337
I know how
to do the snaps.

242
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,907
Yeah. I did it.

243
00:08:17,975 --> 00:08:19,742
Okay, good.
Now let's get your feet out.

244
00:08:21,111 --> 00:08:22,578
I can't believe
we're doing this.

245
00:08:22,646 --> 00:08:24,413
Oh, really smells bad,
doesn't it?

246
00:08:24,481 --> 00:08:26,516
Yeah. You sure you
can't stay like this?

247
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,251
I'm getting a rash, Brian.
I can feel it.

248
00:08:28,318 --> 00:08:30,119
Okay, okay, I can do this.

249
00:08:30,187 --> 00:08:31,220
All right, lay down.

250
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,291
It's so amazing to me
that you know how to do that.

251
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:36,659
It's... it's like watching
someone do algebra.

252
00:08:36,727 --> 00:08:38,427
I just have no conception
of how it's done.

253
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,030
Oh, God!

254
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:43,966
Okay, you ready?

255
00:08:48,172 --> 00:08:49,672
Okay.

256
00:08:52,743 --> 00:08:53,843
Ah, don't do it
right here!

257
00:08:53,911 --> 00:08:54,977
- I don't want to watch!
- What?

258
00:08:55,045 --> 00:08:56,679
Take it over there.
Do it in the corner.

259
00:08:56,747 --> 00:08:58,080
- It's gross!
- It's your poop!

260
00:08:58,148 --> 00:09:00,483
Yeah, but it's your...
activity, you know?

261
00:09:00,551 --> 00:09:02,718
It's... it's your...
it's your thing...

262
00:09:18,869 --> 00:09:19,802
I can't finish!

263
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,903
You have to!

264
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:22,471
How would we explain it
half-eaten?

265
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:24,140
There's no going back
from this.

266
00:09:33,584 --> 00:09:34,884
It's done.

267
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,155
Got some dessert for you.

268
00:09:39,223 --> 00:09:40,356
You've gotta
be kidding me.

269
00:09:40,424 --> 00:09:41,624
Come on.
It's throw-up.

270
00:09:41,692 --> 00:09:43,025
You like throw-up.

271
00:09:43,093 --> 00:09:45,294
I do.
I do like throw-up.

272
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:49,999
All right, now let's get
this diaper back on you.

273
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:52,768
There's just one part left.

274
00:09:52,836 --> 00:09:54,503
What are you talking about?
There's nothing left.

275
00:09:54,571 --> 00:09:55,571
Look, the diaper's 
completely clean.

276
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,740
Yeah, yeah,
but my ass isn't.

277
00:09:57,808 --> 00:09:59,709
You have to clean my ass.

278
00:09:59,776 --> 00:10:01,911
Oh, God, Stewie,
there's got to be a line!

279
00:10:01,979 --> 00:10:03,579
Brian, this is
the most important part.

280
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,214
You've seen Lois
with those sanitary wipes.

281
00:10:05,282 --> 00:10:07,650
- She gets all up in my biznatch with those.
- No, no way.

282
00:10:07,718 --> 00:10:08,918
I could get really sick.

283
00:10:08,986 --> 00:10:10,319
Look, there's hardly anything
on it.

284
00:10:10,387 --> 00:10:11,787
This will take one second,

285
00:10:11,855 --> 00:10:14,090
and then we can put this whole
unpleasantness behind us.

286
00:10:14,157 --> 00:10:16,492
If you ever...

287
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,794
I'm not gonna breathe a word
to anybody ever.

288
00:10:18,862 --> 00:10:20,263
Now go on. Get started.

289
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,765
All right, here goes.

290
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,300
Oh, and just do me a favor

291
00:10:24,368 --> 00:10:26,402
and tell me
when you're about to begin

292
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,404
because I don't wanna be...
Moon river!

293
00:10:28,472 --> 00:10:30,773
Oh, by God, there...
there it goes.

294
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,111
Brian, you rock.

295
00:10:35,178 --> 00:10:36,913
Thank you so much
for doing this.

296
00:10:43,186 --> 00:10:45,554
Oh, wait.
I... I can do this part.

297
00:10:51,728 --> 00:10:53,829
So... yeah.

298
00:10:53,897 --> 00:10:54,897
Thanks.

299
00:10:56,633 --> 00:10:58,401
I feel a lot better now.

300
00:10:58,468 --> 00:11:01,137
Smell's gone.

301
00:11:04,207 --> 00:11:07,310
Look, I hope this hasn't created
any weirdness between us.

302
00:11:07,377 --> 00:11:09,712
I mean, it's not <i>that</i> strange
what happened.

303
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,514
What'd you eat?

304
00:11:11,581 --> 00:11:13,616
Italian Wedding Soup.

305
00:11:13,684 --> 00:11:15,184
Oh, actually, it wasn't bad.

306
00:11:15,252 --> 00:11:16,585
I know, right?!

307
00:11:16,653 --> 00:11:18,621
Jenny Craig, can you believe?
Only 220 calories.

308
00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:20,790
Probably less for you.

309
00:11:20,857 --> 00:11:23,192
You know, I think
I missed my nap today.

310
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,360
I'm sleepy.

311
00:11:24,428 --> 00:11:25,594
Well, why don't
you lie down?

312
00:11:25,662 --> 00:11:26,529
I think I will.

313
00:11:31,268 --> 00:11:32,668
- Brian?
- What?

314
00:11:32,736 --> 00:11:34,170
I just realized
something.

315
00:11:34,237 --> 00:11:35,604
What?

316
00:11:35,672 --> 00:11:37,106
Tomorrow's Sunday.

317
00:11:37,174 --> 00:11:38,274
Fuck...

318
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,676
Guess this is as good
a time as any.

319
00:12:06,979 --> 00:12:08,146
Ah....

320
00:12:10,116 --> 00:12:11,149
Mmm, whatcha doin'?

321
00:12:11,217 --> 00:12:12,417
Oh. Hey.

322
00:12:12,485 --> 00:12:14,286
Just needed a little drink.

323
00:12:14,353 --> 00:12:16,221
Was kind of saving it,
but, uh...

324
00:12:16,289 --> 00:12:17,255
what the hell, right?

325
00:12:17,323 --> 00:12:18,323
Saving it for what?

326
00:12:18,391 --> 00:12:19,658
It's not important.

327
00:12:19,725 --> 00:12:20,692
Want a sip?

328
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,028
You're offering me some?

329
00:12:23,095 --> 00:12:24,329
It's liquor, isn't it?

330
00:12:24,397 --> 00:12:25,430
Yeah, it's liquor.

331
00:12:25,498 --> 00:12:27,265
Babies aren't supposed
to have liquor.

332
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,801
This would be
the most naughty thing ever.

333
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:31,670
Do you want a sip or not?

334
00:12:31,737 --> 00:12:33,538
Yeah, yeah!

335
00:12:33,606 --> 00:12:35,473
But I don't want
to get too buzzed.

336
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:36,841
People take
advantage of kids

337
00:12:36,909 --> 00:12:37,909
when they're buzzed.

338
00:12:37,977 --> 00:12:39,144
It's so easy,

339
00:12:39,211 --> 00:12:40,245
and I wouldn't
even remember.

340
00:12:40,313 --> 00:12:41,546
So don't you
try anything.

341
00:12:41,614 --> 00:12:42,914
Try what?

342
00:12:42,982 --> 00:12:44,516
I already practically
French-kissed your butt.

343
00:12:44,584 --> 00:12:47,118
Yeah, there was no practically
about that.

344
00:12:47,186 --> 00:12:48,753
Mmm, smooth.

345
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:50,755
I like what comes out
of Lois' breasts better,

346
00:12:50,823 --> 00:12:52,223
but I, I like this, too.

347
00:12:55,895 --> 00:12:57,896
Ah...

348
00:12:57,964 --> 00:13:02,267
Oh, startin' to...
startin' to feel that.

349
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,602
Oh. You know,

350
00:13:03,669 --> 00:13:05,704
I... I like... I like hanging out
with you, Brian.

351
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:08,573
I feel like... I feel
like a big boy right now.

352
00:13:08,641 --> 00:13:10,141
Yeah, this isn't
so bad, right?

353
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:13,445
It's like a
very private party.

354
00:13:13,512 --> 00:13:16,181
Mmm, I feel like dancing.

355
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:21,853
Yeah. You know
how to move.

356
00:13:21,921 --> 00:13:23,688
That is real...

357
00:13:23,756 --> 00:13:25,156
You... Wow,
that is awesome.

358
00:13:25,224 --> 00:13:26,791
I'm really impressed.

359
00:13:26,859 --> 00:13:28,893
Oh, wait, I can hurdle
my own leg

360
00:13:28,961 --> 00:13:30,595
like they used
to do in the '90s.

361
00:13:35,368 --> 00:13:37,669
Okay, all right, you know,

362
00:13:37,737 --> 00:13:39,037
this is gonna sound
really weird.

363
00:13:39,105 --> 00:13:40,472
This is gonna
sound really weird,

364
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:42,874
- but I really want you to do it, okay?
- Wha... what?

365
00:13:42,942 --> 00:13:44,709
First you have to say
that you'll do it

366
00:13:44,777 --> 00:13:45,777
before I tell you,

367
00:13:45,845 --> 00:13:47,612
no mat...
no matter what it is.

368
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,947
- All right.
- Really?!

369
00:13:49,015 --> 00:13:50,248
Yeah.
Sure, w... what is it?

370
00:13:50,316 --> 00:13:53,051
I want you to pierce my ear.

371
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:55,053
Let's do it.

372
00:13:55,121 --> 00:13:56,354
You mean it?

373
00:13:56,422 --> 00:13:57,889
Because I... I...
Look... look at my face.

374
00:13:57,957 --> 00:13:59,557
I'm totally serious.
Are you totally serious?

375
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,326
I... I'm with you.
I'm on the train.

376
00:14:01,394 --> 00:14:02,827
You have...?
Do you have a needle?

377
00:14:02,895 --> 00:14:04,796
Uh, uh, ooh, there's a pin
in the sweater.

378
00:14:04,864 --> 00:14:06,665
Here.

379
00:14:06,732 --> 00:14:07,866
Oh, my God!
This is happening!

380
00:14:07,933 --> 00:14:08,933
This is really happening!

381
00:14:09,001 --> 00:14:10,502
Oh, you know,
I think this is going

382
00:14:10,569 --> 00:14:11,803
to look so good on me.

383
00:14:11,871 --> 00:14:13,471
This, this...
You know what else?

384
00:14:13,539 --> 00:14:16,207
Oh, maybe I'll buy a glove
with no knuckles.

385
00:14:16,275 --> 00:14:18,009
Aren't we supposed to, like,
heat it or something?

386
00:14:18,077 --> 00:14:19,310
I don't care. I really...

387
00:14:19,378 --> 00:14:21,379
I don't give a...
I'm all worked up right now,

388
00:14:21,447 --> 00:14:23,448
so we have to do it.
Just do it, okay?

389
00:14:23,516 --> 00:14:24,649
Before... Wha... what are we
drinking anyway?

390
00:14:24,717 --> 00:14:25,684
Glenfiddich.

391
00:14:25,751 --> 00:14:26,851
Love her!

392
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:28,086
Oh, you know what?

393
00:14:28,154 --> 00:14:29,654
I'll just sterilize it
in the scotch.

394
00:14:29,722 --> 00:14:31,256
You just sterilize it
in the scotch.

395
00:14:31,323 --> 00:14:32,390
Why didn't...?
It's, it's...

396
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,693
Bitch, sterilize
that bitch up, you know?

397
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,962
You know, I don't, I don't know
why I told Matthew

398
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,565
that I liked, that I liked
<i>The Bounty Hunter</i>

399
00:14:40,633 --> 00:14:41,833
'cause I hated it.

400
00:14:41,901 --> 00:14:44,402
I just, I wanted him to like me
in that moment.

401
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,837
And that's why I said it.

402
00:14:45,905 --> 00:14:48,073
I don't... Why do I...
why do I do that?

403
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,608
Why do I...? Why am I such
a people pleaser, you know?

404
00:14:50,676 --> 00:14:52,444
When, when is it
Stewie's turn, you know?

405
00:14:52,511 --> 00:14:54,679
I... I... I'm...

406
00:14:54,747 --> 00:14:55,914
I voted for McCain.

407
00:14:55,981 --> 00:14:57,315
Okay, left ear.
Left, left ear.

408
00:14:57,383 --> 00:14:58,249
Right now.
Stick it in.

409
00:14:58,317 --> 00:14:59,517
Come on, dude.

410
00:14:59,585 --> 00:15:01,619
Can I just...
can I just say before...?

411
00:15:01,687 --> 00:15:03,321
Can we just, like, take two...?

412
00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:05,056
I... I love... You're so brave.

413
00:15:05,124 --> 00:15:07,292
I just love how brave
you're being right now.

414
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:09,360
This is like the closest
I've ever felt to you.

415
00:15:09,428 --> 00:15:10,628
Okay. Oh, my God,

416
00:15:10,696 --> 00:15:12,097
I was thinking
the same thing.

417
00:15:12,164 --> 00:15:14,599
We are so "us" right now.

418
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:16,468
Do you...
do you know that?

419
00:15:17,336 --> 00:15:18,837
Okay, okay.

420
00:15:18,904 --> 00:15:19,938
Okay, here we go.

421
00:15:21,006 --> 00:15:22,640
AHHHH! Oh, my God!

422
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:23,608
Oh! Are you okay?

423
00:15:23,676 --> 00:15:24,642
Is it over?

424
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,810
I think.

425
00:15:25,878 --> 00:15:27,245
I... I don't know
where the pin went.

426
00:15:27,313 --> 00:15:28,146
Mov... Wait,
move your hand.

427
00:15:29,849 --> 00:15:32,217
Oh, wow! Oh, shit!

428
00:15:32,284 --> 00:15:34,052
What? What?
What is it?

429
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,587
There's so much blood.

430
00:15:35,654 --> 00:15:37,055
Ewww!!

431
00:15:37,123 --> 00:15:38,223
It's stuck in there.

432
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,491
I think the pin's
too thick

433
00:15:39,558 --> 00:15:40,825
to go all
the way through.

434
00:15:40,893 --> 00:15:42,694
Oh! Get it out!

435
00:15:42,762 --> 00:15:44,062
Got it.

436
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,296
How's it look?

437
00:15:45,364 --> 00:15:47,132
Cool.

438
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,800
Really? Oh, that's good.

439
00:15:48,868 --> 00:15:51,069
Oh, I knew it was...
I knew it would look...

440
00:15:51,137 --> 00:15:52,036
it would look cool.

441
00:15:52,104 --> 00:15:53,138
We don't... Wait.

442
00:15:53,205 --> 00:15:55,173
Don't we have
to put an earring in it

443
00:15:55,241 --> 00:15:56,608
so the hole won't close?

444
00:15:56,675 --> 00:15:58,843
I don't think it's gonna close.

445
00:15:58,911 --> 00:16:00,078
I can't believe...

446
00:16:00,146 --> 00:16:03,047
I can't believe
I have pierced ears.

447
00:16:03,115 --> 00:16:07,018
I'm one of those people
who I talk about.

448
00:16:07,086 --> 00:16:08,920
Finally, no more clip-ons,
you know?

449
00:16:08,988 --> 00:16:10,922
No... Hey, give me
some of that.

450
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,056
Don't hog that there.

451
00:16:12,124 --> 00:16:13,558
Give me some of that.

452
00:16:13,626 --> 00:16:15,860
It looks... it looks
really good, Stewie.

453
00:16:15,928 --> 00:16:17,195
I wish we had
a mirror

454
00:16:17,263 --> 00:16:19,130
'cause I... I... I actually did
a really good job.

455
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:20,198
Oh, yeah, it's awesome.

456
00:16:20,266 --> 00:16:21,166
I'm not worried.

457
00:16:23,002 --> 00:16:25,203
Mmm, cozy.

458
00:16:25,271 --> 00:16:27,739
So, um, question.

459
00:16:27,807 --> 00:16:28,740
Yeah?

460
00:16:28,808 --> 00:16:30,375
This is gonna seem stupid,

461
00:16:30,442 --> 00:16:32,477
but I've been dying
to know.

462
00:16:32,545 --> 00:16:33,444
<i>The Dog Whisperer</i>.

463
00:16:33,512 --> 00:16:34,546
Wha... what is that?

464
00:16:34,613 --> 00:16:36,114
Is any, is any of that true?

465
00:16:36,182 --> 00:16:37,916
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
I've offended you.

466
00:16:37,983 --> 00:16:39,818
No, no, no, no,
not at all, Stewie, no.

467
00:16:39,885 --> 00:16:41,486
No, it's, some,
some of that stuff,

468
00:16:41,554 --> 00:16:42,787
some of that stuff
is right on.

469
00:16:42,855 --> 00:16:43,855
Really? Wow.

470
00:16:43,923 --> 00:16:45,190
Well, give me
a "for instance."

471
00:16:45,257 --> 00:16:46,224
Well, the guy talks about...

472
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:47,826
- Cesar Millan.
- Right, Cesar Millan

473
00:16:47,893 --> 00:16:50,061
talks about living
in the moment

474
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:52,730
because that's how dogs live,
you know?

475
00:16:52,798 --> 00:16:53,932
We live in the moment.

476
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:56,034
I <i>so don't</i> live in the moment.

477
00:16:56,101 --> 00:16:58,169
I'm always, "Oh,
remember that petting zoo?"

478
00:16:58,237 --> 00:17:00,371
Or "I can't wait
to go to Florida."

479
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:02,841
I'm never, I'm never,
like, really present.

480
00:17:02,908 --> 00:17:04,742
You know, you... you gotta
help me work on that.

481
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,144
Oh, definitely.
Definitely, man.

482
00:17:06,212 --> 00:17:07,545
Live with purpose, you know?

483
00:17:07,613 --> 00:17:09,347
Celebrate every day.

484
00:17:09,415 --> 00:17:12,016
He talks about all those things
that dogs do.

485
00:17:12,084 --> 00:17:13,184
Like, we do that.

486
00:17:13,252 --> 00:17:14,886
Dogs do that.
It's instinctual.

487
00:17:14,954 --> 00:17:17,355
In us, you know?
It's like I can't <i>not</i> do it.

488
00:17:17,423 --> 00:17:19,057
That's kind of
what his whole thing is.

489
00:17:19,124 --> 00:17:21,259
Such beautiful lessons.

490
00:17:21,327 --> 00:17:22,861
I hope he's not Mexican.

491
00:17:22,928 --> 00:17:25,363
There's something off about him,
but I hope it's not that.

492
00:17:25,431 --> 00:17:28,600
You know, people can learn
a lot from dogs, you know?

493
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:30,902
A lot. Like, we're like,
like here's us...

494
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:31,903
We're, like,
"Yeah! Yeah!"

495
00:17:31,971 --> 00:17:33,438
Like that. "Yeah! Yeah!"

496
00:17:33,505 --> 00:17:35,473
Okay, sure, sure,
relax, relax.

497
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,542
It's just, well, you don't...

498
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:41,246
I mean, <i>you</i> don't really do
any of those things, do you?

499
00:17:41,313 --> 00:17:43,181
Yeah, I do. Wait.
What are you talking about?

500
00:17:43,249 --> 00:17:45,283
It's just, I don't know...

501
00:17:45,351 --> 00:17:47,118
I mean, do you, <i>you</i> really live
with purpose?

502
00:17:47,186 --> 00:17:48,753
How could you say that to me?

503
00:17:48,821 --> 00:17:50,288
Just callin' it like I see it.

504
00:17:50,356 --> 00:17:51,956
Listen, why, why don't...
why don't you...

505
00:17:52,024 --> 00:17:53,892
You know what?
You can just go to hell!

506
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:56,394
Hey, whoa, whoa. Look,
I didn't mean to start anything.

507
00:17:56,462 --> 00:17:57,695
Let's just forget it, okay?

508
00:17:57,763 --> 00:17:59,097
We're... we're having
a good time.

509
00:17:59,164 --> 00:18:00,498
I don't want to forget it.

510
00:18:00,566 --> 00:18:02,967
How dare you tell me that
my life doesn't have purpose.

511
00:18:03,035 --> 00:18:05,103
No, that's not what I said.
That's what you're saying.

512
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,405
No, no, no. Don't do that.
Don't try to turn my words on me.

513
00:18:07,473 --> 00:18:08,606
And you know what,
take that sweater off.

514
00:18:08,674 --> 00:18:10,008
It makes you look queer.

515
00:18:10,075 --> 00:18:11,342
Okay, well, now you're
just bein' a dick.

516
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:12,777
Well, you might as well
get used to it.

517
00:18:12,845 --> 00:18:14,612
You're gonna be hearing a lot
worse once you go to school.

518
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,081
Are you trying to hurt me?

519
00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:18,416
Because you've succeeded.

520
00:18:18,484 --> 00:18:20,051
Oh, just calling it
like I see it.

521
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:22,287
Oh, I see.
Is that what we're doing?

522
00:18:22,354 --> 00:18:24,222
All right, well, I'll play
that game with you.

523
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,024
Oh, yeah? What are
you gonna do?

524
00:18:26,091 --> 00:18:27,158
You think I care
about you?

525
00:18:27,226 --> 00:18:28,259
I don't.

526
00:18:28,327 --> 00:18:29,794
Yes, you do.
I know you do.

527
00:18:29,862 --> 00:18:31,562
I don't really care.

528
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:34,165
No, you're just smart enough
and you're just clever enough

529
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:35,767
to occasionally amuse me.

530
00:18:35,834 --> 00:18:38,836
If I had anybody else... anybody
else to choose from... I would.

531
00:18:38,904 --> 00:18:41,372
You are the best
of a bad situation.

532
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,674
Nothing more.

533
00:18:42,741 --> 00:18:44,008
I use you, man.

534
00:18:44,076 --> 00:18:46,244
Yeah, I would know
if you were using me.

535
00:18:46,312 --> 00:18:47,312
Oh, oh, you would?

536
00:18:47,379 --> 00:18:48,680
I got you to eat my poop.

537
00:18:48,747 --> 00:18:50,114
And you know why I did it?

538
00:18:50,182 --> 00:18:51,649
Yeah, you were afraid
you were going to get sick.

539
00:18:51,717 --> 00:18:53,685
Because I wanted to see
if I could.

540
00:18:53,752 --> 00:18:55,620
What?

541
00:18:55,688 --> 00:18:59,023
Come on, Brian, I spend half
the day in a dirty diaper.

542
00:18:59,091 --> 00:19:00,224
I was bored.

543
00:19:00,292 --> 00:19:01,759
Just passing the time.

544
00:19:01,827 --> 00:19:04,662
I thought, "How low can I
get this douchebag to go?"

545
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:06,064
Oh, my God!

546
00:19:06,131 --> 00:19:09,434
And when you did it,
I actually felt sorry for you.

547
00:19:09,501 --> 00:19:10,702
There. Your turn.

548
00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:12,470
You're a monster.

549
00:19:12,538 --> 00:19:13,871
Hey, you started
this whole thing.

550
00:19:13,939 --> 00:19:16,307
You son of a bitch,
I could kill you for that!

551
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,475
Oh, really?
Well, how convenient.

552
00:19:17,543 --> 00:19:18,476
You got a gun right there.

553
00:19:20,612 --> 00:19:23,081
Here you go, Brian. You want to
kill me? Kill me with this.

554
00:19:23,148 --> 00:19:25,016
Oh, but there are no bullets
in it, are there?

555
00:19:25,084 --> 00:19:27,118
Yeah, there are. I lied.

556
00:19:27,186 --> 00:19:28,453
Oh, you're so full of crap.

557
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,821
Besides, if you shot me,

558
00:19:29,888 --> 00:19:31,255
it'd all be caught
on that security camera.

559
00:19:33,926 --> 00:19:36,894
Security cam... Oh, my God,
maybe somebody can see us!

560
00:19:36,962 --> 00:19:38,463
Hey, hey, somebody help!

561
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,064
We're in here!

562
00:19:40,132 --> 00:19:41,899
No one's out there, Brian.
They would have come in.

563
00:19:41,967 --> 00:19:43,034
Save your energy.

564
00:19:43,102 --> 00:19:46,571
- Oh, my God.
- What?

565
00:19:46,638 --> 00:19:48,673
- It's all on tape.
- What's all on tape?

566
00:19:48,741 --> 00:19:51,476
Oh.

567
00:19:51,543 --> 00:19:55,913
Oh, my God, oh,
that is gonna be on YouTube.

568
00:19:55,981 --> 00:19:57,415
Oh, God.

569
00:19:57,483 --> 00:19:58,516
Everybody that works
in an office

570
00:19:58,584 --> 00:19:59,951
is gonna say to
their coworkers,

571
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:01,219
"Hey, type in
'dog, baby, heinie lick.'

572
00:20:01,286 --> 00:20:02,920
Check this out."

573
00:20:02,988 --> 00:20:05,857
And then the boss is gonna say,
"Hey, what are you doing there?

574
00:20:05,924 --> 00:20:07,859
Oh, yeah, that's funny.
I saw that in my room."

575
00:20:07,926 --> 00:20:10,094
"Okay, now type in
'Japanese, fish, ass.'"

576
00:20:10,162 --> 00:20:11,996
I am gonna be so humiliated.

577
00:20:12,064 --> 00:20:13,331
Well, I could save you
the embarrassment

578
00:20:13,399 --> 00:20:14,699
and shoot you in the head

579
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:15,833
except there aren't
any bullets in this gun.

580
00:20:37,489 --> 00:20:39,390
I'm sorry, Stewie.

581
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,125
Me, too.

582
00:20:42,728 --> 00:20:44,328
How long is this gonna last?

583
00:20:44,396 --> 00:20:45,897
No idea.

584
00:21:01,423 --> 00:21:02,557
Hope I'm not bothering you.

585
00:21:02,738 --> 00:21:03,704
Nope.

586
00:21:03,772 --> 00:21:05,273
Just doing some stretching.

587
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,875
Maybe a few poses.

588
00:21:07,943 --> 00:21:09,477
You'll tell me if I'm
bothering you, right?

589
00:21:09,545 --> 00:21:10,478
Uh-huh.

590
00:21:10,546 --> 00:21:12,213
I know what you're thinking.

591
00:21:12,281 --> 00:21:14,749
Stewie's so late
to the yoga party.

592
00:21:14,817 --> 00:21:16,384
I'm not even any good.

593
00:21:16,452 --> 00:21:17,785
Right?

594
00:21:17,853 --> 00:21:19,020
I mean, I'm okay.

595
00:21:19,087 --> 00:21:20,955
You know, I'm not
the worst in the class.

596
00:21:21,023 --> 00:21:22,890
I've even been singled out
a few times.

597
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,193
Probably because it's mostly
pregnant women in the group.

598
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,662
Still, Brody must see something.

599
00:21:27,729 --> 00:21:29,096
Although I certainly don't.

600
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:31,365
But then again I'm not
the instructor, am I?

601
00:21:31,433 --> 00:21:33,000
Oh, yuck.
What happened to my ear?

602
00:21:33,068 --> 00:21:34,068
We pierced it.

603
00:21:34,136 --> 00:21:36,070
Oh, yeah.

604
00:21:36,138 --> 00:21:39,207
Lot of crazy shit
went on last night.

605
00:21:39,274 --> 00:21:40,708
Well, we were both drunk.

606
00:21:40,776 --> 00:21:42,176
Oh, of course, of course.

607
00:21:42,244 --> 00:21:43,411
Oh, yes, that's right.

608
00:21:43,479 --> 00:21:45,213
We were four pillows
to the breeze, my friend.

609
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,781
I don't know what
the phrase is.

610
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:47,915
W... w... what're you...
what are you reading?

611
00:21:47,983 --> 00:21:48,983
<i>David Copperfield.</i>

612
00:21:49,051 --> 00:21:50,084
It looks old.

613
00:21:50,152 --> 00:21:51,519
It's a first edition.

614
00:21:51,587 --> 00:21:53,387
That's why I keep it
in my safety deposit box.

615
00:21:53,455 --> 00:21:54,589
It's by Charles Dickens.

616
00:21:54,656 --> 00:21:55,623
Ha. Giggity.

617
00:21:59,495 --> 00:22:01,062
What are you doing?

618
00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:02,129
I was hungry.

619
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:03,431
You want one?

620
00:22:03,499 --> 00:22:05,566
You've had energy bars
this whole time?!

621
00:22:05,634 --> 00:22:06,701
You idiot!

622
00:22:06,768 --> 00:22:08,336
Not energy bars.

623
00:22:08,403 --> 00:22:09,770
Jenny Craig Anytime Bars.

624
00:22:09,838 --> 00:22:11,572
And you just bitched
yourself out of a bite.

625
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,441
All right, I'm sorry.

626
00:22:13,509 --> 00:22:15,176
All right, can I
have one, please?

627
00:22:15,244 --> 00:22:16,444
All right.

628
00:22:16,512 --> 00:22:18,513
- Can you give me a caramel one?
- No.

629
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:22,817
You can have... um...

630
00:22:22,885 --> 00:22:25,386
You can have...
um...

631
00:22:25,454 --> 00:22:26,487
you can have
strawberry yogurt.

632
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:27,822
I don't like
strawberry yogurt.

633
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,690
Oh, picky for someone
who eats the same food

634
00:22:29,758 --> 00:22:31,659
out of a plastic bowl
on the floor every night.

635
00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:32,860
Okay, I get it.

636
00:22:32,928 --> 00:22:34,629
A bowl that starts
in the kitchen

637
00:22:34,696 --> 00:22:36,704
at the beginning of a meal
and ends up in the living room.

638
00:22:36,716 --> 00:22:37,432
Shut up.

639
00:22:37,444 --> 00:22:39,534
And then forgets four seconds
later that he ate it.

640
00:22:39,546 --> 00:22:40,133
Shut up!

641
00:22:40,156 --> 00:22:43,070
Ooh, harsh tone, you just got
bumped down to coconut mint.

642
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,414
Hey, Bri?

643
00:22:53,482 --> 00:22:54,982
Yeah?

644
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,317
How come you have a gun?

645
00:22:56,385 --> 00:22:58,386
I don't know.

646
00:22:58,453 --> 00:22:59,921
What do you mean you don't know?

647
00:22:59,988 --> 00:23:01,756
You... you...
what about all that liberal crap

648
00:23:01,823 --> 00:23:04,525
you're always spewing
about stricter gun regulations?

649
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:06,193
You even cried after Columbine.

650
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:07,862
Because that was
a national tragedy.

651
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,897
Oh, it was kind
of a regional tragedy.

652
00:23:09,965 --> 00:23:10,998
Whatever.

653
00:23:11,066 --> 00:23:12,166
It's just weird, you know?

654
00:23:12,234 --> 00:23:13,434
I mean, you're
the last person

655
00:23:13,502 --> 00:23:14,769
anybody would expect
to have a gun.

656
00:23:14,836 --> 00:23:16,671
Well, that's why I keep it here
where it's safe.

657
00:23:16,738 --> 00:23:18,005
That doesn't make any sense.

658
00:23:18,073 --> 00:23:19,941
Why have it
if you're not gonna use it?

659
00:23:20,008 --> 00:23:22,777
- Is it like a sexual thing?
- No.

660
00:23:22,844 --> 00:23:24,412
Oh, that's a relief.

661
00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:26,247
I hate the idea of you
getting your thrills

662
00:23:26,315 --> 00:23:28,416
pressing a gun
up against your crotch.

663
00:23:28,483 --> 00:23:30,251
Ugh, just picturing it
gives me the willies.

664
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:32,887
You know, I really don't want to
talk about this with you, Stewie.

665
00:23:32,955 --> 00:23:34,822
- Okay, okay, I respect that.
- Thank you.

666
00:23:36,825 --> 00:23:38,626
Are you sure it's
not a sexual thing?

667
00:23:38,694 --> 00:23:40,294
I'm sure.

668
00:23:40,362 --> 00:23:42,863
Oh, good, 'cause that'd be
strange if you had fantasies

669
00:23:42,931 --> 00:23:44,999
about pressing a gun
up against your crotch

670
00:23:45,067 --> 00:23:46,500
and feeling your heartbeat
through your balls.

671
00:23:47,836 --> 00:23:49,236
Please tell me why you have it.

672
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:51,072
I said I don't want
to talk about it.

673
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:52,139
But I want to know.

674
00:23:52,207 --> 00:23:53,140
Just tell me. Come on.

675
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:54,241
No.

676
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:55,309
Come on, please.

677
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:02,984
I keep it in case... I ever
want to commit suicide, okay?

678
00:24:03,051 --> 00:24:04,385
Wow.

679
00:24:04,453 --> 00:24:06,654
Oh.

680
00:24:06,722 --> 00:24:08,089
Oh, my God.

681
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:09,924
You're... you're serious.

682
00:24:09,992 --> 00:24:11,359
But why, Brian?

683
00:24:11,426 --> 00:24:13,194
You wouldn't understand.
You're just a kid.

684
00:24:13,261 --> 00:24:14,895
Well, I could try.

685
00:24:14,963 --> 00:24:19,367
I don't know.
Sometimes it's... all too much.

686
00:24:19,434 --> 00:24:21,669
- What is?
- Life.

687
00:24:21,737 --> 00:24:23,204
Everything.

688
00:24:23,271 --> 00:24:25,039
Just having the gun here,

689
00:24:25,107 --> 00:24:27,642
knowing there's a way out,
it... it helps.

690
00:24:27,709 --> 00:24:29,777
Yes, but a gun... it's so messy.

691
00:24:29,845 --> 00:24:30,978
What about pills?

692
00:24:31,046 --> 00:24:32,913
Even hanging yourself is better.

693
00:24:32,981 --> 00:24:35,182
At least then you might grow
an inch or two

694
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,217
while you're hanging there.

695
00:24:36,284 --> 00:24:37,652
Of course, when they find you,

696
00:24:37,719 --> 00:24:39,654
you might have those
Illeana Douglas eyes.

697
00:24:39,721 --> 00:24:41,689
Hmm.

698
00:24:41,757 --> 00:24:43,924
So, um, why the gun?

699
00:24:43,992 --> 00:24:46,994
It just seemed
the quickest way, I guess.

700
00:24:47,062 --> 00:24:49,697
I suppose.

701
00:24:49,765 --> 00:24:52,266
But I... I... I don't quite understand
why you're so unhappy.

702
00:24:52,334 --> 00:24:58,205
Yesterday when you said
I don't live with purpose...

703
00:24:58,273 --> 00:25:00,174
you were right.

704
00:25:00,242 --> 00:25:01,642
I don't.

705
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,477
What purpose does my life have?

706
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:04,845
I don't like
when you talk like this.

707
00:25:04,913 --> 00:25:06,881
Oh, it's true, Stewie.

708
00:25:06,948 --> 00:25:09,884
Dogs are supposed to be able to
instinctively live with purpose,

709
00:25:09,951 --> 00:25:12,386
not even to have think about it,
just born like that.

710
00:25:12,454 --> 00:25:15,156
But I wasn't.

711
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:17,358
You know, I've tried to find
meaning in my life,

712
00:25:17,426 --> 00:25:20,394
and I just... I just can't.

713
00:25:20,462 --> 00:25:23,130
And that bottle of Scotch?

714
00:25:23,198 --> 00:25:25,866
I was saving it
for my last drink.

715
00:25:25,934 --> 00:25:27,802
Wow, heavy.

716
00:25:27,869 --> 00:25:29,737
And, you know, I'm not
talking about purpose

717
00:25:29,805 --> 00:25:32,239
in the shallow, Rick Warren
over-the-counter self-help variety

718
00:25:32,307 --> 00:25:33,841
because that's...
that's just delusion.

719
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:34,942
That's not real.

720
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,711
I mean, is there ever a time

721
00:25:36,778 --> 00:25:39,647
when we're truly
in the present moment

722
00:25:39,715 --> 00:25:41,849
and not looking toward
the past or the future?

723
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:43,684
I mean, right there,
in the moment?

724
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:48,089
I get that way when
I watch <i>Handy Manny</i>.

725
00:25:48,156 --> 00:25:50,324
So is that why
we came here?

726
00:25:50,392 --> 00:25:51,992
Were you gonna end it?

727
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,195
No, I was just putting money
in my Christmas club.

728
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:55,996
God, I have to get
one of those.

729
00:25:56,064 --> 00:25:57,965
You know, last year
I only had $30 saved

730
00:25:58,033 --> 00:25:59,066
when the holidays
came around.

731
00:25:59,134 --> 00:26:00,601
I was so embarrassed.

732
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:02,636
I think I gave Meg tape.

733
00:26:02,704 --> 00:26:06,707
Well, you're the...
only person I've ever told this to.

734
00:26:08,477 --> 00:26:09,910
Aren't you gonna say anything?

735
00:26:09,978 --> 00:26:12,379
Well, I don't know
what to say.

736
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:15,282
Wanting to kill
yourself, I...

737
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,984
Well, I think that's
pretty selfish of you.

738
00:26:17,052 --> 00:26:18,486
How is that selfish?

739
00:26:18,553 --> 00:26:21,188
What would I do
if you weren't here? Hmm?

740
00:26:21,256 --> 00:26:23,424
You're the only one
who makes my life bearable.

741
00:26:23,492 --> 00:26:26,727
I thought you said I was
the best of a bad situation.

742
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:29,563
I was just trying to hurt you
'cause you hurt me.

743
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:30,998
But the truth is...

744
00:26:31,066 --> 00:26:32,399
you're my only friend, Brian.

745
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:34,135
If I didn't have you,
I'd be lost.

746
00:26:34,202 --> 00:26:35,236
You'd be okay.

747
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:37,037
No, I wouldn't.

748
00:26:37,105 --> 00:26:39,340
I don't really care
for anybody else. Just you.

749
00:26:39,407 --> 00:26:40,808
You're the only one I like.

750
00:26:40,876 --> 00:26:44,345
Well... thanks.

751
00:26:44,412 --> 00:26:47,148
I like you a lot.

752
00:26:47,215 --> 00:26:51,952
I guess you could say
I... really like you.

753
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,422
I would even dare to go
a little further perhaps.

754
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:58,793
I care a great deal about you.

755
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,127
A very great deal.

756
00:27:00,195 --> 00:27:02,229
Maybe even...

757
00:27:02,297 --> 00:27:03,764
deeper than that.

758
00:27:05,867 --> 00:27:07,868
I... I...

759
00:27:07,936 --> 00:27:09,436
I love you.

760
00:27:09,504 --> 00:27:12,139
I mean, not in
like a "Hey, let's, you know,

761
00:27:12,207 --> 00:27:13,774
let's have an underpants party,"

762
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:16,043
or whatever grownups do when
they're in love, but I mean,

763
00:27:16,111 --> 00:27:20,481
I mean, I love you
as one loves another person

764
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:22,883
whom one simply
cannot do without.

765
00:27:22,951 --> 00:27:25,152
Well, I....

766
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,887
I love you, too, Stewie.

767
00:27:26,955 --> 00:27:29,623
You give my life purpose.

768
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:33,227
And maybe...
maybe that's enough.

769
00:27:33,295 --> 00:27:35,963
Because that's just about
the greatest gift

770
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:37,398
one friend can give another.

771
00:27:37,465 --> 00:27:40,167
Thank you.

772
00:27:40,235 --> 00:27:41,836
Hey.

773
00:27:41,903 --> 00:27:43,070
What?

774
00:27:43,138 --> 00:27:44,171
Will you read to me?

775
00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:45,506
Sure.

776
00:27:45,574 --> 00:27:48,342
Wait, wait, wait. I want
to get all snuggled in.

777
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:49,810
Okay, go.

778
00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:53,147
"Chapter One, I am born.

779
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:56,050
"Whether I shall turn out
to be the hero of my own life,

780
00:27:56,117 --> 00:27:58,652
"or whether that station
shall be held by anybody else,

781
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,188
"these pages must show.

782
00:28:01,256 --> 00:28:03,824
"To begin my life
with the beginning of my life,

783
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:07,962
I record that I was born on
a Friday, at 12:00 at night..."

784
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,468
We hope you enjoyed
our very special episode.

785
00:28:33,535 --> 00:28:36,037
And for the rest of the hour,
we'd like to treat you

786
00:28:36,105 --> 00:28:37,939
to some of your favorite
<i>Family Guy</i> musical moments.

787
00:28:38,006 --> 00:28:39,640
That's right.
Some you may know,

788
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:41,843
and others you've never seen
before... like this first one.

789
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,778
A few years back,
Lois had a visit

790
00:28:43,846 --> 00:28:45,580
from her long-lost
brother, Patrick.

791
00:28:45,647 --> 00:28:47,749
He had an irrational hatred
of fat people

792
00:28:47,816 --> 00:28:49,383
and began strangling them.

793
00:28:49,933 --> 00:28:51,801
Though several of these
hefty men were killed,

794
00:28:51,868 --> 00:28:53,836
Peter and his friends from
the National Association

795
00:28:53,904 --> 00:28:55,638
for the Advancement
of Fat People

796
00:28:55,706 --> 00:28:57,607
never got to mourn for
any of the victims.

797
00:28:57,674 --> 00:28:59,609
Until now.

798
00:28:59,676 --> 00:29:02,878
People, people, I know what
will make us feel better.

799
00:29:02,946 --> 00:29:05,848

816
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:15,618
One thing we like
to do at <i>Family Guy</i>

817
00:30:15,686 --> 00:30:17,687
is make fun of pop
culture by twisting it

818
00:30:17,754 --> 00:30:19,155
and mocking it and
commenting on it.

819
00:30:19,222 --> 00:30:20,756
Yeah, and sometimes
we just steal stuff

820
00:30:20,824 --> 00:30:22,325
and put our
characters in it.

821
00:30:22,392 --> 00:30:24,093
- Here's a scene inspired by...
- Copied from...

822
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:26,028
A Jerry Lewis film
entitled <i>The Errand Boy</i>

823
00:30:26,096 --> 00:30:27,963
that was created for
the episode where Peter

824
00:30:28,031 --> 00:30:30,333
takes over
Pewterschmidt Industries.

825
00:30:31,902 --> 00:30:34,303
Peggy, hold my calls
for a few minutes, please.

826
00:32:29,883 --> 00:32:31,317
Several years back,
Brian made friends

827
00:32:31,385 --> 00:32:33,719
with an elderly woman who had
been homebound for years,

828
00:32:34,514 --> 00:32:36,649
and he attempted to bring her
out of her shell.

829
00:32:36,716 --> 00:32:37,883
Ah, yes. Pearl.

830
00:32:37,951 --> 00:32:39,318
She was a nice woman.

831
00:32:39,386 --> 00:32:41,020
So vibrant, full of life.

832
00:32:41,087 --> 00:32:42,454
We became close friends,

833
00:32:42,522 --> 00:32:44,390
and I sang this song
to explain to her

834
00:32:44,457 --> 00:32:46,392
all the wonderful things
that she was missing

835
00:32:46,459 --> 00:32:47,893
by shutting herself
off from society.

836
00:32:47,961 --> 00:32:49,195
And by the song's end,

837
00:32:49,262 --> 00:32:50,629
she felt the courage
to venture out.

838
00:32:50,697 --> 00:32:53,132
And did she get to see
all those things you sang about?

839
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,201
No. She immediately got
hit by a truck and died.

840
00:32:55,268 --> 00:32:57,570
Ah. Well, then, I'm sure
she's glad she met you.

841
00:32:57,637 --> 00:32:58,971
Here's the musical number

842
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,407
that ended
that poor woman's life.

843
00:33:01,474 --> 00:33:03,108
Come on, Pearl.

844
00:33:03,176 --> 00:33:05,477
There's so much you've
missed in the last 30 years.

You know, when it comes
to road show episodes,

00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,341
you and I do most
of the traveling.

990
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:10,443
True, but when Peter
found out that his father

991
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,345
wasn't Francis, the
man who raised him,

992
00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:15,047
but instead a man in Ireland,
Peter decided to visit.

993
00:40:15,115 --> 00:40:16,649
And did we explore
the effects

994
00:40:16,717 --> 00:40:18,885
of the difficult political
and agricultural dynamics

995

that have rent Ireland
for centuries?

996
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:22,989
No. We just made them a
country of drunken redheads.

997
00:40:23,056 --> 00:40:25,324
Ah. Groundbreaking.

998

Do you remember when Peter
got his own TV station?

1023
00:41:34,494 --> 00:41:35,828
Yeah, and the FCC
censored him.

1024
00:41:35,896 --> 00:41:37,697
We all sang a song
about how they take

1025
00:41:37,764 --> 00:41:39,098
the best parts out
of everything.

1026
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:41,500
I know, and the worst part
is that after the song aired,

1027
00:41:41,568 --> 00:41:43,469
we heard the FCC people
liked it.

1028
00:41:43,537 --> 00:41:45,204
They liked
the parody of them.

1029
00:41:45,272 --> 00:41:46,672
Doesn't that just suck?

1030
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,107
I mean, like, you know,
like when... when...

1031
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:50,176
when you make fun of someone
and then they laugh.

1032
00:41:50,243 --> 00:41:52,044
It's like, "No, man.
No, you don't get it.

1033
00:41:52,112 --> 00:41:53,412
The joke is on you."

1034
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,715
And then they're supposed
to be like, "Oh, you got me.

1035
00:41:55,782 --> 00:41:57,350
Oh, now I've got to think
about myself."

1036
00:41:57,417 --> 00:41:59,251
And you're like,
"Yeah. Yeah, you do.

1037
00:41:59,319 --> 00:42:00,753
"Take that.

1038
00:42:00,821 --> 00:42:02,321
And stay out
of our playground."

1039
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:04,890
But those FCC bozos
liked the song.

1040
00:42:04,958 --> 00:42:06,926
I... I don't know... it just...
it ruins it for me.

1041
00:42:06,994 --> 00:42:08,160
Anyway, let's take a look.

1042
00:42:08,228 --> 00:42:09,328
Actually, because of
your little rant,

1043
00:42:09,396 --> 00:42:10,629
we don't have time
for that song.

1044
00:42:10,697 --> 00:42:11,931
Really?

1045
00:42:11,999 --> 00:42:13,933
- So, what, that means the show is over?
- Yep.

1046
00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:15,768
Oh.

1047
00:42:15,836 --> 00:42:17,403
Okay. Good night.
