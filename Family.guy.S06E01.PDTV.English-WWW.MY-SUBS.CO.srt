00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:07,068
<i>We now return to Sunday Golf on CBS.</i>

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,572
<i>And Mickelson here, trying to save par.</i>

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,071
<i>And there's Mickelson's wife.
God, is she hot.</i>

4
00:00:12,097 --> 00:00:14,909
<i>Look at that rack.
There's a downhill lie for you.</i>

5
00:00:14,934 --> 00:00:18,081
<i>Oh, and they're just out there,
begging to be touched. Pleading.</i>

6
00:00:18,104 --> 00:00:20,427
<i>How many golf balls do you think
she can fit in her mouth?</i>

7
00:00:20,441 --> 00:00:22,702
<i>I'd hit that one in the rough,
if you know what I'm saying.</i>

8
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:23,831
<i>Who are you kidding, Greg?</i>

9
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:25,910
<i>You'd **** her for a week,
and then get tired her.</i>

10
00:00:25,927 --> 00:00:28,590
<i>Yeah, you're right. That's what I do.
That's my thing.</i>

11
00:00:28,633 --> 00:00:30,900
<i>- But a hell of a week though.
- Hell of a week.</i>

12
00:00:32,363 --> 00:00:34,435
Oh, my God! The power's out!

13
00:00:34,456 --> 00:00:36,095
What are we gonna do now?

14
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,392
Well, we could light
some candles and read.

15
00:00:41,206 --> 00:00:43,091
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah, that would be great

16
00:00:43,105 --> 00:00:44,852
Yeah. Read the inside of my butt.

17
00:00:44,887 --> 00:00:46,203
We could tell stories.

18
00:00:46,228 --> 00:00:48,692
Hey, Dad, why don't you tell
the story about when I was born?

19
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:50,472
Yeah, we got halfway home
with the afterbirth

20
00:00:50,487 --> 00:00:52,911
before we had to go back to the hospital
and swap it out for Meg.

21
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:53,560
The end.

22
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:54,721
Now, I got a better one.

23
00:00:54,777 --> 00:00:57,223
This is a story of love and loss,

24
00:00:57,255 --> 00:00:58,593
fathers and sons,

25
00:00:58,615 --> 00:01:02,021
and a foresight to retain
international merchandising rights.

26
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:03,871
This is the story

27
00:01:03,928 --> 00:01:05,452
of Star Wars.

28
00:01:05,487 --> 00:01:07,333
Let's begin with part four.

32
00:03:25,015 --> 00:03:26,013
You hear that?

33
00:03:26,047 --> 00:03:27,881
Sounds like we're being boarded
from the rear.

34
00:03:27,896 --> 00:03:29,801
And not the, "Hey, take a deep breath,
let's experiment"

35
00:03:29,826 --> 00:03:30,912
kind of boarded from the rear.

36
00:03:30,928 --> 00:03:31,740
Beep boop.

37
00:03:32,118 --> 00:03:34,041
Could you hold on to this bag?

38
00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:53,701
What if they come in a different door?

39
00:04:06,905 --> 00:04:09,861
Damn! I was two days from retirement.

40
00:04:13,385 --> 00:04:14,590
R-2?

41
00:04:16,276 --> 00:04:19,453
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

42
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:22,481
- All right, now what do I click?
- Click "preferences."

43
00:04:22,548 --> 00:04:26,651
- Okay, I clicked preferences.
- Now go to "default media browser".

44
00:04:26,698 --> 00:04:30,951
Okay, there's a little hourglass,
and it's not letting me do anything.

45
00:04:30,976 --> 00:04:33,831
- It says "buffering." What is that?
- Just give it a minute.

46
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,841
All I'm trying to do is make an mpeg.

47
00:04:35,865 --> 00:04:38,170
All I'm trying to do
is tell you to wait a minute.

48
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:39,350
Okay, relax.

49
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:41,503
Now click "import video file."

50
00:04:41,516 --> 00:04:42,433
All right.

51
00:04:42,485 --> 00:04:45,311
It's telling me I have
to download RealPlayer 7.

52
00:04:45,338 --> 00:04:47,913
You know what?
I'll just bring it to him myself.

53
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,030
There she is!

54
00:04:55,537 --> 00:04:57,882
Do you still got that bag I gave you?

55
00:04:57,895 --> 00:05:00,141
It's gonna be a long ride.

56
00:05:05,298 --> 00:05:07,752
Hold your fire.
There's no life-forms aboard.

57
00:05:07,785 --> 00:05:10,542
"Hold your fire"?
What, are we paying by the laser now?

58
00:05:10,557 --> 00:05:12,740
You don't do the budget, Terry. I do.

59
00:05:14,365 --> 00:05:16,403
Hey, I'm gonna do some crosswords, but...

60
00:05:16,418 --> 00:05:19,210
- that doesn't mean I don't want to talk.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

61
00:05:33,235 --> 00:05:35,510
My God! Look at this mess!

62
00:05:35,525 --> 00:05:38,042
"Hey, Darth Vader's gonna be here.
Should we maybe clean the place up?"

63
00:05:38,068 --> 00:05:39,670
"Nah. It's okay. He won't mind."

64
00:05:40,595 --> 00:05:42,901
Well, well! Princess Leia.

65
00:05:42,936 --> 00:05:46,541
Are you prepared to tell me what you've
done with the stolen Death Star plans?

66
00:05:46,578 --> 00:05:48,653
All right, Lord Vader. You win.

67
00:05:48,688 --> 00:05:51,883
I've hidden the plans
in one of these 26 briefcases.

68
00:05:53,448 --> 00:05:54,801
Ooh! Ooh! Okay, okay!

69
00:05:54,828 --> 00:05:57,712
Uh... uh... I'm feeling number 14!
Let's go with number 14!

70
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:03,031
Oh, it's okay.
I'm just happy to be on TV.

71
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:04,563
All right. Take her away.

72
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,320
Okay, here's another one.
Who would you rather do :

73
00:06:11,356 --> 00:06:14,593
Jabba the Hutt right after a shower
or a service droid?

74
00:06:14,616 --> 00:06:17,223
My father was a service droid!

75
00:06:17,278 --> 00:06:18,401
Hey, where ya going?

76
00:06:18,436 --> 00:06:23,001
You can kiss the lower part of the back
of the canister that is my body.

77
00:06:33,428 --> 00:06:36,822
Oh, man! This looks like
the wrong neighborhood.

78
00:06:37,768 --> 00:06:38,803
Oh, boy.

79
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:42,310
It's okay, R-2. Calm down. Be cool.

80
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:46,212
I ain't done nothing
to antagonize nobody.

81
00:06:46,257 --> 00:06:49,223
What? A droid can't walk down
the desert no more?

82
00:06:49,245 --> 00:06:50,593
I got rights, too.

83
00:06:50,617 --> 00:06:51,490
Who's there?!

84
00:07:29,495 --> 00:07:33,440
Any attack made by the rebels against
this station would be a useless gesture

85
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,761
no matter what technical data
they've obtained.

86
00:07:35,797 --> 00:07:38,912
This station is now
the ultimate power in the universe.

87
00:07:38,946 --> 00:07:41,292
That is fantastic. Terrific work.

88
00:07:41,307 --> 00:07:43,270
- So, no weaknesses at all, huh?
- Nuh...

89
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:44,350
No.

90
00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:47,800
You, uh... you hesitated there.
Is there something I should know?

91
00:07:47,825 --> 00:07:51,161
No. It's virtually indestructible.
Like, 99.9%.

92
00:07:51,226 --> 00:07:52,620
Uh... okay.

93
00:07:52,656 --> 00:07:56,002
Wouldn't be doing my job
if I didn't ask. What's the .01?

94
00:07:56,037 --> 00:07:58,481
Well, I... I mean,
there's this little hole...

95
00:07:58,518 --> 00:08:01,291
It was kind of an aesthetic choice
by the architect.

96
00:08:01,317 --> 00:08:04,552
And, if you shoot
a laser into this hole...

97
00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:06,390
the station blows up.

98
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:09,881
That sounds like
a pretty big design flaw there.

99
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,201
No, no, no.
The hole's only two meters across.

100
00:08:12,216 --> 00:08:14,320
Well, that's no bigger
than a womprat.

101
00:08:14,347 --> 00:08:15,411
Exactly.

102
00:08:15,438 --> 00:08:18,252
And even to get within range of it,
you have to skim along this whole trench.

103
00:08:18,257 --> 00:08:19,070
It's not a big deal.

104
00:08:19,337 --> 00:08:22,741
Can't we board it up? Or, you know,
put some plywood over it or something?

105
00:08:22,777 --> 00:08:24,023
Well, that would look terrible.

106
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:25,531
I mean, we gotta think about resale.

107
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:26,723
Resale? What are you talking about?

108
00:08:26,748 --> 00:08:29,893
This property is right above Sunset.
The value is only gonna go up.

109
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:33,832
Lord Vader, your inside references
to the Los Angeles real estate market

110
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:37,502
haven't given you the clairvoyance to
turn a profit on that condo in Glendale,

111
00:08:37,537 --> 00:08:38,590
nor has it...

112
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,952
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

113
00:08:40,968 --> 00:08:43,010
That property is in a prime location.

114
00:08:43,025 --> 00:08:45,500
20 minutes to the beach,
20 minutes to downtown...

115
00:08:45,538 --> 00:08:47,983
There's nothing to do downtown.

116
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,073
Enough of this!

117
00:08:49,105 --> 00:08:50,621
Vader, release him!

118
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:51,951
As you wish.

119
00:08:54,018 --> 00:08:55,703
All right, so we gonna plug up that hole?

120
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:58,601
Yeah. We can get it done tomorrow
if price is no object.

121
00:09:00,357 --> 00:09:02,771
- We'll get estimates.
- Get estimates. Yeah.

122
00:09:07,907 --> 00:09:11,022
Someone was in the pod.
The tracks go off in this direction.

123
00:09:11,056 --> 00:09:13,771
- Look, sir. Droids!
- Look! A penny!

124
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:19,100
Hey, thanks for the sex,
early '90s printer.

125
00:09:26,456 --> 00:09:27,902
All right, bring 'em on out.

126
00:09:28,706 --> 00:09:31,600
Oh, God, it's a hundred degrees out here!

127
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:35,260
If I pass out, please note
that I'm wearing a Life Call bracelet

128
00:09:35,277 --> 00:09:37,400
with all my insurance information.

129
00:09:38,127 --> 00:09:39,210
Luke?

130
00:09:39,468 --> 00:09:40,651
Luke!

131
00:09:41,076 --> 00:09:42,202
Luke!

132
00:09:42,238 --> 00:09:43,073
What?!

133
00:09:43,307 --> 00:09:47,331
Tell Uncle Owen not to tell you
that your father is Darth Vader.

134
00:09:47,388 --> 00:09:49,880
Aunt Beru, when are you guys
gonna let me join

135
00:09:49,898 --> 00:09:51,710
the rebellion like all my friends?

136
00:09:51,855 --> 00:09:55,433
Oh, pff! Stop whining, Luke,
and come have some blue milk.

137
00:09:55,475 --> 00:09:56,730
One of these days,

138
00:09:56,757 --> 00:10:00,870
I'm just gonna take off and join the
rebellion whether you like it or not!

139
00:10:00,906 --> 00:10:03,180
Over my burned carcass!

140
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:05,022
Hey, shut up with-a da nois-a!

141
00:10:05,045 --> 00:10:06,790
Hey, shut-up-a with-a da shut-up-a!

142
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:08,292
You shut-up-a with-a da shut- up-a!

143
00:10:08,326 --> 00:10:11,040
Shut-up-a yo face!
Now-a my dog-a won't-a shut-up-a!

144
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,920
- Why you no-a shut up-a?
- I make-a you-a shut-up-a!

145
00:10:12,953 --> 00:10:15,465
- You two-a shut-up-a!
- Hey, I poke out-a my head!

146
00:10:26,496 --> 00:10:27,675
Someday

147
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:30,831
I'll get off this rock
and fight the empire.

148
00:10:34,397 --> 00:10:37,951
John Williams and the
London Symphony Orchestra, everybody!

149
00:10:54,176 --> 00:10:56,611
Now do the theme to The People's Court.

150
00:11:12,516 --> 00:11:15,633
Oh, this oil bath is going
to feel so good.

151
00:11:15,785 --> 00:11:18,713
Hey, you guys think that '90s printer
looked clean, right?

152
00:11:18,748 --> 00:11:21,272
Hey, there's something stuck
in this R-2 unit.

153
00:11:22,188 --> 00:11:25,152
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

154
00:11:25,386 --> 00:11:28,493
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

155
00:11:28,638 --> 00:11:31,453
Whoever she is,
she sounds like she's in trouble.

156
00:11:31,477 --> 00:11:33,371
Is there any more to this message?

157
00:11:33,775 --> 00:11:36,941
Intergalactic proton-powered
electrical-tentacled advertising droids!

158
00:11:36,967 --> 00:11:40,201
Intergalactic proton-powered
electrical-tentacled advertising droids!

159
00:11:40,246 --> 00:11:43,341
Intergalactic proton-powered
electrical-tentacled advertising droids!

160
00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:46,240
Hi, I'm Darth Harrington of
Darth Harrington's Intergalactic Proton-

161
00:11:46,266 --> 00:11:49,383
Powered Electrical-Tentacled Advertising
Droids Emporium and Moon Base.

162
00:11:49,396 --> 00:11:51,373
Due to a garbled sup-space transmission,

163
00:11:51,396 --> 00:11:54,061
I am currently overstocked
on all intergalactic proton-

164
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:56,003
powered electrical-tentacled
advertising droids,

165
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,361
and I am passing the savings on to you!

166
00:11:59,465 --> 00:12:01,261
She said, "Obi-Wan Kenobi."

167
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,830
I wonder if she means
old Obi-Wan Kenobi.

168
00:12:04,085 --> 00:12:07,323
Well, I guess I'll go bull's-eye
some womprats in my T-16.

169
00:12:07,335 --> 00:12:09,932
My God, you shoot small animals for fun?

170
00:12:09,946 --> 00:12:12,550
That's the first indicator
of a serial killer, you freak.

171
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:14,532
There's two suns and no women!

172
00:12:14,556 --> 00:12:16,601
What the hell am I supposed to do?!

173
00:12:17,607 --> 00:12:19,780
Master Luke, he's gone, he's gone!

174
00:12:19,795 --> 00:12:20,451
What?

175
00:12:20,478 --> 00:12:23,373
R-2, he took off in the middle
of the night! We got to find him!

176
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:26,562
Oh, what the phantom menace
is that guy's problem?

177
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:31,042
Hey, mind if I turn on the radio?

178
00:12:31,068 --> 00:12:34,521
<i>WTAT, Tatooine's all-talk radio.</i>

179
00:12:34,557 --> 00:12:39,042
<i>My good friends, the liberal galactic
media is at it again. They never stop.</i>

180
00:12:39,068 --> 00:12:41,493
<i>Now they're trying to convince us
that Hoth is melting.</i>

181
00:12:41,517 --> 00:12:43,403
<i>Well, that's crazy.
Just trying to scare us.</i>

182
00:12:43,436 --> 00:12:45,782
<i>And if that weren't enough
to get you mad,</i>

183
00:12:45,796 --> 00:12:49,822
<i>we now have news that Lando Calrissian
has been made the chief administrator</i>

184
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:52,120
<i>of the Bespin Mining Facility.</i>

185
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:53,912
<i>Gee, I wonder how he got that job.</i>

186
00:12:53,915 --> 00:12:55,771
<i>Well, let me tell you
how he got that job.</i>

187
00:12:55,797 --> 00:12:58,100
<i>Affirmative action strikes again.</i>

188
00:12:58,127 --> 00:12:59,400
<i>The time is 8:50.</i>

189
00:13:01,968 --> 00:13:05,330
- R-2, what are you doing out here?
- Beep-boop-beep.

190
00:13:05,347 --> 00:13:08,411
He says, "There are several creatures
approaching from the southeast."

191
00:13:08,445 --> 00:13:09,843
That's not what I said.

192
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:12,922
I said there ain't a pack
of menthols on this planet.

193
00:13:14,455 --> 00:13:17,642
Well, I see some Bantha tracks,
but I don't see any...

194
00:13:17,765 --> 00:13:21,540
Wait a minute. There's Sand People,
all right. I can see one of them now.

195
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,883
Who the hell are you?

196
00:13:42,927 --> 00:13:45,812
One lucky sumbitch.

197
00:13:48,688 --> 00:13:52,470
So, Luke, what brings
your muscley arms out this way?

198
00:13:52,485 --> 00:13:54,181
I'll show you, Mr. Obi-Wan.

199
00:13:54,195 --> 00:13:56,092
R-2, play him the message.

200
00:13:57,206 --> 00:14:01,893
General Kenobi, many years ago,
you served my father in the Clone Wars.

201
00:14:01,955 --> 00:14:03,802
We need your help again.

202
00:14:03,847 --> 00:14:06,050
And not to get too personal, but...

203
00:14:06,077 --> 00:14:09,283
you owe us after that mess
you got into back on Alderaan.

204
00:14:10,496 --> 00:14:14,253
...and we pay to keep the families
of those children quiet, so...

205
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:17,103
Oh, this is just...
just like logistical stuff.

206
00:14:17,126 --> 00:14:18,511
I'll check that later.

207
00:14:18,527 --> 00:14:20,291
...Joey Lawrence haircut,

208
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,603
so I'll assume we can count on your help

209
00:14:22,638 --> 00:14:25,843
to get the Death Star plans
to my father on Alderaan.

210
00:14:25,955 --> 00:14:28,941
The plans are stored inside this R-2 unit.

211
00:14:29,175 --> 00:14:32,013
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

212
00:14:32,395 --> 00:14:34,350
All right now, what do I click?

213
00:14:34,868 --> 00:14:39,581
Luke, you must learn the ways of
the Force and come with meto Alderaan.

214
00:14:39,617 --> 00:14:41,063
What's the Force?

215
00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:44,331
The Force is what gives
a Jedi knight his power.

216
00:14:44,578 --> 00:14:47,692
It surrounds us. It penetrates us.

217
00:14:49,857 --> 00:14:51,480
Here, check this out.

218
00:14:52,297 --> 00:14:54,352
Wow! This is cool!

219
00:14:54,378 --> 00:14:56,880
Yeah, everyone in
the neighborhood has one.

220
00:15:01,355 --> 00:15:05,122
Hey, why would you hang that up?
It looks so tantalizing.

221
00:15:07,436 --> 00:15:10,763
You know, the Empire's gonna come
looking for these droids.

222
00:15:10,796 --> 00:15:14,563
But if they find out who the Jewas sold
them to, that could lead them back...

223
00:15:14,856 --> 00:15:16,013
home.

224
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,840
Luke, wait! It's too dangerous!

225
00:15:18,975 --> 00:15:22,121
Get your fat space ass back here.

226
00:15:32,857 --> 00:15:34,263
Uncle Owen?

227
00:15:34,635 --> 00:15:36,250
Aunt Beru?

228
00:15:37,465 --> 00:15:39,071
Oh, my God!

229
00:15:41,937 --> 00:15:43,863
John Williams!

230
00:15:46,157 --> 00:15:49,960
Great, now we got to do the rest
of this thing with Danny Elfman.

231
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,932
Mos Eisley Space Port.

232
00:16:13,986 --> 00:16:18,011
You will never find a more
wretched hive of scum and villainy.

233
00:16:18,068 --> 00:16:20,761
My sister Regina D2 lives here.

234
00:16:20,797 --> 00:16:23,190
- Is she single?
- She's a lezbot.

235
00:16:39,338 --> 00:16:41,893
- He doesn't like you.
- Sorry.

236
00:16:42,598 --> 00:16:46,232
- I don't like you either.
- You don't even know me.

237
00:16:46,267 --> 00:16:48,010
You know what? That's fair.

238
00:16:48,056 --> 00:16:50,843
I'm Pignose and this is
my brother-in-law Scott.

239
00:16:50,905 --> 00:16:53,993
- He's visiting from Hoth.
- I don't know why they call it Hoth.

240
00:16:54,006 --> 00:16:56,570
- They should call it "Coldth."
- Okay, settle down.

241
00:16:56,607 --> 00:16:58,063
I'm up after the band.

242
00:16:58,237 --> 00:17:01,923
Thank you. We're the Cantina Band.
If you have any requests, shout them out.

243
00:17:01,978 --> 00:17:05,800
<i>Play that same song.</i>
All right, same song. Here we go.

244
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:11,550
Hi. My sexy friend and I

245
00:17:11,576 --> 00:17:14,150
are looking for a ship
to take us to Alderaan,

246
00:17:14,196 --> 00:17:16,592
and I'm willing to pay big money.

247
00:17:16,658 --> 00:17:18,642
Well, you've come to the right place.

248
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:21,213
I'm Han Solo, captain
of the Millennium Falcon

249
00:17:21,225 --> 00:17:24,443
and the only actor whose career
isn't destroyed by this movie.

250
00:17:24,455 --> 00:17:26,691
- Is it a fast ship?
- Are you kidding?

251
00:17:26,727 --> 00:17:29,710
It's the ship that made the Kessel Run
in less than 12 parsecs.

252
00:17:29,785 --> 00:17:30,561
Um...

253
00:17:30,596 --> 00:17:33,492
Isn't a parsec a unit of distance,
not time?

254
00:17:33,506 --> 00:17:34,642
No, no, no, no.

255
00:17:34,777 --> 00:17:37,211
Chewie, take these guys
to the ship and get her ready.

256
00:17:40,437 --> 00:17:43,832
Always gargle before a takeoff.
Waka-waka. All right, let's go.

257
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:53,180
Greedo, as a matter of fact, I was
just going to see Jaba and tell him...

258
00:18:18,757 --> 00:18:21,813
- Well, what do you think?
- What a piece of junk.

259
00:18:21,885 --> 00:18:25,502
Thank you. This was my brother's. He
died of leukemia. How do you feel now?

260
00:18:25,516 --> 00:18:27,863
You got any strawberry milkin there?

261
00:18:27,876 --> 00:18:30,150
No, but she'll make .5 past lightspeed.

262
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:31,483
If you want, I'll show you around

263
00:18:31,505 --> 00:18:33,903
since no one's trying
to stop the ship or blast us.

264
00:18:33,937 --> 00:18:35,592
Stop that ship! Blast them!

265
00:18:36,086 --> 00:18:38,671
Oh, now I can't show you around.
Quick, get in the ship.

266
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,240
Looks like we got
Imperial cruisers on our tail.

267
00:18:57,315 --> 00:19:01,801
Oh, look at that one on the left.
Get off your cell phone. You are driving.

268
00:19:10,008 --> 00:19:11,760
They're gaining on us!

269
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:14,211
We'll be safe enough once
we make the jump to hyperspace.

270
00:19:14,225 --> 00:19:16,550
Besides, I know a few maneuvers.
We'll lose them.

271
00:19:21,936 --> 00:19:24,630
Uh, that, thatwas your maneuver,

272
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:26,541
moving slightly to the left?

273
00:19:26,578 --> 00:19:29,262
Well, I mean, we're not in
the same place we were, huh?

274
00:19:29,308 --> 00:19:32,782
- That ought to confuse them.
- Yeah, but you hardly did anything.

275
00:19:32,828 --> 00:19:35,950
You just started listinglazily
to the left.

276
00:19:35,985 --> 00:19:37,650
I'm pretty sure they can keep up.

277
00:19:37,688 --> 00:19:39,092
- Where did they go?!
- There they are.

278
00:19:39,126 --> 00:19:41,540
They're listinglazily to the left.
Go left! Left!

279
00:19:41,568 --> 00:19:43,540
Boy, this guy knows some maneuvers.

280
00:19:43,555 --> 00:19:46,321
All right, strap yourselves in.
I'm about to make the jump to lightspeed.

281
00:19:46,356 --> 00:19:49,040
Did he say "strap in" or "strap on"?

282
00:19:55,635 --> 00:19:58,312
Man, hyperspace always looks so freaky.

283
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:20,963
Governor Tarkin,

284
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:24,252
I recognized your foul stench
as soon as I was brought on board.

285
00:20:24,287 --> 00:20:26,232
Um, actually, that's me.

286
00:20:26,256 --> 00:20:27,913
I made a Darth doody.

287
00:20:27,995 --> 00:20:32,681
Princess Leia, we've chosen to test
our Death Star planet blower-upper gun

288
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:35,121
on your home planet of Alderaan.

289
00:20:35,165 --> 00:20:36,082
No!

290
00:20:36,388 --> 00:20:38,792
She said, "No."
Should we still do it?

291
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:40,340
Yeah.

292
00:20:55,848 --> 00:20:58,170
So anyway, I says,
"Forget the dental plan."

293
00:20:58,197 --> 00:21:01,220
"Forget sick leave.
I just want a railing," you know?

294
00:21:01,246 --> 00:21:02,651
"One railing right here."

295
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,663
Yeah, I know. I've almost
fallen over that thing so many times.

296
00:21:05,695 --> 00:21:07,562
- So what did they say?
- Oh, get this.

297
00:21:07,575 --> 00:21:10,062
They said they're worried
we'd be leaning all day.

298
00:21:10,106 --> 00:21:11,773
- They said that?
- Yeah.

299
00:21:12,345 --> 00:21:15,002
Well, none of this will matter
when we're famous singers.

300
00:21:21,606 --> 00:21:24,442
- How am I doing?
- Just keep your knees bent.

301
00:21:24,485 --> 00:21:28,211
Imagine you're spreading butter
on a big piece of bread.

302
00:21:28,265 --> 00:21:30,921
That's it.
Spread that butter...

303
00:21:30,965 --> 00:21:32,450
with the Force.

304
00:21:32,496 --> 00:21:35,493
Ha! You guys seem like
crazy morons to me.

305
00:21:35,946 --> 00:21:38,081
You don't believe in the Force, do you?

306
00:21:38,106 --> 00:21:40,172
Oh, you mean that thing
you just found out about, like,

307
00:21:40,197 --> 00:21:42,983
three hours ago and are now
judging me for not believing in it?

308
00:21:43,006 --> 00:21:44,532
Do you believe in anything?

309
00:21:44,568 --> 00:21:46,931
Uh, yeah. Didn't you see
my Kabbalah bracelet?

310
00:21:46,955 --> 00:21:49,102
- What's Kabbalah?
- About a buck seventy-five.

311
00:21:50,107 --> 00:21:52,901
Honestly, I have no idea.
I'm just a slave to trends.

312
00:21:55,976 --> 00:21:57,012
What the hell?

313
00:21:57,076 --> 00:22:00,423
Oh, my God, we came out of hyperspace
into an asteroid field.

314
00:22:06,277 --> 00:22:08,841
Alderaan's been destroyed by the Empire.

315
00:22:08,878 --> 00:22:10,722
Maybe we should head for that small moon

316
00:22:10,736 --> 00:22:13,460
that's clearly a small moon
and not anything else.

317
00:22:16,566 --> 00:22:18,112
That's no moon.

318
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:20,152
It's a space station.

319
00:22:22,896 --> 00:22:25,142
Oh, crap, that got us in a tractor beam.

320
00:22:25,185 --> 00:22:27,250
Well, they're not gonna get me
without a fight.

321
00:22:29,658 --> 00:22:31,022
You can't win.

322
00:22:31,046 --> 00:22:33,563
But there are alternatives to fighting.

323
00:22:33,575 --> 00:22:34,453
Like what?

324
00:22:34,476 --> 00:22:37,013
Like getting the hell out of here!

325
00:22:38,626 --> 00:22:41,682
No, just kidding.
Can you imagine if I was like that?

326
00:23:22,238 --> 00:23:25,170
All right, just follow my lead
and act real cool.

327
00:23:47,307 --> 00:23:50,043
All right, I'm gonna go knock out
that tractor beam.

328
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:52,043
And we'll go rescue the princess.

329
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:55,831
You know Luke, this may be the last time
we see each other.

330
00:23:55,856 --> 00:23:58,170
So there's something I want you to know.

331
00:23:58,407 --> 00:24:00,141
<i>Now I've</i>

332
00:24:00,925 --> 00:24:04,461
<i>had the time of my life</i>

333
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:08,850
<i>And I owe it all to you...</i>

334
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:13,481
<i>I've been waiting for so long</i>

335
00:24:13,527 --> 00:24:17,661
<i>Now I've finally found someone
to stand by me</i>

336
00:24:20,256 --> 00:24:22,640
<i>So we take each other's hand</i>

337
00:24:22,696 --> 00:24:27,422
<i>Cause we seem to understand the urgency</i>

338
00:24:27,896 --> 00:24:29,923
<i>Just remember</i>

339
00:24:30,605 --> 00:24:33,703
<i>You're the one thing</i>

340
00:24:34,025 --> 00:24:37,841
<i>I can't get enough of</i>

341
00:24:39,065 --> 00:24:42,600
<i>So I'll tell you something</i>

342
00:24:44,078 --> 00:24:47,850
<i>This could be love
Because</i>

343
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:53,090
<i>I've had the time of my life</i>

344
00:24:53,145 --> 00:24:57,541
<i>No I never felt this way before</i>

345
00:24:57,626 --> 00:25:02,130
<i>Yes, I swear, it's the truth</i>

346
00:25:02,188 --> 00:25:06,493
<i>And I owe it all to you...</i>

347
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:16,622
Holly smoke!

348
00:25:21,828 --> 00:25:23,382
So, whate **** we are
on the first floor?

349
00:25:23,416 --> 00:25:25,052
Uh, we are on the second floor.

350
00:25:25,075 --> 00:25:27,860
No, no, no, **** here's the
Banana republic and we just pass that.

351
00:25:27,897 --> 00:25:28,631
Uh...

352
00:25:28,877 --> 00:25:30,651
... it's right back there.
We, we, uh...

353
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:32,372
we park on Macy's side, ****

354
00:25:32,387 --> 00:25:34,852
So now we must be other here
by the JCPenney.

355
00:25:34,878 --> 00:25:37,512
It looks that the first floor
is mostly main stuff, ****

356
00:25:37,526 --> 00:25:39,560
and there's a lady Foot Locker
right other there. ****

357
00:25:39,566 --> 00:25:41,112
All right, so we are on the third floor.

358
00:25:41,135 --> 00:25:42,422
All right, let's get in the elevator.

359
00:25:42,456 --> 00:25:45,510
And hurry up, 'cause the smell of
that Mrs. Fields is killing me.

360
00:26:01,637 --> 00:26:04,041
Where are you taking this... thing?

361
00:26:04,086 --> 00:26:06,620
Prisoner transfer from cell block 1138.

362
00:26:06,638 --> 00:26:08,672
You think you could get me
a room by the pool?

363
00:26:09,715 --> 00:26:12,200
Is funny because you are prisoner.

364
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:15,140
And there is no pool
because is Death Star.

365
00:26:17,476 --> 00:26:20,250
We got to find out what cell
this princess of yours is in.

366
00:26:20,268 --> 00:26:22,612
- There it is, 2187.
- I'm on it.

367
00:26:22,697 --> 00:26:25,891
Uh, everything's under control here.
Situation normal.

368
00:26:25,907 --> 00:26:26,843
<i>What happened?</i>

369
00:26:26,866 --> 00:26:29,501
We, uh, had a slight weapons
malfunction, but

370
00:26:29,606 --> 00:26:31,480
everything's perfectly all right.
We're fine.

371
00:26:31,528 --> 00:26:33,962
We're all fine... here... now...

372
00:26:34,087 --> 00:26:35,053
thank you.

373
00:26:35,425 --> 00:26:36,421
How are you?

374
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:38,750
<i>Uh... I've been better.</i>

375
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:40,601
- Well, tell me what's up.
<i>- Well,</i>

376
00:26:40,627 --> 00:26:43,862
<i>I'm in this relationship and
it doesn't seem to be going anywhere.</i>

377
00:26:43,897 --> 00:26:46,651
<i>I like her, but...
we're not really connecting.</i>

378
00:26:46,665 --> 00:26:48,671
- How long's it been?
<i>- About ten months.</i>

379
00:26:48,706 --> 00:26:51,121
- And how often do you see each other?
<i>- Couple of times a week.</i>

380
00:26:51,146 --> 00:26:53,630
Well, why don't you try seeing
each other a little more often

381
00:26:53,647 --> 00:26:55,212
and see if you connect a little more.

382
00:26:55,225 --> 00:26:57,253
And if not, it may be time to move on.

383
00:26:57,278 --> 00:26:58,222
Thanks for calling.

384
00:26:58,236 --> 00:26:59,371
This is Han Solo,

385
00:26:59,387 --> 00:27:01,663
and I'm going to be keeping you
company for the next few hours,

386
00:27:01,687 --> 00:27:03,611
right here on the midnight shift.

387
00:27:03,646 --> 00:27:07,903
<i>Something's telling me it might be you...</i>

388
00:27:09,238 --> 00:27:13,032
<i>It's telling me it might be you...</i>

389
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:17,683
Aren't you a little fat
to be a storm trooper?

390
00:27:17,705 --> 00:27:20,011
Well, stay here and rot,
you stuck-up bitch.

391
00:27:20,047 --> 00:27:21,571
Wait. Who are you?

392
00:27:21,585 --> 00:27:22,902
I'm Luke Skywalker.

393
00:27:22,928 --> 00:27:25,490
Me and Han Solo and Obi-Wan
are here to rescue you.

394
00:27:25,507 --> 00:27:28,063
- Wait, Obi-Wan Kenobi?
- Yeah.

395
00:27:28,096 --> 00:27:30,302
Suddenly I'm not so fat, huh?

396
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,441
Come on, into the garbage chute.

397
00:27:44,708 --> 00:27:46,651
She's right. Come on, Chewbacca.

398
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,543
Are you kidding? It's probably full
of disease. I'm not jumping in there.

399
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:51,693
Not even if I throw this pig's ear?

400
00:27:51,716 --> 00:27:53,913
- Oh, come on, that's not fair.
- Go get it!

401
00:27:57,225 --> 00:28:00,483
Oh, boy, great idea, Princess,
diving into a pile of garbage.

402
00:28:00,497 --> 00:28:02,483
When we get out of here,
maybe you can show me around

403
00:28:02,497 --> 00:28:03,802
your home planet of Alderaan.

404
00:28:03,826 --> 00:28:05,050
Aw...!

405
00:28:05,097 --> 00:28:06,231
Too soon?

406
00:28:06,258 --> 00:28:07,780
Hey, it could be worse.

407
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:10,570
It's worse.

408
00:28:13,808 --> 00:28:15,922
The walls are closing!

409
00:28:19,536 --> 00:28:22,210
Listen to them, R-2. They're dying.
What do we do?

410
00:28:22,247 --> 00:28:24,531
Only one thing to do, man.

411
00:28:24,557 --> 00:28:26,823
You still got that bag I gave you?

412
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:35,680
Man, I wish I could listen to some
Tattooine, Wind and Fire right now.

413
00:28:35,845 --> 00:28:36,742
Mm...

414
00:28:36,776 --> 00:28:39,642
So you think
the Empire's gonna fall, man?

415
00:28:39,756 --> 00:28:41,633
I-I-I don't...I don't know, man.

416
00:28:42,486 --> 00:28:45,292
H-How you, how you, how you,
how you doing right now?

417
00:28:45,326 --> 00:28:46,790
Good. Why?

418
00:28:46,885 --> 00:28:47,551
I think,

419
00:28:47,598 --> 00:28:51,051
I think, I think I... I think I may be
having sort of... a mini freak-out here.

420
00:28:51,077 --> 00:28:52,563
- Oh.
- Just-Just...

421
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:54,991
Just tell me I don't have
to stay in this room.

422
00:28:55,005 --> 00:28:55,642
What?

423
00:28:55,665 --> 00:28:58,492
Just tell me right now that I...
that I don't have to stay in this room.

424
00:28:58,508 --> 00:29:00,602
You don't have to stay in this room.

425
00:29:00,615 --> 00:29:01,781
Oh, thank God.

426
00:29:07,798 --> 00:29:09,670
Thank God we're saved.

427
00:29:10,446 --> 00:29:13,630
Look at this.
Who throws out half a pizza?

428
00:29:13,647 --> 00:29:15,030
And look at this couch.

429
00:29:15,058 --> 00:29:18,240
Somebody threw out a whole couch
and it's in great shape.

430
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,973
Yeah, you put a little Febreze on that,

431
00:29:19,986 --> 00:29:22,261
scrub it out a little bit,
it'll look great in your apartment.

432
00:29:22,285 --> 00:29:23,133
You know what?

433
00:29:23,157 --> 00:29:26,021
I know we have a dangerous job
to do here, but

434
00:29:26,046 --> 00:29:27,221
I'm taking this.

435
00:29:27,246 --> 00:29:28,672
I'm taking this couch.

436
00:29:28,988 --> 00:29:30,120
All right, you ready?

437
00:29:30,155 --> 00:29:32,761
All right, one... two... three.

438
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:35,420
- Easy, easy, easy.
- Okay.

439
00:29:36,665 --> 00:29:38,583
- Stop, stop, stop, stop...
- What? What...?

440
00:29:39,016 --> 00:29:40,801
- No, no, no, no... Twist it.
- I am.

441
00:29:41,927 --> 00:29:44,171
No, no, no, no, no, other way.
You're twisting the wrong way.

442
00:29:44,175 --> 00:29:46,161
- What do you want me to do?
- Just look down, all right.

443
00:29:46,175 --> 00:29:47,880
Just look at me, look what I'm doing.

444
00:29:47,898 --> 00:29:49,192
- You see the way I'm twisting it?
- Yeah.

445
00:29:49,215 --> 00:29:51,192
- Turn it that way from your end.
- Okay.

446
00:29:51,825 --> 00:29:52,851
No, no, no, no, no.

447
00:29:54,536 --> 00:29:56,320
Put it down. Put it down. Just drop it.

448
00:29:56,348 --> 00:29:57,432
All right. All right.

449
00:29:57,455 --> 00:29:58,301
All right, let's...

450
00:29:58,866 --> 00:30:00,571
Just hang on and figure this out.

451
00:30:00,596 --> 00:30:02,932
Han, there are storm troopers
all over the place.

452
00:30:02,948 --> 00:30:04,532
Shouldn't we be getting out of here?

453
00:30:04,878 --> 00:30:06,483
All right, okay, all right, okay.

454
00:30:06,506 --> 00:30:07,990
I got it, I know... okay, okay...

455
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,741
Here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna take the cushions off,

456
00:30:10,755 --> 00:30:12,081
unscrew the legs,

457
00:30:12,116 --> 00:30:15,112
take the mattress out and this
whole thing is gonna be a lot simpler.

458
00:30:15,138 --> 00:30:16,962
It's easier than we're making it.

459
00:30:38,366 --> 00:30:39,892
Hey, did you hear something?

460
00:30:39,917 --> 00:30:42,252
Probably just another drill.

461
00:30:42,295 --> 00:30:44,592
You know that last drill we had?

462
00:30:44,626 --> 00:30:47,550
I was about to finally
bone my girlfriend,

463
00:30:47,566 --> 00:30:50,173
and then we heard
that there was this drill

464
00:30:50,195 --> 00:30:52,862
and she told me there was no way.

465
00:30:58,797 --> 00:31:00,461
So, Obi-Wan...

466
00:31:00,638 --> 00:31:02,041
we meet again.

467
00:31:02,216 --> 00:31:06,510
What part of "stay 50 yards away
at all times" don't you understand?

468
00:31:08,848 --> 00:31:10,013
Uh-oh.

469
00:31:10,066 --> 00:31:12,512
Your powers are weak, old man.

470
00:31:15,466 --> 00:31:16,810
Obi-Wan!

471
00:31:18,485 --> 00:31:20,792
Boy, you got here just in time.

472
00:31:22,465 --> 00:31:23,810
No...!

473
00:31:32,718 --> 00:31:35,110
All right, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

474
00:31:38,127 --> 00:31:39,622
All right, twist it counter-clockwise.

475
00:31:39,628 --> 00:31:41,351
I am twisting it.
You're twisting it the other way.

476
00:31:41,355 --> 00:31:43,533
I mean counter-clockwise
from where I'm standing

477
00:31:43,557 --> 00:31:44,913
so... so th... so then you...

478
00:31:44,925 --> 00:31:45,851
so clockwise.

479
00:31:46,826 --> 00:31:48,322
You twist it clockwise.

480
00:31:48,528 --> 00:31:49,692
Okay... okay, go.

481
00:31:50,336 --> 00:31:52,321
You know what? Put it down,
put it down for a second.

482
00:31:52,335 --> 00:31:54,562
- My fingers are killing me.
- Han, they're shooting at us!

483
00:31:54,597 --> 00:31:56,340
You know what? Lift it up tall ways.

484
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,711
Aw, for cr...
oh, it's wedged. It's wedged.

485
00:32:01,135 --> 00:32:03,423
You know what? It's not going anywhere.
Let's just take off,

486
00:32:03,437 --> 00:32:04,461
we'll deal with it later.

487
00:32:04,478 --> 00:32:06,352
You get in the cockpit and I'll just...

488
00:32:06,376 --> 00:32:08,112
I'll hang on to this thing as we go.

489
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:20,962
Easy.

490
00:32:33,158 --> 00:32:35,321
I can't believe he's gone.

491
00:32:35,356 --> 00:32:37,460
I know, Luke, but it's true.

492
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:38,622
He's gone.

493
00:32:38,776 --> 00:32:41,092
I mean, you saw him get beheaded.

494
00:32:41,117 --> 00:32:44,503
Nobody lives through that...
Not for long, anyway.

495
00:32:44,516 --> 00:32:47,562
I mean, sometimes the brain
is still active for a few minutes

496
00:32:47,568 --> 00:32:49,182
after the beheading, but...

497
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:52,341
to be honest, I can't imagine
a worse kind of hell.

498
00:32:52,356 --> 00:32:53,751
And unfortunately,

499
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:55,842
hell is probably where he'll end up,

500
00:32:55,866 --> 00:32:59,452
because the Christians don't look
too kindly on the whole Force thing.

501
00:32:59,518 --> 00:33:01,672
Come on, kid,
we're not out of the woods yet.

502
00:33:05,518 --> 00:33:06,812
Here they come!

503
00:33:23,528 --> 00:33:25,020
- Hey, Han!
- What?!

504
00:33:25,037 --> 00:33:27,973
- Why do they call them "Tie Fighters"?
- - No idea!

505
00:33:40,405 --> 00:33:42,161
They're coming too fast!

506
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,170
Oh, boy. Nickel for every time
that's happened.

507
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,421
Just keep shooting, Luke!

508
00:33:53,946 --> 00:33:56,440
That's how we do it
in my neighborhood, bitch!

509
00:34:00,746 --> 00:34:02,641
I got him! I got him!

510
00:34:02,655 --> 00:34:04,470
Great, kid! Don't get penis-y!

511
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:11,301
I just want to tell you both...

512
00:34:11,346 --> 00:34:13,371
Good luck.
We're all counting on you.

513
00:34:39,845 --> 00:34:40,792
Mom?

514
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,331
Yeah. Yeah we won.

515
00:34:42,745 --> 00:34:44,063
Yeah, we won the battle.

516
00:34:44,906 --> 00:34:46,651
Yeah, I'm calling like you asked.

517
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:47,703
Okay.

518
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:48,583
Okay.

519
00:34:48,826 --> 00:34:50,432
Okay, but...
okay, but I gotta go...

520
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:52,111
I got other stuff to do.

521
00:34:52,478 --> 00:34:53,312
O-Okay

522
00:34:53,455 --> 00:34:54,950
Okay, okay, but I gotta go.

523
00:34:55,585 --> 00:34:56,351
Okay.

524
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:57,992
Okay, yes.

525
00:34:58,435 --> 00:34:59,261
Yes.

526
00:34:59,788 --> 00:35:01,182
Yes, yes, Mom.

527
00:35:01,207 --> 00:35:03,481
I-I love you too, Mom.
Okay, all right, good-bye.

528
00:35:26,998 --> 00:35:28,512
P-choo. P-choo.

529
00:35:28,536 --> 00:35:29,740
Gotcha.

530
00:35:32,456 --> 00:35:36,260
Thanks to the information in this
R-2 unit provided by Princess Leia,

531
00:35:36,306 --> 00:35:39,782
we should be able to mount a
successful offensive on the Death Star.

532
00:35:39,807 --> 00:35:40,662
But first,

533
00:35:40,676 --> 00:35:43,493
please take a moment to watch
this instructional video.

534
00:35:48,966 --> 00:35:50,532
Nothing but net.

535
00:35:50,686 --> 00:35:51,422
Hi,

536
00:35:51,448 --> 00:35:55,813
I'm Magic Johnson with a few tips
on blowing up the Death Star.

537
00:35:55,997 --> 00:35:59,171
First off, never forget your objective.

538
00:35:59,207 --> 00:36:03,181
There gonna be so many folks
coming at you to slow you down,

539
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:06,820
you might feel like you got
a bull's-eye on your head.

540
00:36:07,026 --> 00:36:09,942
No, but they will be trying to kill you.

541
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:14,321
Also, don't forget you have teammates
out there watching your back.

542
00:36:14,378 --> 00:36:18,380
Unless you been messing around
with their wife or girlfriend.

543
00:36:18,546 --> 00:36:21,382
No, but they will be there to help you.

544
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:22,731
Lastly,

545
00:36:22,765 --> 00:36:26,933
you wanna make sure you step back and
take cover after you sink that bucket,

546
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:30,702
'cause that sky gonna light up
like the Fourth of July.

547
00:36:31,025 --> 00:36:34,802
No, but there will be a large explosion.

548
00:36:46,098 --> 00:36:48,323
Well, kid, I guess this is good-bye.

549
00:36:48,335 --> 00:36:51,140
So, you got your reward
and you're leaving. Is that it?

550
00:36:51,157 --> 00:36:52,970
When you say it that way,
I sound like a douche,

551
00:36:52,985 --> 00:36:54,123
but, yeah, that's what I'm doing.

552
00:36:54,135 --> 00:36:56,160
What'd you get for a reward anyway?

553
00:36:56,385 --> 00:36:59,622
Uh, let's see,
I got 10% off a Netflix membership,

554
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,761
uh...

555
00:37:00,828 --> 00:37:02,922
some nice Cracker Barrel Cheddar,

556
00:37:03,288 --> 00:37:08,343
assorted lotions, and a little plastic
champagne bottle full of jelly beans...

557
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:10,001
and a little bear.

558
00:37:10,207 --> 00:37:11,883
See? Little bear?

559
00:37:12,168 --> 00:37:15,021
"Hey, Luke. We had fun
on the Death Star."

560
00:37:15,048 --> 00:37:16,942
Well, take care of yourself, Han.

561
00:37:16,956 --> 00:37:18,970
I guess that's what you're best at.

562
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:21,761
Oh, look, a light saber cheese knife.

563
00:37:26,018 --> 00:37:26,962
Yuck.

564
00:37:41,487 --> 00:37:42,740
All wings. Check in.

565
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:45,353
- Red three standing by.
- Red six standing by.

566
00:37:45,368 --> 00:37:48,122
- Red five standing by.
- Red Buttons standing by.

567
00:37:48,147 --> 00:37:50,622
- Redd Foxx standin' by!
- Big Red standing by.

568
00:37:50,645 --> 00:37:53,821
<i>- Red October standing by.</i>
- Helen Reddy standing by.

569
00:37:53,837 --> 00:37:55,651
Simply Red standing by.

570
00:38:25,776 --> 00:38:28,210
I'm going in. Cover me, Porkins!

571
00:38:28,275 --> 00:38:30,513
Uh, having a little trouble here.

572
00:38:42,097 --> 00:38:45,193
Careful, Redd Foxx,
there's one right on your tail!

573
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:52,063
Ahh! I'm comin', Elizabeth!

574
00:39:00,668 --> 00:39:02,790
<i>Use the Force, Luke.</i>

575
00:39:02,826 --> 00:39:05,583
- Obi-Wan?
<i>- Yeah, it's me.</i>

576
00:39:05,705 --> 00:39:07,730
<i>Use the Force.</i>

577
00:39:07,757 --> 00:39:09,391
<i>Force that thing in there.</i>

578
00:39:09,406 --> 00:39:11,541
<i>Just like I showed you
with those puppets.</i>

579
00:39:11,556 --> 00:39:14,482
<i>but don't tell anybody
 'cause you'll get in trouble.</i>

580
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:25,033
Clark, I don't like the look
of this neighborhood.

581
00:39:25,045 --> 00:39:26,711
Come on, Ellen,
it's important for the kids

582
00:39:26,726 --> 00:39:28,370
to witness the plight of the rebellion.

583
00:39:28,395 --> 00:39:30,131
Kids, you noticing all this plight?

584
00:39:30,975 --> 00:39:32,003
Roll 'em up!

585
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:40,330
The Force is strong with this one.

586
00:39:44,488 --> 00:39:46,571
**** you, you son of a bitch!

587
00:39:46,598 --> 00:39:48,401
What am I, R2-Pac?!

588
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:50,503
<i>The Death Star is getting closer.</i>

589
00:39:50,575 --> 00:39:53,282
And Leia's getting larger!

590
00:40:04,845 --> 00:40:07,122
I have you now, young Skywalker!

591
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:10,400
And with today's gas prices,
not a minute too soon.

592
00:40:12,605 --> 00:40:13,532
What the deuce?!

593
00:40:16,078 --> 00:40:16,910
Look at this.

594
00:40:16,925 --> 00:40:19,542
Look how much more comfortable
we are now shooting stuff.

595
00:40:47,425 --> 00:40:51,521
<i>Luke, the Force will be with you always.</i>

596
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:53,512
<i>And so will I.</i>

597
00:40:53,527 --> 00:40:54,991
<i>Always.</i>

598
00:40:55,028 --> 00:40:58,262
<i>'Course, when you get older
and get some crow's feet,</i>

599
00:40:58,296 --> 00:41:00,301
<i>I might lose interest.</i>

600
00:41:09,295 --> 00:41:10,750
The end.

601
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:14,681
Well, Dad,

602
00:41:14,695 --> 00:41:16,323
thanks for keeping us entertained.

603
00:41:16,336 --> 00:41:17,992
That was a great story.

604
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:19,242
Yeah, but

605
00:41:19,265 --> 00:41:22,492
didn't Robot Chicken already
do this three months ago?

606
00:41:22,528 --> 00:41:24,030
Well, I wouldn't worry about it, Chris.

607
00:41:24,055 --> 00:41:26,821
I don't think people are even aware
of that show's existence.

608
00:41:26,858 --> 00:41:29,703
Well, I don't know, Dad. I think
a decent number of people watch it.

609
00:41:29,738 --> 00:41:31,062
Oh really? Define "decent."

610
00:41:31,078 --> 00:41:33,670
I think it's the highest-rated show
on Cartoon Network

611
00:41:33,707 --> 00:41:36,070
and the Star Wars episode
doubled that audience.

612
00:41:36,098 --> 00:41:38,903
Well, yeah, but double ten people
is like 20 people,

613
00:41:38,918 --> 00:41:41,283
so, I mean, what kind of numbers
are we talking about here, you know?

614
00:41:41,297 --> 00:41:42,793
Don't be glib about this stuff, Dad.

615
00:41:42,808 --> 00:41:45,490
It's a legitimate show
and they beat you to the punch.

616
00:41:45,567 --> 00:41:47,350
Uh... I don't know about that, Chris.

617
00:41:47,367 --> 00:41:51,212
I mean, to me, a legitimate show
is on ABC, CBS, NBC...

618
00:41:51,226 --> 00:41:52,940
You know, one of the real networks.

619
00:41:53,335 --> 00:41:54,950
I don't know about that, Dad.

620
00:41:54,968 --> 00:41:57,420
And besides, what's up
with that 15-minute runtime?

621
00:41:57,437 --> 00:42:01,042
What is that? It's like 15 minutes
of guys playing with Star Wars dolls?

622
00:42:01,058 --> 00:42:04,341
- Oh, yay, yay, tune me into that.
- Oh, so you do know the show.

623
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:07,343
I read part of a review online.
I am not a fan.

624
00:42:07,845 --> 00:42:10,193
You know, Dad, you're a real jerk!
