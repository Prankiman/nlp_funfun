11
00:00:35,361 --> 00:00:37,545
I got to say, some days I wish

12
00:00:37,546 --> 00:00:39,447
I didn't have a sister.

13
00:00:39,448 --> 00:00:42,149
Oh...

14
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,384
- What?
- Nothing.

15
00:00:43,385 --> 00:00:44,719
Oh, I thought you asked me

16
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,254
what was going on with my sister.

17
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:49,290
I did not.

18
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:50,992
Hey, look. Tom Tucker.

19
00:00:50,993 --> 00:00:52,326
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.

20
00:00:52,327 --> 00:00:54,462
Coming up, tonight's second story.

21
00:00:54,463 --> 00:00:56,530
But first, Quahog says good-bye

22
00:00:56,531 --> 00:00:57,798
to an old friend.

23
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:59,800
That's right, Tom. Medieval Castle,

24
00:00:59,801 --> 00:01:02,169
which has been a staple of
family entertainment and dining,

25
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,537
is closing its doors.

26
00:01:03,538 --> 00:01:05,373
The restaurant has
gone into foreclosure,

27
00:01:05,374 --> 00:01:07,408
and will be up for auction tomorrow.

28
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,777
Yes, hard to believe a place
where you eat with your hands

29
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,245
next to piles of horse dung

30
00:01:11,246 --> 00:01:13,080
while untrained theater students fight

31
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:15,750
with real swords could
be drowning in lawsuits.

32
00:01:15,751 --> 00:01:17,752
Medieval Castle? I love that place.

33
00:01:17,753 --> 00:01:19,600
My sister almost got a job there once.

34
00:01:19,601 --> 00:01:22,156
Guys, we should go to that
auction tomorrow and buy it.

35
00:01:22,157 --> 00:01:25,126
I mean, can you imagine if we
had our own medieval castle?

36
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:26,160
I bet it'd be even more fun

37
00:01:26,161 --> 00:01:28,012
than when I went to White Castle.

38
00:01:30,283 --> 00:01:33,751
Huh. Name's a little deceiving.

39
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,043
What's wrong with you?

40
00:01:42,044 --> 00:01:44,045
Oh, it's my back. It's killing me.

41
00:01:44,046 --> 00:01:46,647
Yeah, I'm not falling for that
hot-oil massage bit again.

42
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:47,906
No, this time it's not a bit.

43
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:49,219
I'm really hurt.

44
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,250
I must have jacked it up playing sports

45
00:01:51,251 --> 00:01:53,552
and not trying to dance like Beyoncé.

46
00:01:53,553 --> 00:01:54,786
Wow. If you're in that much pain,

47
00:01:54,787 --> 00:01:55,821
I better tell Lois.

48
00:01:55,822 --> 00:01:57,289
Please don't.

49
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,757
Then she'll drive me to the doctor,

50
00:01:58,758 --> 00:02:00,859
and I hate being in the car with her.

51
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,895
♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪

52
00:02:03,896 --> 00:02:07,232
♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪
♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪

53
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:09,601
♪ Shut the door, baby,
don't say a word ♪

54
00:02:09,602 --> 00:02:12,871
Okay, I guess that's<i> not</i> my part.

55
00:02:15,942 --> 00:02:18,477
There it is, guys. Aw,
this is gonna be awesome!

56
00:02:18,478 --> 00:02:19,845
We just got to win this auction,

57
00:02:19,846 --> 00:02:21,480
and then we'll have our own castle.

58
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:24,716
Oh, yeah? Over my dead tooth!

59
00:02:24,717 --> 00:02:26,952
Good afternoon, and welcome
to today's auction.

60
00:02:26,953 --> 00:02:28,520
I'm Al Harrington, of Al Harrington's

61
00:02:28,521 --> 00:02:30,122
Wacky Waving Inflatable Arm-Flailing

62
00:02:30,123 --> 00:02:31,857
Tubeman Warehouse and Emporium.

63
00:02:31,858 --> 00:02:33,325
Due to the presence of black mold,

64
00:02:33,326 --> 00:02:34,993
discarded half-eaten turkey legs,

65
00:02:34,994 --> 00:02:37,696
and an undulating rat king
that no one dares approach,

66
00:02:37,697 --> 00:02:40,032
I have been advised to move
these proceedings along

67
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:41,366
as quickly as possible.

68
00:02:41,367 --> 00:02:43,402
Do I hear an opening bid? Anyone.

69
00:02:43,403 --> 00:02:45,604
Do I hear an opening
bid for this majestic

70
00:02:45,605 --> 00:02:47,039
fiberglass castle facade,

71
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,474
masking what was once
a Midas Muffler shop?

72
00:02:49,475 --> 00:02:50,642
Two bits.

73
00:02:50,643 --> 00:02:53,078
Two bits. That's 25
cents in the Old West.

74
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:56,515
We have 25 cents. Do I
hear higher than 25 cents?

75
00:02:56,516 --> 00:02:59,718
This paper bag, which could
be full of money or my socks.

76
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:00,952
You take the chance.

77
00:03:00,953 --> 00:03:02,754
We have an intriguing mystery bag.

78
00:03:02,755 --> 00:03:04,890
Do I hear more than the mystery bag?

79
00:03:04,891 --> 00:03:06,925
Two bits and a cardboard box,

80
00:03:06,926 --> 00:03:10,295
which may or may not
contain a mystery bag.

81
00:03:10,296 --> 00:03:12,030
Already the most challenging auction

82
00:03:12,031 --> 00:03:13,332
I have ever been a part of.

83
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,633
Do I hear a higher bid

84
00:03:14,634 --> 00:03:16,802
from that James Bond villain over there?

85
00:03:16,803 --> 00:03:19,738
50 kroner.

86
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:21,440
Which, converted to American currency,

87
00:03:21,441 --> 00:03:23,108
is $7.40.

88
00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:26,244
Do I hear a much higher bid,
followed by shocked murmuring?

89
00:03:26,245 --> 00:03:28,747
$10,000!

90
00:03:28,748 --> 00:03:30,264
- I'm shocked.
- That's shocking.

91
00:03:30,265 --> 00:03:31,617
We're all shocked.

92
00:03:31,618 --> 00:03:33,085
We can't afford that.

93
00:03:33,086 --> 00:03:34,886
Peter, do something. I can't.

94
00:03:34,887 --> 00:03:37,656
There's only $9,000 in the mystery bag.

95
00:03:37,657 --> 00:03:39,358
Due to my 12:00 noon court appointment

96
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:41,259
as part of a crippling
child-custody battle

97
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,761
with my horrific ex-wife,

98
00:03:42,762 --> 00:03:45,063
I am saying going once, going twice,

99
00:03:45,064 --> 00:03:48,834
and awarding this condemned
building to you...!

100
00:03:50,436 --> 00:03:51,703
Damn, it, we lost!

101
00:03:51,704 --> 00:03:54,239
I guess the castle was
a crazy idea anyway.

102
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,841
I should probably just invest this money

103
00:03:55,842 --> 00:03:57,492
in a 401-Gay.

104
00:03:58,962 --> 00:04:01,042
And how long before I can take this out?

105
00:04:05,702 --> 00:04:08,487
Man, those losers don't
deserve that castle.

106
00:04:08,488 --> 00:04:10,655
I would call my sister about this

107
00:04:10,656 --> 00:04:12,724
if she were able to answer the phone.

108
00:04:12,725 --> 00:04:15,360
Poor thing.

109
00:04:15,361 --> 00:04:16,661
Poor, poor thing.

110
00:04:16,662 --> 00:04:19,164
Well, you know, in castle times,

111
00:04:19,165 --> 00:04:20,866
if you wanted something,
you just took it.

112
00:04:20,867 --> 00:04:22,033
What are you talking about?

113
00:04:22,034 --> 00:04:24,603
I'm saying the four of us
should storm that castle

114
00:04:24,604 --> 00:04:25,971
and take it for ourselves.

115
00:04:25,972 --> 00:04:27,706
Should we do it with careful planning,

116
00:04:27,707 --> 00:04:30,475
or have another couple beers
and then just go for it?

117
00:04:30,476 --> 00:04:31,643
Well, let's make that decision

118
00:04:31,644 --> 00:04:33,595
after another couple beers.

119
00:04:38,635 --> 00:04:40,752
I checked with my mom, and she said

120
00:04:40,753 --> 00:04:43,989
it was cool with her if we
wanted to sleep here tonight.

121
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,091
- I'm pretty sure I can.
- Count me in.

122
00:04:46,092 --> 00:04:49,043
I'm gonna have to go
home and get my pillow.

123
00:04:53,466 --> 00:04:56,601
Yes, you heard me right,
cancel my insurance.

124
00:04:56,602 --> 00:04:59,070
I've been in this location for 40 years,

125
00:04:59,071 --> 00:05:01,273
and never once have I broken a lamp.

126
00:05:01,274 --> 00:05:02,991
Good day, sir.

127
00:05:06,563 --> 00:05:09,214
God, I hope he's got insurance.

128
00:05:09,215 --> 00:05:10,415
Of course he's got insurance.

129
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,534
He's been at this location for 40 years.

130
00:05:15,238 --> 00:05:16,755
Yes, you heard me right.

131
00:05:16,756 --> 00:05:18,623
Cancel my husband's life insurance.

132
00:05:18,624 --> 00:05:20,759
He's been in perfect
health for 40 years.

133
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,295
We're selling the lamp
store and going to travel.

134
00:05:23,296 --> 00:05:25,831
We need this after losing
both our children.

135
00:05:25,832 --> 00:05:27,599
Good day, sir.

136
00:05:31,288 --> 00:05:32,871
All right, plan "B."

137
00:05:32,872 --> 00:05:35,440
We'll shoot flaming arrows,
like in<i> Robin Hood.</i>

138
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:38,009
So should I be aiming
for an open window,

139
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,611
or just arcing it over the wall?

140
00:05:39,612 --> 00:05:40,946
I don't know, I've never seen the movie,

141
00:05:40,947 --> 00:05:42,414
just the Bryan Adams video.

142
00:05:42,415 --> 00:05:43,949
Oh, such a good song.

143
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,950
Archers...

144
00:05:44,951 --> 00:05:46,117
Yeah?

145
00:05:46,118 --> 00:05:47,752
Oh, yeah, he's that guy, too.

146
00:05:47,753 --> 00:05:49,537
Prepare to fire.

147
00:05:58,831 --> 00:06:00,365
I wonder what they're gonna put here.

148
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:01,433
Trader Joe's?

149
00:06:01,434 --> 00:06:04,419
Oh, I would<i> love</i> a Trader Joe's!

150
00:06:08,258 --> 00:06:10,442
Sorry to keep you, I was reading this

151
00:06:10,443 --> 00:06:12,377
<i>Highlights</i> magazine in the waiting room.

152
00:06:12,378 --> 00:06:14,779
Do you see any differences
between these two pictures?

153
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,748
Oh, the pie has a wedge removed.

154
00:06:16,749 --> 00:06:18,450
Yes, yes.

155
00:06:18,451 --> 00:06:20,385
Dr. Hartman, were you
able to tell anything

156
00:06:20,386 --> 00:06:21,653
from Stewie's X rays?

157
00:06:21,654 --> 00:06:24,055
Oh, yeah. Little guy's got scoliosis.

158
00:06:24,056 --> 00:06:25,590
Oh, my God.

159
00:06:25,591 --> 00:06:28,693
Oh, no, am I gonna be a
big-shoe, small-shoe guy?

160
00:06:28,694 --> 00:06:30,128
But don't worry, he'll be fine.

161
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:32,030
He just needs to wear
this brace for a while

162
00:06:32,031 --> 00:06:34,032
- to correct it.
- Oh, dear.

163
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:36,401
Now, does he have any
school pictures coming up?

164
00:06:36,402 --> 00:06:37,969
Yeah, he actually does.

165
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,070
Well, then, this will not be

166
00:06:39,071 --> 00:06:41,456
a "refrigerator door" year.

167
00:06:45,462 --> 00:06:47,412
All right, this says if
we don't get arrested

168
00:06:47,413 --> 00:06:48,914
for the next six months,

169
00:06:48,915 --> 00:06:51,416
the arson and mayhem
charges will be dropped.

170
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:52,984
Hey, sorry again, you guys.

171
00:06:52,985 --> 00:06:54,119
Ah, no harm done.

172
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,754
Yeah, no hard feelings, fellas.

173
00:06:55,755 --> 00:06:57,322
I've already forgotten about it.

174
00:06:57,323 --> 00:06:59,624
I'm too busy thinking about
my hot date tonight.

175
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,426
Yeah, right. "Hot date."

176
00:07:01,427 --> 00:07:03,261
With your left hand or your right hand?

177
00:07:03,262 --> 00:07:06,097
Actually, I use both and
do, like, an Indian burn.

178
00:07:06,098 --> 00:07:07,899
But that's not what this is.

179
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,768
Tonight I'm getting lucky.

180
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:11,002
Hi, are you Mort?

181
00:07:11,003 --> 00:07:13,488
Why, yes, I am.

182
00:07:14,891 --> 00:07:17,509
What the hell was that?
Mort's getting laid?

183
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,711
Yeah, thanks to Tinder,
he's had a different girl

184
00:07:19,712 --> 00:07:21,346
every night this week.

185
00:07:21,347 --> 00:07:22,447
What's "Tinder"?

186
00:07:22,448 --> 00:07:23,648
It's an app for your phone

187
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:25,483
where two strangers can hook up

188
00:07:25,484 --> 00:07:27,352
for a dirty liaison.

189
00:07:27,353 --> 00:07:28,620
- What, like hookers?
- Nope.

190
00:07:28,621 --> 00:07:30,422
Just two horny people with phones.

191
00:07:30,423 --> 00:07:31,590
Wait, I don't get it.

192
00:07:31,591 --> 00:07:34,192
So you hit 'em on the head with
your phone and knock 'em out?

193
00:07:34,193 --> 00:07:37,062
No, you just swipe someone's picture,
they come over, and you plow 'em.

194
00:07:37,063 --> 00:07:39,297
Wow! I gotta try this.

195
00:07:39,298 --> 00:07:41,166
I mean, easy sex on the Internet?

196
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:43,268
Did you know about this, Scott Baio?

197
00:07:43,269 --> 00:07:44,502
Uh, yeah.

198
00:07:44,503 --> 00:07:45,870
And you, Scott Caan?

199
00:07:45,871 --> 00:07:48,473
Did you also know about
easy sex on the Internet?

200
00:07:48,474 --> 00:07:49,225
Yes.

201
00:07:49,226 --> 00:07:52,592
And how about you, douche bag
music producer Scott Storch?

202
00:07:52,593 --> 00:07:54,874
Quagmire, all the Scotts know about it.

203
00:07:59,987 --> 00:08:02,504
Okay, let's get me set
up on this Tinder thing.

204
00:08:02,505 --> 00:08:04,039
I can't wait to start getting laid

205
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,207
at the push of a button.

206
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,075
Well, first you got to
set up your profile.

207
00:08:07,076 --> 00:08:10,245
Oh, yeah, I've been working on that.
I wrote several long paragraphs

208
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:12,614
describing my interests,
some pet peeves,

209
00:08:12,615 --> 00:08:15,317
choice of wine, a couple
of inspirational quotes,

210
00:08:15,318 --> 00:08:16,952
things I've learned from my cats...

211
00:08:16,953 --> 00:08:18,153
No, no, no, no. None of that.

212
00:08:18,154 --> 00:08:20,122
You want a naked bathroom selfie

213
00:08:20,123 --> 00:08:22,891
covering your stuff with
a fistful of $100 bills.

214
00:08:22,892 --> 00:08:26,495
That shows you like sex,
and you got mon-ay!

215
00:08:26,496 --> 00:08:27,829
Well, that seems a bit crude.

216
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,865
Oh, she's cute.

217
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:31,400
And wearing a yin-yang necklace.

218
00:08:31,401 --> 00:08:33,802
That's interesting. I
wonder what beach that is.

219
00:08:33,803 --> 00:08:35,137
No, no, no. Give me that.

220
00:08:35,138 --> 00:08:36,672
Here, you see this? You
see what I'm doing?

221
00:08:36,673 --> 00:08:38,507
Not even looking. I'm swiping "yes."

222
00:08:38,508 --> 00:08:41,043
Yes, yes, yes. Casting a wide net.

223
00:08:41,044 --> 00:08:42,273
Heh, look at this.

224
00:08:42,274 --> 00:08:44,376
You already got a hit.
And she sent a message.

225
00:08:44,377 --> 00:08:46,948
She did? What am I looking at here?

226
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:49,084
It's mostly small, colorful pictures.

227
00:08:49,085 --> 00:08:51,086
Those are emojis. Read 'em.

228
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:53,655
Okay, it says "Hey,"
and then a kissy face,

229
00:08:53,656 --> 00:08:56,291
and then, like, a saucy, smirking face,

230
00:08:56,292 --> 00:08:58,160
three balloons, and a locomotive.

231
00:08:58,161 --> 00:08:59,227
What the hell is all this?

232
00:08:59,228 --> 00:09:01,596
Maybe she likes you.
Send something back.

233
00:09:01,597 --> 00:09:05,300
Okay. "Dearest Theresa, I
hope this finds you well.

234
00:09:05,301 --> 00:09:07,836
I so appreciated your
last communication..."

235
00:09:07,837 --> 00:09:09,930
No, stop, stop! God, stop, stop!

236
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:12,477
Just send her an eggplant
and the erupting volcano.

237
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,496
All right, take a gander.

238
00:09:21,497 --> 00:09:23,599
Gawk at the Elephant Man.
Let's get it all out.

239
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,702
- There's our brave guy.
- Brave?

240
00:09:26,703 --> 00:09:28,670
And just for being such a trooper,

241
00:09:28,671 --> 00:09:30,272
I thought maybe you could be

242
00:09:30,273 --> 00:09:32,040
the first in line for snack today.

243
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,309
Really? On pretzel day?

244
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:37,312
And after that, you can hold the bunny!

245
00:09:37,313 --> 00:09:38,447
Yeah, I'll pass on that.

246
00:09:38,448 --> 00:09:40,449
But the pretzel thing
sounds up my alley.

247
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,484
Now, if I could just find someone

248
00:09:42,485 --> 00:09:44,453
to wear this hero hat.

249
00:09:44,454 --> 00:09:47,823
I think I found him.

250
00:09:47,824 --> 00:09:50,659
Well, I say, that was
a pleasant surprise.

251
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,761
You know, like when a woman
in a Porsche Cayenne

252
00:09:52,762 --> 00:09:54,446
isn't a complete bitch.

253
00:09:56,617 --> 00:09:59,968
Huh. Well, I did not expect that.

254
00:10:01,204 --> 00:10:02,904
I wasn't telling you to go,

255
00:10:02,905 --> 00:10:05,022
I was trying to smell my own fart.

256
00:10:11,514 --> 00:10:13,548
Hi, are you Courtney, from Tinder?

257
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:15,450
You must be Glenn. I got you these.

258
00:10:15,451 --> 00:10:17,352
A lovely bouquet for a lovely...

259
00:10:17,353 --> 00:10:19,588
Yeah, take off your pants and
sit on the coffee table.

260
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:20,495
Okay.

261
00:10:21,713 --> 00:10:23,425
That was great.

262
00:10:23,426 --> 00:10:25,160
And we can still make our reservation.

263
00:10:25,161 --> 00:10:26,307
What? Why?

264
00:10:26,308 --> 00:10:27,996
- We already had sex.
- Wait.

265
00:10:27,997 --> 00:10:30,565
So I don't have to make
small-talk with you

266
00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:32,801
- or spend any money?
- Of course not.

267
00:10:32,802 --> 00:10:36,071
Here, wipe yourself off
with this West Elm catalog.

268
00:10:36,072 --> 00:10:38,183
My God, this app is amazing!

269
00:10:38,184 --> 00:10:40,265
Thank you, cell-phone Jesus.

270
00:10:41,428 --> 00:10:42,944
Huh?

271
00:10:42,945 --> 00:10:44,499
Oh, yeah, fine.

272
00:11:34,414 --> 00:11:36,264
So, how's it going with the back brace?

273
00:11:36,265 --> 00:11:38,934
- Are people giving you a hard time?
- Quite the contrary, Brian.

274
00:11:38,935 --> 00:11:41,203
Apparently, people love the wretched.

275
00:11:41,204 --> 00:11:42,971
Thanks to this thing,
I was offered seats

276
00:11:42,972 --> 00:11:45,724
directly behind home plate at Fenway.

277
00:11:46,284 --> 00:11:47,594
I passed.

278
00:11:48,261 --> 00:11:51,780
Wow, that patient next
door is fat.

279
00:11:51,781 --> 00:11:53,048
I can hear you.

280
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:55,117
Uh, that wasn't me,
that was Mrs. Griffin.

281
00:11:55,118 --> 00:11:57,152
So, I've got Stewie's results here.

282
00:11:57,153 --> 00:11:58,653
Um, it appears the back brace

283
00:11:58,654 --> 00:12:00,522
has corrected the spine very nicely.

284
00:12:00,523 --> 00:12:01,757
That's wonderful.

285
00:12:01,758 --> 00:12:03,759
Stewie doesn't have to
wear the brace anymore.

286
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,994
What? No! I can't give this thing up.

287
00:12:05,995 --> 00:12:07,095
Wait, what do you mean?

288
00:12:07,096 --> 00:12:09,598
- You want to keep wearing the brace?
- Of course I do.

289
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,333
It's the best thing that's
ever happened to me.

290
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:12,601
When I wear this brace,

291
00:12:12,602 --> 00:12:14,803
I get pampered like
the Queen of England.

292
00:12:14,804 --> 00:12:18,640
So, I have the most money
in the world, right?

293
00:12:18,641 --> 00:12:19,975
Yes, Your Majesty.

294
00:12:19,976 --> 00:12:22,744
Great. Can you make sure my hair

295
00:12:22,745 --> 00:12:25,871
looks like anyone in a nursing home?

296
00:12:34,374 --> 00:12:36,158
All right, hitting the links.

297
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:38,994
Joe, golf shorts may not
be the right look for you.

298
00:12:38,995 --> 00:12:40,195
It's gonna be a nice day.

299
00:12:40,196 --> 00:12:41,763
Not for us, if you wear those.

300
00:12:41,764 --> 00:12:43,465
Well, that seems a little hurtful.

301
00:12:43,466 --> 00:12:46,134
Hey, where's Quagmire? Our
tee time's in 20 minutes.

302
00:12:46,135 --> 00:12:47,055
I don't know.

303
00:12:47,056 --> 00:12:50,121
I haven't seen much of him
since he discovered Tinder.

304
00:12:54,444 --> 00:12:55,660
Tinder?

305
00:13:03,036 --> 00:13:05,020
Quagmire, come on. It's time for golf.

306
00:13:05,021 --> 00:13:07,022
I swipe "no" on golf.

307
00:13:07,023 --> 00:13:09,858
Smells kind of gamey in here.

308
00:13:09,859 --> 00:13:12,561
Swipe "yes" on Betsy.
Swipe "yes" on Jennifer.

309
00:13:12,562 --> 00:13:16,031
Swipe "yes" on Andrea. Swipe
"yes" on all the lady faces.

310
00:13:16,032 --> 00:13:18,533
Swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe,
swipe, swipe, swipe.

311
00:13:18,534 --> 00:13:21,570
Let's, uh, let's get a little
light in here, huh, buddy?

312
00:13:21,571 --> 00:13:23,171
The yellow face!

313
00:13:23,172 --> 00:13:25,173
It burns my Tinder!

314
00:13:25,174 --> 00:13:27,275
Oh, my God, he's lost it.

315
00:13:27,276 --> 00:13:30,325
That app's turned Quagmire
into some kind of sex ghoul.

316
00:13:31,097 --> 00:13:33,992
The way he's crouching,
there's a teste peeking out.

317
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:40,243
Hey, listen, Quagmire,

318
00:13:40,244 --> 00:13:42,052
you're our friend, all right?

319
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:43,384
We hate to see you like this.

320
00:13:43,385 --> 00:13:44,937
I don't have any friends,

321
00:13:44,938 --> 00:13:47,177
only sex people from the phone.

322
00:13:47,178 --> 00:13:48,489
You got to stop this.

323
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,991
It looks like you haven't
left this room in weeks.

324
00:13:50,992 --> 00:13:53,694
No need to leave. They all come here.

325
00:13:53,695 --> 00:13:56,297
Sometimes they bring burgers and cheese.

326
00:13:56,298 --> 00:13:58,499
Hey, come on, Quagmire,
let's go for a walk, huh?

327
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,568
Get some fresh air...
oh, for God's sake.

328
00:14:00,569 --> 00:14:02,703
You're gonna have a
baby in your butt, man.

329
00:14:02,704 --> 00:14:03,771
Can't leave.

330
00:14:03,772 --> 00:14:06,374
"Heather within five miles" is coming.

331
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:10,778
Are you "Glenn within five miles"?

332
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:12,813
I can take my glass eye out

333
00:14:12,814 --> 00:14:14,849
if you want to try something different.

334
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:18,252
I got a good feeling about
her. Maybe she's the one.

335
00:14:18,253 --> 00:14:19,954
Let's do it in the garage.

336
00:14:19,955 --> 00:14:23,174
It's kind of cold, but we can
do sweaters on, pants off.

337
00:14:24,177 --> 00:14:26,026
Look, he left his phone.

338
00:14:26,027 --> 00:14:27,828
I'm just gonna nudge it with my knee

339
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:31,065
into this empty pizza box...
and it's stuck to my knee.

340
00:14:31,066 --> 00:14:32,812
Let's, uh, let's just go.

341
00:14:34,854 --> 00:14:37,004
All right, we got to just
throw that phone away

342
00:14:37,005 --> 00:14:38,639
and end this once and for all.

343
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,375
Yeah, no kidding.
Quagmire's in bad shape.

344
00:14:41,376 --> 00:14:44,429
He looks worse than I did
after that day at the beach.

345
00:14:46,498 --> 00:14:48,831
I spanked somebody else's kid.

346
00:14:56,976 --> 00:14:58,492
Sorry I was late.

347
00:14:58,493 --> 00:15:00,194
You're still wearing that back brace?

348
00:15:00,195 --> 00:15:01,462
That can't be good for you.

349
00:15:01,463 --> 00:15:03,230
Dr. Hartman said you were
done with that thing.

350
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:04,932
I'm not gonna listen to that bozo.

351
00:15:04,933 --> 00:15:06,100
Of course I'm still wearing it.

352
00:15:06,101 --> 00:15:07,902
Watch me jump this line.

353
00:15:07,903 --> 00:15:09,537
Excuse me, I have scoliosis.

354
00:15:09,538 --> 00:15:11,906
Excuse me. Scoliosis, coming through.

355
00:15:11,907 --> 00:15:13,808
Hey, pal. Polio.

356
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:16,291
A thousand apologies.

357
00:15:22,068 --> 00:15:24,151
Swipe. Swipe. Swipe.

358
00:15:24,152 --> 00:15:25,753
Come on, I'm not getting any matches!

359
00:15:25,754 --> 00:15:27,621
All right, Quagmire, we got to talk.

360
00:15:27,622 --> 00:15:29,824
This whole thing's out
of control, Quagmire.

361
00:15:29,825 --> 00:15:31,158
You got to get off Tinder.

362
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:34,094
Yeah, there's plenty of nice
women out in the real world

363
00:15:34,095 --> 00:15:35,930
to meet the old-fashioned way.

364
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:38,408

I'm not quitting Tinder.

396
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:21,869
Guys, I've been to the doctor's.

397
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,835
I do have a baby in my butt.

398
00:17:32,632 --> 00:17:35,516
Mm, you're still here.

399
00:17:35,517 --> 00:17:37,985
Did we...?

400
00:17:39,187 --> 00:17:40,454
What the deuce?

401
00:17:42,534 --> 00:17:44,835
Brian! Brian!

402
00:17:44,836 --> 00:17:47,070
Yes, is it possible to
get Showtime for free

403
00:17:47,071 --> 00:17:50,107
for the next, like, two
hours to see if I like it?

404
00:17:50,108 --> 00:17:51,308
Brian!

405
00:17:54,763 --> 00:17:57,014
What is this? What's happening to me?

406
00:17:57,015 --> 00:17:58,448
Oh, my God, Stewie.

407
00:17:58,449 --> 00:18:01,051
It's got to be from wearing
that damn brace all the time.

408
00:18:01,052 --> 00:18:02,920
Your neck must have atrophied so much

409
00:18:02,921 --> 00:18:04,421
it can no longer support your head.

410
00:18:04,422 --> 00:18:06,047
You've got to take me to the hospital.

411
00:18:06,048 --> 00:18:07,024
Absolutely.

412
00:18:07,025 --> 00:18:08,458
Let me just watch <i>Jennifer's Body</i>

413
00:18:08,459 --> 00:18:09,493
and we'll go right there.

414
00:18:09,494 --> 00:18:11,128
Brian, there's no nudity in that movie.

415
00:18:11,129 --> 00:18:12,129
Take me to the hospital!

416
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,285
What, so it's rated "R" for curses?

417
00:18:14,286 --> 00:18:16,316
God, this country.

418
00:18:20,589 --> 00:18:22,539
Is it, is it noticeable?

419
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,874
Oh, nothing that can't be fixed

420
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,510
with a string of chili
pepper Christmas lights.

421
00:18:26,511 --> 00:18:30,013
<i>I wore that brace for
the next five years of my life.</i>

422
00:18:30,014 --> 00:18:32,249
<i>The kids stopped
cheering the second day.</i>

423
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:36,536
<i>Then it was just, "Get off the
swing, you Christmas turd."</i>

424
00:18:40,576 --> 00:18:43,060
I'll have another one, Jerome.

425
00:18:43,061 --> 00:18:44,928
You sure you haven't had too many?

426
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:46,279
Just give me a drink.

427
00:18:48,517 --> 00:18:50,667
Sir, is everything all right?

428
00:18:50,668 --> 00:18:52,002
I'm fine. I'm fine, it...

429
00:18:52,003 --> 00:18:53,904
oh, h... oh, hey, uh, you on Tinder?

430
00:18:53,905 --> 00:18:56,139
What? That gross dating thing?

431
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,709
No. Look, I'm not trying to pick you up,

432
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,078
it just seemed like you
were upset about something,

433
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:04,381
and I know when I'm upset, it's
nice to let someone else in.

434
00:19:04,382 --> 00:19:05,449
Giggity.

435
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,850
What did you just say?

436
00:19:06,851 --> 00:19:07,918
I-I-I don't know.

437
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,419
I think I said, I said, "Giggity."

438
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,521
Okay.

439
00:19:11,522 --> 00:19:14,191
Come on, Quagmire, this is a real girl

440
00:19:14,192 --> 00:19:15,192
right in front of you.

441
00:19:15,193 --> 00:19:16,693
Just pick her up and take her home.

442
00:19:16,694 --> 00:19:17,761
You don't need your phone.

443
00:19:17,762 --> 00:19:20,797
Don't listen to him. I'm all you need.

444
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:22,933
Are you really gonna
listen to a phone over me?

445
00:19:22,934 --> 00:19:24,868
God, I don't know why I do this anymore.

446
00:19:24,869 --> 00:19:27,037
Don't give up, Miniature Quagmire.

447
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:28,538
This is exactly why you got

448
00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:30,474
into the over-the-shoulder
advice business.

449
00:19:30,475 --> 00:19:32,242
Ignore him, Miniature Quagmire.

450
00:19:32,243 --> 00:19:34,711
Give up on your attempt
to convince real Quagmire

451
00:19:34,712 --> 00:19:36,680
to not use Tinder, and
to instead have sex

452
00:19:36,681 --> 00:19:38,348
with this woman who's
right in front of him.

453
00:19:38,349 --> 00:19:39,416
Wait, what's going on?

454
00:19:39,417 --> 00:19:40,884
I'm just saying, you used to have skills

455
00:19:40,885 --> 00:19:43,820
that no one else had, that
took you years to hone.

456
00:19:43,821 --> 00:19:44,921
You were an artist.

457
00:19:44,922 --> 00:19:46,940
Ah, damn. I think I was too wordy.

458
00:19:47,943 --> 00:19:50,260
I'm still an artist.

459
00:19:50,261 --> 00:19:51,287
What was that?

460
00:19:51,896 --> 00:19:55,499
I was just saying, I am
upset about something.

461
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,833
I thought you were.

462
00:19:56,834 --> 00:19:58,235
Do you want to talk about it?

463
00:19:58,236 --> 00:19:59,269
I do.

464
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,838
I buried my twin brother today.

465
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:03,473
We were very close.

466
00:20:03,474 --> 00:20:06,462
We used to finish each other's, um...

467
00:20:07,602 --> 00:20:09,212
Sentences?

468
00:20:09,213 --> 00:20:11,181
Oh, oh, I just got chills.

469
00:20:11,182 --> 00:20:12,449
I'm Sandra.

470
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,488
I'm Glenn.

471
00:20:14,118 --> 00:20:15,485
You know, I just,

472
00:20:15,486 --> 00:20:17,971
I just feel like my penis
shouldn't be alone tonight.

473
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:21,660
All right.

474
00:20:22,093 --> 00:20:24,661
Well, looks like Quagmire's back.

475
00:20:24,662 --> 00:20:27,464
Yep, he's scumming it up
in the real world again.

476
00:20:27,465 --> 00:20:29,299
And all it took was for us to hire

477
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,635
that $200 dirty prostitute

478
00:20:31,636 --> 00:20:33,870

00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:42,612
Hi, I'm that prostitute you guys
hired to seduce your friend.

482
00:20:42,613 --> 00:20:45,215
