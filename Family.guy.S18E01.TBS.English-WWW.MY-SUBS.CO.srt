<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

2
00:00:04,817 --> 00:00:08,174
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

3
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:11,744
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>good old-fashioned values</i>

4
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:14,747
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

5
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:18,250
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

6
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:21,420
<i>Lucky there's a man</i>
<i>who positively can do</i>

7
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,191
<i>All the things that make us</i>

8
00:00:23,192 --> 00:00:24,423
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:30,151

11
00:00:37,573 --> 00:00:39,229
So what's the big emergency?

12
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,255
Why did everyone
have to come in on a Monday?

13
00:00:41,256 --> 00:00:43,745
I'm afraid we have troubling news.

14
00:00:43,746 --> 00:00:46,814
Due to budget cuts, we'll
be laying off one employee.

15
00:00:49,151 --> 00:00:51,519
The Internet pretty much
only lets us fire white males,

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,989
so if you're not
a white male, you're safe.

17
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,858
- So, is Derek Jeter safe?
- Safe!

18
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:58,526
- What?
- He's half black.

19
00:00:58,527 --> 00:00:59,927
- What? What do you need, glasses?
- No, I don't need glasses.

20
00:00:59,928 --> 00:01:01,341
He's white by a mile. He tucks...

21
00:01:01,343 --> 00:01:03,031
You're the one who needs glasses.

22
00:01:03,032 --> 00:01:04,832
And what happened to this kind
of coach-umpire confrontation?

23
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:06,701
- I know, I miss it, too.
- It used to happen a lot in the '70s

24
00:01:06,702 --> 00:01:08,770
but doesn't seem to happen
that much anymore.

25
00:01:08,771 --> 00:01:11,368
to a bygone era when
men settled their differences

26
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:12,940
I agree. That's what we're doing now.

27
00:01:12,941 --> 00:01:14,477
Thrusting their chests into one another.

28
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:16,433
I miss having a guy yell in my mouth.

29
00:01:16,434 --> 00:01:18,489
And while we're talking about stuff,
I've never cleaned my ice trays.

30
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,228
- Oh, you have to do that.
- Why do I have to?

31
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:22,129
- You're poisoning your family.
- It's just water and water.

32
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,153
Carrying an ice tray from
the freezer to the sink is like ringing

33
00:01:25,154 --> 00:01:27,214
- the damn dinner bell for arm hairs.
- Come to think of it,

34
00:01:27,215 --> 00:01:29,149
but I don't remember seeing a few
short hairs in my ice cubes

35
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,754
Of course they're getting in there.

36
00:01:30,755 --> 00:01:33,227
- That I'm hoping were from my arm.
- Clean your trays.

37
00:01:33,228 --> 00:01:35,963
Oh, cool off, Griffin.
It is no big deal.

38
00:01:35,964 --> 00:01:37,532
It's just that someone's getting fired

39
00:01:37,533 --> 00:01:40,234
- in front of everybody tomorrow.
- Well, that sounds fine.

40
00:01:40,235 --> 00:01:42,537
I guess I'll just see you... What?!

41
00:01:42,538 --> 00:01:44,072
Old joke. You're out.

42
00:01:44,073 --> 00:01:46,741
- Old joke? I put my own twist on it.
- There was no twist.

43
00:01:46,742 --> 00:01:49,377
Oh, you're crazy.
It was a tip of the hat to my son.

44
00:01:49,378 --> 00:01:51,779
If anything,
it's a gift to our long-time viewers.

45
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,748
Merry Christmas.
Here's a warmed-over turd

46
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:55,822
from ten years ago.

47
00:01:58,821 --> 00:02:00,885
Okay, I can do this.

48
00:02:00,886 --> 00:02:03,691
No need to be nervous.
Just show 'em that I'm good at my job.

49
00:02:03,692 --> 00:02:05,359
That's it. Easy peasy.

50
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,361
Hey there, PG.

51
00:02:07,362 --> 00:02:08,730
Been a minute.

52
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:11,199
Hey, Ernie. I mean, I mean
Cookie Monst... I mean Bert.

53
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,233
Bert. Sorry.

54
00:02:12,234 --> 00:02:13,735
Oh, it's okay, Peter.

55
00:02:13,736 --> 00:02:15,236
Just do what you would normally do.

56
00:02:15,237 --> 00:02:16,871
Pretend I'm not here.

57
00:02:16,872 --> 00:02:18,573
Oh, pretend you're not here? All right.

58
00:02:18,574 --> 00:02:21,041
God, that Bert is an idiot.

59
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:22,522
What a pud.

60
00:02:22,523 --> 00:02:23,711
But I wouldn't mind
getting to know that Sheila

61
00:02:23,712 --> 00:02:24,879
a little better.

62
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,447
She's got a great dumper.

63
00:02:26,448 --> 00:02:28,950
And by dumper,
I mean fecal thoroughfare.

64
00:02:28,951 --> 00:02:30,785
Should I...?

65
00:02:30,786 --> 00:02:32,120
Yeah, answer it.

66
00:02:32,121 --> 00:02:35,156
Could be important for the company.

67
00:02:37,493 --> 00:02:38,960
Goodbye?

68
00:02:38,961 --> 00:02:40,962
Ah, shoot. Opposite of that, yeah?

69
00:02:40,963 --> 00:02:42,663
Let's roll to the break room, Peter.

70
00:02:42,664 --> 00:02:44,665
We're ready to announce
who's getting fired.

71
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,968
Oh, sure, if Sheila and her
wastemaker are gonna be there.

72
00:02:46,969 --> 00:02:50,122
Please stop talking about
my wife's anal processes.

73
00:02:57,646 --> 00:03:01,415
Opie, will you accept this stein?

74
00:03:07,923 --> 00:03:10,258
Bachelor Nick? Why are you here?

75
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:12,426
They make me come to all these things.

76
00:03:12,427 --> 00:03:14,170
Cool. How's Vanessa?

77
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:15,963
- We broke up.
- Aw.

78
00:03:15,964 --> 00:03:18,800
I would murder my family
for one hour with Corinne.

79
00:03:18,801 --> 00:03:21,075
Eh, she was a little young.

80
00:03:22,171 --> 00:03:24,105
You know how stupid you sound?

81
00:03:24,106 --> 00:03:26,816
Peter, take a step forward.

82
00:03:27,943 --> 00:03:30,378
I-I'm sorry. I-I keep messing up.

83
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:33,792
You're seeing me at my worst.
I'm very nervous.

84
00:03:40,422 --> 00:03:42,423
My life is flashing before my eyes.

85
00:03:42,424 --> 00:03:46,160
And for some reason, it's all
just the sort of gay moments.

86
00:04:01,042 --> 00:04:02,958
Excuse me, is someone sitting here?

87
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,879
Yes. My lover, Tom.

88
00:04:06,315 --> 00:04:09,550
Oh, Peter! I'm so happy you're okay.

89
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:11,839
Whoa, you're alive?

90
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,021
What happened?
Did I have a heart attack?

91
00:04:14,022 --> 00:04:15,656
No, you had a panic attack.

92
00:04:15,657 --> 00:04:18,426
Or, in medical terms,
"a heart attack for wussies."

93
00:04:18,427 --> 00:04:19,727
Hey, we have a bet going.

94
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:21,729
Do you remember if you put
your wrist to your forehead

95
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,564
like a nancy-boy when you fainted?

96
00:04:23,565 --> 00:04:25,466
I choose not to answer.

97
00:04:25,467 --> 00:04:28,002
Peter, you need to get
your stress under control.

98
00:04:28,003 --> 00:04:30,071
I'm texting you a link
to a collection of songs

99
00:04:30,072 --> 00:04:31,505
called yacht rock.

100
00:04:31,506 --> 00:04:32,740
Any time I'm feeling stressed,

101
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:35,109
I play this music,
and it really mellows me out.

102
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,612
- I think it'll work for you.
- Well, what is that? Is that like...

103
00:04:37,613 --> 00:04:40,047
<i>Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.</i>

104
00:04:40,048 --> 00:04:41,315
No, no, it's more like...

105
00:04:41,316 --> 00:04:42,650
<i>Ia, da, da, da, da</i>

106
00:04:42,651 --> 00:04:43,951
<i>Da, da, da, da, da.</i>

107
00:04:43,952 --> 00:04:46,687
Oh, good. It's... <i>Ia, da, da, da, da</i>

108
00:04:46,688 --> 00:04:48,522
<i>Da, da, da, da.</i>
'Cause I don't like that.

109
00:04:48,523 --> 00:04:50,458
<i>Da, da, da, ba, ba, ba.</i>

110
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:52,793
No, I assure you, it's... <i>Ia, da, da, da</i>

111
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:54,395
<i>Da, da, da, da, da, da, da.</i>

112
00:04:54,396 --> 00:04:55,830
Now, if you'll excuse me,

113
00:04:55,831 --> 00:04:58,966
I have more music
to prescribe to sick patients.

114
00:05:02,504 --> 00:05:04,939
- So, Peter, you feeling better?
- Yeah, I guess.

115
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,408
The doctor just said
I'm too stressed out.

116
00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:09,777
Did the doctor give you anything
to help, you know,

117
00:05:09,778 --> 00:05:11,379
mellow you out?

118
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,648
<i>¿Los drogas?</i>

119
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:16,884
No, he just gave me this link
for something called yacht rock.

120
00:05:18,854 --> 00:05:20,788
This one's called "Summer Breeze,"

121
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:23,958
and it makes me feel fine.

122
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:26,093
This music... I...

123
00:05:26,094 --> 00:05:28,829
I feel like I'm dirty dancing
with a sunset.

124
00:05:32,134 --> 00:05:34,302
Uh, guys, there's a yacht rock cruise

125
00:05:34,303 --> 00:05:37,171
that leaves
from the Quahog Marina tomorrow.

126
00:05:37,172 --> 00:05:39,707
And I'm not even kidding.

127
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:42,343
You know what, guys? We haven't
gone anywhere in a long time.

128
00:05:42,344 --> 00:05:43,811
So, let's do it.

129
00:05:43,812 --> 00:05:45,413
Cleveland, buy those tickets,

130
00:05:45,414 --> 00:05:47,648
'cause the guys are going
on a yacht rock cruise.

131
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:49,150
- Yeah!
- Awesome!

132
00:05:49,151 --> 00:05:51,406
Peter? Is that you?

133
00:05:51,407 --> 00:05:53,487
- Do I know you?
- I-It's me. Lyle?

134
00:05:53,488 --> 00:05:55,189
From the other side of the aquarium?

135
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,024
I-I... I don't... I don't know you.

136
00:05:57,025 --> 00:05:59,360
I-I don't... I don't know
what you're talking about.

137
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:01,662
<i>But I did know
what he was talking about.</i>

138
00:06:01,663 --> 00:06:03,831
<i>I spent the next two and a half years</i>

139
00:06:03,832 --> 00:06:06,154
<i>cruising various aquariums.</i>

140
00:06:06,155 --> 00:06:07,969
<i>I never did find Lyle.</i>

141
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,172
<i>Also, I didn't quite clear the table.</i>

142
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,833
I got to say, Peter, I had
reservations about this cruise,

143
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:27,668
but you do seem more relaxed.

144
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:29,236
Hey, good thing I had reservations

145
00:06:29,237 --> 00:06:30,938
<i>on</i> this cruise, huh?

146
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:33,190
I don't mind dad jokes.

147
00:06:33,191 --> 00:06:34,731
Everyone's included.

148
00:06:37,112 --> 00:06:38,646
Looks like mine won't be the only tail

149
00:06:38,647 --> 00:06:40,381
I'll be chasing this week.

150
00:06:40,382 --> 00:06:43,751
- Hey. What the...
- All dogs have to be crated below deck.

151
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:47,488
Stewie, help!

152
00:06:47,489 --> 00:06:49,190
I knew this was a possibility, so I put

153
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:53,027
a 1982 Mattel Electronic
Baseball game in your bag.

154
00:06:54,596 --> 00:06:56,097
Okay, that's something.

155
00:06:56,098 --> 00:06:58,099
The battery might be
a little old, though.

156
00:07:07,342 --> 00:07:08,843
Peter, you brought your family?

157
00:07:08,844 --> 00:07:11,145
This was supposed to be a guys' trip.

158
00:07:11,146 --> 00:07:12,672
Please don't tell Donna.
- Please don't tell Bonnie.

159
00:07:12,673 --> 00:07:14,682
- She hasn't been on a vacation...
- She'll kill me if...

160
00:07:14,683 --> 00:07:16,050
- Please, Lois, please.
- Please, Lois.

161
00:07:16,051 --> 00:07:17,485
- Promise me. Here, look,
- Promise me first.

162
00:07:17,486 --> 00:07:19,020
- I'm putting money
- Here's my gun. Do you want it?

163
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,921
- In your purse.
- I-I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.

164
00:07:20,922 --> 00:07:23,057
I'm sending a selfie
to Bonnie and Donna.

165
00:07:23,058 --> 00:07:24,892
Cruise, bitches.

166
00:07:24,893 --> 00:07:27,228
- Don't hit send, please don't hit send.
- Please don't hit send.

167
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:29,296
And... send.

168
00:07:30,766 --> 00:07:33,901
You son of a bitch.

169
00:07:33,902 --> 00:07:35,903
- I told you.
- What did he do now?

170
00:07:35,904 --> 00:07:37,571
He don't listen to you.

171
00:07:37,572 --> 00:07:40,541
He don't listen to you.

172
00:07:42,277 --> 00:07:43,611
What is it, Bonnie?

173
00:07:43,612 --> 00:07:46,280
Nothing, Father Monaghan.

174
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:48,582
- Well, this sucks now.
- Our whole trip's ruined,

175
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,084
thanks to you, Peter.

176
00:07:50,085 --> 00:07:52,219
Thank God Bonnie's got Father Monaghan

177
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,255
for spiritual counsel.

178
00:07:54,256 --> 00:07:55,690
Well, it's not my fault
you guys are too stupid

179
00:07:55,691 --> 00:07:57,124
to understand what the plan was.

180
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,671
The plan was clear.
You're the stupid one.

181
00:07:59,672 --> 00:08:03,197
What?

182
00:08:03,198 --> 00:08:06,667
<i>Sailing takes me away...</i>

183
00:08:06,668 --> 00:08:09,303
- What were we fighting about?
- I don't know.

184
00:08:09,304 --> 00:08:12,273
My cares have all suddenly melted away.

185
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:15,376
Are my toes tapping?
I feel like my toes are tapping.

186
00:08:15,377 --> 00:08:17,645
Nah, there's a seagull
pecking at your foot.

187
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,514
Whenever I wear my Tevas,

188
00:08:20,515 --> 00:08:23,295
my toes are up for grabs.

189
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,054
Hey, Cleveland, this is us.

190
00:08:27,055 --> 00:08:28,656
You guys got to stop by later.

191
00:08:28,657 --> 00:08:31,392
Snuck on a little of this action.

192
00:08:31,393 --> 00:08:33,609
What? You guys are sharing a room?

193
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,430
- You're adults.
- I'm not paying full price for a room.

194
00:08:36,431 --> 00:08:38,566
Have some self-respect. You're 40.

195
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:40,568
It's not like
we're gonna be in there much.

196
00:08:40,569 --> 00:08:42,744
Too busy scoping trim.

197
00:08:42,745 --> 00:08:45,703
I may bail to the room to catch a nap.

198
00:08:45,704 --> 00:08:47,771
Right behind you, roomie.

199
00:08:47,772 --> 00:08:50,845
After we wake,
we gonna fire up that Keurig.

200
00:08:50,846 --> 00:08:54,482
Oh, yeah, that's why I brought
along a couple of these babies.

201
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,252
Wait, there's only one bed.

202
00:08:58,253 --> 00:09:00,354
I know. We're going head to toe.

203
00:09:00,355 --> 00:09:02,757
Say hello to your pillow.

204
00:09:02,758 --> 00:09:05,426
Hi there, do you know if singer
and songwriter Bob Welch

205
00:09:05,427 --> 00:09:06,761
is on board yet?

206
00:09:06,762 --> 00:09:09,930
He's not, because he died in 2012.

207
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,781
Can you give me a moment?

208
00:09:14,336 --> 00:09:17,171
<i>Sentimental gentle wind</i>

209
00:09:17,172 --> 00:09:20,341
<i>Blowing through my life again...</i>

210
00:09:20,342 --> 00:09:23,844
I can't believe Bob Welch
is really gone.

211
00:09:23,845 --> 00:09:25,813
<i>Gentle one...</i>

212
00:09:25,814 --> 00:09:29,850
Hey... we just heard about Bob Welch.

213
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:31,852
<i>Blowing through my life again...</i>

214
00:09:31,853 --> 00:09:33,521
Yeah.

215
00:09:33,522 --> 00:09:35,756
Who the (BLEEP) is Bob Welch?

216
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:47,268
Okay, for the first game,
I choose Alan Parsons

217
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:49,603
as my teammate, but not The Project.

218
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:51,272
I want nothing to do with them.

219
00:09:51,273 --> 00:09:53,007
We'll play Joe and Loggins.

220
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:55,276
- Thanks for picking me, Peter.
- No problem.

221
00:09:55,277 --> 00:09:57,611
"Crosby, Stills, Nash"
to see who goes first?

222
00:09:57,612 --> 00:09:59,814
Crosby, Stills, Nash, shoot.

223
00:09:59,815 --> 00:10:02,883
- Nash. I win.
- No, Crosby eats Nash.

224
00:10:02,884 --> 00:10:05,853
- Stills snorts Crosby.
- What does Nash do?

225
00:10:05,854 --> 00:10:07,855
Nash smokes Stills.

226
00:10:07,856 --> 00:10:10,706
So, Kenny, "Footloose."

227
00:10:10,707 --> 00:10:12,893
Not really a song for everyone.

228
00:10:12,894 --> 00:10:16,599
Well, maybe you'd prefer my song
in <i>Caddyshack,</i> "I'm Alright."

229
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,127
Wh-What, do you think I'm stupid
because I'm in a chair?

230
00:10:20,128 --> 00:10:21,762
I'll pull the tape, guy.

231
00:10:21,763 --> 00:10:24,238
The gopher sang that song.

232
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,378
This is so exciting.
What do you want to do tonight?

233
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:33,814
What if we just go see a movie?

234
00:10:33,815 --> 00:10:36,250
We can see a movie at home.
We need to go out.

235
00:10:36,251 --> 00:10:37,651
Shake things up.

236
00:10:37,652 --> 00:10:40,054
We're here to experience
new things, be other people.

237
00:10:40,055 --> 00:10:42,256
Mm-hmm.

238
00:10:42,257 --> 00:10:44,258
How much wine have you had tonight?

239
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,761
Maybe we could hang out
with that nice couple

240
00:10:47,762 --> 00:10:50,030
- we met the other day.
- The Federmans?

241
00:10:50,031 --> 00:10:52,266
Why do you always want
to hang out with other people

242
00:10:52,267 --> 00:10:53,934
when we're on vacation?

243
00:10:53,935 --> 00:10:55,669
It's just nice to meet new people.

244
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:59,406
Right, because I'm so interested
in the medical supply business.

245
00:10:59,407 --> 00:11:01,442
- Why do you always do that?
- Do what?

246
00:11:01,443 --> 00:11:03,444
Diminish people.

247
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:04,879
Oh, that's why.

248
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,982
Well, I feel like this has
become a referendum on me,

249
00:11:07,983 --> 00:11:11,002
and I don't appreciate it.

250
00:11:12,087 --> 00:11:14,221
Did you pack my dandruff shampoo?

251
00:11:14,222 --> 00:11:15,689
No.

252
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:18,425
Then I guess this black shirt is out.

253
00:11:18,426 --> 00:11:20,794
You just want to hang out
with Doug Federman.

254
00:11:20,795 --> 00:11:23,397
What? That's... that's the wine talking.

255
00:11:23,398 --> 00:11:25,599
What does Doug Federman have
that I don't?

256
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,268
A job.

257
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:30,437
I'm going to watch the magic
show in the Cognac Club.

258
00:11:30,438 --> 00:11:32,172
Why, because there's
a two-drink minimum?

259
00:11:32,173 --> 00:11:34,975
Oh, you shut up!

260
00:11:34,976 --> 00:11:36,310
Thank you.

261
00:11:36,311 --> 00:11:38,779
For my next trick,
I'll need a volunteer.

262
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,148
- How about you, sir?
- No, I don't want to!

263
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:43,659
I don't want to do it.

264
00:11:46,521 --> 00:11:49,356
Bell, Biv, DeVoe, shoot.

265
00:11:49,357 --> 00:11:51,392
- Gotcha.
- What do you mean?

266
00:11:51,393 --> 00:11:53,627
I win. Bell bivs DeVoe.

267
00:11:53,628 --> 00:11:56,230
Dude, you can't "biv" someone.
Biv's a guy.

268
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:59,600
Everybody on this cruise is boring.

269
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:05,639
I can show you where there's
a whole pile of those.

270
00:12:06,853 --> 00:12:08,025
Cigarette butts?

271
00:12:08,026 --> 00:12:10,477
Yeah. The wind blows them all
to this one spot.

272
00:12:10,478 --> 00:12:12,346
It's right by where the seagulls crap.

273
00:12:12,347 --> 00:12:15,516
It's my job to clean it up.
That's how I know about it.

274
00:12:15,517 --> 00:12:18,018
You must know a lot about crap.

275
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:19,687
You're not from here, are you?

276
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:22,089
From the cruise? No. I'm from a town.

277
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,024
You want to mess around
on some damp towels

278
00:12:24,025 --> 00:12:25,426
next to where the seagulls crap?

279
00:12:25,427 --> 00:12:26,860
It wasn't seagulls.

280
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:28,696
I got locked out of my room earlier.

281
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:30,030
Oh.

282
00:12:30,031 --> 00:12:32,433
- Why is your poop white?
- I don't know.

283
00:12:32,434 --> 00:12:35,936
I've been dealing with
fecal albinism my whole life.

284
00:12:35,937 --> 00:12:38,973
<i>All I want to do</i>

Hey, what are you guys up to?

290
00:12:50,652 --> 00:12:53,554
We're making a food spread in room 103.

291
00:12:53,555 --> 00:12:54,655
Come on by.

292
00:12:54,656 --> 00:12:57,124
Grab some cocktail sauce on your way.

00:12:57,125 --> 00:13:00,294
Oh, wait. Never mind.

294
00:13:00,295 --> 00:13:01,962
Aah! Damn it.

295
00:13:01,963 --> 00:13:05,632
We're watching <i>Michael Clayton</i>
<i>on DVD later. Be there.</i>

296
00:13:08,937 --> 00:13:12,473
By the way, I, uh,
heard about Bob Welch.

297
00:13:12,474 --> 00:13:14,208
I'm sorry.

298
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:16,610
Don't know what else to say.

299
00:13:16,611 --> 00:13:19,513
- Sending good vibes.
- Yeah...

300
00:13:19,514 --> 00:13:21,115
Can you give me a moment?

301

- Bob Welch.

305
00:13:31,893 --> 00:13:34,128
- Hey, aren't you the captain?
- Yes.

306
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:37,106
Well, if you're here,
who's driving the boat?

307
00:13:38,033 --> 00:13:40,167
Oh, my God!

308
00:13:44,418 --> 00:13:47,274
Wow, I've never seen someone
eat so many powdered Donettes

309
00:13:47,275 --> 00:13:48,609
in half an hour before.

310
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,843
Yeah, I was really hungry,

311
00:13:49,844 --> 00:13:51,712
and I didn't like
what they had at dinner.

312
00:13:51,713 --> 00:13:55,064
I think we may have solved
your fecal albinism.

313
00:13:55,065 --> 00:13:56,817
I love you, Meg.

314
00:13:56,818 --> 00:13:58,819
Oh, my God,

315
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,021
no one's ever told me that before.

316
00:14:01,022 --> 00:14:03,190
This is the best night of my li...

317
00:14:28,683 --> 00:14:31,185
Listen to all those idiots fall.

318
00:14:31,186 --> 00:14:33,821
- Honey, don't revel in it.
- Hey, I need this.

319
00:14:33,822 --> 00:14:35,989
I just found out Bob Welch died.

320
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,592
<i>Sentimental gentle wind</i>

321
00:14:38,593 --> 00:14:40,194
<i>Blowing...</i>

322
00:14:40,195 --> 00:14:42,763
- Aah! What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

323
00:14:42,764 --> 00:14:46,300
And, look, Oates is hanging on
to Hall for dear life.

324
00:14:47,902 --> 00:14:50,504
What else is new? He's been
doing that for 40 years.

325
00:14:50,505 --> 00:14:53,674
Ha, ha. Yeah, make fun of more people

326
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:55,776
more successful than you.

327
00:14:55,777 --> 00:14:57,344
He's a millionaire.

328
00:14:57,345 --> 00:14:59,379
You're nothing.

329
00:15:15,654 --> 00:15:17,889
Oh, thank God we're all okay.

330
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,991
Looks like Oates wasn't so lucky.

331
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,668
Guys, it's me, Kenny Loggins.

332
00:15:30,669 --> 00:15:32,169
First of all, I'm all right.

333
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,571
Don't nobody worry about me.

334
00:15:33,572 --> 00:15:35,006
Gopher!

335
00:15:35,007 --> 00:15:37,775
This boat has flipped over.
We need to get up to the hull.

336
00:15:37,776 --> 00:15:39,243
There's a spot in the propeller room

337
00:15:39,244 --> 00:15:41,078
where the hull's only an inch thick.

338
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:43,047
Maybe we can try to cut our way out...

339
00:15:47,452 --> 00:15:50,454
Hey, you sons of bitches!

340
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,090
This is Chad!

341
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:55,426
He's my boyfriend. We love each other.

342
00:15:55,427 --> 00:15:58,162
We said it and everything.

343
00:16:02,334 --> 00:16:03,792
A little help?

344
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,707
Hi-yah!

345
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,824
Preesh.

346
00:17:14,673 --> 00:17:16,841
Guys, we got to get out of here.

347
00:17:33,658 --> 00:17:35,960
- You're alive.
- And well.

348
00:17:35,961 --> 00:17:38,629
We got to get out of here. The
water levels are rising fast.

349
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,431
I'll just grab an apple real quick.

350
00:17:40,432 --> 00:17:43,200
Granny Smith? What,
do you got a oven in your mouth?

351
00:17:43,201 --> 00:17:46,670
- Huh?
- Pie apple. It's a pie apple.

352
00:17:46,671 --> 00:17:48,539
I like a good Red Delicious.

353
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,408
Oh, does your mouth have a lid on it?

354
00:17:50,409 --> 00:17:51,776
What are you talking about?

355
00:17:51,777 --> 00:17:54,712
That's a garbage apple.
May as well eat a Honeycrisp.

356
00:17:54,713 --> 00:17:57,314
- What's wrong with that one?
- Science apple.

357
00:17:57,315 --> 00:18:00,117
Made in a lab
with test tubes and beakers.

358
00:18:00,118 --> 00:18:02,553
Well, what apples do <i>you</i> like?

359
00:18:02,554 --> 00:18:04,955
Fuji for eating, crab for huckin'.

360
00:18:04,956 --> 00:18:06,791
That's a prankster's apple.

361
00:18:06,792 --> 00:18:09,527
Gosh, Cleveland, I had no idea
you knew so much about apples.

362
00:18:09,528 --> 00:18:12,663
- Hmm. Did you ever ask?
- No, I guess I didn't.

363
00:18:12,664 --> 00:18:14,165
Hmm.

364
00:18:22,774 --> 00:18:26,077
I can't open it!

365
00:18:26,078 --> 00:18:28,546
There's too much water
pushing from the other side!

366
00:18:28,547 --> 00:18:30,014
So we're stuck?

367
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:32,583
Yeah, unless we can
somehow tip the boat.

368
00:18:32,584 --> 00:18:34,585
<i>Maybe we can.</i>

369
00:18:34,586 --> 00:18:36,487
What are you talking about,
Michael McDonald?

370
00:18:36,488 --> 00:18:38,222
<i>The timbre in my voice</i>

371
00:18:38,223 --> 00:18:40,491
<i>Allows me to communicate with whales.</i>

372
00:18:40,492 --> 00:18:42,460
<i>Maybe they can help.</i>

373
00:19:26,638 --> 00:19:28,472
Oh, we... oh, we found him.

374
00:19:28,473 --> 00:19:31,075
(BLEEP)! You guys left me
down there to drown.

375
00:19:31,076 --> 00:19:33,511
Technically, we left you
up there to drown.

376
00:19:33,512 --> 00:19:36,180
- The boat flipped.
- You know what you did.

377
00:19:36,181 --> 00:19:38,249
I think the only way
to teach you a lesson

378
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,551
is to dog-shake and get you all wet.

379
00:19:40,552 --> 00:19:41,986
- No, Brian, don't!
- I'm doing it.

380
00:19:44,656 --> 00:19:45,923
All right, we're even.

381
00:19:48,944 --> 00:19:50,628
Well, we found the thinnest part
of the hull,

382
00:19:50,629 --> 00:19:52,363
but it's still an inch thick.

383
00:19:52,364 --> 00:19:56,000
Yeah, of steel. How are we
supposed to get through that?

384
00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:14,791
Man, that was crazy.

385
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:18,135
I'm Casey Kasem.

386
00:20:18,136 --> 00:20:20,050
Coming in at number seven
on the countdown,

387
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:22,720
that was Peter Griffin
with "Yacht Rocky,"

388
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,310
down three spots.

389
00:20:24,311 --> 00:20:25,823
Now for our number six.

390
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,425
<i>Number six.</i>

391
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:30,526
We'll start with a letter
from Melanie in Kansas.

392
00:20:30,527 --> 00:20:32,767
She writes, "Dear Casey,

393
00:20:32,768 --> 00:20:35,599
"is Christopher Cross
as nice as he seems?

394
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,859
"Also, aren't you dead?

395
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,403
"And why did your large wife

396
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,814
"hide your body from your children?"

397
00:20:41,815 --> 00:20:45,276
Well, the answer to your first
question is a resounding yes.

398
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:48,086
Christopher Cross
is a perfect gentleman.

399
00:20:48,087 --> 00:20:49,793
And as for the second question,

400
00:20:49,794 --> 00:20:51,059
you're correct, Melanie.

401
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,465
I'm extremely dead,

402
00:20:52,466 --> 00:20:55,204
and I do wish my children
could have closure.

403
00:20:55,205 --> 00:20:57,650
Honey, if you're listening, please,

404
00:20:57,651 --> 00:21:00,107
just put my body in the ground.

405
00:21:00,108 --> 00:21:02,472
And now back to the countdown.
