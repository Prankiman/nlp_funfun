1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,800
It seems today that all you see

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,100
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,700
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,800
On which we used to rely?

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,100
Lucky there's a family guy

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,000
Lucky there's a man who positively
can do all the things that make us

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,700
Laugh and cry

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,000
He's a family guy

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,700
That concludes our special
half-hour salute to the past 1,000 years.

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,000
We leave you with a look back
at some of those we've lost this millennium. 

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,600
Kevin asked me to Quagmire's
millennium party. I am so psyched.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,400
There's nothing like someone else's party.

13
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,500
You never have to clean up the mess.

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,200
Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun, hey!

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,300
Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun, hey!

16
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,600
Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun, hey!

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,900
Well, looks like someone's
going to a big party tonight.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,500
You should pick up a chicken-strip party
pack for all your friends. Here's a coupon.

19
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,000
Look, pal, I don't take coupons
from giant chickens. Not after last time.

20
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,800
Oh, yeah, and that nice chicken
outside gave me this coupon.

21
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry. This has expired.

22
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,600
You son of a...

23
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:25,700
- I'm gonna need these by Friday.
- Will that give us enough time to...?

24
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,100
Chicken... gave me a bad coupon.

25
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,800
- Some other time, pal.
- There won't be any other time.

26
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,000
The world is gonna end at midnight.

27
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:08,200
- Y2K.
- Are you sellin' chicken or sex jelly?

28
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,300
Haven't you heard? At midnight,
every computer in the world is gonna fail.

29
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,700
Planes will fall out of the sky and all
the world's nuclear weapons will explode,

30
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,300
- Annihilating the entire planet.
- No!

31
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,900
Silly rabbit. Trix are for kids.

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,400
Damned long ears, tryin' to take Easter
away from Jesus. What were you sayin'?

33
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,200
Hey, Peter, in case you didn't know,

34
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:42,600
a balloon tied to a mailbox is the
international symbol for "party over here!"

35
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,900
Forget the party. The world's gonna end.
Y2K. I heard it from a chicken-man.

36
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh, Peter, you are
the height of just-too-muchery.

37
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,200
Laugh, but when you die,
you'll have to go to heaven.

38
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,500
And you know what? I bet you run into those
two dead bailiff ladies from Night Court. 

39
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,100
And you won't know which one is which.
And it'll be really awkward. So bite me.

40
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,300
- Can you help me with these damned studs?
- Aren't you a little overdressed?

41
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,500
Oh, actually,
I'm just stopping off at Quagmire's.

42
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,700
There's a benefit gala
at the Boston Pops tonight, and...

43
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,500
well, I'm trying to nail the flautist.

44
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,100
Oh, Stewie, you're adorable.

45
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,000
Yes, yes, I rather like the sash.
But do the Huggies make my ass look big?

46
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,500
Peter, come on. You've had 1,000 years
to get ready for this party.

47
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,200
It always takes him so long to get dressed.

48
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,900
Peter, we're gonna be late for my cousin's
wedding. Aren't you dressed yet?

49
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,800
Oh, crap. Well, one of us
is gonna have to change.

50
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,300
Unzip me.

51
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,200
- Where's your father?
- He's still down in the basement.

52
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,900
Peter, you've been down there all day.
I hope they're already...

53
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,300
Oh, my God!
The government is here. Run, ET, run!

54
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,300
The end of the world is comin'.
Get in your radiation suits.

55
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,100
We are not missing a once-in-a-lifetime event
because of some wacko doomsday theory.

56
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:16,400
OK, OK. You know that one Christmas
present you really wanted, but didn't get?

57
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,700
- A phone?
- A dead Lois?

58
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,600
Yeah, well, it's in the basement.
Come on, let's go see.

59
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,700
What the hell...? Peter,
if you wanna stay here, that's fine.

60
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,000
But we're goin' to the party. Kids!

61
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,200
- Honey, are you pregnant?
- No.

62
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,300
Oh, dear me. Yes, yes, this is how
I wanted to enter the new millennium.

63
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,300
Locked in a basement with imbeciles,
dressed like a gay Neil Armstrong.

64
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,800
Thanks a lot. Right now I could be in Boston,
pretending I give a rat's ass about Vivaldi.

65
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,900
- And I could be getting felt up by Kevin.
- Now don't you give it all away up front.

66
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,200
Make him work for it.
And shame on you, Peter.

67
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,100
Scarin' the kids with
your nuclear-holocaust nonsense.

68
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,600
You said "nuclear". It's "nukular",
dumb idiot. The S is silent.

69
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,500
It's almost midnight.

70
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,500
We now go live to Asian reporter
Tricia Takanawa. Tricia, what can you tell us? 

71
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:19,000
Quahog's fabled alabaster clam is about
to descend and usher in a new millennium.

72
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,300
- Ten... nine... eight... seven...
- This is it.

73
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,300
- Six... five... four...
- Hold on tight.

74
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,400
...one... Happy New Year!

75
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,100
- A flautist, Peter.
- Well, I hope you're happy.

76
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,400
Come on, kids,
we can still make the party if we...

77
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,400
Nice work. Very festive.

78
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,700
Actually, each light represents
a missile launching by itself.

79
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,000
The pattern is just a coincidence.

80
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,000
Now that you mention it, the Y is
a bit misshapen. Still, it's pretty amazing.

81
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,500
What the hell. Come here, Hillary.

82
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What'd I miss?

83
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,200
Holy crap! Anybody else feel that?

84
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,500
Good morning, family. Hey, Lois,
remember when I was the third Hardy Boy?

85
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,800
Peter, there was no third Hardy Boy.

86
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,300
Oh, really?
Just like there was no apocalypse?

87
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
He shoots, he scores!

88
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,800
OK, we were wrong about
the end of the world and you were right.

89
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,600
- Can we please just drop it?
- It's just not fair.

90
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,100
I finally get a date with Kevin,
and he gets vaporised.

91
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,300
He's just using that as an excuse.

92
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,900
Let's just be grateful we survived the
apocalypse healthy and mutation-free.

93
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,500
- I said I can do it.
- Hey, shut up!

94
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,700
- Oh, hey, Clevemire.
- That's Quagland.

95
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,100
Quagland? Oh, you must be dreamin'.

96
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,300
Not about kickin' your fat ass.

97
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,100
Boys, please. You used to be so close.

98
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,200
Sorry, Lois. We're both a little crabby on
account of the fact that neither one of us

99
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,500
has had any food
since we got fused together.

100
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,900
Well, we just finished off
what was left in the kitchen.

101
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,200
When I think back on all the food
we've wasted in this house.

102
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,300
Eat, Tom Selleck. Come on. Down the hatch.

103
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,000
Come on. Hey, hey! None for you, Higgins.

104
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,300
Tryin' to steal Tom Selleck's food.

105
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,700
No. No. You've had yours.

106
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:56,300
Thank goodness Peter bought a huge supply
of dehydrated meals before the blast.

107
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,000
Peter, whaddaya doin'?
You just ate a year's worth of food.

108
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,900
What a waste of money. I'm still hungry.

109
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,800
Everyone leave. I have to poop.

110
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,300
Now!

111
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,700
Well, so much for finding food
at the Stop 'N Shop.

112
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,000
It figures. The one time I remember
my value-club card.

113
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,600
Wait a minute, I smell barbecue.

114
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,100
So, whaddaya think, Diane?
Can I cook or what?

115
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,700
Delicious, Tom. I guess
we should be eating her with chopsticks.

116
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,100
Oh, my God. They're eating
Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa.

117
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,100
That's crazy. They're just
gonna be hungry again in an hour.

118
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,500
Come on, Woody.
We're gonna search for food.

119
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,100
- Sorry, Chris, the plant can't come.
- It's his best friend.

120
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,500
Lois, it'll just be another mouth to feed.
I'll take care of Woody, son.

121
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,400
What was that?

122
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,500
- Nothing. Let's go.
- Go where?

123
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,200
If there's no food in Quahog,
why should there be food anywhere else?

124
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,500
Lois, everyone knows there are only two
things that can survive a nukular holocaust:

125
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,200
cockroaches and Twinkees.
And there's a Twinkee factory in Natick.

126
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,100
- Twinkees?
- Yeah, I saw a story about 'em on A&E.

127
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,100
And now, back to A&E's biography:
Twinkee the Kid.

128
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,200
It was difficult for Twink
to play with other children. 

129
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,600
He was different. He was definitely... 

130
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:27,500
He had no bones, 
and he couldn't really play any sports. 

131
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,900
- That's why we got him the lasso. 
- Yeah. 

132
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,000
He's spend hours in the back yard
playing Wonder Woman. 

133
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,900
- He's gonna kill me. 
- He loved that lasso. 

134
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,100
He... Not as much as the baton. 

135
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,900
But, uh... we put a stop to the baton. 

136
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,700
He... he was different enough, you know. 

137
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,900
We gotta get to that factory
and we'll have all the food we need.

138
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,700
Well, goodbye sweet home.
Maybe someday we'll return.

139
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:59,100
- Hey, Joe, can you keep an eye on the place?
- I might as well. I'm melted to the ground.

140
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,900
There you go.
These oughta keep the rats away.

141
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,800
Thanks. Stay in school.

142
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,200
Bring it on!

143
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,700
Look, Peter, people.

144
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,600
- Halt.
- Uh-oh.

145
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,700
I am Jorad. I and my band
of highway warriors control this territory.

146
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,300
- Do you have food?
- No, that's why we're on the road.

147
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,500
Then you may not pass
until you answer the following question:

148
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,800
Name something you'd take on a picnic.

149
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,900
- A blanket.
- Potato salad.

150
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,300
- A dead Lois?
- OK, we're gonna go with potato salad.

151
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,600
Show me potato salad.

152
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Maybe we should go now.

153
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,700
- Aw, jeez. Outta gas!
- Hey, Dad, look.

154
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,300
Well, howdy, strangers.
You look plumb tuckered.

155
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,300
- Like to sit a spell?
- Actually, we are tired.

156
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,900
- And hungry.
- Well, we got plenty o' room here.

157
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:21,300
- And all the fresh apples you can eat.
- Oh, Peter, we found a new home.

158
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,700
- We're goin' to Natick.
- For what?

159
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,700
A Twinkee factory
that might not even exist any more?

160
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,200
She's right. Besides, this place is paradise.

161
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,600
- Sure is, except for Randy Newman.
- Randy Newman?

162
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,500
Yep. Just sits there all night and day,
singin' about what he sees.

163
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,500
Fat man with his kids and dog

164
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,300
Drove in through the morning fog

165
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,600
Hey, there, Rover

166
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,700
Come on over

167
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,000
Well, it's nice to have music while we eat.

168
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,600
Red-headed lady

169
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,700
Reachin' for an apple

170
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
Gonna take a bite

171
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,900
Uh, no, no

172
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,600
She's gonna breathe on it first

173
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,700
Wipes it on her blouse

174
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,700
She takes a bite

175
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,700
Chews it once

176
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,900
Twice, three times

177
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,300
Four times

178
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,100
Stops

179
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,800
Saliva working

180
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,900
Takes a long, hard look at Randy

181
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,400
Five times

182
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,700
Fat, old husband walking over

183
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,300
Let's get the hell outta here.

184
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,600
They're walking down the road

185
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,000
Left foot, right foot

186
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,300
Left foot, right foot

187
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,900
Left...

188
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,900
Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot

189
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,200
Please, Chris, Mommy's got
a very big headache. Stop it!

190
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,000
Thank you, sweetie.
Now, Peter, we've gotta find some food.

191
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,900
Oh, my God. Look!

192
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,700
It's Natick.

193
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,800
There's no factory?

194
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,700
Oh, very good, fat man.

195
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,800
We've followed the pied piper to the gates
of oblivion and look what it's brought us.

196
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
We're finished. We're done.

197
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,600
Game over, man. Game over.

198
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,400
- Dammit!
- Get outta that nuclear waste.

199
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,200
Who knows what animals have been in there?

200
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,800
It's about damn time.

201
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,700
Oh, words...

202
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,300
Should've sent a poet.

203
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,500
- There's enough food to last us for ever.
- We're saved. You were right.

204
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,900
We can settle down here and
build a house just like we had in Quahog.

205
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Yeah, and we can build a mall
so I have a place to hang out.

206
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:01,000
And two Denny's, so we can say "Let's not
go to that one. Let's go to the good one."

207
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,200
We can dig Joe out of the driveway

208
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,000
and we can build a community
just like the one we had.

209
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:12,100
No, we'll build a better one.
I hereby proclaim this city New Quahog.

210
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,100
Well, this isn't very good, now, is it?

211
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,700
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

212
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,600
- Guess who?
- Stop it, Chris.

213
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,900
Wrong!

214
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,100
Oh, wait. Did you say "Chris"?

215
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,300
Stewie, time for breakfast!

216
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,000
Did you wash your tentacles?
My big, handsome boy.

217
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,300
What the devil are you talking about?

218
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,300
I'm repugnant.
I'm a radio-bloody-active freak.

219
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,000
Yeah, I fold. Hey, come on.
Let's go home and get tender with your wife.

220
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:19,500
I don't know, Quagmire. Lovemaking
with Loretta has somehow lost its intimacy.

221
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,400
All right.

222
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,800
Excuse me, Mr Mayor. We have an outsider
who wishes to join our community.

223
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,900
Welcome to my fair city.

224
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,600
If you wanna become a citizen,
you have to get a job.

225
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:37,300
- Before the disaster, I was a physician.
- That's terrific. We need a doctor.

226
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,600
We sure do. Let's hope you get it.

227
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,800
Now, pick a job out of the hat.

228
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,500
Ah, village idiot. That's a good one.

229
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,900
On Tuesdays you get to
wave your penis at traffic.

230
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,300
Congratulations.

231
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,600
Maybe we shoulda just let him be a doctor.

232
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,900
No. These are the rules of New Quahog.

233
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,100
That's how everyone else got their jobs.

234
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
Go!

235
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,400
You see, Doc, my back tooth is killin' me.

236
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,800
And things have worked out fine so far.

237
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,400
Peter, no offence, but that's
because we all pitched in.

238
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,500
- We've built schools and hospitals.
- Not to mention the theatre.

239
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,200
But when I saw the movie,

240
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:25,800
it looked like Audrey Hepburn
not only didn't have breakfast at Tiffany's,

241
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,200
she hadn't eaten anything in a year.

242
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,300
I'm such a bitch.

243
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,000
We have everything we need.
And no crime, no guns, no pollution.

244
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,400
Brian's right.
We've left ourselves defenceless.

245
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,700
- Guys, we need to make some guns.
- Guns? Guns only lead to trouble.

246
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,400
And when that trouble happens,
we'll blow its freaking head off.

247
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,500
Without guns, how would our forefathers
have settled their differences?

248
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,700
Eight, nine, ten.

249
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,800
And turn.

250
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,700
Honey, Mommy's making you
some new feetie pyjamas.

251
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,700
And look, it has a little trap door
for when you gotta make inky.

252
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,900
I'll show you inky.

253
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,300
- Let's see if they fit, hm?
- Never! Eugh.

254
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,800
Ha, ha, ha, look at me! I'm Fred Astaire.

255
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,800
- Aaah!
- Gotcha.

256
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,000
Oh, you are gettin' heavy.

257
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,700
I'll have your father flood the basement,
so you can get more exercise.

258
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,900
Yes, yes. I do seem
to have gained a bit of girth.

259
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,500
Actually, my gullet seems to be rumbling.

260
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,300
There we are. Oh, I say. I've laid an egg.

261
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,700
That wasn't so bad. I don't know what
these women are always complaining about.

262
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,900
Attention, New Quahogians.

263
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,200
Today, my vision for our future comes true.

264
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,400
A chicken in every pot and a cap in every ass.

265
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,900
Put that away. Where did you get
the metal for all those guns?

266
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Recycling. I used the pipes
from our irrigation system.

267
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,500
Are you crazy?
You destroyed all our water pipes?

268
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,700
We don't need guns. We need food and water.

269
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,000
I have a canker sore on my lip,
and I keep pokin' at it with my tongue,

270
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,100
- But that's only makin' it worse.
- There's a reason I'm in charge here.

271
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,900
I'm the one who knew the world was
gonna end and found the Twinkee factory.

272
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,300
- And I gave elocution lessons to Rosie Perez.
- That's nothing to be proud of.

273
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,800
Don't be stupid.
She speak good and everything.

274
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,100
- Let's get him outta here!
- Throw him out!

275
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,100
Wait! We can work this out!

276
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:36,500
I haven't been thrown outta any place
since I was a counsellor at the bulimia clinic.

277
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,200
Aw, man. Did anybody else throw up
after eatin' that fish last night?

278
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,200
- That's the last of 'em.
- Good riddance.

279
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,400
What the hell would we ever need guns for?

280
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,900
Victory is ours!

281
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,000
Quick, grab the guns! They're our only hope.

282
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You remember the other day you were
asking me what the definition of irony was?

283
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,300
And I said...

284
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,200
Honey, I'm sorry I got us
kicked outta New Quahog.

285
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:30,600
I guess nobody really needs guns.
I'm not always right after all.

286
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:35,100
Oh, Peter, hearing you say that almost
makes it worth havin' the world blown up.

287
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,400
Where are we gonna go?

288
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,100
I hear there's a Carvel factory in Framingham.

289
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,600
All right! Fudgie the Whale, and Cookie Puss,

290
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,100
and Cookie O'Puss,
and Nutty the Chocolate Ghost.

291
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,400
Come on, everybody. Let's sing a song.

292
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,700
Oh. Uh... Left foot, right foot.

293
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,400
Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot.

294
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,800
- Bobby.
- Good morning.

295
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,200
Oh, Bobby, I just had the weirdest dream.

296
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,000
I dreamt I saw
the strangest episode of Family Guy, 

297
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,000
and there was a giant chicken
and Stewie was an octopus.
