6
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,840
OK, Peter, I'm off to my book club.

7
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,970
You'll babysit Stewie?

8
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,740
Only if I can have a plastical.

9
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,310
Only if you say it right.

10
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,520
Pa... psycal.

11
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,370
Good! And you gotta be responsible tonight.

12
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:58,990
I don't want the repeat of the last time

13
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,990
I left you alone with one of our children.

14
00:01:03,056 --> 00:01:05,125
It's just so horrible.

15
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:06,841
I'm sorry, Lois.

16
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:10,039
I thought if I shock him enough it'd stop crying.

17
00:01:11,214 --> 00:01:12,836
I was kinda right.

18
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:17,586
Yeah, I'm babysitting for Stewie.

19
00:01:17,586 --> 00:01:19,373
I babysit now, 'cause I'm grown up.

20
00:01:19,373 --> 00:01:21,794
I'm so getting hair down there.

21
00:01:21,794 --> 00:01:23,981
Anyway, you guys should totally come over.

22
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,061
What? You're already here? No way!

23
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:34,184
OK, Quagmire's turn. Truth or Dare?

24
00:01:34,184 --> 00:01:36,184
Uh... I pick dare... No, no, no, truth, truth!

25
00:01:36,184 --> 00:01:38,346
OK, truth. Do you have AIDS?

26
00:01:38,346 --> 00:01:41,261
Ah... C'mon, we're all just trying to have a good time.

27
00:01:41,261 --> 00:01:43,659
OK, Cleveland, your turn. Truth or Dare?

28
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:45,070
Um... Dare!

29
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,049
OK. I dare you to make out with Joe for 15 seconds.

30
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:51,277
- What?
- No way! Uh! Uh!

31
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,429
You got to, it's a dare.

32
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:53,793
- That's the game.
- That's the game.

33
00:01:53,793 --> 00:01:56,414
OK. What's the hell, I'm an openminded person.

34
00:01:56,414 --> 00:01:57,536
So am I. No big deal.

35
00:01:57,536 --> 00:01:58,706
Just my body.

36
00:01:58,942 --> 00:02:01,927
Oh my god! They gonna do it! Oh, I gotta take a picture.

37
00:02:02,844 --> 00:02:10,391
[Peter and Quagmire shouting]

38
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:12,391
Hey! Keep it down.

39
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:14,788
It's just two guys making out, relax.

40
00:02:14,788 --> 00:02:15,916
Stewie, go to bed.

41
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,056
What am I expected to put myself to bed?

42
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:19,913
Is no one taking care of me?

43
00:02:19,913 --> 00:02:23,722
Duh, he's a worse dad than a rich New York City investment banker.

44
00:02:23,957 --> 00:02:27,108
Hi, daddy! At school today they pick one kid...

45
00:02:27,108 --> 00:02:28,965
Melly, it's in here again.

46
00:02:28,965 --> 00:02:30,470
Me sorry, mister sir.

47
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,032
Get out the room, how dare you to bother your father.

48
00:02:33,032 --> 00:02:35,454
Him unhappy. Him had doing in first place.

49
00:02:35,454 --> 00:02:39,333
Now come on, I'll let you rub some lotion on me elbows.

50
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:41,873
We now return to Robert Mitchum in

51
00:02:41,873 --> 00:02:44,529
Out of shape inshape guy from the 50's.

52
00:02:45,258 --> 00:02:47,468
Gambling is illegal in this town.

53
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:48,338
Says who?

54
00:02:48,338 --> 00:02:50,877
Says me. You got a problem with that?

55
00:02:50,877 --> 00:02:53,675
I'm... Not really sure.

56
00:02:53,675 --> 00:02:55,297
Kinda waiting for you to exhale.

57
00:02:57,155 --> 00:02:59,153
Actually yeah, I do have a problem with that.

58
00:03:00,023 --> 00:03:03,150
Oh, come on. Stupid satellite TV.

59
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,631
Maybe I have to fix the dish.

60
00:03:08,134 --> 00:03:09,239
Uh oh.

61
00:03:10,744 --> 00:03:12,319
Oh no! Oh no!

62
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,188
Hehey, hey. Help. Help!

63
00:03:17,727 --> 00:03:20,054
Hey! Hey, Brian! Brian!

64
00:03:20,054 --> 00:03:20,948
What the hell?

65
00:03:20,948 --> 00:03:23,416
Call the fire brigade! Get a ladder! Get me down!

66
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,710
What are you doing up there?

67
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,755
Counting the stars in the Orion's penis!

68
00:03:26,755 --> 00:03:28,542
What do you think I'm doing up here, I'm stuck!

69
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:29,741
How did you get on the roof?

70
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:32,821
What am I doing an interview? Shut up and get a ladder or something!

71
00:03:32,821 --> 00:03:34,821
Actually yeah. Maybe we are doing an interview.

72
00:03:34,821 --> 00:03:37,594
So, Stewie, tell us about that new project you have coming up.

73
00:03:37,594 --> 00:03:39,521
What are you talking about? Get me down, you douche.

74
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:41,849
No. First you tell me about that new project.

75
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:43,025
Oh, you're so dead.

76
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:45,282
Is that the title of your new film?

77
00:03:45,282 --> 00:03:48,597
Uh... I've been working on a new movie and it's really great. Toss me a rope!

78
00:03:48,597 --> 00:03:50,971
No, that's not good enough. I want details.

79
00:03:50,971 --> 00:03:52,971
Grr... I'm gonna slit your throat while you sleep.

80
00:03:52,971 --> 00:03:56,136
Am... Well... When you working with Jack Black...

81
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:58,136
Uh... You just got to keep up, you know.

82
00:03:58,136 --> 00:04:00,023
I mean he's doing his thing and you got to...

83
00:04:00,023 --> 00:04:01,692
You got to match his energy level.

84
00:04:01,692 --> 00:04:03,838
Without looking like you trying to warm up him

85
00:04:03,838 --> 00:04:05,838
'cause, you know, that's the game you just not gonna win.

86
00:04:05,838 --> 00:04:07,782
What was it like having a privilege

87
00:04:07,782 --> 00:04:10,485
of performing the words of Oscar winnier Diablo Cody?

88
00:04:10,485 --> 00:04:13,142
She's an overpriced cool girl who's got lucky once.

89
00:04:13,142 --> 00:04:15,775
Uh... That doesn't sound like an interview answer.

90
00:04:15,775 --> 00:04:17,775
Say something nice about Diablo Cody.

91
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:22,053
I... envy the tattoo artist who had that

92
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,639
huge canvas of arm fat to work with.

93
00:04:25,885 --> 00:04:28,918
Wonderful. Wonderful. Hey, listen, could you hang with us through the break?

94
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:29,341
What?

95
00:04:29,341 --> 00:04:32,445
We'll be right back with Stewie's co-star Robin Williams.

96
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:35,054
No! No, I hate Robin Will... Where you going?

97
00:04:37,523 --> 00:04:38,699
Stewie!

98
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:39,545
What?

99
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:42,766
I have to tell you about the future.

100
00:04:42,766 --> 00:04:43,330
What?

101
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:47,115
I have to tell you 'bout the future.

102
00:04:47,115 --> 00:04:49,258
On the night, I go back...

103
00:04:49,258 --> 00:04:51,258
Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no, no, no, hang on, Michael.

104
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:54,028
I have to tell you about your future.

105
00:04:54,286 --> 00:04:55,885
Peter, Stewie's on the roof.

106
00:04:56,426 --> 00:04:59,247
Ah, Nick Jonas is so cute.

107
00:04:59,247 --> 00:05:00,188
Hey, Peter.

108
00:05:00,188 --> 00:05:00,916
Yeah?

109
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,257
PILLOW FIGHT!

110
00:05:02,257 --> 00:05:03,902
Ah, you bastard.

111
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:22,311
Oh my god! Sorry, Lois.

112
00:05:22,311 --> 00:05:26,520
Peter! What is our infant son doing up on the roof?

113
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,520
There's a racoon up here.

114
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,752
Yikes! Looks like I need a distraction.

115
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:33,573
Ladies and gentlemen, mr. Conway Twitty.

116
00:05:33,691 --> 00:08:21,089
Twitty Conway - I See The Want In Your Eyes

117
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:23,722
Terrific! Terrific!

118
00:08:23,722 --> 00:08:26,449
So, Lois, you still pissed at me about Stewie being on the roof?

119
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:27,931
Yes, Peter, I am.

120
00:08:27,931 --> 00:08:30,423
Oh, for crying out loud. If Conway Twitty isn't enough

121
00:08:30,423 --> 00:08:32,068
to lighten you up, what more is it gonna take?

122
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:34,068
A minotaur with Sean Connery's head?

123
00:08:37,358 --> 00:08:39,357
Is this 31 Spooner st...

124
00:08:39,357 --> 00:08:41,731
Get out of here. Just get the hell out of here.

125
00:08:44,553 --> 00:08:47,304
Look, Lois, what do you say we just bury the hatchet, huh?

126
00:08:47,304 --> 00:08:50,995
We'll stay in tonight, pop some popcorn and watch Jimmy Camel try.

127
00:08:50,995 --> 00:08:52,405
No, thank you, Peter.

128
00:08:52,405 --> 00:08:54,592
And even if wanted to, the TV is out.

129
00:08:54,592 --> 00:08:56,379
There must be something wrong with the dish.

130
00:08:56,379 --> 00:08:58,471
It's all right, it's all right. I'll fix the dish.

131
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,717
Where's my screwdriver.

132
00:09:00,728 --> 00:09:02,703
Ho-ly crap!

133
00:09:02,703 --> 00:09:05,454
You are not gonna believe what I just found.

134
00:09:05,454 --> 00:09:06,865
The yellow piece of paper?

135
00:09:06,865 --> 00:09:08,369
A raffle ticket, Brian.

136
00:09:08,369 --> 00:09:10,369
But not just any raffle ticket.

137
00:09:10,369 --> 00:09:14,071
I won this in 1989 from a Honey Nut Cheerios sweepstakes

138
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:15,611
and I totally forgot to cash it in.

139
00:09:15,611 --> 00:09:18,503
It's one free round of golf with famous celebrity.

140
00:09:18,503 --> 00:09:20,830
Woow. Who's the celebrity?

141
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,393
I'll give you a hint. Famous football player.

142
00:09:23,393 --> 00:09:27,460
Had a bit part in Roots. Couple of great scenes in The Towering Inferno.

143
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,401
Wait a minute...

144
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,669
Chuck Connors? He was the basketball player and he was in Roots.

145
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:34,326
Yeah, he wasn't in The Towering Inferno, you dumb beaver.

146
00:09:34,326 --> 00:09:37,264
What? I diidn't say nothing.

147
00:09:37,264 --> 00:09:38,228
Dad, who is it?

148
00:09:38,228 --> 00:09:39,568
O.J. Simpson.

149
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:41,896
Who's that?

150
00:09:42,202 --> 00:09:45,000
O.J. Simpson on Spooner street.

151
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,150
Now, that's the story I can sink my teeth into.

152
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,150
Stick around.

153
00:09:54,663 --> 00:10:00,094
Peter, why in the world would you want to play golf with O.J. Simpson?

154
00:10:00,094 --> 00:10:03,926
Why not, Lois. He's The Juice, one of greatest football players ever.

155
00:10:03,926 --> 00:10:05,548
Peter, he murdered two people.

156
00:10:06,512 --> 00:10:07,547
What?

157
00:10:07,547 --> 00:10:11,567
He brutally killed his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman.

158
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:13,142
O.J. Simpson?

159
00:10:13,142 --> 00:10:13,894
Yes!

160
00:10:13,894 --> 00:10:15,282
Was this in the news?

161
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,562
Yes, Peter, it was all over the news.

162
00:10:17,562 --> 00:10:20,619
Wait a minute, if he killed two people, how come he's not in jail?

163
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:21,700
He was acquitted.

164
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,534
Aw... Here you go, everything's fine.

165
00:10:23,534 --> 00:10:26,731
Well, Peter, it's generally believed that the jury made a mistake.

166
00:10:26,731 --> 00:10:29,576
You're saying all those guys in their powdered wigs and

167
00:10:29,576 --> 00:10:32,703
pilgrim hats and their big gross wives were wrong?

168
00:10:32,703 --> 00:10:34,561
Man, they have to be stupider than you are

169
00:10:34,561 --> 00:10:35,971
when you fart yourself a wake.

170
00:10:37,311 --> 00:10:39,380
Hello? What... Who's here? What's going on?

171
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:42,625
Whatever's happening here

172
00:10:43,565 --> 00:10:45,094
just knock it off.

173
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:53,840
So I, Peter Griffin, will be playing one free round of golf

174
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,108
tomorrow with the one and only O.J. Simpson.

175
00:10:57,108 --> 00:11:01,316
What? Peter, you can't play golf with O.J. Simpson. He's a murderer.

176
00:11:01,316 --> 00:11:04,231
Oh, you sound just like Lois. No, no, Joe, I don't believe you.

177
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:07,006
Oh yeah? Well say that after the soul-searching walk

178
00:11:07,006 --> 00:11:09,006
around the town to Dust in the Wind.

179
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:40,062
Kansas - Dust In The Wind

180
00:11:40,062 --> 00:11:41,920
Oh my god, Joe, you right.

181
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,920
O.J. Simpson is a murderer.

182
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,598
What am I gonna do, I'm playing golf with him tomorrow.

183
00:11:46,598 --> 00:11:48,598
Well, now wait a minute, Peter.

184
00:11:48,598 --> 00:11:51,018
This may be an unpresented opportunity

185
00:11:51,018 --> 00:11:52,405
Maybe you could wear a wire.

186
00:11:52,405 --> 00:11:54,898
Get O.J. to confess and we could tape the whole thing.

187
00:11:55,039 --> 00:12:00,023
Wow, imagine it. Peter Griffin - the guy who took down O.J.

188
00:12:00,023 --> 00:12:02,609
Marsha Clark sure couldn't do it, you dumb beaver.

189
00:12:02,609 --> 00:12:04,866
Hey! I wasn't even there.

190
00:12:04,866 --> 00:12:07,711
I was building a canadian damb at the time.

191
00:12:07,805 --> 00:12:12,531
Did you know that beavers affect ... more than any other animal?

192
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,341
Except men.

193
00:12:15,305 --> 00:12:16,880
He was in our house earlier.

194
00:12:19,913 --> 00:12:23,840
Now remember, Peter, we will be right here in the van if anything goes wrong.

195
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,684
Just try to get O.J. talking about the murders.

196
00:12:26,684 --> 00:12:29,858
Do you think he'd be offended if I ask him to sign this basket ball?

197
00:12:29,858 --> 00:12:31,387
Yeah, I think he'd be very offended.

198
00:12:34,255 --> 00:12:35,642
All right, Joe, can you hear me?

199
00:12:35,642 --> 00:12:36,841
Loud and clear, Peter.

200
00:12:42,343 --> 00:12:43,730
Hi, are you Peter Griffin?

201
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,235
That's my name, don't put a knife in it.

202
00:12:45,235 --> 00:12:47,515
Nice to meet you, c'mon, let's t. off.

203
00:12:50,031 --> 00:12:53,087
Damn it. Would you look at these golf shoes, they're all scuffed up.

204
00:12:53,346 --> 00:12:56,661
My wife were supposed to polish 'em but clearly she forgot.

205
00:12:57,084 --> 00:13:00,916
Man, sometimes I just feel like I could just stab her repeatedly.

206
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:02,656
White women, huh?

207
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,656
Jewish waitress too.

208
00:13:04,656 --> 00:13:07,500
I got this jewish waiter one time. He was awful, didn't tip him.

209
00:13:07,805 --> 00:13:09,992
You eh... You've doing something bad to a jewish waiter?

210
00:13:09,992 --> 00:13:12,954
What's up, Peter? I'm sorry, I was focusing on my drive.

211
00:13:12,954 --> 00:13:15,893
You're doing great, Peter. Just don't let him intimidate you.

212
00:13:15,893 --> 00:13:19,020
Guys, guys, someone's getting frogged in the clubhouse.

213
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:19,843
Quagmire!

214
00:13:19,843 --> 00:13:20,971
She sounds fat.

215
00:13:22,358 --> 00:13:24,545
Hey, you know what I like to do sometimes, Juice?

216
00:13:24,545 --> 00:13:27,108
I like to just confess things I've done to people.

217
00:13:27,155 --> 00:13:30,399
You know, just clean my ... Makes me feel a whole lot better.

218
00:13:30,963 --> 00:13:32,562
Anything you'd like to confess?

219
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:33,691
No. Not really.

220
00:13:33,691 --> 00:13:36,841
Peter, we're not really hearing him very well. Can you get closer?

221
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:40,509
Um... Are you sure O.J.?

222
00:13:40,932 --> 00:13:42,860
Are you sure you wouldn't like to confess

223
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,376
to the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman?

224
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:45,963
What?

225
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:48,221
What the hell is that?

226
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,572
You wearing a wire!

227
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,746
I am so murdered.

228
00:13:53,746 --> 00:13:56,778
Peter, I'm hurt. How could you decieve me like this?

229
00:13:56,778 --> 00:13:59,083
Oh god, O.J. please, don't kill me.

230
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:03,550
Wait a minute, is this about that whole business back in 1994?

231
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,843
Well, yeah.

232
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:08,252
Down it. That's been chasing me for 13 years.

233
00:14:08,252 --> 00:14:11,520
And here I was looking forward to a nice day of golf

234
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,482
away from all those people who have demonized me

235
00:14:14,482 --> 00:14:16,739
and made me out some kind of bogeyman.

236
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:19,890
Even though I was found innocent by jury of my PS.

237
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,506
But what about the civil trial?

238
00:14:21,506 --> 00:14:24,333
Believe me, Peter, there was nothing civil about it.

239
00:14:25,697 --> 00:14:27,766
Well, that makes up for one murder.

240
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:31,105
The one thing I'm guilty of is a few bad movies.

241
00:14:31,105 --> 00:14:34,255
And that makes up for the other murder. I am sold.

242
00:14:34,255 --> 00:14:36,255
You are so witty and charming.

243
00:14:36,255 --> 00:14:38,255
That's nice of you to say, Peter.

244
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,449
It's been so long since I had a friend.

245
00:14:45,141 --> 00:14:46,246
You poor fella.

246
00:14:46,528 --> 00:14:48,973
Gosh, there's no way you could have killed anybody.

247
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:53,346
Not without sad eyes, I'm gonna make sure everything is gonna be all right.

248
00:14:53,722 --> 00:14:56,873
Hey everybody, look who I brought home.

249
00:14:57,037 --> 00:14:59,224
Ten thousand rushing yards, six pro-balls

250
00:14:59,224 --> 00:15:01,998
two arrests and no convictions. All it's O.J. Simpson.

251
00:15:01,998 --> 00:15:03,079
Hi, Griffins.

252
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,631
- Oh my god!
- What the...

253
00:15:04,631 --> 00:15:05,760
I just think you're terrific

254
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,931
O.J. this is my family. Family, O.J.

255
00:15:12,931 --> 00:15:14,341
It's nice to meet you all.

256
00:15:14,341 --> 00:15:16,457
Hey, Peter, you mind if I use your restroom?

257
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,915
No, it's upstairs and to the left.

258
00:15:18,432 --> 00:15:20,219
Peter, are you out of your mind

259
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,219
bringing O.J. Simpson in our home?

260
00:15:22,219 --> 00:15:24,216
Look, don't make that face at me, Lois.

261
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:25,673
O.J. is innocent, all right?

262
00:15:25,673 --> 00:15:26,990
Peter, we know he did it.

263
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,894
Oh, you were there? I didn't realized that.

264
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:30,493
Oh, and you didn't do anything to stop it?

265
00:15:30,493 --> 00:15:31,880
Oh, accessory to murder!

266
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,880
Why are you so quick to defend this guy?

267
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,136
Because he was a childhood hero, Brian.

268
00:15:36,277 --> 00:15:39,615
Yes, he have a few marital problems but I used to look up to him.

269
00:15:39,615 --> 00:15:42,319
That's it, isn't it? You idolized O.J. Simpson

270
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:44,319
as a boy and you just can't accept the fact

271
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:45,658
that he's not who you thought he was.

272
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:48,197
Right, enough with yepperty yep, O.J. is gonna stay

273
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:51,347
here with us in Quahog untill I can help him get his life back on track.

274
00:15:55,885 --> 00:15:57,296
Hi, Lois.

275
00:15:58,048 --> 00:15:59,200
Hello, O.J.

276
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,200
Anything I can do to help make dinner?

277
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,031
Um... Sure, you can take the lasagne out of the oven.

278
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,089
You got it.

279
00:16:09,216 --> 00:16:11,661
Oh, wouldn't you know it, it won't fit.

280
00:16:11,826 --> 00:16:14,529
Well, it's all right, how hard could it be.

281
00:16:18,385 --> 00:16:20,478
Oh, Lois, I'm so sorry.

282
00:16:20,478 --> 00:16:23,346
Uh, it's all right, O.J. Le-let me get something to clean that up.

283
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,731
OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD!

284
00:16:26,731 --> 00:16:28,072
Brian, what's the matter?

285
00:16:29,106 --> 00:16:30,164
Oh, you're alive!

286
00:16:30,164 --> 00:16:32,515
Yeah, we just had a little pasta spill.

287
00:16:32,515 --> 00:16:33,714
Oh, thank god!

288
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:36,583
It's OK, Brian.

289
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,098
It's not the first accident we've had in this house.

290
00:16:39,427 --> 00:16:40,768
OK, one...

291
00:16:40,768 --> 00:16:43,989
two... Oh-oh, hang on, hang on, Brian. Stop the wheel, stop the wheel.

292
00:16:43,989 --> 00:16:45,094
I BM'd.

293
00:16:45,282 --> 00:16:48,056
Hey, Juice! Is it all right if I call you Juice? Great!

294
00:16:48,056 --> 00:16:50,360
Listen, I was wondering if you could give me a little advise

295
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,360
on how to murder a woman and get away with it.

296
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,628
Ah, cool, look an that.

297
00:16:53,628 --> 00:16:55,203
Hey, Chris, go long.

298
00:16:58,942 --> 00:17:00,470
Touchdown!

299
00:17:00,681 --> 00:17:02,139
Good grief.

300
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:04,749
What are you doing, O.J.?

301
00:17:04,749 --> 00:17:08,275
Well, I've got no money left to pay my off civil suit debt.

302
00:17:08,275 --> 00:17:11,167
So I'm making a god's eye to send to Fred Goldman.

303
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:13,659
It's kinda nice, right?

304
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:14,670
Better than nothing.

305
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,504
He's got money to buy tongue depressors and

306
00:17:16,504 --> 00:17:18,504
yarn but not enough to pay us back?

307
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,760
You know how much mustache creme I could have bought?

308
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,217
I don't like the mustache, Fred.

309
00:17:22,217 --> 00:17:23,840
Nobody likes the mustache.

310
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,321
That's why we lost the trial.

311
00:17:25,321 --> 00:17:26,355
That's not true!

312
00:17:34,231 --> 00:17:35,525
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.

313
00:17:35,525 --> 00:17:36,724
And I'm Diane Simmons.

314
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:37,735
Our top story tonight

315
00:17:37,735 --> 00:17:40,250
Quahog, Rhode Island known for quaint neighborhoods

316
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:44,623
white sandy beaches and harboring bloodthirsty murderers?

317
00:17:44,623 --> 00:17:48,761
That's right, Tom. Former murderer O.J. Simpson has moved to Quahog.

318
00:17:48,761 --> 00:17:50,548
We don't have footage of the murder itself

319
00:17:50,548 --> 00:17:52,194
but we can show you what's happened

320
00:17:52,194 --> 00:17:54,898
thanks to this reanactment by the Quahog Opera Company.

321
00:17:58,189 --> 00:18:00,705
I love you, Nicole

322
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:04,349
but I must confess

323
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,982
to some trepidation

324
00:18:06,982 --> 00:18:10,697
for I am a lonely waiter

325
00:18:10,768 --> 00:18:16,222
who loves a loss of a estation (?)

326
00:17:58,025 --> 00:18:52,170
opera-style song

327
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,968
Well, it looks like this is one more town

328
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:56,590
the medias run me out of.

329
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:59,764
Now wait a second, Juice. You can't let them tell you how to live your life.

330
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,481
You've been running for too long.

331
00:19:01,481 --> 00:19:04,514
I say you let people get to know you the way I have.

332
00:19:04,514 --> 00:19:06,418
You really think that's possible, Peter?

333
00:19:06,418 --> 00:19:08,840
Of course it is. We'll even throw a big party

334
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,543
and invite everybody in town and I promise, they'll accept you.

335
00:19:15,141 --> 00:19:17,586
Peter, I really appreciate this but...

336
00:19:17,586 --> 00:19:19,090
are you sure people are ready?

337
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,407
Absolutely O.J.

338
00:19:20,407 --> 00:19:22,805
This party will get you a chance to get to know everybody

339
00:19:22,805 --> 00:19:25,462
and give them a chance to know a real O.J. Simpson.

340
00:19:25,462 --> 00:19:28,260
Peter, do you really expect anyone to show up?

341
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,916
Sure I do. Look, here comes a bunch of people.

342
00:19:35,501 --> 00:19:37,194
Wow! What a turnout.

343
00:19:37,194 --> 00:19:40,156
Uh, Peter, that's not a group of enthusiastic party guests

344
00:19:40,156 --> 00:19:41,355
That's an angry mob.

345
00:19:43,471 --> 00:19:45,658
We don't want you in our town, Simpson.

346
00:19:45,658 --> 00:19:48,761
We don't love you like we did in 1993.

347
00:19:48,761 --> 00:19:49,420
Doh!

348
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,277
And that's for you O.J.

349
00:19:51,277 --> 00:19:53,277
We don't want you here either.

350
00:19:57,437 --> 00:19:58,495
Wow! Wow! Wow!

351
00:19:58,495 --> 00:20:02,068
Anyone who wants a piece of O.J. has to get by me.

352
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:05,830
No, Peter. This is my fight and I'll be the one to fight it.

353
00:20:06,465 --> 00:20:08,557
Look at you all. Look what you're doing.

354
00:20:08,557 --> 00:20:11,496
Why you no better than what you made me ought to be.

355
00:20:11,496 --> 00:20:13,942
Sure I made some mistakes in my life.

356
00:20:13,942 --> 00:20:16,434
I forget to take the trash out somedays.

357
00:20:16,434 --> 00:20:19,278
I've left the toothpaste cap on the bathroom counter.

358
00:20:19,278 --> 00:20:21,347
I've taped football games without the

359
00:20:21,347 --> 00:20:23,957
expressed written consent of the NFL.

360
00:20:23,957 --> 00:20:26,755
I guess what I'm saying is

361
00:20:26,755 --> 00:20:28,072
I'm not perfect.

362
00:20:28,072 --> 00:20:31,034
The only difference is I have the courage to admit it.

363
00:20:31,034 --> 00:20:33,034
Does anyone else has the courage?

364
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:36,653
If so, why don't you just come on up here and join me?

365
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:39,263
He's right, I'm not perfect.

366
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,753
I suppose, I'm not either.

367
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,785
Yeah, I guess none of us are perfect.

368
00:20:48,785 --> 00:20:50,783
Boy, do I feel like a jerk.

369
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:51,865
Me too.

370
00:20:51,865 --> 00:20:54,827
I think we owe you an apology, O.J.

371
00:20:57,907 --> 00:21:00,399
You see, none of us are perfect.

372
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:14,952
Oh, I guess he did do it.

373
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,000
