﻿1
00:00:06,383 --> 00:00:08,284
It was awfully nice of our
new neighbors

2
00:00:08,318 --> 00:00:09,785
to invite us
over for dinner.

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:10,720
I don't know, Lois.

4
00:00:10,754 --> 00:00:11,988
Going to
Cleveland's house

5
00:00:12,022 --> 00:00:13,606
with someone else
living there just seems weird.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,292
Like when a new Pope
moves into the Vatican.

7
00:00:16,326 --> 00:00:18,260
Hi, I don't know
who to complain to about this,

8
00:00:18,295 --> 00:00:21,297
but I'm still getting
XVIII's mail.

9
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:22,531
Yeah, no.

10
00:00:22,566 --> 00:00:25,067
No, he's not here anymore,
this is XXIV.

11
00:00:25,102 --> 00:00:26,902
Yeah, no, I don't need
<i>Newsweek.</i>

12
00:00:26,937 --> 00:00:29,238
No, I don't need
<i>National Geographic.</i>

13
00:00:29,272 --> 00:00:32,541
Oh yeah, no, yeah, we'll-we'll
hang on to <i>Boys' Life.</i>

14
00:00:33,577 --> 00:00:35,461
Hello, neighbors.

15
00:00:35,495 --> 00:00:36,996
Joe, you can walk.

16
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:37,997
How do you do?

17
00:00:38,031 --> 00:00:39,031
I'm Stan Smith.

18
00:00:39,066 --> 00:00:40,182
Please, come in.

19
00:00:42,352 --> 00:00:45,021
Oh, I'm so glad
everyone could make it.

20
00:00:45,055 --> 00:00:46,455
Stan, I need $50.

21
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,925
They're selling a biopsy of
Celine Dion's uterus on eBay.

22
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,394
What the hell
kind of dog is that?

23
00:00:51,428 --> 00:00:53,629
I was going to
ask the same thing.

24
00:00:53,663 --> 00:00:55,581
Oh, uh, that's
our alien, Roger.

25
00:00:55,615 --> 00:00:57,533
He lives in our attic,
but nobody can know.

26
00:00:57,567 --> 00:00:59,719
And don't tell
anybody about our attic.

27
00:01:00,754 --> 00:01:01,721
Hello?

28
00:01:01,755 --> 00:01:02,855
Oh, hey, Quagmire.

29
00:01:02,889 --> 00:01:04,273
Hey, you're not gonna
believe this.

30
00:01:04,307 --> 00:01:06,459
I'm over here with Joe,
and he's got a space alien.

31
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:14,316
Peter, wake up.

32
00:01:14,351 --> 00:01:15,751
You're having
a nightmare.

33
00:01:16,787 --> 00:01:17,753
Oh, Lois.

34
00:01:17,788 --> 00:01:19,438
Thank God,
it was just a dream.

35
00:01:19,473 --> 00:01:20,589
Hey.

36
00:01:20,624 --> 00:01:22,992
Lois, what's that
fat man doing in our bed?

37
00:01:23,026 --> 00:01:26,162
Ugh, damn it,
I always wake up

38
00:01:26,196 --> 00:01:29,231
before I find out if they can
understand the baby.

Thanks for helping me set
up this jungle gym, guys.

42
00:02:07,521 --> 00:02:09,588
Lois says Stewie's been
getting a little chunky.

43
00:02:09,623 --> 00:02:12,274
Ugh, everybody's
always commenting on my weight.

44
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:14,560
This is why
I almost died from anorexia.

45
00:02:17,364 --> 00:02:18,631
You...

46
00:02:18,665 --> 00:02:20,065
look...

47
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,300
fat.

48
00:02:21,334 --> 00:02:23,469
All right, I got the
monkey bars all put together.

49
00:02:23,503 --> 00:02:24,720
Aw, God,
look at that,

50
00:02:24,754 --> 00:02:26,439
they already got
Al Qaedas all over them.

51
00:02:26,473 --> 00:02:27,656
Get, get
out of here.

52
00:02:27,674 --> 00:02:28,874
Scat!

53
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:30,493
Man, they're gonna be so good

54
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:32,478
at swinging bar-to-bar,
when they invade.

55
00:02:32,512 --> 00:02:35,464
Wow, Quagmire, how did you
build that part so fast?

56
00:02:35,499 --> 00:02:36,532
It was easy.

57
00:02:36,566 --> 00:02:37,716
I just followed
the instructions.

58
00:02:37,767 --> 00:02:39,047
I couldn't find
the English ones.

59
00:02:39,052 --> 00:02:40,603
These are in Latin
and those stuffy

60
00:02:40,637 --> 00:02:42,471
Ivy League professors
won't help me.

61
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,825
<i>Nullum gratuitum</i>
<i>prandium,</i> eh, Peter?

62
00:02:45,859 --> 00:02:47,059
Oh, yeah?

63
00:02:47,093 --> 00:02:48,733
Why don't you catch
a football, you nerds?

64
00:02:49,796 --> 00:02:50,796
Nerds.

65
00:02:50,831 --> 00:02:52,014
No, I just read the back,

66
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,065
where it's printed in French.

67
00:02:53,116 --> 00:02:54,416
You speak French?

68
00:02:54,451 --> 00:02:55,918
Sure, they love me in France.

69
00:02:57,621 --> 00:03:00,206
Oh, Quagmire!
Shh. Quagmire!

70
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,907
<i>Silence!</i>
<i>C'est Quagmire.</i>

71
00:03:09,332 --> 00:03:11,550
Quagmire.
Aw, Quagmire.

72
00:03:11,585 --> 00:03:14,370
Oh, Quagmire, don't
fall near ze mouse trap.

73
00:03:14,404 --> 00:03:16,055
Yeah, and French also
comes in handy

74
00:03:16,089 --> 00:03:17,690
when I have layovers
in Montreal.

75
00:03:17,724 --> 00:03:18,958
That place is the best.

76
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:20,659
I always wanted to go
to Canada,

77
00:03:20,694 --> 00:03:22,678
but then <i>South Park</i> went,
so we couldn't go.

78
00:03:22,712 --> 00:03:24,563
Oh, man, you guys should
come with me sometime.

79
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:26,439
Montreal has the best
strip clubs in the world.

80
00:03:26,466 --> 00:03:27,449
They do?

81
00:03:27,484 --> 00:03:28,684
Yeah, they're unbelievable.

82
00:03:28,718 --> 00:03:30,553
The girls
up in Canada are gorgeous.

83
00:03:30,587 --> 00:03:31,770
And they
all play ice hockey,

84
00:03:31,805 --> 00:03:33,422
so they lose
their teeth by age ten.

85
00:03:33,456 --> 00:03:34,623
Wow.

86
00:03:34,658 --> 00:03:36,425
In fact,
I'd even go so far as to say

87
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:37,693
that a Canadian strip club

88
00:03:37,727 --> 00:03:40,062

We got to go.

114
00:04:27,944 --> 00:04:28,944
Yeah, will you
take us, Quagmire?

115
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:29,929
Please?

116
00:04:29,963 --> 00:04:30,996
All right,
let's do it!

117
00:04:31,047 --> 00:04:31,997
But I don't want to
get any crap

118
00:04:32,032 --> 00:04:33,082
from your wives about me

119
00:04:33,116 --> 00:04:34,016
taking you to a strip joint.

120
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,210
So you guys are gonna have to

121
00:04:35,218 --> 00:04:36,339
lie about where we're going.

122
00:04:36,353 --> 00:04:37,836
Okay, sure.
Yeah, no problem.

123
00:04:37,887 --> 00:04:39,004
I'm a great liar.

124
00:04:41,391 --> 00:04:42,891
Okay, we're
good this way.

125
00:04:42,926 --> 00:04:44,426
Is it clear
in your direction?

126
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,113
Yep.

127
00:04:51,318 --> 00:04:53,619
We now return to
<i>Stabbed in the Butt,</i>

128
00:04:53,653 --> 00:04:55,888
the only game show where if
you get the answer wrong,

129
00:04:55,922 --> 00:04:57,122
you get
stabbed in the butt.

130
00:04:57,157 --> 00:04:59,458
All right, Bradley,
here's your question.

131
00:04:59,492 --> 00:05:02,061
What is the
atomic weight of nitrogen?

132
00:05:03,863 --> 00:05:04,663
Get him, guys!

133
00:05:04,698 --> 00:05:06,031
Stab him
in the butt!

134
00:05:06,082 --> 00:05:07,533
Okay,
bye, you guys.

135
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:08,801
I'm leaving now.

136
00:05:08,835 --> 00:05:11,036
Peter, tell me again
why you're going to Montreal?

137
00:05:11,071 --> 00:05:12,788
Hey, do I give you
the third degree

138
00:05:12,822 --> 00:05:15,291
every time you go for one of
those luxurious mammograms?

139
00:05:15,325 --> 00:05:17,259
Dad, why can't we all go?

140
00:05:17,294 --> 00:05:18,661
Because somebody's
got to stay here

141
00:05:18,695 --> 00:05:19,995
and round up all
these rattlesnakes.

142
00:05:22,015 --> 00:05:23,015
Bye.

143
00:05:27,604 --> 00:05:28,854
Hey, guys.

144
00:05:28,888 --> 00:05:30,472
Check it out.
What do you think?

145
00:05:30,506 --> 00:05:31,724
Wow, a private plane?

146
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,292
How'd you swing
that, Quagmire?

147
00:05:33,326 --> 00:05:35,628
Well, let's just say
I walked in on John Travolta

148
00:05:35,662 --> 00:05:37,296
with not Kelly Preston.

149
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,265
Oh, my God,
this plane is awesome, Quagmire.

150
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,667
Hey, who's that?

151
00:05:41,701 --> 00:05:43,435
Oh, that's
J. Private Planington.

152
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,903
He invented
private planes.

153
00:05:44,938 --> 00:05:47,306
He was also the world's
foremost squid hunter.

154
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,942
I've got a lot of big
ideas, too,

155
00:05:49,976 --> 00:05:51,477
but everybody's
just so jealous.

156
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,364
Boy, this is nice.

157
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:57,116
Hey, Joe, I'm gonna
go check out the john.

158
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:01,103
Oh, my God,
have you seen this?

159
00:06:01,137 --> 00:06:02,671
Look how fancy this thing is.

160
00:06:02,706 --> 00:06:04,690
They even got a special map
that lets you choose

161
00:06:04,724 --> 00:06:06,358
who you wan to dump
your poop on.

162
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:10,629
Geez, the synagogue
button's almost worn out.

163
00:06:14,067 --> 00:06:16,101
Oh, my God, Joe,
there's a man on the wing.

164
00:06:16,152 --> 00:06:17,736
Peter, there's
no man on the wing.

165
00:06:17,771 --> 00:06:18,971
There is! I saw him!

166
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:20,673
Peter, stop
being ridiculous.

167
00:06:20,707 --> 00:06:21,907
I'm telling you,
lift up the shade.

168
00:06:21,941 --> 00:06:22,841
There's a man on the wing.

169
00:06:22,876 --> 00:06:24,710
Fine.

170
00:06:24,744 --> 00:06:25,778
It's me.

171
00:06:25,812 --> 00:06:26,945
I'm the
man on the wing.

172
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,714
Peter, how the hell
did you get out there?

173
00:06:28,748 --> 00:06:30,032
Are you crazy?!

174
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:31,500
Get back
in here, Peter!

175
00:06:32,736 --> 00:06:34,269
What the hell's going on
back there?

176
00:06:34,304 --> 00:06:35,304
We're losing altitude.

177
00:06:37,874 --> 00:06:39,408
Hang on, you guys;
I don't know

178
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:40,909
if I can pull out
of this-- giggity!

179
00:06:40,944 --> 00:06:42,845
Wow, from up here,
everything looks

180
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:44,546
so huge and coming faster.

181
00:06:58,228 --> 00:07:00,662
Uh, what happened?

182
00:07:00,697 --> 00:07:01,830
Did we crash?

183
00:07:01,865 --> 00:07:03,399
Yeah, we crashed.

184
00:07:03,433 --> 00:07:04,600
Wow.

185
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:06,402
Still, you know,
we saved so much trouble

186
00:07:06,436 --> 00:07:08,370
not flying commercial,
I think we came out ahead.

187
00:07:08,405 --> 00:07:09,538
Sure.

188
00:07:09,572 --> 00:07:11,106
Drive right up to the plane.
Exactly.

189
00:07:11,141 --> 00:07:13,142
If we went to Logan,
that plane wouldn't crash

190
00:07:13,176 --> 00:07:14,443
for another hour,
at least.

191
00:07:16,813 --> 00:07:18,147
Oh, they made
pretty good time.

192
00:07:24,515 --> 00:07:25,874
I'm bored.

193
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,043
Peter, you made me crash
the damn plane!

194
00:07:28,077 --> 00:07:29,711
Okay, I know you're a
pilot and everything,

195
00:07:29,746 --> 00:07:31,580
but not everyone
likes to talk about planes

196
00:07:31,614 --> 00:07:33,015
as much as you, Quagmire.

197
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,851
Well, we're out
of cell phone range

198
00:07:35,885 --> 00:07:36,725
and the radio's shot.

199
00:07:36,753 --> 00:07:37,853
This is not good.

200
00:07:37,887 --> 00:07:39,021
No one knows
we're out here,

201
00:07:39,055 --> 00:07:40,656
and we've got
no food or water.

202
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,591
Relax, Quagmire,
there's food all around us.

203
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,859
The trick is just knowing

204
00:07:43,893 --> 00:07:45,494
what's safe to eat
and what's not.

205
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:51,867
Okay, these are a "maybe."

206
00:07:51,901 --> 00:07:53,719
You guys, I think,
for the time being,

207
00:07:53,753 --> 00:07:56,021
we're gonna have to start
thinking in terms of survival.

208
00:07:56,055 --> 00:07:57,489
Yeah, we're just
gonna have to do

209
00:07:57,523 --> 00:07:58,824
what Davy Crockett
would do.

210
00:07:58,858 --> 00:08:01,009
I mean, that guy killed a
bear when he was only three.

211
00:08:01,077 --> 00:08:02,778
Honey, don't you
think it's weird

212
00:08:02,812 --> 00:08:03,979
that our
three-year-old son

213
00:08:04,013 --> 00:08:05,113
is murdering animals?

214
00:08:05,148 --> 00:08:06,215
Nonsense.

215
00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:07,699
He's a healthy,
normal young boy.

216
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:10,869
Ma, Pa, I
killed my pet raccoon.

217
00:08:10,903 --> 00:08:12,521
Why, Davy?

218
00:08:12,555 --> 00:08:14,022
So I could
have this cool hat

219
00:08:14,057 --> 00:08:16,592
and 'cause it felt like
heaven when I was doing it.

220
00:08:22,565 --> 00:08:23,966
Well, it's getting dark.

221
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,467
We should
probably start a fire.

222
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:26,702
Man, how do
we do that?

223
00:08:26,736 --> 00:08:28,086
Hey, do you think
there's directions

224
00:08:28,121 --> 00:08:29,721
about starting
fires in the song

225
00:08:29,756 --> 00:08:30,956
"We Didn't
Start the Fire"?

226
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:31,957
I don't think so.

227
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:33,191
I better go
through it all.

228
00:08:33,226 --> 00:08:34,960
♪ Stuff, stuff,
stuff and stuff ♪

229
00:08:34,994 --> 00:08:36,595

239
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:53,111
Okay, how's
the fire coming?

240
00:08:56,582 --> 00:08:58,033
Okay, this should work.

241
00:08:58,067 --> 00:08:59,434
If it rains, at least
we know we can stay dry.

242
00:08:59,469 --> 00:09:00,435
Yeah.

243
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,737
So, now our number one concern

244
00:09:01,771 --> 00:09:03,972
is that Predators
are watching our body heat.

245
00:09:04,007 --> 00:09:05,140
Peter, that's
just a movie.

246
00:09:05,174 --> 00:09:07,209
That's not real.

247
00:09:07,243 --> 00:09:08,810
No, I think we
need to cover ourselves in mud

248
00:09:08,845 --> 00:09:09,845
to avoid being seen.

249
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,013
Peter, Joe's right.

250
00:09:11,047 --> 00:09:12,147
That's
only a movie.

251
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:13,548
Oh, God,
somebody farted!

252
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:14,650
Ugh, it stinks!

253
00:09:14,684 --> 00:09:16,101
We should not rule out
the Predator

254
00:09:16,135 --> 00:09:17,135
having been the farter.

255
00:09:20,273 --> 00:09:21,594
Okay, we still
got nothing to eat,

256
00:09:21,607 --> 00:09:22,707
so it looks
like we're gonna

257
00:09:22,725 --> 00:09:24,426
have to hunt
animals for food.

258
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,861
And since we
have no weapons,

259
00:09:25,895 --> 00:09:27,763
I set up some
traps and snares.

260
00:09:27,797 --> 00:09:29,181
Well, I was about to
take a leak.

261
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:30,315
Can I go
in that direction?

262
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,216
Yes.

263
00:09:31,234 --> 00:09:32,517
No.

264
00:09:32,552 --> 00:09:34,086
Ah, damn it, my legs!

265
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,187
I think they're broken!

266
00:09:35,221 --> 00:09:36,355
Yay, Joe.

267
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:37,990
Now you have a friend.

268
00:09:41,027 --> 00:09:42,995
Damn it, Peter,
this is all your fault.

269
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:44,863
Listen, I wish
you had a family

270
00:09:44,897 --> 00:09:47,783
to take care of you, too,
but that's a choice you made.

271
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:48,950
Here you go, guys.

272
00:09:48,985 --> 00:09:51,970
First time in a while
I've had wood in my lap.

273
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:54,306
Are... are we supposed
to laugh at that?

274
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,220
'Cause it's upsetting.

275
00:09:55,241 --> 00:09:56,875
Man, being
out here sucks.

276
00:09:56,909 --> 00:09:58,627
I mean,
I'm not a forest guy.

277
00:09:58,661 --> 00:09:59,728
I-I'm more of a

278
00:09:59,762 --> 00:10:01,296
"take-it-all-in-
at-the-beach" guy.

279
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,384
Excuse me, sir.

280
00:10:05,418 --> 00:10:06,435
This is
private property.

281
00:10:06,469 --> 00:10:07,486
what are you doing?

282
00:10:08,438 --> 00:10:09,738
Just taking it all in.

283
00:10:09,772 --> 00:10:12,057
You're staring
at my daughter's bedroom.

284
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:13,925
She's really
grown into her body.

285
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,827
This is gonna
be a fun summer for her.

286
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:18,046
You guys, we've been out here
a couple days now,

287
00:10:18,081 --> 00:10:20,899
and I don't think
anyone's coming to get us.

288
00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:22,818
It might be time
for one of us to go for help.

289
00:10:22,852 --> 00:10:24,219
Well, what do
you want us to do?

290
00:10:24,253 --> 00:10:25,954
Peter's the
only one who can walk.

291
00:10:25,988 --> 00:10:27,072
What?!

292
00:10:27,106 --> 00:10:28,273
You want me to
just walk out there,

293
00:10:28,307 --> 00:10:29,441
straight into the woods?

294
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:30,776
Peter, if you don't,

295
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,445
the only other option
is we sit here and wait to die.

296
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:35,747
All right, I'll do it.

297
00:10:35,782 --> 00:10:36,932
If I just keep walking,

298
00:10:36,966 --> 00:10:38,050
I gotta hit civilization

299
00:10:38,084 --> 00:10:39,051
at some point, right?

300
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:40,085
Thanks, Peter.

301
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:41,086
Yeah.

302
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,088
And good luck.

303
00:10:44,724 --> 00:10:46,291
Uh-oh.

304
00:10:46,325 --> 00:10:47,426
What?

305
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,728
Well, I hate to ask
you this, Quagmire,

306
00:10:49,762 --> 00:10:51,329
but do you know how
to change a diaper?

307
00:10:51,364 --> 00:10:52,964
Yeah, of course I know
how to change a diaper.

308
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:54,900
I saw
<i>Mr. Mom</i> four times.

309
00:10:58,521 --> 00:11:01,690
That's not how you dry a baby.

310
00:11:01,724 --> 00:11:04,726
He has to do it
'cause his wife has the job.

311
00:11:04,761 --> 00:11:06,728
But motherhood's a job.

312
00:11:06,763 --> 00:11:08,764
M-Motherhood's
a job, too, though.

313
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:11,783
Morning.

314
00:11:11,817 --> 00:11:12,868
What the hell?!
Where'd you come from?!

315
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,336
Yeah, what are...
what are you doing

316
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,837
out here in the middle
of nowhere?!

317
00:11:15,872 --> 00:11:17,005
Middle of nowhere?!

318
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,540
No, I live right
over there.

319
00:11:18,574 --> 00:11:20,709
What?! A plane crashes
in your backyard,

320
00:11:20,743 --> 00:11:22,377
and you don't say anything?!

321
00:11:22,412 --> 00:11:23,779
This is Canada, eh?

322
00:11:23,813 --> 00:11:26,214
I thought it might be rude to
intrude on your plane crash.

323
00:11:26,249 --> 00:11:27,449
Well, this is
great news!

324
00:11:27,483 --> 00:11:28,617
We're saved!

325
00:11:28,651 --> 00:11:29,985
Yes, I suppose so.

326
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:32,170
Listen, why don't we
head back to my place,

327
00:11:32,205 --> 00:11:35,040
grab a bite to eat and watch
the big curling match on TV?

328
00:11:35,074 --> 00:11:37,976
Canada is in the world
final against Mexico.

329
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,750
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

330
00:11:53,109 --> 00:11:55,127
Okay, well, we have
to grab our friend Peter.

331
00:11:55,161 --> 00:11:57,129
He just headed out
that way to get help.

332
00:11:57,163 --> 00:11:58,863
Oh. That's not good.

333
00:11:58,881 --> 00:12:00,315
There's nothing
in that direction

334
00:12:00,349 --> 00:12:02,300
but wilderness for
thousands of kilometers.

335
00:12:02,335 --> 00:12:03,652
What?! You're kidding.

336
00:12:03,686 --> 00:12:05,420
Oh, crap. Peter!

337
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:07,539
Peter, come back! Peter!

338
00:12:07,573 --> 00:12:10,926
Peter! Peter!

339
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,661
I think he's gone.

340
00:12:23,322 --> 00:12:26,274
I'm afraid he might not
have survived, Mrs. Griffin.

341
00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:28,109
We've been searching
these woods for weeks.

342
00:12:28,161 --> 00:12:29,744
We've got to keep looking.

343
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:31,463
He's got to be out there
somewhere.

344
00:12:31,497 --> 00:12:33,031
Oh, my God,
we're in Canada.

345
00:12:33,065 --> 00:12:35,116
I get to use my
new passport.

346
00:12:35,168 --> 00:12:38,203
I hope my picture
looks okay.

347
00:12:38,237 --> 00:12:39,971
That's Liam Hemsworth.

348
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:41,423
No, it's not. It's me.

349
00:12:41,457 --> 00:12:42,958
It's just a
really good angle.

350
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:45,126
God, just look
for Peter. God.

351
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,914
I'm sorry, Mrs. Griffin,

352
00:12:48,948 --> 00:12:51,316
there's been no sign
of your husband for two months.

353
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,051
We're gonna have
to suspend our search.

354
00:12:53,085 --> 00:12:55,353
But there's got to be
something we can do!

355
00:12:55,388 --> 00:12:57,455
Well, the odds were always
against us.

356
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,291
Most black men don't
possess the skills

357
00:12:59,325 --> 00:13:01,193
to survive out here
in the wilderness.

358
00:13:01,227 --> 00:13:02,894
My husband isn't black.

359
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:04,129
Oh, boy.

360
00:13:04,163 --> 00:13:07,199
Well, then, we need
to regroup because...

361
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:08,867
we haven't been looking.

362
00:13:08,901 --> 00:13:11,937
Wait! We may have a possible
lead on Peter Griffin!

363
00:13:11,971 --> 00:13:14,139
What?! Oh, my God,
where is he?!

364
00:13:14,173 --> 00:13:17,442
Well, we didn't find him,
but we found this.

365
00:13:18,945 --> 00:13:20,545
And there's some scribbling
on the back

366
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,780
that says, "Mrs. G."

367
00:13:21,814 --> 00:13:25,333
We figured "G" has
to stand for "Griffin."

368
00:13:25,384 --> 00:13:27,552
No. That G isn't for "Griffin."

369
00:13:27,587 --> 00:13:29,588
It's for "Garrett."

370
00:13:29,622 --> 00:13:32,357
This is Mrs. Garrett
from <i>The Facts Of Life!</i>

371
00:13:32,391 --> 00:13:33,842
And <i>Diff'rent Strokes.</i>

372
00:13:33,893 --> 00:13:35,210
Why does everyone forget that?

373
00:13:35,244 --> 00:13:37,295
Kids, your father
made this.

374
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,563
That's so weird.

375
00:13:38,598 --> 00:13:41,132
Dad gets lost in the woods,
and he makes a doll?

376
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:42,400
Eh, it's not that strange.

377
00:13:42,435 --> 00:13:44,436
It's kind of what Tom Hanks did
in <i>Castaway.</i>

378
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:52,561
I'm sorry, Wilson!

379
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:01,886
Right here is where
we found the doll.

380
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:04,623
Okay, everybody fan out
and look for your father.

381
00:14:04,657 --> 00:14:05,990
Peter!
Peter!

382
00:14:06,008 --> 00:14:08,276
Dad!
Fat-ass!

383
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:15,250
Peter?!

384
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,658
Oh, thank God!
We found you!

385
00:14:23,693 --> 00:14:25,427
Are you okay?!

386
00:14:27,697 --> 00:14:28,930
What the hell?!

387
00:14:28,965 --> 00:14:32,000
It looks like he's become
some kind of feral beast.

388
00:14:32,034 --> 00:14:33,268
Oh, my God!

389
00:14:35,554 --> 00:14:38,907
I can't live by
society's rules, either.

390
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,067
Mom, I still
don't get it.

391
00:14:52,102 --> 00:14:54,236
How could Dad turn
into some kind of feral creature

392
00:14:54,237 --> 00:14:56,005
just from two months
in the wilderness?

393
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:57,240
Yeah,
it's weird.

394
00:14:57,274 --> 00:14:58,474
He doesn't
even talk.

395
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:01,077
Well, he was living among
wild animals for two months,

396
00:15:01,111 --> 00:15:03,479
and you know how impressionable
your dad can be.

397
00:15:05,315 --> 00:15:08,117
Hmm.

398
00:15:09,152 --> 00:15:11,120
Peter, this
is your home.

399
00:15:12,973 --> 00:15:14,874
This is the couch
where you sit.

400
00:15:19,963 --> 00:15:22,665
Oh, yes, that's
the television.

401
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:25,084
Kids, I think he
recognizes the TV.

402
00:15:26,453 --> 00:15:28,821
We're all thinking it,
and he just does it.

403
00:15:28,856 --> 00:15:31,724
You guys, this is gonna
be harder than we thought.

404
00:15:31,758 --> 00:15:34,360
I guess we're all just
gonna have to work together

405
00:15:34,394 --> 00:15:37,096
to reintroduce your father
to civilized society.

406
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,731
Well, that's gonna be
a challenge.

407
00:15:38,765 --> 00:15:40,199
But it can't be any harder

408
00:15:40,234 --> 00:15:42,268
than folding
that thousand-mile-long sheet.

409
00:15:42,302 --> 00:15:44,170
All right, I got my corner.
Everybody ready?

410
00:15:44,204 --> 00:15:45,605
Ready. Chris?

411
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:47,173
Ready. Meg?

412
00:15:54,648 --> 00:15:56,649
You know, long ago,
before this happened,

413
00:15:56,683 --> 00:16:00,386
your father did make some videos
in case he ever became feral.

414
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,622
I guess
they're worth a shot.

415
00:16:02,656 --> 00:16:04,924
Hello, feral Peter.

416
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,393
If you're listening to this,
you've probably become feral,

417
00:16:07,427 --> 00:16:10,663
and you're probably thinking of
a nice juicy rabbit right now.

418
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:14,333
But this isn't
who you really are, Peter.

419
00:16:14,368 --> 00:16:16,068
We got to get you back on track.

420
00:16:16,103 --> 00:16:17,236
Isn't that right, buddy?

421
00:16:18,538 --> 00:16:20,506
Look, it's working!

422
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,008
Okay, good. So, feral Peter,

423
00:16:22,042 --> 00:16:24,911
why don't you put in tape number
two and let's get started.

424
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,785
Don't listen to that Peter!
That Peter is a liar!

425
00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:34,720
Run! Be free!
They will enslave you!

426
00:16:44,731 --> 00:16:45,898
All right, now,
I've been trying

427
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:47,366
to figure out something
we can do together,

428
00:16:47,401 --> 00:16:48,734
and I think
I've found it.

429
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:49,936
We're gonna sing a song.

430
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,704
Now, I'll start, and
when I point to you,

431
00:16:51,738 --> 00:16:53,639
you'll sing your part.
Ready?

432
00:16:53,674 --> 00:16:55,174
♪ War!

00:17:01,381 --> 00:17:02,848
Now, let's try
something else.

00:17:06,553 --> 00:17:08,187
Okay, I like where
this is going.

440
00:17:08,221 --> 00:17:09,488
Let's take it
from the top.

441

00:17:24,805 --> 00:17:25,938
Oh, my God!

444
00:17:25,973 --> 00:17:28,074
Come on! Get out
of the trash.

445
00:17:30,077 --> 00:17:32,044
Who threw out my sequin top?

446
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:34,380
You're 43! Accept it!

447
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,587
Hey, Lois.

448
00:17:41,621 --> 00:17:43,089
Oh, hi, Glenn.

449
00:17:43,123 --> 00:17:45,825
We just thought we'd come by
and see how Peter was doing.

450
00:17:45,859 --> 00:17:47,059
Yeah, has he gotten
any better?

451
00:17:47,094 --> 00:17:48,260
I'm afraid not.

452
00:17:48,295 --> 00:17:49,962
He's still only
speaking gibberish.

453
00:17:49,997 --> 00:17:51,997
Yeah, and we could live
without the semen throwing,

454
00:17:51,999 --> 00:17:53,132
I'll tell you that.

455
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,867
I don't know
what else to do.

456
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:57,203
We've tried everything
to bring the old Peter back,

457
00:17:57,237 --> 00:17:59,672
but we can't
break through to him.

458
00:17:59,706 --> 00:18:02,041
Lois, I think you've
done all you can.

459
00:18:02,075 --> 00:18:03,776
Hard as it is to admit,

460
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:06,679
it might be time to let
Peter be where he belongs.

461
00:18:06,713 --> 00:18:07,930
What do you mean, Brian?

462
00:18:07,964 --> 00:18:10,733
We might have to release
Peter back into the wild.

463
00:18:10,767 --> 00:18:12,268
What?! We-we can't do that.

464
00:18:12,302 --> 00:18:14,603
We'll never
see him again!

465
00:18:14,638 --> 00:18:16,706
Eh, enough time passes,
you'll forget all about him.

466
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,407
Just like
Inspector Gadget forgot

467
00:18:18,442 --> 00:18:20,109
about that one-night stand.

468
00:18:20,143 --> 00:18:21,777
Suzanne, we have to talk.

469
00:18:21,812 --> 00:18:23,045
Okay.

470
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,247
Someone has made
contact with me.

471
00:18:25,282 --> 00:18:29,151
Someone from my past, and,
well, long story short,

472
00:18:29,186 --> 00:18:32,221
go, go, Guatemalan son.

473
00:18:38,528 --> 00:18:41,664
Peter, we all
love you very much,

474
00:18:41,698 --> 00:18:43,966
but we think maybe
this is where you belong

475
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,068
and where you'll be happy.

476
00:18:46,103 --> 00:18:47,636
This is barely
even a forest.

477
00:18:47,671 --> 00:18:49,739
I can see an Arby's
through the trees.

478
00:18:51,241 --> 00:18:52,475
You're free, Peter.

479
00:18:52,509 --> 00:18:54,577
Whatever adventures
lie ahead of you,

480
00:18:54,611 --> 00:18:57,980
know that my heart
will always be with you.

481
00:18:58,014 --> 00:19:01,083
Now, go! Go on!
Get out of here!

482
00:19:06,123 --> 00:19:08,774
I always knew, one day,
this would happen.

483
00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:12,411
We will never forget you,
but you're better off here.

484
00:19:12,446 --> 00:19:14,547
Why are we dragging this out?
It's 6:30.

485
00:19:14,581 --> 00:19:16,849
Go ahead, Peter.
Go on!

486
00:19:16,883 --> 00:19:18,651
Be with your own kind!

487
00:19:21,621 --> 00:19:23,389
We're all gonna
miss you, Dad!

488
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:25,091
More than you know!

489
00:19:29,463 --> 00:19:31,063
What?
My God, I...

490
00:19:31,098 --> 00:19:33,199
I think he's trying
to talk to you.

491
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:34,400
Quick, Meg!

492
00:19:34,434 --> 00:19:35,601
Say something else!

493
00:19:35,635 --> 00:19:37,570
Well, okay, um...

494
00:19:37,604 --> 00:19:39,038
I love you, Dad,

495
00:19:39,072 --> 00:19:41,941
and no matter where you are,
you'll always be my father.

496
00:19:44,277 --> 00:19:46,679
Shut... up...

497
00:19:46,713 --> 00:19:48,114
M-Meg.

498
00:19:48,148 --> 00:19:49,682
I don't believe it!

499
00:19:49,716 --> 00:19:51,217
Peter, you talked!

500
00:19:51,251 --> 00:19:53,285
Shut up, Meg.

501
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,521
Shut... up, Meg.

502
00:19:55,555 --> 00:19:58,224
Shut up... Meg.

503
00:19:58,258 --> 00:20:00,226
Shut up, Meg.

504
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,427
- Peter!
- Dad!

505
00:20:01,461 --> 00:20:03,229
- You're back!
- Yay.

506
00:20:06,349 --> 00:20:08,317
Jim.

507
00:20:08,351 --> 00:20:11,086
Your name is Jim.

508
00:20:11,121 --> 00:20:13,022
Close enough, Peter!

509
00:20:13,056 --> 00:20:14,824
Come on, you guys,
let's go home!

510
00:20:16,459 --> 00:20:17,593
Yeah!

511
00:20:19,629 --> 00:20:22,264
Is she...
is she letting him drive?

512
00:20:25,535 --> 00:20:27,703
Boy, I sure am happy
to be back.

513
00:20:27,737 --> 00:20:30,172
Yeah, Peter, we thought
we'd lost you for good.

514
00:20:30,207 --> 00:20:31,807
And luckily,
I don't know many words,

515
00:20:31,842 --> 00:20:34,376
so I was able to relearn them
all in a day.

516
00:20:34,411 --> 00:20:35,945
Don't ever leave
us again, Dad.

517
00:20:35,979 --> 00:20:37,613
Aw, sorry, Chris,
but this weekend,

518
00:20:37,647 --> 00:20:39,982
Quagmire's taking me
to a Canadian strip club.

519
00:20:40,016 --> 00:20:43,552
He said he's put together a very
special surprise, just for me.

520
00:20:43,587 --> 00:20:45,621
<i>Mesdames et monsieurs,</i>

521
00:20:45,655 --> 00:20:48,290
all the way from America,
please welcome

522
00:20:48,325 --> 00:20:50,025
Miss Charlotte Rae!

523
00:20:52,329 --> 00:20:54,496
Mrs. Garrett!
Mrs. Garrett!

524
00:20:54,531 --> 00:20:56,832
Girls, girls, girls!

525
00:20:58,339 --> 00:21:03,339
