00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,613
Hey.
What are you working on?

13
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:40,916
Oh, just trying to make some
sense of these numbers.

14
00:00:40,952 --> 00:00:42,551
(women moaning, giggling)

15
00:00:42,587 --> 00:00:43,953
What the...
What did you hit?

16
00:00:43,988 --> 00:00:45,688
What happened to
my spreadsheet?

17
00:00:45,723 --> 00:00:49,191
What exactly was the endgame
if I hadn't walked in?

18
00:00:49,227 --> 00:00:51,460
Ugh, there's nothing worse
than grocery shopping

19
00:00:51,496 --> 00:00:52,696
on the day before
Thanksgiving.

20
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,196
(turkey thuds)

21
00:00:54,232 --> 00:00:56,899
Yeah, that's the sound
a rich family's turkey makes.

22
00:00:56,934 --> 00:00:59,135
There's still a lot more
groceries in the car.

23
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,203
Well, it's not a race.
Take a break.

24
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:03,372
Ugh, if you knew
how close we were

25
00:01:03,408 --> 00:01:05,741
to putting you
down last year.

26
00:01:05,777 --> 00:01:07,076
Geez, what's her problem?

27
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:08,678
Eh, Thanksgiving's
exhausting.

28
00:01:08,713 --> 00:01:10,012
You know what
she could use?

29
00:01:10,048 --> 00:01:12,248
A little sip
of that drink I invented.

30
00:01:12,283 --> 00:01:14,450
Hi! Stewie Griffin here
with my latest creation:

31
00:01:14,485 --> 00:01:16,686
Monster Energy Drink.
What is it? I don't know,

32
00:01:16,721 --> 00:01:19,021
but it's free from this truck
that stopped outside your work.

33
00:01:19,057 --> 00:01:21,257
Mix it with booze. Ever been
wide-awake-blacked-out?

34
00:01:21,292 --> 00:01:23,325
Ever try to jump over
a train on a bike?

35
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:25,327
Ever bit the beak off a bird?
Monster Energy:

36
00:01:25,363 --> 00:01:27,363
put it in your body
and ask questions later.

Peter, you got a letter
from your sister Karen.

55
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,369
What? You've got
a sister, Dad?

56
00:02:07,405 --> 00:02:08,938
How come we've
never met her?

57
00:02:08,973 --> 00:02:10,706
Is she a prim and proper
aunt ("ONT")

58
00:02:10,742 --> 00:02:12,808
or a big, fat,
dirty aunt ("ANT")?

59
00:02:12,844 --> 00:02:15,177
I have no obligation
to tell any of you anything.

60
00:02:15,213 --> 00:02:17,680
Mr. Griffin has shown good
faith in appearing here today

61
00:02:17,715 --> 00:02:19,148
and will not be subjected

62
00:02:19,183 --> 00:02:21,083
to this sort of
hostile interrogation.

63
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:23,953
Your father doesn't like to
talk about his sister, Meg.

64
00:02:23,988 --> 00:02:25,955
They've never
really gotten along.

65
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,757
Wow, Peter.
In all the years I've known you,

66
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:28,958
you've never even
mentioned a sister.

67
00:02:28,993 --> 00:02:30,993
Big deal, I don't
talk about my sister.

68
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:33,395
I also don't talk about
that tickling uncle.

69
00:02:33,431 --> 00:02:35,297
All right, Uncle Dan,
remember: no tickling.

70
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,333
(chuckles)
You got it.

71
00:02:38,503 --> 00:02:39,568
(laughing)

72
00:02:39,604 --> 00:02:41,504
You didn't say anything
about Uncle Neil.

73
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:43,472
Whose uncles are you?

74
00:02:43,508 --> 00:02:45,608
It says here your sister's
coming for Thanksgiving.

guests, can I invite

77

Rosario Vargas from
the third district,

78
00:02:51,415 --> 00:02:52,982
a leader you
can depend on?

79
00:02:53,017 --> 00:02:54,717
I don't want
Karen here.

80
00:02:54,752 --> 00:02:57,720
Peter, you've been avoiding
your sister for too long.

81
00:02:57,755 --> 00:02:59,822
Besides, she says she's been
having Thanksgiving

82
00:02:59,857 --> 00:03:01,757
with your mother for
the last 20 years.

83
00:03:01,793 --> 00:03:03,292
And now that your mom
has passed,

84
00:03:03,327 --> 00:03:05,561
she'd like to spend
Thanksgiving with you.

No.

87
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:13,502
Peter, Karen's coming
and that's that.

88

How cool! I didn't
even know I had an aunt.

I can't wait

00:06:22,732 --> 00:06:26,233
but you'll also never forget
what's gonna happen September 17

159
00:06:26,268 --> 00:06:29,236
at the Jack Witschi
Sports Arena!

160
00:06:29,271 --> 00:06:31,605
Peter, I can't believe you've
kept your sister a secret.

161
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,007
She's amazing!

162
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:34,408
Yeah, she's crazy strong.

163
00:06:34,443 --> 00:06:36,110
Like Superman on a date.

164
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,545
Yeah, I wasn't here,
but I heard her scream,

165
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:40,614
so I came flying in
and found her like this.

166
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,449
It's weird.
Same cause of death

167
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,918
as those three guys
in that local public bathroom.

168
00:06:44,954 --> 00:06:47,121
Unsolvable.

169
00:06:50,893 --> 00:06:53,394
Now do you see why I didn't
want Karen here, Lois?

170
00:06:53,429 --> 00:06:55,195
She terrorized me
my whole childhood.

171
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,464
Now she's got to embarrass
me in front of my friends?

172
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,366
Peter, Bonnie just
changed Joe on the table.

173
00:06:59,402 --> 00:07:00,934
What are you
worried about?

174
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:03,370
Still, I don't want
to go back out there.

175
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:04,972
Look, I know
you've had your differences,

176
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,140
but Karen's your sister.

177
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,975
And you're grown-ups now.

178
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,145
Can't you just go out there
and pretend to have a good time?

179
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,479
Fine, I'll play along.

180
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,648
I guess I've lied before.

181
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:18,986
Where you going?
Home.

182
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,487
Where's home?

183
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,156
The White House.

184
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:27,428
Okay, I'm here.
This is my house.

185
00:07:27,463 --> 00:07:29,263
You can go now.
Thanks for taking me home.

186
00:07:29,298 --> 00:07:30,431
Go ahead, go inside.

187
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:31,999
I will.
You can drive away now.

188
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,735
No, no, I-I want to make
sure you get inside safe.

189
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,670
Yeah, but I-I got to look
through the mail first.

190
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,172
You know how it is.
Really, I insist.

191
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,807
I-It's totally okay. Go.

192
00:07:39,842 --> 00:07:41,975
At this point, it's more
about me than it is you.

193
00:07:42,011 --> 00:07:43,310
It's a bad
neighborhood.

194
00:07:43,345 --> 00:07:44,912
If I don't see
you go inside,

195
00:07:44,947 --> 00:07:46,947
I'll be thinking
about it all night.

196
00:07:46,982 --> 00:07:48,482
(sighs)

197
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,227
(whispering)

198
00:08:03,365 --> 00:08:06,366
Uh... come on in,
Mr. President!

199
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,680
(laughter)

200
00:08:19,715 --> 00:08:22,816
And then, so I'm like, "Peter,
how was I supposed to know

201
00:08:22,852 --> 00:08:25,119
you didn't want your teammates
to know you wore a bra?"

202
00:08:25,154 --> 00:08:26,987
(laughter)

203
00:08:27,022 --> 00:08:29,623
It was a custom-designed
sports halter top.

204
00:08:29,658 --> 00:08:31,225
More stories!
More stories!

205
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,494
Hey, tell one where
Peter is a nincompoop

206
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:34,995
or maybe a Silly Billy.

207
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,497
(laughs)

208
00:08:36,532 --> 00:08:37,898
Oh, man.

209
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:39,333
Okay, let's just
carve the turkey.

210
00:08:39,368 --> 00:08:40,901
Oh, Aunt Karen
already carved it.

211
00:08:40,936 --> 00:08:42,836
She did?
But that's my thing.

212
00:08:42,872 --> 00:08:45,839
I always do my "are you a leg
man or a breast man" joke.

213
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,074
Aunt Karen
did that, too.

214
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,542
It was hilarious.

215
00:08:48,577 --> 00:08:50,978
I never really got it
until she said it.

216
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:52,379
Ha, ha!

217
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,783
Hey, Karen,
later you got to show us

218
00:08:55,818 --> 00:08:57,117
some of your wrestling holds.

219
00:08:57,153 --> 00:08:59,193
Yeah, what's that trademark
finishing move of yours?

220
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:00,521
The Toxic Shock.

221
00:09:00,556 --> 00:09:02,022
Oh, yeah,
that move is badass!

222
00:09:02,057 --> 00:09:04,424
You're awesome.
Know what else is awesome?

223
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,393
This stuffing.
Thank you, Glenn.

224
00:09:06,428 --> 00:09:07,928
You're welcome.
I'm in a good mood.

225
00:09:07,963 --> 00:09:09,830
Sure, what the hell,
I'll show you my moves.

226
00:09:09,865 --> 00:09:11,198
Maybe after dinner.

227
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:13,367
No, no, no. The family
football game is after dinner.

228
00:09:13,402 --> 00:09:14,968
We do it every year!

229
00:09:15,004 --> 00:09:16,970
Peter, calm down.
You're making a scene.

230
00:09:17,006 --> 00:09:19,907
It's not my fault, Lois.
She's ruining Thanksgiving!

231
00:09:19,942 --> 00:09:22,709
The way Tim Burton
ruined the Fourth of July!

Fat chicks with black hair
get tattoos of me!

244
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,916
God, I love this time of year.

245
00:10:02,952 --> 00:10:05,252
It's just past
all the amazing colors of fall,

246
00:10:05,287 --> 00:10:07,120
and before the white of winter.

247
00:10:07,156 --> 00:10:09,089
Just brown and gray.

248
00:10:09,124 --> 00:10:10,457
Magical.

249
00:10:10,492 --> 00:10:11,925
All right, let's do this.

250
00:10:11,961 --> 00:10:13,460
All right, listen up,
I'm the captain.

251
00:10:13,495 --> 00:10:15,596
The teams are chosen by
a lottery system where...

252
00:10:15,631 --> 00:10:17,331
Aunt Karen, can I
be on your team?

253
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,498
Yeah, yeah, me, too!

254
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,300
Uh, yeah, sure,
I'll take, uh,

255
00:10:20,336 --> 00:10:23,470
Meg, Skinny,
Hot Chocolate and The Bus.

256
00:10:23,505 --> 00:10:24,905
Pee Pee, you get
the crumbs.

257
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,073
Let's go.

258
00:10:26,108 --> 00:10:27,574
All right, let's do it, Pop!

259
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,843
I'm gonna make some
sports points for you!

260
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,044
We'll kick off.

261
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:34,915
Hey, time-out!

262
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,283
Did anyone tape the parade?

263
00:10:36,318 --> 00:10:38,352
Please tell me
someone taped the parade!

264
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,254
(grunts)

265
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:41,255
(sighs)

266
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,857
(groaning)

267
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,426
Oh, my God! She's
doing The Toxic Shock!

268
00:10:46,462 --> 00:10:48,462
(groaning)

269
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:55,435
(gasping, wheezing)

270
00:10:55,471 --> 00:11:00,607
Y-Y-You're a j-jerk, K-K-Karen!

271
00:11:00,643 --> 00:11:02,075
What the hell was that?

272
00:11:02,111 --> 00:11:03,443
That's his stutter.

273
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:06,046
And whenever he stutters,
he usually pees his pants.

274
00:11:06,081 --> 00:11:09,249
N-No, I... d-d-don't.

275
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,853
(groans):
Oh.

276
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,423
So this is football.

277
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,758
I like it.

278
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,033
Hi, Dad.

279
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:28,535
Look, I-I just want you to know,
I feel bad about what happened

280
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,237
with you and Aunt Karen
the other day.

281
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:33,040
Oh, you mean when she put me in
that no-bottom James Bond chair

282
00:11:33,075 --> 00:11:34,508
and assaulted my grundle?

283
00:11:34,543 --> 00:11:35,943
I didn't even
know about that.

284
00:11:35,978 --> 00:11:38,378
Well, that's 'cause
it didn't happen.

285
00:11:38,414 --> 00:11:40,414
I'd kick her ass if she
tried something like that!

286
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:43,750
Dad, stop. Even I can see
that your sister's a huge bully.

287
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,820
And trust me, I know more about
getting bullied than anyone.

288
00:11:46,855 --> 00:11:49,089
You do? How?

289
00:11:49,124 --> 00:11:52,960
♪ Celebrate good times,
come on ♪

290
00:11:52,995 --> 00:11:54,962
♪ Let's celebrate ♪

291
00:11:54,997 --> 00:11:56,596
♪ Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh ♪

292
00:11:56,632 --> 00:12:00,968
♪ Celebrate good times,
come on. ♪

293
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,538
Man, I love that song.

294
00:12:04,573 --> 00:12:06,640
Dad, what I'm trying
to tell you is,

295
00:12:06,675 --> 00:12:09,209
I now see why you've been
so tough on me all these years.

296
00:12:09,244 --> 00:12:10,610
'Cause it makes
my friends laugh?

297
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,946
No, because that's how
Aunt Karen treated you

298
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,114
when you were a kid.

299
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:15,682
(gasps loudly)

300
00:12:15,718 --> 00:12:18,452
That's right. And that's why
you need to confront Karen.

301
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,320
Oh, no. Oh, no.
No, I can't do that.

302
00:12:20,356 --> 00:12:22,089
I tried for years
to stand up to her.

303
00:12:22,124 --> 00:12:23,124
Nothing ever worked.

304
00:12:23,158 --> 00:12:24,624
What, so now
you're gonna quit?

305
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,625
You can't quit.

306
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,661
What if Muhammad Ali had quit?

307
00:12:27,696 --> 00:12:29,663
Ah, my grandchildren!

308
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:31,531
Who would like me
to read them a book,

309
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:33,834
or maybe paint their name
on a grain of rice?

310
00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:35,769
Honey, dinnertime!

311
00:12:35,804 --> 00:12:37,070
Ah, my favorite.

312
00:12:37,106 --> 00:12:38,839
Hot soup.

313
00:12:38,874 --> 00:12:40,540
Right in there.

314
00:12:40,576 --> 00:12:42,909
Dad, I know you can
stand up to Aunt Karen.

315
00:12:42,945 --> 00:12:46,179
And maybe if you finally do,
she'll stop terrorizing you,

316
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:48,181
and you won't have to
take it out on me

317
00:12:48,217 --> 00:12:49,449
for the rest of my life.

318
00:12:49,485 --> 00:12:51,084
You know what, Meg?

319
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,153
You're right!
I'm gonna do it!

320
00:12:53,188 --> 00:12:54,154
You are?

321
00:12:54,189 --> 00:12:55,155
Damn right!

322
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,390
Yay, Dad!

323
00:12:56,425 --> 00:12:58,358
I am gonna become
a lady wrestler

324
00:12:58,394 --> 00:13:00,727
and defeat Heavy Flo
in the ring.

325
00:13:00,763 --> 00:13:02,295
Wait. What?! No! What?!

326
00:13:02,331 --> 00:13:03,730
I meant go talk to her.

327
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:05,665
Nope, it's got to be a
lady wrestling match.

328
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,334
Hey, Meg,
Thanksgiving's over.

329
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:10,203
Come help me
with the Christmas decorations.

330
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:12,072
Meg! Help me with
the Christmas decorations!

331
00:13:18,187 --> 00:13:19,920
Comments? Questions?

332
00:13:19,956 --> 00:13:21,088
What the hell are you...

333
00:13:21,124 --> 00:13:22,656
I'm sorry. Chris had
his hand up first.

334
00:13:22,692 --> 00:13:23,657
Chris?

335
00:13:23,693 --> 00:13:25,493
What's the capital
of Maryland?

336
00:13:25,528 --> 00:13:27,495
I do not know, but that's
a very good question.

337
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:28,496
Now, Lois?

338
00:13:28,531 --> 00:13:30,631
Peter, what the hell
are you doing?!

339
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,233
First, it's not Peter.

340
00:13:32,268 --> 00:13:34,935
When I am in this outfit,
I am Maxi Paddy,

341
00:13:34,971 --> 00:13:37,338
the fiercest enemy of Heavy Flo.

342
00:13:37,373 --> 00:13:39,273
Peter, you look--
okay, that's clever--

343
00:13:39,308 --> 00:13:41,008
but, Peter,
you look ridiculous.

344
00:13:41,043 --> 00:13:42,109
Take that off.

345
00:13:42,145 --> 00:13:43,911
If you want to settle things
with your sister,

346
00:13:43,946 --> 00:13:45,246
just go talk to her.

347
00:13:45,281 --> 00:13:47,782
No, Lois, the only way to
settle a family dispute

348
00:13:47,817 --> 00:13:49,083
is in the cage.

349
00:13:49,118 --> 00:13:50,217
I mean, you don't understand.

350
00:13:50,253 --> 00:13:51,452
Karen made me feel worse than

351
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,788
a guy getting cut
from a baseball team.

352
00:13:53,823 --> 00:13:55,055
You wanted to
see me, Coach?

353
00:13:55,091 --> 00:13:57,191
I'm sorry, Kyle.
You can't do this boring,

354
00:13:57,226 --> 00:13:58,926
stupid thing with us.

355
00:14:02,498 --> 00:14:05,266
All right, Peter,
your sister's the real deal.

356
00:14:05,301 --> 00:14:08,035
So I arranged for you
to get some combat pointers

357
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,704
from my old buddy,
Steven Seagal.

358
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,607
Uh, this... this fat guy?

359
00:14:13,643 --> 00:14:16,010
Yup. Go on, ask him anything.

360
00:14:16,045 --> 00:14:17,645
How... how did...?

361
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,346
Uh, why-why you so fat?

362
00:14:19,382 --> 00:14:21,849
Okay, ask him about
anything but his weight.

363
00:14:21,884 --> 00:14:23,117
(sighs):
Uh...

364
00:14:23,152 --> 00:14:25,986
uh, you act Asian,
you look Native American,

365
00:14:26,022 --> 00:14:27,888
your name is possibly Jewish.

366
00:14:27,924 --> 00:14:29,390
What are you?

367
00:14:29,425 --> 00:14:30,791
He fat.

368
00:14:32,328 --> 00:14:34,562
All right, Peter,
most professional wrestlers

369
00:14:34,597 --> 00:14:36,831
become addicted to painkillers
at some point.

370
00:14:36,866 --> 00:14:39,266
So I figure,
why don't we just start now?

371
00:14:39,302 --> 00:14:42,136
Uh... okay,
yeah, I'm in.

372
00:14:42,171 --> 00:14:43,404
Where you getting
all these?

373
00:14:43,439 --> 00:14:45,005
Stepdaughter's purse.

374
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,208
Ain't my problem.

375
00:14:47,243 --> 00:14:52,012
Man, I love putting my hand down
my pants when I'm on drugs.

376
00:14:52,048 --> 00:14:56,150
We should just go live on a
boat in some guy's backyard.

377
00:14:56,185 --> 00:14:58,419
So, you gonna do
that wrestling stuff?

378
00:14:58,454 --> 00:15:00,354
Nah, I'm gonna
stick with these.

379
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:03,157
I would crime
for more of these.

380
00:15:04,694 --> 00:15:06,794
Okay, now if you're gonna defeat
your sister in the ring,

381
00:15:06,829 --> 00:15:08,662
you got to get to the root
of your fears.

382
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:10,531
We got to go back
to your childhood,

383
00:15:10,566 --> 00:15:12,299
so I'm gonna
hypnotize you.

384
00:15:12,335 --> 00:15:14,535
Okay, go back.

385
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,904
Now, we need to go
back in time.

386
00:15:19,742 --> 00:15:21,709
(high-pitched voice):
My jeans are husky.

387
00:15:21,744 --> 00:15:23,844
Okay, further. Further.

388
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,479
Little further.

389
00:15:25,514 --> 00:15:28,048
Now, open your eyes
and tell me what you see.

390
00:15:28,084 --> 00:15:31,585
(demonic voice): I see the six
stations of the Lord's order,

391
00:15:31,621 --> 00:15:33,888
and they will all burn!

392
00:15:33,923 --> 00:15:35,322
Okay, too far!
Too far! Too far!

393
00:15:35,358 --> 00:15:36,624
Come back. Come back.

394
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:37,958
Come back.

395
00:15:37,994 --> 00:15:39,927
(high-pitched voice): Hey,
can I make my husky jeans

396
00:15:39,962 --> 00:15:41,695
into cutoffs
for swimming?

397
00:15:41,731 --> 00:15:43,097
Ah, forget it. You're ready.

398
00:15:43,132 --> 00:15:45,132
Yeah, Peter.
I think you're gonna win!

399
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:47,568
All right! Hey, thanks for
all your help, you guys.

400
00:15:47,603 --> 00:15:49,003
You know, there's
only two things

401
00:15:49,038 --> 00:15:50,537
I've wanted to do
my whole life:

402
00:15:50,573 --> 00:15:53,874
put my sister in her place

423
00:16:38,187 --> 00:16:39,753
(crowd cheering)

424
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:47,528
(grunting)

425
00:16:47,563 --> 00:16:50,331
And we've got quite a match
tonight between Heavy Flo

426
00:16:50,366 --> 00:16:51,999
and another woman
whose name I've forgotten

427
00:16:52,034 --> 00:16:53,634
but I'm sure is a gross pun.

428
00:16:53,669 --> 00:16:55,069
Right you are, Bill.

429
00:16:55,104 --> 00:16:57,972
Tonight, she's up against
Her Vajesty's Secret Cervix.

430
00:16:58,007 --> 00:17:00,240
Interesting fact:
these two gals have

431
00:17:00,276 --> 00:17:02,743
over eight meters of
ass crack between them.

432
00:17:02,778 --> 00:17:04,478
One! Two! Three!

433
00:17:04,513 --> 00:17:05,546
(crowd cheering)

434
00:17:05,581 --> 00:17:06,981
It's over!

435
00:17:07,016 --> 00:17:12,553
And once again, a Heavy Flo has
ruined another lady's evening!

436
00:17:12,588 --> 00:17:14,054
(cheering continues)

437
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:16,323
PETER:
You ain't no champ!

438
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:18,525
Not till you go through me!

439
00:17:18,561 --> 00:17:19,860
Who the hell are you?!

440
00:17:19,895 --> 00:17:23,364
I'm Maxi Paddy, which is
short for Maxine Patricia.

441
00:17:23,399 --> 00:17:25,766
I was named after my father,
Maxwell Patrick.

442
00:17:25,801 --> 00:17:27,034
But that's enough about me.

443
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,836
I'm here to kick your ass!

444
00:17:28,871 --> 00:17:30,070
Get out of here!

445
00:17:30,106 --> 00:17:32,573
I'm not fighting some fat loser
from the crowd.

446
00:17:32,608 --> 00:17:35,576
Huh. It looks like
this Heavy Flo is pee,

447
00:17:35,611 --> 00:17:37,611
because you're yellow!

448
00:17:37,646 --> 00:17:38,879
CROWD:
Oh!

449
00:17:38,914 --> 00:17:40,180
Well, that didn't
quite track,

450
00:17:40,216 --> 00:17:42,149
but the crowd
seems to be on board.

451
00:17:42,184 --> 00:17:43,184
It sure does!

452
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:45,519
Looks like Heavy Flo
has a challenger!

453
00:17:45,554 --> 00:17:47,788
All right, get up here,
but make it quick.

454
00:17:47,823 --> 00:17:50,391
I got a<i> Lampoon</i>
reunion to get to.

455
00:17:50,426 --> 00:17:52,159
Heavy Flo, always
finding a way

456
00:17:52,194 --> 00:17:54,461
to drop her Harvard degree
into conversation.

457
00:17:54,497 --> 00:17:56,330
Yes, very
off-putting, Bill.

458
00:17:56,365 --> 00:17:59,233
Those of us who went to Harvard
really don't appreciate it.

459
00:17:59,268 --> 00:18:00,067
(bell dings)

460
00:18:00,102 --> 00:18:02,102
(grunting)

461
00:18:05,374 --> 00:18:06,874
Ow! Damn it, Karen!

462
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:07,975
Karen?

463
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,243
Peter, is that you?

464
00:18:09,278 --> 00:18:10,511
What are you doing here?

465
00:18:10,546 --> 00:18:13,180
Something I should have done
a long time ago.

466
00:18:13,215 --> 00:18:16,050
I'm tired of you bullying me!
You're going down!

467
00:18:16,085 --> 00:18:17,217
VENDOR:
Butt-scratcher?!

468
00:18:17,253 --> 00:18:18,519
Butt-scratcher!

471
00:18:48,517 --> 00:18:51,251
CROWD (chanting):
Toxic Shock! Toxic Shock!

472
00:18:53,322 --> 00:18:55,589
Oh, my God,
she's taking it too far!

473
00:18:55,624 --> 00:18:57,891
Heavy Flo is gonna break
this girl's arms!

474
00:18:57,927 --> 00:18:58,992
Woman's arms.

475
00:18:59,028 --> 00:19:00,294
Come on, Bill.

476
00:19:00,329 --> 00:19:02,329
N-N-No!

477
00:19:02,364 --> 00:19:04,431
Tell... Stewie...

478
00:19:04,467 --> 00:19:06,733
he's in charge of the show now.

479
00:19:09,271 --> 00:19:12,506
Say hello to Teen LaQueefa!

480
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:16,510
One! Two! Three!

481
00:19:16,545 --> 00:19:17,778
(crowd cheering)

482
00:19:17,813 --> 00:19:19,012
I don't believe it!

483
00:19:19,048 --> 00:19:22,349
Heavy Flo is down, and
we have a new champion!

484
00:19:22,384 --> 00:19:24,485
I tell you, this is
one for the books,

485
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,620
if anyone kept track
of this nonsense!

486
00:19:26,655 --> 00:19:29,022
Wow, you really
saved me!

487
00:19:29,058 --> 00:19:30,190
Thanks, stranger.

488
00:19:30,226 --> 00:19:31,859
Dad, it's me.

489
00:19:31,894 --> 00:19:34,394
(gasps) Meg?

490
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,296
It was you who saved me?

491
00:19:36,332 --> 00:19:37,764
That's right, Dad.

492
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,400
Wow, even after all the
crummy stuff I've done to you?

493
00:19:40,436 --> 00:19:42,536
But why?
Because you're my dad.

494
00:19:42,571 --> 00:19:44,938
And I couldn't stand by
and watch you get hurt.

495
00:19:44,974 --> 00:19:46,507
Wow. Thanks, Meg.

496
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:48,509
You know, that's something
even my own mom and dad

497
00:19:48,544 --> 00:19:49,776
never did for me.

498
00:19:49,812 --> 00:19:52,012
They just stood by and
let Karen pick on me.

499
00:19:52,047 --> 00:19:54,548
Well, you deserve better.
We all do.

500
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,817
You know, Meg, I'm really sorry

501
00:19:56,852 --> 00:19:59,052
I treated you so badly
over the years.

502
00:19:59,088 --> 00:20:01,989
I guess I was taking out
all the pain I felt on you.

503
00:20:02,024 --> 00:20:05,425
I understand.
Better than anybody.

504
00:20:05,461 --> 00:20:07,427
But I still love you, Dad.

505
00:20:07,463 --> 00:20:09,429
I love you, too, Meg.

506
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:17,538
Did somebody order
a hot-ass bitch and this lady?

507
00:20:17,573 --> 00:20:19,006
Oh, you're alive.

508
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,175
Sorry, I was told
I was in charge now.

509
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,976
Well, if you die,
this is kind of

510
00:20:23,012 --> 00:20:25,579
the creative direction
I'm leaning toward.

511
00:20:29,485 --> 00:20:31,118
Well, I'm proud of you, Dad.

512
00:20:31,153 --> 00:20:32,920
You finally stood up
for yourself.

513
00:20:32,955 --> 00:20:35,022
So, Peter,
have you talked to Karen?

514
00:20:35,057 --> 00:20:38,058
I called, like, four times, but
she's not out of the coma yet.

515
00:20:38,093 --> 00:20:39,593
Apparently, they usually
use fake chairs,

516
00:20:39,628 --> 00:20:41,028
but Meg used a real one.

517
00:20:41,063 --> 00:20:42,529
Do they think
she's gonna survive?

518
00:20:42,565 --> 00:20:44,131
It could go either way.

519
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:48,945
(phone ringing) Hello? No, I think I'm a
different blood type.

520
00:20:49,045 --> 00:20:51,276
No, I don't
want to check.

521
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:53,409
Doctor says there's
nothing they can do.

522
