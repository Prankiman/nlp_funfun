Hi, it's me, Peter, your TV cartoon pal.

2
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,605
Y'know, Lois has bitchin' lately

3
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,140
that I watch too much
TV and don't read enough books.

4
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,390
So I went to the library
and picked up three books

5
00:00:44,425 --> 00:00:47,350
by the greatest author
of the last thousand years.

6
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,905
Stephen King.

7
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,040
And tonight I'd like
to share them with you.

8
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,785
We begin with a little
tale called "Stand by Me"

9
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,660
about 4 young boys who
went looking for a dead body

10
00:00:56,695 --> 00:00:59,270
and instead found ..... themselves.

11
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,460
... and also a dead body.

12
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,260
The year was 1955

13
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,230
and the voice in my head
was that of Richard Dreyfuss.

14
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,310
<i>I never had friends like
the ones I had when I was 12.</i>

15
00:01:13,345 --> 00:01:15,215
<i>There was me, Petey Lachance</i>

16
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,140
Anyone else fed up with
this over-saturation of media?

17
00:01:18,175 --> 00:01:20,330
Three channels, and still nothin' on.

18
00:01:20,365 --> 00:01:21,905
<i>Then there was Joey Duchamp</i>

19
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,240
<i>The voice in his head was Roy Scheider.</i>

20
00:01:24,275 --> 00:01:25,417
<i>How are you, Richard?</i>

21
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:26,566
<i>Fine, Roy, how are you?</i>

22
00:01:26,601 --> 00:01:27,645
<i>Good, good.</i>

23
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,250
<i>We should grab a
drink sometime and catch up.</i>

24
00:01:30,285 --> 00:01:32,020
<i>Maybe reminisce about "Jaws".</i>

25
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,220
<i>Great, you should
give me a call sometime.</i>

26
00:01:34,255 --> 00:01:35,870
<i>My number's 555 ...</i>

27
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,040
<i>Wait, wait. What?</i>

28
00:01:37,075 --> 00:01:38,575
<i>555?</i>

29
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,585
<i>Er ... yeah.</i>

30
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,635
<i>You know what, Richard?</i>

31
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,540
<i>If you don't want
to have drinks, just say so.</i>

32
00:01:42,575 --> 00:01:43,950
<i>You don't have to be a dick about it.</i>

33
00:01:43,985 --> 00:01:44,705
Oh, please!

34
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,360
Make the voices stop!

35
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,635
<i>And then there was Quag Chambers.</i>

36
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,420
<i>He was the leader of our gang.</i>

37
00:01:50,455 --> 00:01:51,965
<i>He had sex when he was five</i>

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,390
<i>and committed his
first rape when he was ten.</i>

39
00:01:54,425 --> 00:01:55,115
<i>Rape, of course,</i>

40
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,750
<i>being legal in the 50's.</i>

41
00:01:56,782 --> 00:01:58,730
Ha ha. Beat those cards, fellows!

42
00:01:58,779 --> 00:01:59,579
Ha ha ha.

43
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,390
Giggity, giggity, 50's, giggity

44
00:02:01,425 --> 00:02:02,535
Hey, you guys ...

45
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,320
<i>Finally, there was Cleve Brown </i>

46
00:02:04,355 --> 00:02:06,070
<i>my pudgy black friend.</i>

47
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,810
<i>I can still see him now </i>

48
00:02:07,845 --> 00:02:09,355
<i>all pudgy and black.</i>

49
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,585
Cleve, please, we're
busy lookin' at Playboy.

50
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,780
Look at the way these
women starve themselves.

51
00:02:13,815 --> 00:02:15,835
This one can't be more that 180 pounds.

52
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,180
This is way better than Playboy.

53
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,480
Do you guys wanna see a dead body?

54
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,330
Cleve, it's 1955.

55
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,110
Please re-enter the clubhouse in a
more stereotypically animated fashion.

56
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,190
Lord a'mighty! I done seen me

57
00:02:29,225 --> 00:02:30,905
a dead body down by the lake!

58
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,100
Sho' nuff, I thought I'd go deef and dumb

59
00:02:33,135 --> 00:02:34,540
when I saw me that dead body!

60
00:02:34,575 --> 00:02:35,335
Cleve, calm down!

61
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,570
You're not making any sense!

62
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,380
<i>Anything was possible
as we set out that day </i>

63
00:02:43,415 --> 00:02:45,005
<i>except contracting AIDS</i>

64
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,570
<i>because AIDS had not yet
been invented by the government</i>

65
00:02:47,605 --> 00:02:50,710
<i>in an effort to eradicate
the homosexual community.</i>

66
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:56,070
<i>Have Gun, Will Travel,
reads the card of a man </i>

67
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,320
<i>A knight without
armour in a savage land </i>

68
00:03:01,355 --> 00:03:02,845
OK, I got another one.

69
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,590
<i>- Show me that smile again
- Ooh, show me that smile</i>

70
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,740
<i>Don't waste another
minute on your cryin' ...</i>

71
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,275
<i>We decided to cut through
old man Pressman's junkyard.</i>

72
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,846
<i>Even though legend had it,
that any kid caught scaling the fence</i>

73
00:03:17,885 --> 00:03:20,900
<i>ran the risk of being
attacked by the old man's dog.</i>

74
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,410
<i>who would charge to the cry of "Chopper,
sick balls"</i>

75
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,280
I got a bad felling about this.

76
00:03:27,315 --> 00:03:28,175
Hey!

77
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,310
What are you kids doin'?

78
00:03:29,345 --> 00:03:30,660
Oh no, it's him!

79
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,365
That's right!

80
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,540
Old man Pressman.

81
00:03:32,575 --> 00:03:33,645
I own the junkyard.

82
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,970
I'm cranky 'cos all my stuff is junk.

83
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,320
Why can't I have nice things?

84
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,945
Chopper, sic 'em!

85
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:40,940
Sic 'em, boy!

86
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,030
<i>Now, he said "sic 'em, boy",</i>

87
00:03:48,065 --> 00:03:49,620
<i>but what I heard was</i>

88
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,680
<i>"Chopper, talk to
disfigured World War 2 veterans</i>

89
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,350
<i>who aren't as
bitter as they should be."</i>

90
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,420
Glad I could do my part.

91
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,330
I think you may have done too much.

92
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,400
<i>Hey, how about this brand
new thing called rock'n'roll?</i>

93
00:04:02,435 --> 00:04:03,902
<i>Even though it was just invented,</i>

94
00:04:03,937 --> 00:04:05,370
<i>we already remember it fondly.</i>

95
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,280
<i>Here's Little Richard
with "Piano Riff Woooo"</i>

96
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,630
My arse!

97
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,580
Man, this trip is dangerous.

98
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,100
Couldn't we have just taken a bus?

99
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,350
..... black guy.

100
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,905
Uh, guys, anyone know
when the next train is scheduled?

101
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,850
Don't worry. If a train comes
I'll warn you in slow motion.

102
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,400
T-r-a-i-n!

103
00:04:57,181 --> 00:04:58,619
Aaaaaaahhhh!!!

104
00:05:06,502 --> 00:05:08,850
Aaaaahhh! Aaaaahhh! My legs!

105
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:13,290
A-n-o-t-h-e-r     t-r-a-i-n!

106
00:05:13,578 --> 00:05:15,965
Aaaaaaahhhh!!!
Aaaaaaahhhh!!! Aaaaaaahhhh!!!

107
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,140
What an odd, clustered train schedule!

108
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,700
Hey, sorry you paralyzed, Joey.

109
00:05:21,735 --> 00:05:23,000
Ah, it's alright.

110
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,235
Thanks for goin' all the way back

111
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,070
to the junkyard to
get me this wheelchair.

112
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,900
Boy, was old man Pressman angry.

113
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,294
O-o-o-o-o-h-h-h-h-h!!!

114
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,105
Well, there it is.

115
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,685
<i>None of us could breathe.</i>

116
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,115
<i>The twisted and mangled body</i>

117
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,475
<i>we had come to see</i>

118
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,860
<i>was far more disgusting</i>

119
00:05:41,895 --> 00:05:43,167
<i>than any of us could </i>

120
00:05:43,202 --> 00:05:44,440
<i>ever have imagined.</i>

121
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,230
He's nasty.

122
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,445
Out of my way, you little pipsqueaks!

123
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,660
I'm taking credit for finding this body.

124
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,480
<i>It was the meanest guy in town.</i>

125
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,590
<i>Ace, and his whole gang.</i>

126
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:00,740
<i>Beast-man, Mer-man, and for
some reason, Norm from "Cheers."</i>

127
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,465
Hey, gang.

128
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,120
What, are we beatin' somebody up?

129
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:04,325
Now, get lost!

130
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,880
We'll take it from here.

131
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,165
Kiss my grits,

132
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,790
you cheap dime store hood.

133
00:06:13,825 --> 00:06:15,770
This ain't over, Lachance.

134
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,195
I mean, you have a
gun right now, but tomorrow

135
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,880
I'll get a gun and come
to your house and kill you.

136
00:06:21,312 --> 00:06:24,280
Oh .... yeah, I guess
you could do that, huh?

137
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,035
I mean, we live in the same town.

138
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,600
And I just can't be on
my guard for the rest of my life.

139
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,770
Boy, that is a major hole in this story.

140
00:06:30,805 --> 00:06:32,090
OK, take the body.

141
00:06:35,046 --> 00:06:37,263
<i>We never forgot
that wonderful summer,</i>

142
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:39,953
<i>and eventually, we all
went our seperate ways.</i>

143
00:06:39,954 --> 00:06:42,578
<i>Joey learned to live
without the use of his legs,</i>

144
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:46,137
<i>and even went on to create
a wheelchair type rugby game</i>

145
00:06:46,138 --> 00:06:49,259
<i>called
"Don't-feel-sorry-for-us-ball"</i>

146

<i>Cleve grew up and went
on to marry Rebecca Romjin.</i>

147
00:06:52,637 --> 00:06:54,794
<i>Actually, I'm not
even joking about that.</i>

148
00:06:54,795 --> 00:06:58,812
<i>The fat kid from "Stand by Me"
is now married to Rebecca Romjin.</i>

149
00:06:58,813 --> 00:07:00,137
<i>Can you believe that?</i>

150
00:07:00,138 --> 00:07:01,232
<i>I swear to God!</i>

151
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:02,498
<i>Look it up on the internet!</i>

152
00:07:02,499 --> 00:07:03,901
<i>Doesn't that piss you off? </i>

153
00:07:04,361 --> 00:07:07,345
<i>Quag grew up to become
a famous Hollywood actor.</i>

154
00:07:07,346 --> 00:07:09,421
<i>Unfortunately, about a week ago,</i>

155
00:07:09,422 --> 00:07:12,853
<i>he took an overdose of
designer drugs at the Viper Room.</i>

156
00:07:12,952 --> 00:07:15,558
<i>He died on the kerb outside.</i>

157
00:07:15,722 --> 00:07:18,535
<i>And now, we're left
with a hair lipped reminder </i>

158
00:07:18,536 --> 00:07:20,178
<i>of what might have been.</i>

159
00:07:24,265 --> 00:07:26,766
Hi. Welcome
back from commercials.

160
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:28,781
Joaquin Phoenix, if
you're still watching,

161
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,858
you are a good sport and a trooper.

162
00:07:30,859 --> 00:07:32,414
And you passed our test,

163
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,167
and you can be our friend.

164
00:07:34,226 --> 00:07:37,717
And now for a segment
we like a little less than
the first and the last ...

165
00:07:37,718 --> 00:07:39,073
Here's "Misery."

166
00:07:45,112 --> 00:07:46,186
Marcia, I've done it!

167
00:07:46,187 --> 00:07:48,513
I've finished the book
and Snuggly Jeff is dead

168
00:07:48,514 --> 00:07:50,171
and the readers
are just gonna love it.

169
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:52,220
Paul, I still wish I
could talk you out of this.

170
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:55,640
Snuggly Jeff is the most
succesful children's book series ever.

171
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,202
Yeah, but I wanna get
into writing more serious stuff.

172
00:07:58,203 --> 00:08:01,452
Y'know, something where
the reader doesn't have a load in
his pants while he's lookin' at it.

173
00:08:01,484 --> 00:08:03,399
Well, we'll talk about
it when you get back.

174
00:08:09,045 --> 00:08:10,048
<i>This just in ...</i>

175
00:08:10,049 --> 00:08:13,056
<i>The Weather Service has
reported a big snow storm on its way.</i>

176
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:16,877
Oh, my God!

177
00:08:16,878 --> 00:08:17,828
Stephen King!

178
00:08:19,392 --> 00:08:20,618
Aaaaahhhh!!!

179
00:08:21,795 --> 00:08:23,622
Hey, this'd make a neat story!

180
00:08:25,908 --> 00:08:26,604
Done!

181
00:08:46,575 --> 00:08:47,776
I'm your number one fan.

182
00:08:48,229 --> 00:08:49,431
I'm your number one fan.

183
00:08:49,747 --> 00:08:51,068
I'm your number one fan.

184
00:08:51,433 --> 00:08:53,040
O-o-o-o-o-h-h-h ...

185
00:08:53,624 --> 00:08:56,054
Who ... wh-who are you?

186
00:08:56,055 --> 00:08:57,261
I'm Stewie Wilkes.

187
00:08:57,262 --> 00:08:58,371
I saved your life.

188
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,109
You were in a terrible car accident

189
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,538
and you broke both your legs.

190
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:03,355
I taste lipstick!

191
00:09:03,356 --> 00:09:04,363
Am I wearing lipstick?

192
00:09:04,364 --> 00:09:05,802
Not any more.

193
00:09:09,357 --> 00:09:12,153
Um, Paul, quick question,
and feel free to say no,

194
00:09:12,154 --> 00:09:15,261
but I couldn't help but notice
the new Snuggly Jeff manuscript

195
00:09:15,262 --> 00:09:17,939
in your bag, and, I was
wondering if I could read it

196
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,276
then kill you if I hate it?

197
00:09:19,277 --> 00:09:20,761
Well, I guess that'd be OK.

198
00:09:20,762 --> 00:09:22,172
Oh, thankyou, thankyou, thankyou!

199
00:09:22,207 --> 00:09:24,451
Can I read it while I touch
your ear and suck my thumb?

200
00:09:24,452 --> 00:09:25,269
Uh, I guess.

201
00:09:25,358 --> 00:09:26,773
Oh, goody, goody!

202
00:09:48,483 --> 00:09:49,387
Stewie?

203
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:52,895
I just finished the
book, you dirty birdy!

204
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,355
How could you?

205
00:09:54,356 --> 00:09:55,544
He can't be dead!

206
00:09:55,545 --> 00:09:57,725
Snuggly Jeff cannot be dead!

207
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,311
Aaaaaarrrr!!

208
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:02,125
Look, Stewie, I've gone as
far as I can with Snuggly Jeff,

209
00:10:02,126 --> 00:10:04,255
and I .. I wanna
write something more serious

210
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:08,123
Well, you are gonna write
Snuggly Jeff back to life, Mr. Man.

211
00:10:08,124 --> 00:10:09,181
Look, Stewie, first of all,

212
00:10:09,182 --> 00:10:10,136
you're insane.

213
00:10:10,137 --> 00:10:12,713
And second of all, I have
to be inspired before I write.

214
00:10:12,714 --> 00:10:14,349
Well, how 'bout a little TV?

215
00:10:15,193 --> 00:10:17,590
<i>We now return to Magnum B.M.</i>

216
00:10:18,005 --> 00:10:19,662
<i>Magnum, I've found a fingerprint</i>

217
00:10:19,663 --> 00:10:21,174
<i>smudge at the crime scene.</i>

218
00:10:21,175 --> 00:10:23,530
<i>Do you have poo on your hands?</i>

219
00:10:24,253 --> 00:10:25,342
<i>A little.</i>

220
00:10:31,476 --> 00:10:32,567
No, no, no!

221
00:10:32,568 --> 00:10:33,955
This won't do, Paul.

222
00:10:33,956 --> 00:10:35,504
You can't just have Snuggly Jeff

223
00:10:35,505 --> 00:10:36,629
magically brought back to life

224
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,989
by a child's wish.

225
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,374
It's insulting to the reader!

226
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:39,999
What do you mean?

227
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,702
Well, it's just bad story telling.

228
00:10:41,703 --> 00:10:43,365
Let's see ... How
can I explain this to you?

229
00:10:43,366 --> 00:10:44,862
Did you ever see the movie Contact?

230
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,560
Yeah.

231
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:49,326
So, like, they spent a trillion dollars
building this mile high space machine

232
00:10:49,327 --> 00:10:50,952
and Jake Busey blows it up.

233
00:10:50,953 --> 00:10:51,906
So, now they're all like:

234
00:10:51,907 --> 00:10:54,051
"Oh, no. We can't
use the space machine"

235
00:10:54,052 --> 00:10:55,343
But then this other guy's like:

236
00:10:55,344 --> 00:10:56,781
"Hey, it just so happens,

237
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:59,951
"I built another identical
trillion dollar space machine

238
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:02,121
at my own expense,
on the other side of the world"

239
00:11:02,177 --> 00:11:03,341
And we're supposed to believe

240
00:11:03,342 --> 00:11:04,727
no-one noticed that?

241
00:11:04,782 --> 00:11:07,000
Well, I stood up in the theatre and I said:

242
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:08,999
"No! You can't go into space

243
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,201
because the machine
already got blown up

244
00:11:11,202 --> 00:11:13,871
by Jake Cock-a-Doody Busey!"

245
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,374
Start over!

246
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,008
Fine. But you're
gonna have to go into town

247
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:17,989
and get me some more paper.

248
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:18,758
I'm all out.

249
00:11:18,793 --> 00:11:19,701
Uh, I don't know, Paul

250
00:11:19,702 --> 00:11:21,726
Let me see if I can
get the Big Wheels started.

251
00:11:24,026 --> 00:11:25,026
Rurrr, rurr, rurr, rurr.

252
00:11:25,027 --> 00:11:27,054
Oh, I don't know, Paul. It's not starting.

253
00:11:27,151 --> 00:11:28,251
Rurrr, rurr, rurr, rurr.

254
00:11:28,252 --> 00:11:30,019
Oh, I'm afraid I'm gonna flood it.

255
00:11:30,117 --> 00:11:32,057
Rurrr, rurr, rurr, rurr.. Vrooooom!

256
00:11:32,188 --> 00:11:33,188
Vrooooom! Vrooooom!

257
00:11:33,189 --> 00:11:34,594
OK. I got it now.

258
00:11:34,595 --> 00:11:35,704
I'll see you in a bit.

259
00:12:11,296 --> 00:12:14,230
Heh heh. He's too big for that car.

260
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:24,340
Mr. Sheldon?

261
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:25,857
Oh, my God! I'm saved!

262
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:27,589
Let's get outta here
before Stewie gets back!

263
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:32,322
Ah! My legs!

264
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:35,821
Now I'm gonna have to spend
the rest of my life in a wheelchair!

265
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:37,025
No you're not.

266
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:43,840
Well, that's it, Stewie.

267
00:12:43,841 --> 00:12:44,890
The book is done.

268
00:12:44,891 --> 00:12:46,013
Can I go now?

269
00:12:46,014 --> 00:12:48,267
Oh, no, Paul. I'm not stupid.

270
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,605
If I let you go, you'll
just run straight to the police

271
00:12:50,606 --> 00:12:52,527
and tell them I kidnapped
you and held you hostage

272
00:12:52,528 --> 00:12:54,123
and fondled you
while you were asleep.

273
00:12:54,124 --> 00:12:55,521
No, I ...wait ...What?

274
00:12:55,556 --> 00:12:56,919
You'll tell them that
while you were sleeping

275
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,605
I did things to you
that you don't remember.

276
00:12:58,606 --> 00:13:01,054
You .. fondled me
while I was asleep?

277
00:13:01,062 --> 00:13:01,769
Yeah.

278
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:02,777
I don't think I like that.

279
00:13:02,778 --> 00:13:03,788
Well, it's done.

280
00:13:09,754 --> 00:13:11,020
Everybody still awake?

281
00:13:11,021 --> 00:13:12,534
Alright. Big finish.

282
00:13:12,535 --> 00:13:14,097
Now, you remember
that Stephen King story

283
00:13:14,098 --> 00:13:15,506
when the guy went
up to the empty hotel

284
00:13:15,507 --> 00:13:16,928
and there were those creepy twins

285
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,584
and a guy was
runnin' around with that axe

286
00:13:18,585 --> 00:13:20,084
and a kid talked to his finger?

287
00:13:20,085 --> 00:13:22,246
Ah ha, can't you see Stewie doin' that?

288
00:13:22,247 --> 00:13:24,313
Well, here's
"The Shawshank Redemption"

289
00:13:42,298 --> 00:13:45,075
<i>The first time I
laid eyes on Andy Dufresne</i>

290
00:13:45,076 --> 00:13:46,903
<i>I didn't think much of him.</i>

291
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:48,915
<i>He was a fat drink of water,</i>

292
00:13:49,077 --> 00:13:51,501
<i>the kind of drink of
water that y'know your friend</i>

293
00:13:51,502 --> 00:13:54,318
<i>got from the bathroom
and not from the kitchen.</i>

294
00:13:54,732 --> 00:13:58,314
5 packs of cigarettes says the
fat one breaks first tonight.

295
00:13:58,315 --> 00:14:00,840
You're on. I'll take the
Don Martin looking one.

296
00:14:06,547 --> 00:14:10,382
<i>A month went by before
Andy said 2 words to somebody.</i>

297
00:14:10,409 --> 00:14:13,276
<i>As it turned out,
that somebody was me.</i>

298
00:14:13,277 --> 00:14:14,601
Vagina, boob.

299
00:14:15,348 --> 00:14:18,510
<i>Later, Andy came back
with more than 2 words.</i>

300
00:14:18,576 --> 00:14:21,135
I understand you're a man
who knows how to get things.

301
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:24,480
I've been known to procure
various and sundry items.

302
00:14:24,481 --> 00:14:26,795
I .. I .. I don't
understand what you just said.

303
00:14:26,796 --> 00:14:27,596
I need stuff.

304
00:14:27,597 --> 00:14:28,295
Can you get it?

305
00:14:28,296 --> 00:14:29,135
What do you need?

306
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:30,325
I need a rock hammer.

307
00:14:30,326 --> 00:14:31,295
What's it for?

308
00:14:31,296 --> 00:14:33,655
I carve Star Wars
figurines outta stone

309
00:14:33,656 --> 00:14:36,106
but it's also for not
tunneling my way outta here.

310
00:14:36,107 --> 00:14:38,022
Wow. Can you carve me a set of

311
00:14:38,035 --> 00:14:40,047
women's private parts out of stone?

312
00:14:40,136 --> 00:14:40,531
Sure.

313
00:14:40,532 --> 00:14:42,425
Or you could just
have sex with Helen Hunt.

314
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:44,176
- Ah ha ha ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha ha haa!

315
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:46,165
Ah, we've only had one conversation

316
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,725
but I can tell we're
gonna be life long friends.

317
00:14:48,776 --> 00:14:50,544
And since you're
black and I'm white

318
00:14:50,545 --> 00:14:52,913
that makes it more
especial for the audience.

319
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:01,145
Inspection!

320
00:15:09,031 --> 00:15:10,090
You Andy Dufresne?

321
00:15:10,091 --> 00:15:11,310
A little bit. You?

322
00:15:11,356 --> 00:15:12,056
Ah ha ha ha ha!

323
00:15:12,057 --> 00:15:13,274
I'm just tweakin' your bum.

324
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:14,017
What can I do for you?

325
00:15:14,018 --> 00:15:16,911
I understand you
make Star Wars figurines.

326
00:15:16,936 --> 00:15:18,818
Oh, Grievous! Wicked!

327
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,823
Well, anyway, I'm
a pretty corrupt guy

328
00:15:20,824 --> 00:15:23,717
so I figured I could sell your
figurines and pocket the cash.

329
00:15:23,718 --> 00:15:24,539
What d'ya say?

330
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,634
I don't know ...

331
00:15:25,635 --> 00:15:26,478
Oh, come on!

332
00:15:26,479 --> 00:15:28,793
I'll even cripple that guy
who rapes you in the shower.

333
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:29,825
But I like that guy.

334
00:15:29,826 --> 00:15:30,734
Too late!

335
00:15:32,736 --> 00:15:34,229
Ah, my legs!

336
00:15:34,536 --> 00:15:36,656
<i>Two things never happened again</i>

337
00:15:36,657 --> 00:15:37,711
<i>after that.</i>

338
00:15:37,712 --> 00:15:39,517
<i>Boggs never walked again,</i>

339
00:15:39,518 --> 00:15:40,687
<i>and Andy's farts</i>

340
00:15:40,688 --> 00:15:42,465
<i>never made a sound again.</i>

341
00:15:48,096 --> 00:15:50,970
<i>Thanks to the Star
Wars figurines Andy carved,</i>

342
00:15:50,971 --> 00:15:54,155
<i>he landed a cushy job
cleanin' the warden's office.</i>

343
00:15:54,156 --> 00:15:55,845
OK, you clean up the warden's office

344
00:15:55,846 --> 00:15:57,870
while I go pop out a pine cone.

345
00:16:08,572 --> 00:16:13,765
<i>Plays "Hollaback Girl"
by Gwen Stefani</i>

346
00:16:18,483 --> 00:16:20,687
<i>To this day, I have no idea what</i>

347
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:22,421
<i>that woman was singin' about.</i>

348
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,649
<i>Like, literally, no idea.</i>

349
00:16:25,053 --> 00:16:27,748
<i>I don't know what a hollaback girl is.</i>

350
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:29,094
<i>But I have to imagine</i>

351
00:16:29,095 --> 00:16:31,430
<i>it's a foul disease ridden thing</i>

352
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,125
<i>that wears too much makeup</i>

353
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:37,554
<i>to cover up the fact
that it's a 47 year old fish dog.</i>

354
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:41,049
Andy, I think you know why
I've called you in here today.

355
00:16:41,116 --> 00:16:43,429
A prison is an
environment which requires

356
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,468
the highest level of discipline ...

357
00:16:45,469 --> 00:16:47,969
and that little stunt you pulled today

358
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,313
.. that little stunt you pulled today

359
00:16:50,314 --> 00:16:52,142
made a lot of
people look very foolish.

360
00:16:52,143 --> 00:16:53,999
Look, warden ..
we got it rough in here

361
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,550
I just thought we
could use a little music.

362
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:58,562
Music is expressly
forbidden inside prison walls!

363
00:16:58,563 --> 00:17:00,491
My God! How can you be so obtuse?

364
00:17:00,492 --> 00:17:01,614
What did you call me?

365
00:17:01,615 --> 00:17:03,092
Obtuse. You're bein' obtuse.

366
00:17:03,093 --> 00:17:04,456
Two months in the hole!

367
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:05,838
Or am I being obtuse?

368
00:17:06,001 --> 00:17:07,515
Nope, now you're bein' acute.

369
00:17:09,244 --> 00:17:12,132
<i>That time in the
hole changed ol' Andy.</i>

370
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:14,650
I'm gettin' outta here tonight, Red.

371
00:17:14,651 --> 00:17:17,026
I'm gonna take the
poop pipe to the crap swamp.

372
00:17:17,027 --> 00:17:19,385
Wow. Where you
headed once you get out?

373
00:17:19,386 --> 00:17:20,892
Zihuatanejo.

374
00:17:20,893 --> 00:17:22,087
Sounds fancy.

375
00:17:22,088 --> 00:17:24,150
Eh, actually, it's
a filthy Mexican village.

376
00:17:24,151 --> 00:17:25,200
Listen, Red

377
00:17:25,201 --> 00:17:26,370
when you get outta here,

378
00:17:26,371 --> 00:17:28,314
I want you to do somethin' for me.

379
00:17:28,477 --> 00:17:32,015
Up in a hayfield in Buxton,
Maine, under an old oak tree,

380
00:17:32,016 --> 00:17:35,112
there's a rock that has
no earthly business bein' there.

381
00:17:35,202 --> 00:17:38,611
Under that rock is a box with
somethin' I want you to have.

382
00:17:38,795 --> 00:17:41,150
Course, now that I think about
it, I've been in her 25 years

383
00:17:41,151 --> 00:17:44,120
All these landmarks are based
on possibly outdated observations.

384
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:46,210
That whole area could
be a Wal-Mart by now.

385
00:17:46,211 --> 00:17:48,476
If it is, pick yourself
up some nice cheap pants

386
00:17:48,477 --> 00:17:49,770
and good life to you.

387
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:52,721
Inspection!

388
00:17:57,585 --> 00:18:00,083
Dufresne? Dufresne!

389
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,182
Dufresne, you better get
your arse out here before

390
00:18:02,183 --> 00:18:04,572
here before you make
me cut this sentence shor ....

391
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,168
Where is he?
Where the hell is Dufresne?

392
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:12,119
I don't know, Sir.

393
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,864
I want him found ... now.

394
00:18:13,899 --> 00:18:15,648
Not after breakfast

395
00:18:15,649 --> 00:18:17,569
Not after C.S.I.

396
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:18,695
Now!

397
00:18:18,696 --> 00:18:19,710
God, I'm so angry

398
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:22,455
I could just throw a rock
at that poster of David Cassidy.

399
00:18:44,728 --> 00:18:47,125
<i>What the warden and
his boys didn't realise was</i>

400
00:18:47,184 --> 00:18:50,500
<i>that Andy Dufresne had
escaped from Shawshank Prison</i>

401
00:18:50,584 --> 00:18:51,703
the night before.

402
00:19:09,303 --> 00:19:10,759
<i>Andy crawled to freedom</i>

403
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,770
<i>through 500 yards of foulness</i>

404
00:19:12,771 --> 00:19:14,485
<i>I can't even imagine.</i>

405
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,322
<i>Andy Dufresne,</i>

406
00:19:19,323 --> 00:19:21,575
<i>the man who crawled
through a river of poop</i>

407
00:19:21,576 --> 00:19:23,943
<i>and came out clean on the other side.</i>

408
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,029
<i>Why he chose enchilada night,</i>

409
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,429
<i>I will never know.</i>

410
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,701
Do you believe,
in your best judgement,

411
00:19:33,702 --> 00:19:35,298
that you have been rehabilitated?

412
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,658
Rehabilitated?

413
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:39,377
It's just a stupid made up word

414
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,713
so boys like you
can sit behind a desk,

415
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:44,134
wear a fancy suit,
and feel important.

416
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,671
You're a jerk! And I had
sex with your mother last night!

417
00:19:47,672 --> 00:19:49,703
And I swear to God,
you let me out of here,

418
00:19:49,704 --> 00:19:52,123
first thing I'm
gonna do is kill again.

419
00:19:55,015 --> 00:19:56,518
<i>When I got outta Shawshank,</i>

420
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:58,981
<i>there was only one thing on my mind.</i>

421
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,322
<i>A promise I made to
a friend that I had to keep.</i>

422
00:20:04,574 --> 00:20:07,612
<i>Walk along the stone wall
until you reach the tree,</i>

423
00:20:07,719 --> 00:20:09,908
<i>and that's where
you'll find the rock.</i>

424
00:20:24,498 --> 00:20:25,725
<i>Dear Red,</i>

425
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:26,977
<i>If you've come this far,</i>

426
00:20:26,978 --> 00:20:29,009
<i>maybe you're
willing to go a little further.</i>

427
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,649
<i>You remember the name
of the town in Mexico, right?</i>

428
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:33,982
Crap!

429
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:40,977
What? Oh! Oh, is that him?

430
00:20:40,978 --> 00:20:42,897
Is that..? No, no, beach dog.

431
00:20:43,853 --> 00:20:45,570
Oh! Oh! Is that Red?

432
00:20:45,571 --> 00:20:47,643
Is it? No, no. Not him either.

433
00:20:48,018 --> 00:20:51,381
Where the hell is that jagoff?
There's like 1200 bucks in that box.

434
00:20:51,382 --> 00:20:53,228
Oh, my God,
if he ran off with that ...

435
00:20:53,229 --> 00:20:55,422
Oh, I am gonna be so pissed!

436
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,245
And what am I gonna do?
Go to the authorities?

437
00:20:57,246 --> 00:20:58,493
I just broke out of prison.

438
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:00,964
Now, what? I gotta spend the
rest of my life here by myself?

439
00:21:01,476 --> 00:21:04,281
Well, at least I won't have to be
self conscious about my farting.

440
00:21:05,975 --> 00:21:07,376
Well, that's our show.

441
00:21:07,444 --> 00:21:08,656
Thank you, Stephen King.

442
00:21:08,657 --> 00:21:09,971
We'll see you in court.

443
00:21:10,008 --> 00:21:11,974
Now stay tuned for whatever FOX

444
00:21:11,974 --> 00:21:13,326
