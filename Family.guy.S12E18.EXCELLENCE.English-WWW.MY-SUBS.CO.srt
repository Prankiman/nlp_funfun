12
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:36,850
Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker.

13
00:00:36,884 --> 00:00:38,952
Tonight, the conclusion
of our three-part report

14
00:00:38,986 --> 00:00:40,487
on bestiality at the aquarium.

15
00:00:40,521 --> 00:00:42,189
But first, our top story:

16
00:00:42,223 --> 00:00:44,624
A local boy dies
after playing video games

17
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:46,626
for 51 hours straight.

18
00:00:46,661 --> 00:00:49,329
He was playing <i>Halo;</i>
now he has a halo.

19
00:00:49,363 --> 00:00:51,131
Just kidding. He was gay.

20
00:00:51,165 --> 00:00:52,299
Look at that.
Big deal.

21
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,667
Stayed awake
for 51 hours.

22
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:54,868
That's nothing.

23
00:00:54,902 --> 00:00:56,662
Yeah, I've flown
back-to-back Australia trips

24
00:00:56,671 --> 00:00:57,838
that were longer
than that.

25
00:00:57,872 --> 00:00:58,839
I never sleep.

26
00:00:58,873 --> 00:01:00,006
Something's
been beeping

27
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:01,241
in our bedroom
for three years.

28
00:01:01,275 --> 00:01:02,375
Bonnie won't
look for it,

29
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,577
and I can't
find it.

30
00:01:03,611 --> 00:01:04,878
Hey, I got a fun idea.

31
00:01:04,912 --> 00:01:05,879
Let's bet on it.

32
00:01:05,913 --> 00:01:07,414
100 bucks says
I can stay awake

33
00:01:07,448 --> 00:01:08,548
longer than both of you.

34
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:09,816
Yeah!
Let's do this!

35
00:01:09,851 --> 00:01:10,817
You in, Peter?

36
00:01:10,852 --> 00:01:12,486
Oh, hell yeah,
I'm in!

37
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,620
You guys don't
know nothing

38
00:01:13,654 --> 00:01:14,621
about staying
up late.

39
00:01:14,655 --> 00:01:16,056
I used to pull
all-nighters

40
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,357
when I worked
for that lesbian

41
00:01:17,391 --> 00:01:18,792
carpet-cleaning
company.

42
00:01:20,628 --> 00:01:22,963
Lesbians have regular carpets,
too, you pervs.

43
00:01:22,997 --> 00:01:24,664
DEEP FEMALE VOICE:
When you're done with that,

44
00:01:24,699 --> 00:01:26,800
can you help me plug
the hole in this dike?

45
00:01:28,035 --> 00:01:29,636
I'm kind of
a Jack-of-all-trades.

46
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,005
WOMAN: Hey, help me
fix this gash.

47
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:35,308
Somebody's been having
scissor fights on this thing.

48
00:01:38,346 --> 00:01:39,980
All right, let's get
some ground rules down.

49
00:01:40,014 --> 00:01:42,182
No closing your eyes and
pretending you're thinking.

50
00:01:46,788 --> 00:01:47,754
Peter. Peter!

51
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:49,089
I was thinking!

52
00:01:49,123 --> 00:01:50,290
Hi, boys.

53
00:01:50,324 --> 00:01:51,825
I baked a fresh
batch of cookies

54
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:52,826
for your
slumber party.

55
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,827
Hey!

56
00:01:53,861 --> 00:01:55,562
It's not a slumber
party, Lois!

57
00:01:55,596 --> 00:01:56,696
Yeah, get out
of here!

58
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:58,431
Just leave the cookies
and go.

59
00:01:58,466 --> 00:01:59,432
Okay.

60
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:00,600
You boys
have fun.

61
00:02:00,635 --> 00:02:02,202
We will. Just go!

62
00:02:02,236 --> 00:02:03,236
Geez.

63
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:04,504
Ah, I'm already bored.

64
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:05,572
What should we do?

65
00:02:05,606 --> 00:02:06,573
Hey, let's prank-call
Cleveland.

66
00:02:06,607 --> 00:02:07,574
Oh, yeah.
Yeah!

67
00:02:10,111 --> 00:02:12,112
(phone ringing)

68
00:02:13,114 --> 00:02:14,447
Brown house.

69
00:02:14,482 --> 00:02:16,349
(bad accent): Uh, Cleveland?
It's Loretta.

70
00:02:16,384 --> 00:02:17,350
What?

71
00:02:17,385 --> 00:02:19,319
But... but
you're dead.

72
00:02:19,353 --> 00:02:21,555
No... no, I...
I faked my death

73
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:23,924
to get the IRS
off my back.

74
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,258
Oh, my God.

75
00:02:25,293 --> 00:02:26,614
Does that mean
I have to give back

76
00:02:26,627 --> 00:02:27,828
the insurance money?

77
00:02:27,862 --> 00:02:29,296
(laughing)

78
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,864
Who's there
with you, Loretta?

79
00:02:30,898 --> 00:02:31,965
(laughs)

80
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:32,966
It+s us,
you idiot!

81
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,967
She's still
dead.

82
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:35,702
Oh, you guys
are more meaner

83
00:02:35,736 --> 00:02:37,838
than The Jerky Boys.

84
00:02:37,872 --> 00:02:38,839
(laughing)

85
00:02:38,873 --> 00:02:39,840
Ah, that was awesome.

86
00:02:39,874 --> 00:02:41,174
Hey, who else
has a dead wife?

87
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:42,776
Mort.
Uh, I got this one.

88
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,244
(dials phone)

89
00:02:44,278 --> 00:02:46,613
(phone rings)

90
00:02:46,647 --> 00:02:47,781
Uh, hello?

91
00:02:47,815 --> 00:02:49,616
QUAGMIRE:
Uh... shalom.

92
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,218
Muriel?

93
00:02:57,758 --> 00:02:59,659
You guys are gonna lose.

94
00:02:59,694 --> 00:03:02,095
It's been 62 hours.

95
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:04,030
Joe, you're about to drop.

96
00:03:04,065 --> 00:03:06,900
And, Peter, you've been
hallucinating all night.

97
00:03:06,934 --> 00:03:08,969
Yeah, whatever, Quagmire.
I got to go to the bathroom.

98
00:03:09,003 --> 00:03:10,403
Where's your toilet?

99
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:15,709
Right here, Peter.

100
00:03:15,743 --> 00:03:19,312
Better cover the seat.
Oh, J/K, I'm not fancy.

101
00:03:20,948 --> 00:03:22,148
Aah, leave me alone.

102
00:03:22,183 --> 00:03:24,784
(grunting)

103
00:03:26,754 --> 00:03:27,754
(grunting)

104
00:03:27,788 --> 00:03:29,789
(squishing)

105
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:34,160
We are all one.

106
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:41,301
Pizza. Pizza.

107
00:03:41,335 --> 00:03:42,903
Peter. Peter.

108
00:03:42,937 --> 00:03:44,404
(grunting)

109
00:03:44,438 --> 00:03:46,907
Damn it, Joe. What are you
staring at? Pull him off me.

110
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,345
Oh!

111
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,548
♪ ♪

112
00:04:00,988 --> 00:04:04,124
Oh, my God, Joe,
when did you start running?

113
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:06,826
And jumping? And sky-dancing?

114
00:04:06,861 --> 00:04:09,296
He ain't sky-dancing;
he fell asleep.

115
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:14,034
That means
it's just you and me.

116
00:04:14,068 --> 00:04:16,970
Yeah, and tiny
Sharon Stone from <i>Casino.</i>

117
00:04:17,004 --> 00:04:18,738
You son of a bitch.

118
00:04:18,773 --> 00:04:21,341
I will go to the FBI.
I will go to the police.

119
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,742
Quagmire, help.

120
00:04:22,777 --> 00:04:24,077
I-I don't...
I don't see her.

121
00:04:24,111 --> 00:04:26,980
I-I-I didn't...
I didn't see the movie.

122
00:04:32,653 --> 00:04:34,621
Peter, wake up.

123
00:04:34,655 --> 00:04:37,857
I need to know if I can delete
your <i>iCarlys</i> from the DVR.

124
00:04:37,892 --> 00:04:39,459
What? Aw, damn it.

125
00:04:39,493 --> 00:04:41,194
Wait, I didn't
fall asleep first, did I?

126
00:04:41,228 --> 00:04:42,562
Oh, wha... Wait,
what-what-what happened?

127
00:04:42,596 --> 00:04:44,531
W-Wait, wait...
Were you asleep?

128
00:04:44,565 --> 00:04:46,099
Did I win? I won.

129
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:47,767
Guys, we were
all so tired.

130
00:04:47,802 --> 00:04:48,902
There's no way
to prove

131
00:04:48,936 --> 00:04:50,403
which one of you
fell asleep first.

132
00:04:50,438 --> 00:04:51,705
Oh, yes, there is, Joe.

133
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:53,974
I got cameras
in every room of this house.

134
00:04:55,176 --> 00:04:59,312
(click, electric whirring)

135
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,752
There's a naked lady squatting
over a cake in your kitchen.

136
00:05:05,786 --> 00:05:07,220
She'll wait.
She-she knows to wait.

137
00:05:07,254 --> 00:05:08,321
(click)

138
00:05:15,429 --> 00:05:19,199
(slow, distorted thumping)

139
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,537
Well, it looks
like Peter won.

140
00:05:24,572 --> 00:05:27,841
And it looks like I went
48 hours without an e-mail,

141
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,076
text message
or voice mail.

142
00:05:30,111 --> 00:05:32,112
All right, I won 200 bucks.

143
00:05:33,748 --> 00:05:36,950
And there's a little bit
of blood in my ear.

144
00:05:36,984 --> 00:05:38,284
Well, a bet's a bet.

145
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:40,086
Yeah, congratulations,
Peter.

146
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:42,088
What are you gonna do
with your winnings?

147
00:05:42,123 --> 00:05:45,258
Joe, never ask me
about money. It's rude.

148
00:05:45,292 --> 00:05:46,960
We're gonna go out to eat.

149
00:05:49,997 --> 00:05:54,401
(indistinct conversations)

150
00:05:54,435 --> 00:05:56,169
This is a great
place, Peter.

151
00:05:56,203 --> 00:05:57,537
You can tell
by the laminated

152
00:05:57,571 --> 00:05:59,639
high school football
schedule on the wall.

153
00:05:59,673 --> 00:06:03,476
I'm gonna go see which lobster
I think deserves to die.

154
00:06:05,179 --> 00:06:06,246
Hey, Chris.

155
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,981
Oh, hi, Pam.

156
00:06:08,015 --> 00:06:10,750
I thought you gave a great
book report at school today.

157
00:06:10,785 --> 00:06:14,087
Well, thanks. All the credit
goes to Slash's biography.

158
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:15,288
What a maniac.

159
00:06:15,322 --> 00:06:17,023
Well, all I know is

160
00:06:17,058 --> 00:06:19,025
you looked cute
while you gave it.

161
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,628
Hey, Chris. I didn't know
you knew my daughter.

162
00:06:21,662 --> 00:06:23,830
Sure, I do.
We're in the same gossip group

163
00:06:23,864 --> 00:06:25,965
in the cafeteria at lunch.

164
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,234
♪ Pick a little, talk a little,
pick a little, talk a little ♪

165
00:06:28,269 --> 00:06:30,503
♪ Cheep, cheep, cheep, talk
a lot, pick a little more. ♪

166
00:06:30,538 --> 00:06:32,939
Come on, Pam, we got to go
before they see the tip.

167
00:06:32,973 --> 00:06:34,307
MAN:
40%?

168
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:37,444
I would've left more, but
he messed up our order.

169
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:38,778
I'm sorry, I got to go.

170
00:06:38,813 --> 00:06:40,980
I like bumping into
you outside of school.

171
00:06:41,015 --> 00:06:42,615
You should move into our house.

172
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,750
(laughs)

173
00:06:43,784 --> 00:06:45,185
You're funny, Chris.

174
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:48,721
Hey, uh, maybe we could...
hang out again sometime.

175
00:06:48,756 --> 00:06:50,623
You know, if you want.

176
00:06:50,658 --> 00:06:53,693
I'd like that.

177
00:06:53,727 --> 00:06:55,862
(singsongy):
Ooh!

178
00:06:55,896 --> 00:06:57,897
See you at school, Chris.

179
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,102
Hey, Chris. These...

180
00:07:02,136 --> 00:07:04,571
on her nipples.
(laughs)

181
00:07:04,605 --> 00:07:06,172
Kill that one.

182
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:11,883
ANNOUNCER: The Hallmark Channel
is proud to present

183
00:07:11,892 --> 00:07:14,093
<i>Hallmark Greeting Cards</i>
<i>Explained.</i>

184
00:07:14,127 --> 00:07:16,429
So, there's a penguin
on the front and it says,

185
00:07:16,463 --> 00:07:17,663
"I hear you're 40."

186
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:19,832
And when you're 40,
your eyes start to go.

187
00:07:19,866 --> 00:07:21,634
And then y-you open the card.

188
00:07:21,668 --> 00:07:23,903
And then "happy birthday"
is all blurry,

189
00:07:23,937 --> 00:07:27,073
because whoever opens the card
is 40 and you want to

190
00:07:27,107 --> 00:07:31,210
give them the impression that
their eyes are starting to go.

191
00:07:31,244 --> 00:07:34,213
Hey, guys, there's someone
I want you to meet.

192
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:36,348
Pam, this
is my family.

193
00:07:36,383 --> 00:07:39,318
Family, this
is my girlfriend, Pam.

194
00:07:39,352 --> 00:07:41,554
You know, Chris, Usher
categorizes his girls

195
00:07:41,588 --> 00:07:43,723
into two groups:
bitches he's with

196
00:07:43,757 --> 00:07:45,391
and bitches he's gonna get with.

197
00:07:45,425 --> 00:07:47,727
So is this one you got
or one you gon' get?

198
00:07:47,761 --> 00:07:50,596
Wait. Jerome's daughter
is your girlfriend?

199
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,132
Chris, can I speak to you
for a moment privately?

200
00:07:55,001 --> 00:07:57,303
I voted
for Obama once.

201
00:07:57,337 --> 00:07:59,638
Dad, if this is about Pam...

202
00:07:59,673 --> 00:08:01,040
Yes, it is about Pam.

203
00:08:01,074 --> 00:08:02,374
And I have
something to say.

204
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:04,643
Chris, she's...
she's not fat.

205
00:08:04,678 --> 00:08:05,911
What?

206
00:08:05,946 --> 00:08:08,013
I-I figured the day you
came home with a girl,

207
00:08:08,048 --> 00:08:10,082
we'd have to back her
through the garage.

208
00:08:10,117 --> 00:08:12,551
A little further, little further.
(thunderous footsteps)

209
00:08:12,586 --> 00:08:15,521
Little further...
Whoa! Whoa, whoa.

210
00:08:15,555 --> 00:08:16,956
Okay, all right.
Now, do you prefer

211
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,325
"Fatty" or
"Miss Boom-Bi-Latty?"

212
00:08:19,359 --> 00:08:22,228
So, you don't mind
that Pam is... black?

213
00:08:22,262 --> 00:08:24,130
Chris, it's 1998.

214
00:08:24,164 --> 00:08:26,999
Actually, Dad...
Peter Griffin does not see color.

215
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:28,901
Now, let's go see
your mom's done listing

216
00:08:28,935 --> 00:08:31,403
all the black people she's
ever seen on television.

217
00:08:31,438 --> 00:08:36,308
Flip Wilson, John Amos,
Diahann Carroll,

218
00:08:36,343 --> 00:08:38,711
that monster
that plays tennis.

219
00:08:41,748 --> 00:08:44,316
So, I saw Chris is dating
Jerome's daughter.

220
00:08:44,351 --> 00:08:46,619
Looks like they've had
some pretty hot dates.

221
00:08:46,653 --> 00:08:48,687
Don't, uh...
don't look at my kids

222
00:08:48,722 --> 00:08:51,090
when they're off doing
their private lives.

223
00:08:51,124 --> 00:08:54,160
Hey, there's my new
brother-in-law brother, now.

224
00:08:54,194 --> 00:08:55,928
Griffin, you and me
have to talk.

225
00:08:55,962 --> 00:08:57,263
What's up, blood?

226
00:08:57,297 --> 00:09:00,065
Nobody's dating nobody.
You understand?

227
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,200
Oh, don't worry, Jerome.

228
00:09:01,234 --> 00:09:03,335
I already gave
Chris the sex talk.

229
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:06,405
It's... awesome.

230
00:09:06,439 --> 00:09:08,174
Peter, you don't understand.

231
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,242
I don't want Pam
dating a white boy.

232
00:09:10,277 --> 00:09:12,178
What? Jerome.

233
00:09:12,212 --> 00:09:13,512
You're a racist.

234
00:09:13,547 --> 00:09:15,381
Black people
can't be racist.

235
00:09:15,415 --> 00:09:18,651
We can be way sexist,
but we ain't racist.

236
00:09:18,685 --> 00:09:20,386
Sure, black people
can be racist.

237
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,388
They gave Michelle Pfeiffer
such a hard time.

238
00:09:22,422 --> 00:09:24,390
She didn't pick that school;
they sent her there.

239
00:09:24,424 --> 00:09:25,524
Coolio had her back.

240
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,626
Look, I think if you
got to know us better,

241
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:28,794
you wouldn't have
any problem

242
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:30,296
with your daughter
dating one of us.

243
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,730
QUAGMIRE:
I'll date her.

244
00:09:31,765 --> 00:09:33,966
Look, why don't you and Pam
come over tomorrow night,

245
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,367
a-and you'll see
that white people

246
00:09:35,402 --> 00:09:37,203
are even better
than black people.

247
00:09:37,237 --> 00:09:38,671
Peter.
Y-Y-You know what I mean.

248
00:09:38,705 --> 00:09:40,439
They-they're equal.
Separate but equal.

249
00:09:40,473 --> 00:09:42,174
Peter.
Just equal.

250
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:44,009
All right, we'll
come to dinner.

251
00:09:44,044 --> 00:09:45,945
But I want you to know
I'm very skeptical

252
00:09:45,979 --> 00:09:47,413
about this whole thing.

253
00:09:47,447 --> 00:09:48,747
Oh, that's okay.
Hey, listen,

254
00:09:48,782 --> 00:09:51,417
I was skeptical about
traveling to Mexico.

255
00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:52,518
(flies buzzing)

256
00:09:52,552 --> 00:09:55,254
I took one step
outside the resort.

257
00:10:00,126 --> 00:10:02,161
Thanks for having us to
dinner, Mrs. Griffin.

258
00:10:02,195 --> 00:10:03,762
Oh, my pleasure, Pam.

259
00:10:03,797 --> 00:10:06,398
Yes. I, for one, say
this is long overdue.

260
00:10:06,433 --> 00:10:09,535
It's about time people of color
broke bread at this table.

261
00:10:09,569 --> 00:10:11,437
Broke bread? W-What?

262
00:10:11,471 --> 00:10:14,139
Who are you, St. Francis
of Assisi all of a sudden?

263
00:10:14,174 --> 00:10:16,408
Jerome, you have done
a wonderful job raising Pam

264
00:10:16,443 --> 00:10:18,210
to be a lovely
young woman.

265
00:10:18,245 --> 00:10:20,012
You say that like
you're surprised.

266
00:10:20,046 --> 00:10:21,347
I-I beg your pardon?

267
00:10:21,381 --> 00:10:23,582
Sounds like you're saying
a single black man

268
00:10:23,617 --> 00:10:25,618
can't raise a child
on his own.

269
00:10:25,652 --> 00:10:27,553
Yes, Lois, what
<i>are</i> you saying?

270
00:10:27,587 --> 00:10:29,755
You know, before I speak,
I like to ask myself,

271
00:10:29,789 --> 00:10:32,758
"Would Dr. King approve
of what I'm about to say?"

272
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:34,960
Most of the time,
I find that he would.

273
00:10:34,995 --> 00:10:37,963
Dad, I think Mrs. Griffin was
just giving you a compliment.

274
00:10:37,998 --> 00:10:39,565
Yeah, I was just trying to say

275
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:42,635
we all appreciate having you
in our home.

276
00:10:42,669 --> 00:10:45,304
Oh, so suddenly
we're all friends?

277
00:10:45,338 --> 00:10:47,306
Wait, w-we've always
been friends.

278
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,041
If we're friends,
what's my last name?

279
00:10:49,075 --> 00:10:50,042
Cool J?

280
00:10:50,076 --> 00:10:51,176
Where am I from?

281
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:52,645
The south part
of a large city?

282
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:53,913
Where'd I go to college?

283
00:10:53,947 --> 00:10:56,715
Does it air commercials
during daytime judge programs?

284
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,518
Peter, you only got two of
those three things right.

285
00:10:59,552 --> 00:11:01,654
Look, I know what
this is about.

286
00:11:01,688 --> 00:11:04,256
You're being all nice
just so your son can get

287
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,591
into my daughter's pants.

288
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:06,992
Dad, stop it.

289
00:11:07,027 --> 00:11:09,328
White guys don't want a
relationship with black women--

290
00:11:09,362 --> 00:11:11,263
they just want a notch
on their belt.

291
00:11:11,298 --> 00:11:13,299
You're a novelty
to these people.

292
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,466
"These people"?

293
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:17,136
This is the moment in the meal
when I stand up!

294
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,804
W-Wait a minute, "a novelty"?

295
00:11:18,838 --> 00:11:21,140
We used to date
before I met Peter.

296
00:11:21,174 --> 00:11:23,475
S-So what are white women
to black men?

297
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:26,979
A very pleasant page
in our memory books.

298
00:11:27,013 --> 00:11:28,247
Aw.

299
00:11:28,281 --> 00:11:30,082
Oh, yeah, that's right.
You banged my wife.

300
00:11:30,116 --> 00:11:31,417
She did? Huh.

301
00:11:31,451 --> 00:11:33,419
No wonder I had
so much room in there.

302
00:11:33,453 --> 00:11:35,287
Her womb was like one
of those places

303
00:11:35,322 --> 00:11:37,790
where they reconstruct
crashed airplanes.

304
00:11:37,824 --> 00:11:39,864
Look, Jerome, I-I know
you think we're all terrible,

305
00:11:39,893 --> 00:11:42,661
but white people have done a lot
of good things for the world.

306
00:11:42,696 --> 00:11:44,530
Oh, yeah? Like what?

307
00:11:44,564 --> 00:11:46,332
Well, I'll tell you!

You know what?
That song only made me

341
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,854
hate white people
even more.

342
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:17,322
What about
eight more verses?

343
00:13:17,357 --> 00:13:19,191
Let's go, Pam.
We're leaving.

344
00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:21,527
But, Dad,
Chris treats me really well.

345
00:13:21,561 --> 00:13:23,829
He gave me
this diamond necklace.

346
00:13:23,863 --> 00:13:25,631
That's my diamond necklace!

347
00:13:25,665 --> 00:13:27,499
Cool it. I'm trying to get laid.

348
00:13:27,534 --> 00:13:29,435
Look, this ain't
happening, Pam.

349
00:13:29,469 --> 00:13:31,303
Straight up.
You ain't swervin' with him,

350
00:13:31,337 --> 00:13:33,839
you ain't gonna shump-a-jump,
you're not hollerin' at him,

351
00:13:33,873 --> 00:13:35,808
you ain't his shorty
or his boo.

352
00:13:35,842 --> 00:13:38,277
Oh, my God, Lois, I think
he just summoned Candyman.

353
00:13:38,311 --> 00:13:39,812
You're a fool.

354
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:49,332
(door shuts)

355
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,234
I was hoping
they'd be darker.

356
00:13:56,825 --> 00:13:59,526
God, I miss Pam
so much.

357
00:13:59,561 --> 00:14:01,929
I don't think
I can live without her.

358
00:14:01,963 --> 00:14:04,365
It's okay, Chris.
Hey, here's someone your type.

359
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,500
(falsetto):
Whoo-wee, Chris! You're cute!

360
00:14:06,534 --> 00:14:08,168
Stewie, that's
Log Cabin.

361
00:14:08,203 --> 00:14:10,104
Uh, h-he gets the joke.

362
00:14:10,138 --> 00:14:12,106
I'm sorry, Chris.
Jerome just doesn't think

363
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,108
his daughter should date
a white guy.

364
00:14:14,142 --> 00:14:16,110
Black racism
is the biggest problem

365
00:14:16,144 --> 00:14:17,945
facing this country today.

366
00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:20,481
You know, I should go
over there and fight for Pam.

367
00:14:20,515 --> 00:14:22,016
Absolutely you should.

368
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:23,884
You should always fight
for what you believe in.

369
00:14:23,918 --> 00:14:25,452
Like Patrick Henry.

370
00:14:25,487 --> 00:14:28,422
Give me liberty
or give me death.

371
00:14:28,456 --> 00:14:29,790
(gunshot)

372
00:14:29,824 --> 00:14:31,458
Oh, that was easy.

373
00:14:31,493 --> 00:14:32,593
I know, right?

374
00:14:32,627 --> 00:14:34,695
Ryan wanted to give him liberty.

375
00:14:34,729 --> 00:14:37,064
You do the paperwork, Ryan.

376
00:14:40,302 --> 00:14:44,471
ANNOUNCER: <i>And now the HBO</i>
<i>original series,</i> Boys.

377
00:14:44,506 --> 00:14:46,540
Hey, sorry I slept
with that girl you liked.

378
00:14:46,574 --> 00:14:47,675
Eh, it's cool.

379
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:49,543
Did you walk around naked
after you had sex?

380
00:14:49,577 --> 00:14:51,879
What? No. No one
wants to see that.

381
00:14:51,913 --> 00:14:54,081
Isn't this time in our lives
so interesting?

382
00:14:54,115 --> 00:14:55,649
No.

383
00:14:55,684 --> 00:14:57,851
Griffin! Where the hell
is my daughter?

384
00:14:57,886 --> 00:15:00,954
She left me a note saying
she ran off with Chris.

385
00:15:00,989 --> 00:15:02,489
Oh, my God, Chris?

386
00:15:02,524 --> 00:15:04,992
That dirtbag hangs
around my daughter, too!

387
00:15:05,026 --> 00:15:06,527
I don't have time
for your nonsense.

388
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:07,995
I got to find
my daughter.

389
00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:10,197
Look, let me help you!
I'm great at finding stuff.

390
00:15:10,231 --> 00:15:11,999
Last night, I found
Lois's G-spot.

391
00:15:12,033 --> 00:15:14,068
LOIS: No, he didn't!
I didn't know she was home.

392
00:15:14,102 --> 00:15:16,337
I was able to please her
in other ways, though.

393
00:15:16,371 --> 00:15:18,772
LOIS: No!
Okay, let's just go.

394
00:15:22,544 --> 00:15:24,011
My dad's such a jerk.

395
00:15:24,045 --> 00:15:26,947
I'm glad we ran away.
Yeah.

396
00:15:26,981 --> 00:15:30,751
So... what do people do
in motels?

397
00:15:30,785 --> 00:15:32,419
They get naked.

398
00:15:32,454 --> 00:15:35,556
Okay, but all I know about sex
is from Internet porn,

399
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:38,659
so I'm very excited
to try buffering.

400
00:15:38,693 --> 00:15:40,794
(chuckles)
Then I'll leave you alone

401
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:42,896
to get undressed and
under the covers,

402
00:15:42,931 --> 00:15:44,898
and I'll be right back.

403
00:15:54,242 --> 00:15:56,810
Hey, I'm trying to sleep
and urinate here.

404
00:15:56,845 --> 00:15:58,612
Do you mind using
the other bed?

405
00:15:58,646 --> 00:15:59,680
Sorry.

406
00:15:59,714 --> 00:16:01,682
I was the cousin in <i>Vacation.</i>

407
00:16:01,716 --> 00:16:03,484
Yeah, I know who you are.

408
00:16:06,588 --> 00:16:08,222
How do I look?

409
00:16:08,256 --> 00:16:10,290
Oh, God. Are we at that part
of the relationship?

410
00:16:10,325 --> 00:16:11,692
You look fine!

411
00:16:11,726 --> 00:16:14,228
Pam, this may come
as a surprise to you,

412
00:16:14,262 --> 00:16:16,964
but I am not
an experienced lover.

413
00:16:16,998 --> 00:16:19,566
Don't worry. It's my
first time, too.

414
00:16:19,601 --> 00:16:22,369
Wow, I guess everybody
has a first time.

415
00:16:22,404 --> 00:16:24,671
Even Maverick from <i>Top Gun.</i>

416
00:16:24,706 --> 00:16:26,707
Thank you, pretty lady!

417
00:16:31,846 --> 00:16:35,215
So, all those other black
drivers that you're nodding at,

418
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,817
do you know them?

419
00:16:36,851 --> 00:16:38,852
(siren wailing)

420
00:16:42,724 --> 00:16:44,024
Ah, man.

421
00:16:44,058 --> 00:16:45,893
Look, relax. We'll just
tell him the truth.

422
00:16:45,927 --> 00:16:47,227
We're cruising
around town

423
00:16:47,262 --> 00:16:49,897
looking for a sexually active
14-year-old boy.

424
00:16:49,931 --> 00:16:52,633
You have any idea how
fast you were going?

425
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:54,468
I was going the speed limit,
Officer.

426
00:16:54,502 --> 00:16:55,569
He was.

427
00:16:55,603 --> 00:16:57,104
Are you here against
your will, sir?

428
00:16:57,138 --> 00:16:59,773
If you're asking if I'd rather
be at the zoo, then yes.

429
00:16:59,808 --> 00:17:01,375
Maybe you step
out of the car

430
00:17:01,409 --> 00:17:03,410
and we see if you've
been drinking.

431
00:17:03,445 --> 00:17:05,145
(sighs)

432
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:09,450
I'm too fat to be
in the car by myself.

433
00:17:12,487 --> 00:17:15,589
The police pull me over for
made-up violations all the time.

434
00:17:15,623 --> 00:17:18,392
You don't know what it's like
to be treated like a criminal.

435
00:17:18,426 --> 00:17:20,060
What's it like?
Bad.

436
00:17:20,094 --> 00:17:21,628
Whoa.

437
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,897
I've never broken a law
in my life, Peter.

438
00:17:23,932 --> 00:17:25,732
I'm a 42-year-old man,

439
00:17:25,767 --> 00:17:27,534
I own a business,
I pay my taxes,

440
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:29,436
and yet I got to deal
with this crap

441
00:17:29,471 --> 00:17:31,138
every time
I step outside my house.

442
00:17:31,172 --> 00:17:35,108
Makes me so damn angry, I don't
know what to do with myself.

443
00:17:35,143 --> 00:17:36,510
Well, you should be like me.

444
00:17:36,544 --> 00:17:39,279
Whenever I get angry,
I go do some <i>Footloose</i> dancing.

Forgive me for being

Dad, I'm fine.

467
00:18:59,861 --> 00:19:01,461
Don't worry.
Nothing happened.

468
00:19:01,496 --> 00:19:05,265
I tucked it between my legs
as a joke and then it got stuck.

to be a little
suspicious of Whitey.

473
00:19:15,777 --> 00:19:17,744
Thank you
for understanding, Peter.

474
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:20,213
Jerome is right. White is
white, black is black--

475
00:19:20,248 --> 00:19:22,215
got to keep the races
completely separate.

476
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,152
That... wasn't
exactly my point.

477
00:19:25,186 --> 00:19:26,687
Chris, from now on,
I don't want you

478
00:19:26,721 --> 00:19:27,988
talking to any
black people.

479
00:19:28,022 --> 00:19:30,290
How the hell am I supposed
to get through airport security?

480
00:19:30,325 --> 00:19:31,625
We'll figure it out.

481
00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:33,293
It's the least we
can do for Jerome.

482
00:19:33,328 --> 00:19:35,162
Isn't that
right, Jerome?

483
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:43,236
Is that the lesson
you want me to learn, Dad?

484
00:19:43,271 --> 00:19:45,439
No, baby.

485
00:19:45,473 --> 00:19:48,108
You know, Peter,
maybe I did overreact.

486
00:19:48,142 --> 00:19:50,177
Just 'cause I've experienced
some hard times

487
00:19:50,211 --> 00:19:53,513
doesn't mean this generation
can't teach us a thing or two.

488
00:19:53,548 --> 00:19:55,716
(sighs)
All right,

489
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,618
if these kids want to date,

490
00:19:57,652 --> 00:19:59,831
then I guess
that's okay with me.

It takes a man with
a crazy big hog

493
00:20:06,394 --> 00:20:07,750
to admit when
he's wrong.

494
00:20:07,896 --> 00:20:10,598
Thanks, Peter.

Hey, Jerome, you want to
help me kill Randy Quaid?

497
00:20:15,742 --> 00:20:16,873
Who?
