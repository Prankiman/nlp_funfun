Charlie, don't forget
what happened to the boy

15
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:47,341
- who got everything he ever wanted.
- What?

16
00:00:47,373 --> 00:00:49,075
He lived happily ever after.

17
00:00:49,108 --> 00:00:51,010
But he did have to earn it.

18
00:00:51,043 --> 00:00:52,179
Hint, hint.

19
00:00:52,212 --> 00:00:53,412
Do it, Charlie!

20
00:00:53,445 --> 00:00:55,915
I'm not going back
to that four-person bed!

21
00:00:55,948 --> 00:00:57,817
Hell, I'll do it, if you want!

00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,486
No! It has to be a child!

What did he just say?

24
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,655
Brian, this does not seem appropriate

25
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:04,091
to watch in front of the baby.

26
00:01:04,123 --> 00:01:05,524

Uh, this one, too.

Also wet.

31
00:01:14,534 --> 00:01:16,270
Huh. This one's dry,

32
00:01:16,302 --> 00:01:18,838
but the back of the
seat in front of it is wet.

Uch. All they're doing

is announcing that they play the kazoo,

46
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:47,867
and then asking if others
also play the kazoo.

47
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,435
This doesn't seem so bad.

48
00:01:49,468 --> 00:01:51,237
I mean, after all,
it's a song for babies.

49
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,710
Yeah, but-but that's the thing.

50
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:55,608
Baby songs never tackle
real baby issues.

51
00:01:55,642 --> 00:01:57,644
You know, like... like loud noises.

52
00:01:57,645 --> 00:01:58,543
Or teething.

53
00:01:58,544 --> 00:02:00,814
Or when Dad uses me as a lumbar pillow.

54
00:02:00,846 --> 00:02:02,381
- Eh...
- Ow.

55

- Ow. Ow.

00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,152
Ow.

57
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,285
Ow.

58
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:08,922
This thing works better in the car.

59
00:02:08,954 --> 00:02:10,589
Well, how could they
address baby issues?

60
00:02:10,623 --> 00:02:12,492
Children's songs are written by adults.

61
00:02:12,524 --> 00:02:15,295
And, dollars to donuts, white adults.

62
00:02:15,327 --> 00:02:17,684
I-I.. Who-who are
you mad at, Brian?

63
00:02:17,684 --> 00:02:18,874
Uch, how much time you got?

64
00:02:18,908 --> 00:02:20,184
Not enough for that, but you're right.

65
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:21,843
If you want a song a baby'll like,

66
00:02:21,876 --> 00:02:23,413
you've got to get a baby to write it.

67
00:02:23,445 --> 00:02:24,846
Well, call John Mayer.

68
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,815
He's a big, fat baby.

69
00:02:25,848 --> 00:02:27,717
No, I'll do it, and you can help.

70
00:02:27,749 --> 00:02:28,818
Well, I... I did write

71
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,819
a musical about Alexander Hamilton.

72
00:02:30,852 --> 00:02:31,830
Not-not that one,

73
00:02:31,854 --> 00:02:33,155
but, uh, sure, I'm in.

74
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:34,157
Ooh, I'm excited.

75
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:35,257
This'll be great.

76
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,759
And those guys back at
the factory can suck it.

77
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:39,661
I'm gonna get out of this place one day.

78
00:02:39,695 --> 00:02:40,697
Hey, Butch.

79
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,863
Get a load of Stewie.

80
00:02:41,897 --> 00:02:43,600
He says he's gonna get out of here.

81
00:02:45,201 --> 00:02:46,836
You don't know me, man. I'm different.

82
00:02:46,868 --> 00:02:47,869
I got ideas.

83
00:02:47,903 --> 00:02:49,706
Hey, Butch, you hear that?

84
00:02:49,738 --> 00:02:50,839
Stewie's got ideas.

85
00:02:50,873 --> 00:02:51,840
Shut up!

86
00:02:51,874 --> 00:02:53,276
I'm gonna go across that river

87
00:02:53,308 --> 00:02:55,177
and make it to the city
on the other side.

88
00:02:55,211 --> 00:02:56,612
I'm gonna be a singer.

89
00:02:56,646 --> 00:02:58,947
Bublé over here says
he's gonna be a singer.

90
00:02:58,981 --> 00:03:01,117
Hey, Bublé, I got a
tune for you to sing.

91
00:03:01,149 --> 00:03:05,288
It's called "Get Your Ass Back
on the Forklift, Lunch is Over".

92
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,390
Hey, Stewie, don't listen to those guys.

93
00:03:08,423 --> 00:03:09,625
Follow your heart.

94
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:10,626
Shut up, Butch.

95
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:11,737
You're the loser of this crew.

96
00:03:11,761 --> 00:03:12,762
Hey guys, you hear that?

97
00:03:12,795 --> 00:03:14,696
Butch told me to follow my heart.

98
00:03:21,937 --> 00:03:25,107
Dad, can I have 50 bucks
for a shamrock tattoo?

99
00:03:25,141 --> 00:03:26,242
It's time.

100
00:03:26,274 --> 00:03:27,552
All right, but make sure you get it

101
00:03:27,576 --> 00:03:28,645
where everyone can see.

102
00:03:28,677 --> 00:03:29,645
Hold on, Peter.

103
00:03:29,678 --> 00:03:31,580
I-if Chris wants money for something,

104
00:03:31,613 --> 00:03:33,783
maybe it's time he got a part-time job.

105
00:03:33,815 --> 00:03:35,884
He could mow lawns or-or babysit.

106
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:36,885
I can't work.

107
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:37,886
I'm too young.

108
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,221
Well, Will Smith's little kid

109
00:03:39,255 --> 00:03:40,423
works as a movie star,

110
00:03:40,456 --> 00:03:42,134
even though he looks
like a wet baby horse.

111
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:44,459
All right, I suppose I could get a job.

112
00:03:44,493 --> 00:03:46,296
Well, maybe even my old job as the guy

113
00:03:46,328 --> 00:03:47,563
racing through an airport

114
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:49,432
at the end of a romantic comedy.

115
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:52,334
Taxi! Taxi!

116
00:03:53,535 --> 00:03:55,170
Hey. Are you crazy?

117
00:03:55,203 --> 00:03:56,806
Crazy for love.

118
00:03:56,838 --> 00:03:58,574
The most amazing girl I've ever met

119
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:00,443

120

121
00:04:14,657 --> 00:04:16,358
What the hell's going on?

122
00:04:16,392 --> 00:04:17,659
This guy's in love.

123
00:04:17,693 --> 00:04:18,661
Is she worth it?

124
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:21,029
She's a once-in-a-life-time girl.

125
00:04:21,063 --> 00:04:22,632
I'll give you an escort.

126
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,016
No charge.

127
00:04:32,007 --> 00:04:34,277
Final boarding call for Ashley's flight

128
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,846
to stuffy New England college.
Final boarding.

129
00:04:36,878 --> 00:04:38,780
Ooh, whoa, whoa, whoa, child.

130
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:40,148
What's the hurry?

131
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:42,217
The love of my life, that's what.

132
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,152
We got a code Romeo.

133
00:04:44,185 --> 00:04:46,856
Repeat, code Romeo.

134
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:48,624
If you get there on time,

135
00:04:48,657 --> 00:04:50,493
there's an extra 50 in it for you.

136
00:04:50,525 --> 00:04:52,494
I love this job!

137
00:04:56,866 --> 00:04:58,735
Ashley, wait!

138
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:04,673
I wouldn't miss this for all
the rush hour fares in Bigtown.

139
00:05:04,707 --> 00:05:07,409
Chris, you came. Oh, my God!

140
00:05:07,443 --> 00:05:09,445
Let me get my grandma.

141
00:05:11,546 --> 00:05:12,647
Chris?

142
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:15,051
Ashley. I love you.

143
00:05:20,623 --> 00:05:22,592
Oh, you're groaning at me?

144
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:25,395
You paid $19 to fly Spirit Air.

145
00:05:25,428 --> 00:05:27,596
You get what you get.

146
00:05:31,534 --> 00:05:33,503
All right, Brian,
I've written a few songs,

147
00:05:33,536 --> 00:05:36,038
all about stuff babies
actually care about.

148
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,739
No more rainbows and unicorns.

149
00:05:37,772 --> 00:05:39,174
Real baby issues.

150
00:05:39,207 --> 00:05:40,743
Right, like heartworm and parvo?

151
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:42,010
No, baby stuff.

152
00:05:42,044 --> 00:05:43,512
Oh, oh, human babies.

153
00:05:43,546 --> 00:05:45,782
I didn't... I didn't realize
there was an agenda.

154
00:05:45,815 --> 00:05:47,582
Okay, look, just pay attention.

155
00:05:47,616 --> 00:05:50,419
♪ Momma liked to party

Stewie, that's good.
Hey, can I write one?

161
00:06:02,664 --> 00:06:04,299
Yeah, we need as many as we can.

162
00:06:04,332 --> 00:06:06,635
Our first gig is Saturday.
It's a birthday party.

Wow, already?

00:06:07,936 --> 00:06:09,438
How'd you book a gig so fast?

165
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:11,106
Easy. I figured out the perfect way

166
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,575
to get the word out
to middle-aged moms.

167
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:17,046
Musical entertainment,
available for parties.

168
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:20,049
Musical entertainment,
available for parties.

169
00:06:20,082 --> 00:06:22,851
Hey. Where you drinking that Chardonnay?

170
00:06:28,022 --> 00:06:29,724
Oh, hey, Chris,
how's the job hunt going?

171
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:32,294
Terrible. I can't find a job anywhere.

172
00:06:32,327 --> 00:06:34,162
A lot of people seem to be turned off

173
00:06:34,195 --> 00:06:35,832
by my dishonorable discharge.

174
00:06:35,865 --> 00:06:37,066
What, from the Army?

175
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:38,301
No, it's a euphemism.

176
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:39,601
Oh, yucky.

177
00:06:39,635 --> 00:06:42,137
Uh, you guys, I need help
unloading the groceries.

178
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:45,474
My undiagnosed mom injury is flaring up.

179
00:06:46,942 --> 00:06:48,611
These little things of applesauce

180
00:06:48,644 --> 00:06:50,580
better not be for desserts.

181
00:06:50,613 --> 00:06:52,615
Go to hell, Glenn Quagmire!

182
00:06:52,647 --> 00:06:54,983
I'm sorry, but Mondays are Asian only.

183
00:06:55,017 --> 00:06:56,419
Why is your last name Wong?

184
00:06:56,452 --> 00:06:58,187
It's my married name.

185
00:06:58,219 --> 00:07:00,322
Now I see why you're here.

186
00:07:01,322 --> 00:07:02,692
Geez, what was that about?

187
00:07:02,724 --> 00:07:04,125
Ah, a little scheduling mix-up.

188
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:06,295
I am just so busy,
I-I don't have any time

189
00:07:06,327 --> 00:07:08,164
to organize my own life.

190
00:07:08,197 --> 00:07:09,765
Wait a minute, what if you had someone

191
00:07:09,798 --> 00:07:12,268
to help keep you organized?
Chris is looking for work.

192
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:14,135
Maybe he can help you
out, be your assistant.

193
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:15,337
Huh, maybe.

194
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,772
You have any references?

195
00:07:16,805 --> 00:07:19,675
Uh, "cowabunga," "schwing,"
"yada, yada, yada."

196
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:21,142
Those are pretty good references.

197
00:07:21,176 --> 00:07:22,678
You're hired.

198
00:07:25,714 --> 00:07:27,350
Look at that. Look at the cake.

199
00:07:27,382 --> 00:07:30,019
"Happy Birthday Charlie
and Uncle Craig."

200
00:07:30,051 --> 00:07:32,787
And Uncle Craig's written
in a different color.

201
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,657
Oh, poor Uncle Craig.

202
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,959
Hey, is that your
ex-girlfriend, Olivia?

203
00:07:36,991 --> 00:07:38,326
God, what's she doing here?

204
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:39,995
She was always such a nightmare.

205
00:07:42,865 --> 00:07:44,800
Olivia?! Oh, my God, do I look okay?

206
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:46,969
I hate this shirt.
Switch shirts. Switch shirts!

207
00:07:47,002 --> 00:07:49,839
Stewie? Oh, I thought that was you.

208
00:07:49,871 --> 00:07:52,407
Hey, Olivia, hey, what brings you here?

209
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,142
Oh, the birthday boy and I met

210
00:07:54,176 --> 00:07:56,979
at Burt Reynolds' acting
camp in Jupiter, Florida.

211
00:07:57,012 --> 00:07:58,748
Well, I'm glad to hear
you're still acting.

212
00:07:58,781 --> 00:08:01,384
You know, the last time
I saw you, you were...

213
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:02,274
Burning in a cardboard house?

214
00:08:02,298 --> 00:08:03,661
Yeah, burning in a cardboard
house, yeah.

215
00:08:03,685 --> 00:08:05,596
Uh, hey, listen, uh, I don't
know if you've heard,

216
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,322
but we're the entertainment.

217
00:08:07,356 --> 00:08:10,392
Aw, that's good. Good for you.

218
00:08:10,426 --> 00:08:12,161
Okay, great to see you.

219
00:08:12,193 --> 00:08:13,662
Come on, Stewie, it's not about her.

220
00:08:13,695 --> 00:08:16,332
It's about those six
children watching and the spazzy kid

221
00:08:16,365 --> 00:08:17,609
who's just waiting for the snakes.

222
00:08:17,633 --> 00:08:19,736
Bring out the snakes!

223
00:08:22,071 --> 00:08:24,840
It's a hot crowd, have fun out there.

224
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:27,509
I'm gonna go feed everything
in my van to each other.

225
00:08:27,543 --> 00:08:29,845
Okay, kids, if
everyone's done washing their hands

226
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:32,213
from the snakes, we
have some fun music for y...

227
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:34,250
No climbing on the boat!

228
00:08:34,283 --> 00:08:37,287
Okay, now please welcome
Red Shirt Blue Shirt.

229
00:08:39,087 --> 00:08:40,755
All right, we're Red Shirt Blue Shirt,

230
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:43,693
and here's a song we call
"Mommy and Daddy's Room."

231
00:08:43,726 --> 00:08:45,827
And we think it's one
you can all relate to.

242

My God, did you hear 'em,
Stewie? We're a hit.

243
00:09:16,258 --> 00:09:17,827
We got to go out and celebrate.

244
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,428
Oh, he can't go out with you tonight.

245
00:09:19,461 --> 00:09:20,763
He's got a date with me.

246
00:09:20,795 --> 00:09:22,397
Really? Awesome.

247
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,299
Brian, I can't go. I'm not feeling well.

248
00:09:24,332 --> 00:09:25,809
Stewie, I've been
standing here the whole time.

249
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,345
But, you know-you know
what, that's fine.

250
00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:30,406
I'll just go have a dog-style
celebration by myself.

251
00:09:30,438 --> 00:09:32,073
Yeah!

252
00:09:32,106 --> 00:09:33,608
Awesome time!

253
00:09:33,641 --> 00:09:35,477
This is very fun for me!

254
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,611
- Hey!
- Oh, hey!

255
00:09:36,645 --> 00:09:39,136
- This is fun, right?
- The best!

256
00:09:39,305 --> 00:09:40,510
And me, too!

257
00:09:45,596 --> 00:09:47,432
Great crowd, babe.

258
00:09:47,465 --> 00:09:48,834
What are... What is this?

259
00:09:48,867 --> 00:09:51,137
Oh, Olivia's president of our fan club.

260
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,838
She's also doing half the band.

261
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,306
Do you even know what that means?

262
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:56,908
Uh, let's just say I couldn't
toddle right for a week.

263
00:09:56,941 --> 00:09:58,176
Okay, you don't.

264
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,450
All right, if you'll excuse me,

265
00:09:59,478 --> 00:10:00,979
I have a poo poo diaper.

266
00:10:02,348 --> 00:10:04,291
You really think this
Olivia thing is a good idea?

267
00:10:04,315 --> 00:10:05,283
Why wouldn't it be?

268
00:10:05,316 --> 00:10:06,527
I don't know. It just seems like

269
00:10:06,551 --> 00:10:08,454
it always ends badly for you two.

270
00:10:08,487 --> 00:10:10,589
And it can be tricky working with an ex.

271
00:10:10,622 --> 00:10:12,491
Look at Kermit and Miss Piggy.

272
00:10:12,523 --> 00:10:13,825
How are you feeling, Miss Piggy?

273
00:10:13,859 --> 00:10:15,269
I heard you called in sick yesterday.

274
00:10:15,293 --> 00:10:17,362
Yeah, I had a frog in my throat.

275
00:10:17,396 --> 00:10:18,798
Right, Kermie?

276
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,166
Eh? Right?

277
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:22,335
Please stop drinking.

278
00:10:26,372 --> 00:10:28,940
Okay, Chris, I think you're
gonna be a great assistant.

279
00:10:28,974 --> 00:10:30,484
Your paperwork appears to be in order,

280
00:10:30,508 --> 00:10:31,853
but before we get started, do you own

281
00:10:31,877 --> 00:10:33,813
a pair of rubber boots
that you'd have to wear

282
00:10:33,845 --> 00:10:35,147
if you worked on a fishing boat?

283
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,382
Uh, no, I don't think so.

284
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,484
All right, I guess
it'll be a light day today,

285
00:10:38,517 --> 00:10:39,828
but tomorrow you
should come wearing those.

286
00:10:39,852 --> 00:10:41,053
Okay, got it.

287
00:10:41,085 --> 00:10:43,188
Now, the first thing I need
you to do every morning

288
00:10:43,221 --> 00:10:45,857
is punch me in the stomach
because I'm a bad person.

289
00:10:45,891 --> 00:10:47,660
Is this a trick?

290
00:10:47,692 --> 00:10:49,627
It's the furthest thing
from a trick. Go ahead.

291
00:10:49,661 --> 00:10:50,963
And it should be pretty hard,

292
00:10:50,995 --> 00:10:53,198
I'm a worse person than you think.

293
00:10:53,232 --> 00:10:55,000
Okay, that's really good.

294
00:10:55,032 --> 00:10:58,570
Now I need you to call
Time Warner about my cable bill.

295
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:04,243
All right, this one is for
all the mommies out there.

296
00:11:04,276 --> 00:11:07,179
This is what we're
really saying when we're crying.

Even Broken Arm Coyote with Washboard.

319
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,285
Hey, let's keep this party rolling.

320
00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:11,911
I'll go get us another badly-scratched

321
00:12:11,944 --> 00:12:14,647
plastic pitcher of soda.

322
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,248
Ugh, finally, he's doing
something useful.

323
00:12:17,282 --> 00:12:18,617
What? What do you mean?

324
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,953
Nothing. It's just,
you write all the songs,

325
00:12:20,985 --> 00:12:23,655
you've got a better
voice, you've got the sweet bod...

326
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:26,158
Oh, my God, babe.

327
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:29,228
Plus, you've got all the cool
catchphrases like "damn you all"

328
00:12:29,261 --> 00:12:31,464
or "what the dude" or whatever.

329
00:12:31,497 --> 00:12:32,574
Uh, it-it's "deuce." But, uh,

330
00:12:32,598 --> 00:12:34,274
but yeah, you're-you're
right, it... I-I do.

331
00:12:34,298 --> 00:12:35,800
Does it-does it sound through the mic

332
00:12:35,834 --> 00:12:38,103
like I'm saying
"dude"? Should it be "dude"?

333
00:12:38,136 --> 00:12:40,415
Meanwhile, everyone thinks
Brian is the star of the group.

334
00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:41,640
Who thinks that?

335
00:12:41,672 --> 00:12:42,941
I don't know. I'm just saying,

336
00:12:42,974 --> 00:12:44,985
after every show, the fans
are always petting Brian,

337
00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:46,412
and not you.

338
00:12:46,445 --> 00:12:47,988
No one's allowed to
pet me. It's illegal.

339
00:12:48,012 --> 00:12:49,348
I just hate to see Brian

340
00:12:49,381 --> 00:12:52,351
getting all the attention
that you deserve.

341
00:12:52,383 --> 00:12:54,419
You should really watch your back.

342
00:12:54,453 --> 00:12:57,323
Wow, it's hard to believe
Brian would betray me.

343
00:12:57,355 --> 00:13:00,158
I mean, he was there for
me when I hit rock bottom.

344
00:13:00,191 --> 00:13:01,594
See, Brian?

345
00:13:01,627 --> 00:13:03,262
That's a rock bottom.

346
00:13:03,295 --> 00:13:04,597
Thanks for being here for that.

347
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:07,365
Now get out of here, we're about
to drink some Chardonnay.

348
00:13:12,403 --> 00:13:14,349
Chris, could you please get
Hannah a thank-you basket

349
00:13:14,373 --> 00:13:15,617
and schedule her next appointment?

350
00:13:15,641 --> 00:13:17,476
I'd like to see her again in two weeks.

351
00:13:17,508 --> 00:13:19,878
Of course. Mr. Quagmire can fit in you

352
00:13:19,912 --> 00:13:21,479
at 3:00 a week from Thursday.

353
00:13:21,512 --> 00:13:22,514
That works.

354
00:13:22,547 --> 00:13:24,315
And you know to fast the night before?

355
00:13:24,349 --> 00:13:25,450
Yup.

356
00:13:25,484 --> 00:13:27,394
And would you like to leave
your panties in the fishbowl

357
00:13:27,418 --> 00:13:29,421
for a chance to win a free lunch?

358
00:13:32,423 --> 00:13:33,391
Good luck.

359
00:13:33,425 --> 00:13:35,227
When you gonna do that drawing anyway?

360
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:37,495
Oh, there's no drawing, I just
like smelling the bowl.

361
00:13:37,528 --> 00:13:39,464
You know, you're doing
a great job, Chris.

362
00:13:39,498 --> 00:13:42,066
Why don't you jerk
the rest of the day off.

363
00:13:42,099 --> 00:13:43,835
Man, this is the best job ever.

364
00:13:43,868 --> 00:13:47,038
And to think I almost took
that pop-up restaurant gig.

365
00:13:48,105 --> 00:13:50,041
- Hi, you hungry?!
- Aah!

366
00:13:59,685 --> 00:14:00,986
Check, check, Malia.

367
00:14:01,018 --> 00:14:02,220
Check, Obama.

368
00:14:02,253 --> 00:14:04,056
Check, check, check, Malia, Obama.

369
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:05,566
All right, that's a creepy mic check.

370
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,710
Let's just do a quick
run-through of "Little Brother."

371
00:14:09,927 --> 00:14:13,865
♪ I want a little brother ♪

372
00:14:13,898 --> 00:14:16,568
♪ On second thought ♪

373
00:14:16,602 --> 00:14:18,871
♪ I think I'd ♪

374
00:14:18,903 --> 00:14:21,272
♪ Kill him dead. ♪

375
00:14:21,306 --> 00:14:22,941
Could-could we just cut Brian's mic?

376
00:14:22,974 --> 00:14:25,277
His humming sounds like
my table's ready at Chili's.

377
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,844
Stewie, what the hell is your problem?

378
00:14:26,878 --> 00:14:29,248
I'll tell you what my problem
is: I'm doing all the work

379
00:14:29,281 --> 00:14:30,748
and you're just riding my coattails.

380
00:14:30,782 --> 00:14:32,292
What are you talking about?
I'm just as big a part

381
00:14:32,316 --> 00:14:33,451
of this group as you are.

382
00:14:33,484 --> 00:14:34,954
Oh, really? You're writing about

383
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:37,389
all your authentic baby experiences?

384
00:14:37,421 --> 00:14:38,923
You asked me to do this with you.

385
00:14:38,956 --> 00:14:40,124
Why you being such a dick?

386
00:14:40,157 --> 00:14:42,728
Because I lost the baby!

387
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:44,063
What was that?

388
00:14:44,095 --> 00:14:46,397
I don't know, he saw that
in a movie or something.

389
00:14:46,431 --> 00:14:48,300
Brian, this seems as good a time as any.

390
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:51,203
I think it's time to talk about
your future with the band.

391
00:14:51,235 --> 00:14:52,437
Are you serious?

392
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,472
You're actually
kicking me out of the band?

393
00:14:54,506 --> 00:14:55,908
Not at all. In fact,

394
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,743
I think you and I
should kick Stewie out.

395
00:14:57,776 --> 00:14:59,545
And I'll take his place.

396
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:02,257
- What?
- Bring out the snakes!

397
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:04,235
Does he just come to all of our shows?

398
00:15:09,726 --> 00:15:11,628
So, you want to fire Stewie

399
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,296
and be Red Shirt Blue Shirt with me?

400
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,698
Absolutely.

401
00:15:14,731 --> 00:15:17,034
You're the whole reason
the fans even like the band.

402
00:15:17,067 --> 00:15:18,835
Kids love dogs.

403
00:15:18,867 --> 00:15:21,037
Besides, we've both seen
what Stewie's become:

404
00:15:21,071 --> 00:15:23,340
an impossible diva.

405
00:15:23,372 --> 00:15:24,974
Yeah, but he's my friend.

406
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,209
Yeah, well, your friend

407
00:15:26,242 --> 00:15:28,844
has been talking about
kicking you out of the band.

408
00:15:28,877 --> 00:15:30,847
Wait, what? He has?

409
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,749
And I don't know if
you've considered this,

410
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:34,917
but the clock is ticking
on Stewie's cuteness.

411
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:36,086
Huh. I guess you're right.

412
00:15:36,118 --> 00:15:38,154
I mean, I wouldn't be
surprised if he ends up

413
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:41,058
looking like an exact
mash-up of Lois and Peter.

414
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,327
Groceries.

415
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:47,664
Hey. I had a thought about
our costumes for today's show.

416
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:50,000
I could wear a shirt
that's both red and blue,

417
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:52,102
and you can do spin art
with all the wussy kids

418
00:15:52,135 --> 00:15:53,937
who are afraid to go on rides.

419
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,213
Yeah? Well, how about this, Stewie?

420
00:15:55,237 --> 00:15:57,006
- You're fired.
- Pardon?

421
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,443
That's right. Olivia's
taking your place in the band.

422
00:15:59,476 --> 00:16:02,044
You are looking at the new
Red Shirt Blue Shirt.

423
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:05,048
What the dude? Uhp, you know
what, "deuce" was right.

424
00:16:05,081 --> 00:16:06,958
Come on, Brian. You and I
should probably rehearse.

425
00:16:06,982 --> 00:16:08,952
We've got a show in 20 minutes.

426
00:16:08,985 --> 00:16:11,455
Fine, go ahead! It's
not gonna be the same!

427
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:14,624
Like Cheers wasn't the same when
they brought in Kirstie Alley.

428
00:16:14,658 --> 00:16:16,360
Norm!

429
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,262
No, I'm-I'm Rebecca.

430
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:26,736
Meg, do you know how
to use Microsoft Excel?

431
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,371
Yeah. I'm actually pretty good.

432
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:31,140
Yeah, you would. Dork.

433
00:16:31,174 --> 00:16:34,778
But I do need to make that
spreadsheet or I'm fired.

434
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,579
Oh, my God.

435
00:16:36,612 --> 00:16:38,982
Peter, our dishwasher
is full of sex toys.

436
00:16:39,015 --> 00:16:40,817
Oh, yeah, Chris put those in there.

437
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,919
It's for his job. He's
workin' for Quagmire now.

438
00:16:42,952 --> 00:16:45,555
He's washing sex toys for Quagmire?

439
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,491
Not just that. He also takes pictures

440
00:16:47,523 --> 00:16:49,959
of Quagmire's genitals
to track sore growth.

441
00:16:49,992 --> 00:16:51,962
So, brace yourself when you open iPhoto.

442
00:16:51,994 --> 00:16:53,763
It's on the "Griffin Family" account.

443
00:16:53,797 --> 00:16:56,165
Peter, my parents have access to that.

444
00:16:56,199 --> 00:16:59,068
What's wrong with this worm?

445
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,670
And you knew about this?

446
00:17:00,703 --> 00:17:02,972
How could you let him
do this disgusting stuff?

447
00:17:03,005 --> 00:17:05,341
What? You're the one who
wanted Chris to get a job.

448
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,844
Yeah, like mowing lawns
or trimming bushes.

449
00:17:07,876 --> 00:17:10,681
Oh, he's doing one of those.

450
00:17:10,713 --> 00:17:11,914
That's it.

451
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,817
I'm calling Quagmire right now
and putting an end to this.

452
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,456
You have reached Glenn Quagmire.

453
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,925
Neither he nor his assistant
is available.

454
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,861
To schedule a liaison, press one.

455
00:17:24,894 --> 00:17:27,030
To cancel a liaison, press two.

456
00:17:27,062 --> 00:17:29,665
If you're calling to report
a pregnancy, please fill out

457
00:17:29,699 --> 00:17:32,936
our online form, and we will
mail you a check for $180.

458
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,337
Thank you, and have a giggity day.

459
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,939
Chris, this is your mother.

460
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:40,210

00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,645
That was great. They loved us.

473
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,847
Yeah, I guess, but did
you see what I saw?

474
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,081
That kid with the cane?

475
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:21,017
Yeah, what do you think
is wrong with him?

476
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:23,052
No, Stewie was out there.

477
00:18:23,086 --> 00:18:24,587
- So?
- So?

478
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,255
We're singing a song he wrote.

479
00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:28,224
This whole thing was his idea.

480
00:18:28,258 --> 00:18:29,826
Brian, don't mess this up.

481
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,028
We've got a good thing going.

482
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,996
I-I hate to tell
you this, but I'm afraid

483
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,331
Red Shirt Blue Shirt is done.

484
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:37,099
I can't do this. I'm out.

485
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:38,835
I don't care. I don't need you.

486
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:42,105
I can get a hundred dogs
to fit that stupid blue shirt.

487
00:18:42,137 --> 00:18:43,572
You're a monster.

488
00:18:43,606 --> 00:18:46,108
Like Frankenstein, when
he became a loan officer.

489
00:18:46,142 --> 00:18:49,011
So, I'm looking for money
to open a small business.

490
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,580
We plan to sell antique lamps.

491
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,848
Handmade blankets.

492
00:18:54,116 --> 00:18:55,351
And pitchforks.

493
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:05,228
Chris, there you are. We need to talk.

494
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,762
What, are you walkin' a horse?

495
00:19:06,796 --> 00:19:08,198
Did Quagmire get a horse?

496
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:09,732
Oh no, here we go.

497
00:19:09,766 --> 00:19:10,967
I want a horse!

498
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,568
Peter, it's not a horse.

499
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:14,203
Chris, what the hell is that?

500
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:16,706
Oh, this is Mr. Quagmire's horse gimp.

501
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,040
What is a "horse gimp"?

502
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,544
It's a sexual fetishist
who derives erotic pleasure

503
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,878
from dressing in horse-themed
leather gear.

504
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,548
Want to see me feed him a carrot?

505
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,081
- Absolutely not.
- Hell yes.

506
00:19:26,115 --> 00:19:28,585
Chris, this is no job for a teenage boy.

507
00:19:28,617 --> 00:19:30,619
You have to quit right now.

508
00:19:30,653 --> 00:19:33,222
I can't quit. I'm actually
good at this job.

509
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,990
Plus, I'm making decent money.

510
00:19:35,023 --> 00:19:36,334
You could work at the pharmacy.

511
00:19:36,358 --> 00:19:37,593
Quiet, Triscuit!

512
00:19:37,626 --> 00:19:39,895
Ooh, hook me to the plow!

513
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:42,398
Chris, I have $1,100 in a
paint can in the garage.

514
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:44,472
Just take that, and we'll
never speak of this again.

515
00:19:44,501 --> 00:19:45,734
Okay.

516
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:49,005
Great. Now let's all go home.

517
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:51,708
Well, that's what I get
for horsing around.

518
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,178
Ah, your joke wasn't funny enough.

519
00:20:00,215 --> 00:20:01,650
Stewie?

520
00:20:01,683 --> 00:20:03,286
Oh, hello, Brian.

521
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:04,988
I'm here to apologize.

522
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,089
And to let you know I quit the band.

523
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,191
You did?

524
00:20:08,223 --> 00:20:10,092
Yes. It's nothing without you.

525
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,293
You were the band.

526
00:20:11,327 --> 00:20:13,329
Those were your songs.

527
00:20:13,363 --> 00:20:16,132
And I'm sorry if I
let Olivia manipulate me.

528
00:20:16,164 --> 00:20:18,835
I guess she manipulated both of us.

529
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:22,505
There's just something about her
flat chest and muscular legs.

530
00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:25,442
Look, I never should've
treated you the way I did.

531
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:28,010
I suppose I didn't
treat you so well either.

532
00:20:28,043 --> 00:20:30,546
So, what do you say? Can
we put this all behind us

533
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:31,856
and go back to the way things were?

534
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,315
Of course we can.

535
00:20:33,348 --> 00:20:35,452
Hey, I wonder if she's
gonna keep the band going.

536
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,619
Probably. She told me

537
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,722
she was just gonna
replace me with another dog.

538
00:20:38,754 --> 00:20:39,989
Yes, but who?

539
00:20:40,022 --> 00:20:41,357
I don't know. Probably some dog

540
00:20:41,391 --> 00:20:43,393
neither you or I have ever met.

541
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:47,797
All right, listen up,
you little pieces of garbage.

542
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,466
This song's about gettin'
heartburn from baked clams.

543
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,269
And other kid stuff.

544
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:56,631
