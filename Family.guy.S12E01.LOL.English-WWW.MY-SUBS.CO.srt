TV ANNOUNCER:
We now return to

13
00:00:36,465 --> 00:00:39,567
<i>11 Angry Men and One</i>
<i>Developmentally Disabled Man.</i>

14
00:00:39,602 --> 00:00:41,669
Okay, the vote is
11 for "guilty"

15
00:00:41,704 --> 00:00:43,238
and one for "kitty."

16
00:00:43,272 --> 00:00:44,439
(all groaning)

17
00:00:44,473 --> 00:00:46,474
All right,
let's keep talking it out...

18
00:00:48,177 --> 00:00:49,944
Has the jury
reached its verdict?

19
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:51,146
We have, Your Honor.

20
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,814
We find the defendant...
kitty.

21
00:00:52,848 --> 00:00:54,749
(gallery shouting, murmuring)

22
00:00:58,454 --> 00:01:00,522
Boy, am I beat.

23
00:01:00,556 --> 00:01:01,923
Peter, what's
with the tie?

24
00:01:01,957 --> 00:01:04,225
Oh, I bought a tie so I can
loosen it when I'm beat.

25
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,226
(sighs heavily)

26
00:01:05,261 --> 00:01:06,227
(exclaiming)

27
00:01:06,262 --> 00:01:07,595
Oh, my God, Dad!

28
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,430
Peter, your breath!
It's horrible.

29
00:01:09,465 --> 00:01:10,532
(sniffs)

30
00:01:10,566 --> 00:01:12,867
Is Whoopi Goldberg
working out down there?

31
00:01:12,902 --> 00:01:14,602
Peter, I think
what everyone's saying

32
00:01:14,637 --> 00:01:16,070
is that you've
got "dad breath."

33
00:01:16,105 --> 00:01:17,505
What the hell's
"dad breath"?

34
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,640
You know,
"dad breath."

35
00:01:18,674 --> 00:01:19,707
Guys get older,

36
00:01:19,742 --> 00:01:21,222
they stop paying
attention to hygiene,

37
00:01:21,243 --> 00:01:22,944
their bodies
are changing...

38
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:24,813
It's just a fact that,
at a certain age,

39
00:01:24,847 --> 00:01:27,048
men start to rot
from the inside out.

40
00:01:27,082 --> 00:01:28,283
(exhales, sniffs)

41
00:01:28,317 --> 00:01:29,617
I don't smell it.

42
00:01:29,652 --> 00:01:30,919
Huh. Maybe that
explains what happened

43
00:01:30,953 --> 00:01:32,687
with that new guy
at work today.

44
00:01:32,755 --> 00:01:34,289
All right, so this
is Pawtucket Patriot's

45
00:01:34,323 --> 00:01:35,623
national distribution.

46
00:01:35,658 --> 00:01:36,825
As you can see,

47
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:38,693
we are predominantly
an East Coast beer.

48
00:01:38,727 --> 00:01:40,361
Hey, there's gonna be a quiz
on all this later.

49
00:01:40,396 --> 00:01:41,629
I'm just kidding.

50
00:01:41,664 --> 00:01:42,897
Someone said that
to me once,

51
00:01:42,932 --> 00:01:44,199
now I say it.

52
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:51,472
Hey, Lois,
what do you say

53
00:01:51,507 --> 00:01:53,441
we do what Anderson
Cooper tried once

54
00:01:53,475 --> 00:01:55,243
before he decided
he hated it?

55
00:01:55,277 --> 00:01:57,145
Oh, Peter...

56
00:01:57,179 --> 00:01:58,146
Hi, there.

57
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,514
Ugh. Oh.

58
00:01:59,548 --> 00:02:00,715
Let's do some
role-playing.

59
00:02:00,749 --> 00:02:02,150
You're you
and I'm Peter,

60
00:02:02,184 --> 00:02:03,284
only with
much worse knees.

61
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,619
Ow, my knees!

62
00:02:04,653 --> 00:02:06,087
Actually, Peter,

63
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:07,856
I think I finally
want to make love

64
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,258
to a 1950's spaceman.

65
00:02:10,292 --> 00:02:12,060
Really? You mean it?!

66
00:02:12,094 --> 00:02:13,094
All right, let's go!

67
00:02:17,299 --> 00:02:19,067
Good.

68
00:02:22,538 --> 00:02:25,773
Ugh, Dad, it smells like
rotting flesh in here.

69
00:02:25,808 --> 00:02:26,941
Take the window lock off!

70
00:02:26,976 --> 00:02:28,209
Can't do that, Meg.

71
00:02:28,244 --> 00:02:30,645
I don't trust myself
not to jump out the window.

00:03:24,934 --> 00:03:27,135
we've got to do something
about that awful breath.

100
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:28,336
I'm making an appointment,

00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,938

Geez, you are not gonna
let this go, are you?

00:03:32,474 --> 00:03:34,809
You're as stubborn as

Well, <i>she's</i> long gone,

114
00:03:56,966 --> 00:03:59,100
All right, I think
I found the culprit.

115
00:03:59,134 --> 00:04:01,569
This shrimp was lodged
under one of your gums.

116
00:04:01,603 --> 00:04:03,671
Wow, that must've been
in there a while.

117
00:04:03,706 --> 00:04:06,374
It's been weeks since I ordered
from Hurry Up, Shrimp.

118
00:04:06,408 --> 00:04:08,209
(sighs)
Where the hell is this guy?

119
00:04:08,243 --> 00:04:10,111
I ordered that shrimp
two hours ago.

120
00:04:10,145 --> 00:04:11,346

Hurry Up, Shrimp?
Well, that just <i>sounds</i> fast.

124
00:04:16,885 --> 00:04:19,354
On average, Americans spend

waiting for shrimp
over the course of their lives.

126
00:04:21,857 --> 00:04:24,058

"Why on earth don't
these guys just hurry up?"

Hey, little guy.

Ah, yes.
You see, legend has it

148
00:05:16,578 --> 00:05:18,846
that Quahog founder
Miles "Chatterbox" Musket

149
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:21,582
hid his fortune
in fear of it being taken

150
00:05:21,617 --> 00:05:23,985

during the Revolutionary War.

he could retrieve it,

152
00:05:26,188 --> 00:05:28,322
and left behind only this map.

153
00:05:28,357 --> 00:05:30,691
Many believe his treasure
is still buried

154
00:05:30,726 --> 00:05:32,760
right here in Rhode Island.

155
00:05:36,832 --> 00:05:39,067
Okay, I'm gonna

159
00:05:46,975 --> 00:05:48,943
to distract your children
while you're eating.

160
00:05:48,977 --> 00:05:51,079
There's no treasure.
Well, what if there is?

161
00:05:51,113 --> 00:05:52,847
Ah, see?
Surprised you with that one.

162
00:05:52,881 --> 00:05:54,949
You see, you see that rock
next to the "X"?

163
00:05:54,983 --> 00:05:57,385
I know that rock, Lois--
it's right near Route 2.

164
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:00,054
I'm finding that treasure.
Peter, the map is a joke.

165
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:01,722
You're being played
for a fool.

166
00:06:01,757 --> 00:06:03,491
Like George McFly.

167
00:06:03,525 --> 00:06:04,892
Hey, Lorraine,

168
00:06:04,927 --> 00:06:07,128
whatever happened to that guy
Marty from high school?

169
00:06:07,162 --> 00:06:09,163
Don't know.
Never saw him after the prom.

170
00:06:09,198 --> 00:06:10,655
Really? Sure you didn't

171
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,868
run into him, oh, say,
about 16 years ago?

172
00:06:13,268 --> 00:06:15,169
George, what are
you talking about?

173
00:06:15,203 --> 00:06:17,304
I'm talking about
the fact that our son,

174
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:19,707
who you insisted we name
after that guy Marty,

175
00:06:19,741 --> 00:06:21,075
looks exactly like him!

176
00:06:21,109 --> 00:06:23,277
You think I'm an idiot?
That I wouldn't notice

177
00:06:23,311 --> 00:06:26,647
that our son is a dead ringer
for the guy who fixed us up?

178
00:06:26,681 --> 00:06:29,750
Mom, Dad, I accidentally set
fire to the living room rug!

179
00:06:29,784 --> 00:06:32,052
I am not going easy on him!

180
00:06:36,191 --> 00:06:39,059
Hey, guys, who wants to dig
for buried treasure with me?

181
00:06:39,094 --> 00:06:40,794
What? What are you
talking about?

182
00:06:40,829 --> 00:06:42,296
Well, this child's
place mat is telling me

183
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,031
to dig for buried treasure
by the side of the highway.

184
00:06:44,065 --> 00:06:45,432
Who's in?

185
00:06:45,467 --> 00:06:47,101
Aw, forget it, Peter.
That's crazy talk.

186
00:06:47,135 --> 00:06:49,837
Yeah, we're not going along
with another one of your stupid ideas.

187
00:06:49,871 --> 00:06:51,305
I don't have
stupid ideas.

188
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:53,541
Haven't you seen my
documentary film?

189
00:06:53,575 --> 00:06:55,943
PETER: <i>Each year,</i>
<i>the environment covers</i>

190
00:06:55,977 --> 00:06:58,546
<i>more than 40% of the Earth.</i>

191
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,116
<i>Every animal on Earth</i>
<i>lays eggs.</i>

192
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,817
<i>This is a birch tree.</i>

193
00:07:03,852 --> 00:07:08,088
<i>Today it will begin</i>
<i>its 10,000-mile journey.</i>

194
00:07:08,123 --> 00:07:10,791
<i>The Earth neither</i>
<i>hates nor loves,</i>

195
00:07:10,825 --> 00:07:15,429
<i>but sits, waiting patiently,</i>
<i>for people to do famous stuff.</i>

196
00:07:22,037 --> 00:07:23,837
Peter, it's time
to come home.

197
00:07:23,872 --> 00:07:25,739
You been out here
digging all day.

198
00:07:25,774 --> 00:07:28,475
I-I told you this whole thing
was ridiculous.

199
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,244
What the hell was
I thinking, anyway?

200
00:07:30,278 --> 00:07:31,946
I must be some
kind of idiot.

201
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,980
(shovel clangs)

202
00:07:33,014 --> 00:07:35,182
(gasps)
(gasps) What was that?

203
00:07:37,218 --> 00:07:40,054
Holy crap!
Lois, it's the treasure!

204
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:41,355
Oh, my God!

205
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:43,591
Peter, you were right!

206
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,326
Oh, no, it's the one kid

207
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,927
who also followed
the treasure map.

208
00:07:58,091 --> 00:07:59,191
I don't believe it!

209
00:07:59,225 --> 00:08:01,193
There really was something
buried out there!

210
00:08:01,227 --> 00:08:03,495
Well, it's not the treasure,
but it looks like

211
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,497
it's a clue
to where the treasure is.

212
00:08:05,532 --> 00:08:07,533
"Face the circle
in the square,

213
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:09,902
you'll see me,
I'll show you where."

214
00:08:09,936 --> 00:08:11,537
Interesting.

215
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:14,239
Interesting, interesting.

216
00:08:20,413 --> 00:08:22,173
Okay, well, if there is
a treasure out there,

217
00:08:22,182 --> 00:08:23,849
we don't want anybody else
to know about it.

218
00:08:23,883 --> 00:08:25,193
None of this leaves
this room, okay?

219
00:08:25,218 --> 00:08:26,018
Obviously.

220
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:27,386
We're not idiots, Brian.

221
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,455
Hey, look!
Dad's on TV!

222
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:30,789
Hello, I'm Tom Tucker,

223
00:08:30,824 --> 00:08:32,891
here with local fortune seeker
Peter Griffin, who appears

224
00:08:32,926 --> 00:08:35,160
to have found a clue
to a hidden treasure.

225
00:08:35,195 --> 00:08:36,462
That's right, Tom,
and I sincerely hope

226
00:08:36,496 --> 00:08:38,297
that the caption beneath me

227
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:40,933
doesn't say "Local Fatty."
Let's do something about that caption.

228
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:43,936
All right, well, you can check
out the clue at our Web site:

229
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:50,275
We were a little late
getting a Web site.

230
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,378
Quick, Neil! Sign into
the neighbors' Wi-Fi

231
00:08:52,412 --> 00:08:54,213
so we can get that clue.

232
00:08:54,247 --> 00:08:55,273
Nurse, write down that clue,

233
00:08:55,298 --> 00:08:57,517
and then go out in
the waiting room and...

234
00:08:57,617 --> 00:08:59,785
maybe start lowering
expectations.

235
00:08:59,819 --> 00:09:00,886
Treasure?!

236
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,987
Yeah, baby?

237
00:09:02,022 --> 00:09:03,989
Bring me a grape wine.

238
00:09:04,024 --> 00:09:05,024
Peter, what the hell!

239
00:09:05,058 --> 00:09:06,158
Now everyone has the clue!

240
00:09:06,192 --> 00:09:07,426
Why would you do that?

241
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,781
Because I'm tired
of people saying

242
00:09:08,795 --> 00:09:10,295
I don't know nothin'.
Everyone doubted me,

243
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:13,132
so I wanted to rub it
in their faces that I was right.

244
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,133
All right, where is it?

245
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:15,801
Give me that!
Is this all there was?

246
00:09:15,835 --> 00:09:16,969
Yeah, is there
anything else

247
00:09:17,003 --> 00:09:18,570
we should know before
we start looking?

248
00:09:18,605 --> 00:09:20,305
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is <i>our</i> thing.

249
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,774
We're not sharing
this with anyone.

250
00:09:21,808 --> 00:09:23,275
Peter, come on,
are you serious?

251
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:26,078
If Joe or I found this, we'd
want you right alongside us.

252
00:09:26,112 --> 00:09:28,313
Well, yeah, we're
like peas in a pod.

253
00:09:28,348 --> 00:09:30,149
Wait-wait.
Don't go in there.

254
00:09:30,183 --> 00:09:32,284
He's doing his podcast.

255
00:09:32,318 --> 00:09:33,285
Oh, that's cute.

256
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:35,688
Now, <i>that</i> I like.

257
00:09:35,722 --> 00:09:37,856
What do you think about <i>this,</i>
you old bag?

258
00:09:37,891 --> 00:09:40,192
Oh, no.

259
00:09:40,226 --> 00:09:42,261
Look, you guys
doubted me, mocked me,

260
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:44,396
constantly handled my Eggo
despite my clear instructions,

261
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:46,665
and now you want a
piece of my treasure?

262
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,471
I don't think so.

263
00:09:47,496 --> 00:09:49,192
Well, fine!
We don't need you anyway!

264
00:09:50,637 --> 00:09:52,237
Peter, I don't like this.

265
00:09:52,272 --> 00:09:53,539
It seems like this treasure

266
00:09:53,573 --> 00:09:55,140
is already turning people
against each other.

267
00:09:55,175 --> 00:09:56,341
Hang on, you guys.

268
00:09:56,376 --> 00:09:58,143
I think I might have
figured something out.

269
00:09:58,178 --> 00:09:59,812
"The circle in the square."

270
00:09:59,846 --> 00:10:02,181
That could be the clock
in the town square.

271
00:10:02,215 --> 00:10:04,583
Wow, that... You're right!
Brian, that could be it!

272
00:10:04,617 --> 00:10:06,719
Well, let's get down there
before anyone else does.

273
00:10:11,825 --> 00:10:15,127
(townspeople murmuring)

274
00:10:15,161 --> 00:10:17,396
Son of a bitch!
Everyone's already here!

275
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,399
Let's see, "Face
the circle in the square."

276
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:22,401
"Face the circle."

277
00:10:22,435 --> 00:10:23,602
"Face."

278
00:10:23,636 --> 00:10:25,471
Okay, the gesturing
needs to stop.

279
00:10:25,505 --> 00:10:27,072
No one else is doing that.

280
00:10:31,044 --> 00:10:32,978
Look!
When you face this way,

281
00:10:33,012 --> 00:10:35,948
you're looking at
the statue of Miles Musket.

282
00:10:37,717 --> 00:10:39,685
Crap, you guys, there's
already other people here.

283
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:41,453
They must have
figured it out, too.

284
00:10:41,488 --> 00:10:43,088
You're right.
Okay, gather round, kids.

285
00:10:43,123 --> 00:10:44,123
Family suicide.

286
00:10:44,157 --> 00:10:45,524
Look-- there's a plaque!

287
00:10:45,558 --> 00:10:48,160
"This square
shall forever honor

288
00:10:48,194 --> 00:10:49,862
"the memory of my son,
Timmy Musket.

289
00:10:49,896 --> 00:10:52,064
"Always a chip
off the old Block.

290
00:10:52,098 --> 00:10:53,565
"May he rest in peace.

291
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,601
Miles 'Chatterbox' Musket."

292
00:10:55,635 --> 00:10:58,470
Wait-- when I played Jane Musket
in the school play

293
00:10:58,505 --> 00:11:00,239
the last three weekends--
thanks for coming...

294
00:11:00,273 --> 00:11:01,740
I couldn't.
I had a thing.

295
00:11:01,775 --> 00:11:03,709
I had a lot of
dog stuff that day.

296
00:11:03,743 --> 00:11:05,744
Yeah, weekends I like
to spend with my kids.

297
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:07,579
I learned that
Timmy Musket is buried

298
00:11:07,614 --> 00:11:09,214
in a cemetery
on Block Island.

299
00:11:09,249 --> 00:11:11,116
I remember it because
my big speech was, "Timmy..."

300
00:11:11,151 --> 00:11:12,417
Meg, please.

301
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:14,486
That must be what "chip off
the old Block" means!

302
00:11:14,521 --> 00:11:16,255
That's it!
Meg, take the car home!

303
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:19,057
Your mother and I are taking
the ferry to Block Island!

304
00:11:19,092 --> 00:11:21,093
Chris, we need to find that
treasure for ourselves.

305
00:11:21,127 --> 00:11:22,327
What do you mean?

306
00:11:22,362 --> 00:11:23,829
Even <i>if</i> Dad finds
the treasure,

307
00:11:23,863 --> 00:11:24,897
he's not gonna share.

308
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:26,231
He'll just blow
through it all.

309
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:27,332
Maybe you're right.

310
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:29,234
I mean, last time
we came into some money,

311
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:30,602
he just wasted it
on all those

312
00:11:30,637 --> 00:11:31,770
diamond pinkie rings
for everybody.

313
00:11:31,805 --> 00:11:32,971
What?!

314
00:11:33,006 --> 00:11:35,440
Uh, well, uh, yeah,
we should probably go.

315
00:11:37,644 --> 00:11:38,677
(tires screeching)

316
00:11:38,711 --> 00:11:40,279
What the hell?
Where are they going?

317
00:11:40,313 --> 00:11:41,480
Oh, forget them.
They're dead weight.

318
00:11:41,514 --> 00:11:42,915
If this treasure's going
to be found,

319
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:44,383
it's up to you
and me, Brian.

320
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:46,151
What do you mean?
Come on! You think

321
00:11:46,186 --> 00:11:47,866
the fat man's gonna
figure out those clues?

322
00:11:47,887 --> 00:11:49,822
He's an idiot.
Yeah, I guess you're right.

323
00:11:49,856 --> 00:11:51,156
Yes, I mean,
he's the guy

324
00:11:51,191 --> 00:11:53,192
who put all those
little bald men in incubators

325
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:54,560
because he thought
they were babies.

326
00:11:54,594 --> 00:11:56,195
Look at you.

327
00:11:56,229 --> 00:11:58,497
You came early,
but you're gonna make it.

328
00:11:58,531 --> 00:12:01,266
I'm a senior vice president
at an investment firm!

329
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:04,203
Oh, someone's a fussy britches.

330
00:12:19,652 --> 00:12:22,020

331
00:12:22,055 --> 00:12:24,089
♪ Takes me away

332
00:12:24,123 --> 00:12:26,191

334
00:12:32,732 --> 00:12:34,399
Want half a Mounds bar?

335
00:12:34,434 --> 00:12:35,767
What?

336
00:12:35,802 --> 00:12:37,135
Who eats a Mounds bar?

337
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,104
I do.
My whole life, I don't think

338
00:12:39,138 --> 00:12:41,273
I've ever seen a single
person eat a Mounds bar.

339
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:43,208
Well, you're about
to see one now.

340
00:12:43,243 --> 00:12:44,576
So, you walk
into a store,

341
00:12:44,611 --> 00:12:46,251
you see the hundreds
of options for candy,

342
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:47,779
and you choose
a Mounds bar?

343
00:12:47,814 --> 00:12:48,881
Yep.

344
00:12:48,915 --> 00:12:50,415
So what is it you like?

345
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,450
The coconut?
The chocolate?

346
00:12:51,484 --> 00:12:52,618
Yeah.
Both those things.

347
00:12:52,652 --> 00:12:53,919
How long you been
eating 'em?

348
00:12:53,953 --> 00:12:55,554
Uh, I've probably
been having a Mounds bar

349
00:12:55,588 --> 00:12:57,823
two or three times a day
for the last 25 years.

350
00:12:57,857 --> 00:12:59,491
Geez, no wonder
you can't walk!

351
00:12:59,525 --> 00:13:01,460
You have total
renal shutdown!

352
00:13:01,494 --> 00:13:02,794
Your kidneys are
drowning in a stew

353
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:03,962
of chocolate and coconut!

354
00:13:03,997 --> 00:13:04,997
Give me that!

355
00:13:07,901 --> 00:13:09,201
(candy wrapper crinkling)

356
00:13:09,235 --> 00:13:10,769
What are you doing?

357
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:15,807
Why are your nipples
poking into me?

358
00:13:15,842 --> 00:13:18,076
Sorry. That happens
when I'm cold.

359
00:13:18,111 --> 00:13:19,912
But why are there
three of them?

360
00:13:19,946 --> 00:13:20,712
There aren't.

361
00:13:20,747 --> 00:13:22,114
Two of them are moles.

362
00:13:22,148 --> 00:13:24,583
Those numbers
still don't add up!

363
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,588
Why the hell are we taking
a hot air balloon?

364
00:13:29,622 --> 00:13:31,657
I don't think we're anywhere
near Block Island.

365
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:33,458
Oh, I know.
We passed that miles ago.

366
00:13:33,493 --> 00:13:35,627
What? Well, then what
about the treasure?

367
00:13:35,662 --> 00:13:38,764
Two friends sailing in
the sky in a wicker basket

368
00:13:38,798 --> 00:13:41,233
with a strange man
holding a cheese plate?

369
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:42,968
This is the treasure, Bri.

370
00:13:43,002 --> 00:13:44,536
You want a Vicodin?

371
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,439
Isn't it dangerous to do drugs
10,000 feet in the air?

372
00:13:47,473 --> 00:13:49,441
Yeah. Exactly.

373
00:13:49,475 --> 00:13:50,642
What the hell?!

374
00:13:50,677 --> 00:13:52,678
Never gonna die!

375
00:13:52,712 --> 00:13:54,413
Your friend is, like,
the coolest guy

376
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:56,181
I've ever had up here.

377
00:13:58,584 --> 00:14:00,485
Oh, damn it, Lois,
they're already here!

378
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,054
This is all your fault!

379
00:14:02,056 --> 00:14:03,588
What?! How is this my fault?

380
00:14:03,623 --> 00:14:05,724
Because you just had
to stop for ice cream!

381
00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:07,626
Then you get in there,
and you order

382
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,328
like you never
heard of food before!

383
00:14:09,362 --> 00:14:13,265
Oh, "Coffee Fudge Swirl with
Reese's Peanut Butter Cups."

384
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:15,367
Oh, I wonder
what's in that!

385
00:14:15,401 --> 00:14:17,536
You just listed off
all the ingredients!

386
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:20,238
Everything you just said
is what's in that!

387
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:24,142
Well, I hate to say it,
but I guess

388
00:14:24,177 --> 00:14:25,644
we're supposed
to dig this kid up.

389
00:14:25,678 --> 00:14:26,878
Any volunteers?

390
00:14:26,913 --> 00:14:28,680
I dig kids.

391
00:14:28,715 --> 00:14:29,915
All of you,
hold it right there!

392
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:31,116
If anyone's digging

393
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,317
into this little kid's grave,
it's me!

394
00:14:32,352 --> 00:14:33,952
You're too late.
We got here first.

395
00:14:33,987 --> 00:14:35,153
No, it's my treasure hunt!

396
00:14:35,188 --> 00:14:36,321
I found the first clue!

397
00:14:36,356 --> 00:14:37,689
You guys are just horning in!

398
00:14:37,724 --> 00:14:38,857
You guys, calm down!

399
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:40,726
See, this is what
I was talking about.

400
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,160
You can't desecrate
a child's grave!

401
00:14:42,161 --> 00:14:43,295
Don't worry, Lois.

402
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:44,696
We're gonna do it
with reverence.

403
00:14:44,731 --> 00:14:46,398
Hey, how about
a little digging song?

404
00:14:46,432 --> 00:14:48,667
(to "Little Bunny Foo Foo"):
♪ Little Peter Griffin

405
00:14:48,701 --> 00:14:50,002
♪ Diggin' up a casket

406
00:14:50,036 --> 00:14:53,538
♪ Shovelful of dirt
and bop ya on the head. ♪

407
00:14:53,573 --> 00:14:55,440
I didn't care for
the end of that song.

408
00:14:55,475 --> 00:14:57,576
Oh, my God!
The treasure's in the casket!

409
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,778
Come on, Meg,
let's get it!

410
00:14:59,812 --> 00:15:01,013
My treasure!

411
00:15:01,047 --> 00:15:03,548
Oh, my God!
You hit your own son!

412
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:04,816
That's it, Peter.

413
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:07,919
I am not gonna stand here
and be a part of this madness.

414
00:15:07,954 --> 00:15:10,155
You're on your own,
because I quit!

415
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:11,790
Chris, Meg,
we're going home.

416
00:15:11,824 --> 00:15:14,626
Well, good! You were just
slowing me down anyway!

417
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,928
You, Asian lady,
you're the new Lois.

418
00:15:16,963 --> 00:15:21,266
I will have one scoop of mint
chocolate chip in a waffle cone.

419
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,802
You are a practical,
straightforward people.

420
00:15:29,035 --> 00:15:30,605
What do you guys think
is in here?

421
00:15:30,606 --> 00:15:31,507
(rattling)

422
00:15:31,508 --> 00:15:32,975
Sounds like books.

423
00:15:33,877 --> 00:15:35,177
(all gasping)

424
00:15:35,211 --> 00:15:37,646
BRUCE:
Oh, my God!

425
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,982
Feels so weird to be
looking at a dead kid

426
00:15:40,016 --> 00:15:41,583
and not have angry
parents nearby.

427
00:15:41,618 --> 00:15:44,853
Hey, look! There's something
written inside the lid.

428
00:15:44,888 --> 00:15:47,923
PETER: "You've crossed the miles,
you've pawed through clues.

429
00:15:47,957 --> 00:15:51,960
Find where he hits, misses,
cheers and boos."

430
00:15:51,995 --> 00:15:54,296
By the way, for those
who came on my boat,

431
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,898
I have those
sandwiches.

432
00:15:55,932 --> 00:15:58,767
"Hits, misses,
cheers, and boos."

433
00:15:58,801 --> 00:16:00,536
Could be... baseball?

434
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,137
And "pawed through clues."

435
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:04,306
Could it be Paw... tucket?

436
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,875
The Pawtucket Red Sox play
at McCoy Stadium.

437
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,211
Quagmire, let's get
to that stadium!

438
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:14,950
Eh! Lois took the bike.

439
00:16:14,984 --> 00:16:16,385
Hey, wait a minute.

440
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:19,922
This is a great time for me
to do my Suzuki Samurai promo!

441
00:16:21,624 --> 00:16:23,592
Are you a Hawaii scumbag?

442
00:16:23,626 --> 00:16:26,061
Do you chug energy drinks
in Arizona?

443
00:16:26,095 --> 00:16:30,432
Suzuki Samurai--
ninja name, garbage car.

444
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,371
You sons of bitches,
this is my...

445
00:16:36,406 --> 00:16:38,407
(yelling, grunting
and muttering)

446
00:16:41,411 --> 00:16:43,345
Oh, my God, look at 'em.

447
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:44,846
Lois was right.

448
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:47,849
This treasure hunt has
turned them all into animals.

449
00:16:47,884 --> 00:16:49,084
(grunting)

450
00:16:49,118 --> 00:16:50,919
There's more
where that came from, mister!

451
00:16:50,954 --> 00:16:52,087
(grunts)

452
00:16:52,121 --> 00:16:54,556
He was right.
There <i>was</i> more!

453
00:16:58,728 --> 00:17:01,196
Oh, look who's back--
the grave robber.

454
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,464
Hey, Lois.

455
00:17:02,498 --> 00:17:04,866
So, what happened?
You find your treasure?

456
00:17:04,901 --> 00:17:07,603
No. I realized something
after you left.

457
00:17:07,637 --> 00:17:09,605
It's not the treasure
that matters.

458
00:17:09,639 --> 00:17:11,907
All that really matters
is the money you get

459
00:17:11,941 --> 00:17:13,842
in <i>exchange</i>
for the treasure.

460
00:17:13,876 --> 00:17:16,178
I guess I had
to learn that the hard way.

461
00:17:16,212 --> 00:17:18,246
Per, you were a real jerk
out there!

462
00:17:18,281 --> 00:17:19,514
I know.

463
00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:20,482
You were right.

464
00:17:20,516 --> 00:17:22,150
I took this thing way too far.

465
00:17:22,185 --> 00:17:24,820
And I'm really sorry about
how I treated you and the kids.

466
00:17:24,854 --> 00:17:25,988
But you know me.

467
00:17:26,022 --> 00:17:27,923
If I read anything
on a place mat,

468
00:17:27,957 --> 00:17:29,358
I I just kind of go nuts.

469
00:17:29,392 --> 00:17:30,759
Can you forgive me?

470
00:17:30,793 --> 00:17:32,060
Chris forgave me.

471
00:17:32,095 --> 00:17:35,430
I can't wait for you
to fall asleep tonight.

472
00:17:35,465 --> 00:17:37,466
Of course I
forgive you, Peter.

473
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,569
So I guess everyone else came
to their senses, too, huh?

474
00:17:40,603 --> 00:17:42,537
No, they all ran off
to McCoy Stadium.

475
00:17:42,572 --> 00:17:44,606
What? Why? What's
at McCoy Stadium?

476
00:17:44,641 --> 00:17:46,642
Ah, there was a clue
at the graveyard.

477
00:17:46,676 --> 00:17:48,510
Here, I took a picture
with my phone.

478
00:17:48,544 --> 00:17:50,178
Oh, it's the
next picture.

479
00:17:50,213 --> 00:17:53,048
Just swipe it
to the next one.

480
00:17:54,817 --> 00:17:56,785
She saw me.

481
00:17:56,819 --> 00:17:59,721
"You've crossed the miles,
you've pawed through clues.

482
00:17:59,756 --> 00:18:03,525
Find where he hits,
misses, cheers and boos."

483
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:06,795
Peter, this can't be leading
them to a baseball stadium.

484
00:18:06,829 --> 00:18:09,598
Baseball wasn't invented
until the 1800s.

485
00:18:09,632 --> 00:18:11,867
Wow, you're really smart, Lois.

486
00:18:11,901 --> 00:18:14,036
You know, Peter,
in the first eight minutes

487
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,871
of Meg's play,
before I walked out,

488
00:18:15,905 --> 00:18:18,674
they said Miles Musket
was a horrible drunk

489
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:19,975
and a wife beater.

490
00:18:20,009 --> 00:18:21,810
So, when it says,
"hits, misses,"

491
00:18:21,844 --> 00:18:25,047
it might be talking
about hitting Mrs. Musket.

492
00:18:25,081 --> 00:18:26,982
And he probably misspelled
"missus"

493
00:18:27,016 --> 00:18:28,984
because he was drunk
when he wrote it.

494
00:18:29,018 --> 00:18:31,219
Or maybe he misspelled it
because cursive is hard,

495
00:18:31,254 --> 00:18:32,954
and everyone should
get off his back.

496
00:18:32,989 --> 00:18:35,557
And "cheers" and "boos"
might be referring to a bar

497
00:18:35,591 --> 00:18:38,427
where he would "cheers,"
and drink his "booze."

498
00:18:38,461 --> 00:18:40,962
"Hits missus,
cheers and booze."

499
00:18:40,997 --> 00:18:43,165
Wait a minute-- it's got
to be an old bar, right?

500
00:18:43,199 --> 00:18:44,866
The Clam's
the oldest bar in town.

501
00:18:44,901 --> 00:18:47,069
(gasps) That must be
where the treasure is!

502
00:18:47,103 --> 00:18:49,037
All right, let's you
put some makeup on

503
00:18:49,072 --> 00:18:50,806
and get right down
to The Clam!

504
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:56,311
Oh, no, they're closed.

505
00:18:56,345 --> 00:18:58,013
Hang on. I got an idea.

506
00:18:58,047 --> 00:18:59,448
But you have to believe.

507
00:18:59,482 --> 00:19:01,249
What?
You have to believe.

508
00:19:01,284 --> 00:19:02,451
Say you believe.

509
00:19:02,485 --> 00:19:04,052
Okay. I believe.

510
00:19:04,087 --> 00:19:07,389
This is worse than the time
we were in The Clam right now.

511
00:19:07,423 --> 00:19:08,890
Yes!

512
00:19:08,925 --> 00:19:10,025
Peter, look!

513
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:12,027
That's Miles Musket!

514
00:19:12,061 --> 00:19:13,628
It is?
Yes!

515
00:19:13,663 --> 00:19:15,964
How have you never seen
this painting before?

516
00:19:15,998 --> 00:19:18,567
Lois, I'm completely hammered
every time I'm in here.

517
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:23,472
(grunts)

518
00:19:29,712 --> 00:19:31,012
(both gasp)

519
00:19:32,048 --> 00:19:33,615
We did it!

520
00:19:33,649 --> 00:19:35,617
We found the treasure!

521
00:19:35,651 --> 00:19:36,952
You know what, Peter?

522
00:19:36,986 --> 00:19:38,954
Why don't <i>you</i> open it?

523
00:19:38,988 --> 00:19:40,956
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

524
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,291
No, okay,
I'll-I'll open it.

525
00:19:43,326 --> 00:19:46,228
Here, hold this.

526
00:19:56,472 --> 00:19:57,773
"Congratulations.

527
00:19:57,807 --> 00:19:59,841
"You have won
The Founding Father Restaurant

528
00:19:59,876 --> 00:20:01,510
"Treasure Hunt Challenge.

529
00:20:01,544 --> 00:20:03,178
"Please enjoy one free meal

530
00:20:03,212 --> 00:20:05,447
"at select
Founding Father locations.

531
00:20:05,481 --> 00:20:07,916
Expires May 16, 2006."

532
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,684
Wait a second.
What year is it?

533
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:11,520
It's 2013, Peter.

534
00:20:11,554 --> 00:20:13,088
So that's...
It's before.

535
00:20:13,122 --> 00:20:14,322
The coupon's no good.

536
00:20:14,357 --> 00:20:15,657
Oh, man!

537
00:20:15,691 --> 00:20:17,993
Um, this sucks worse

538
00:20:18,027 --> 00:20:20,662
than when I went
to that strip club without Lois.

539
00:20:20,696 --> 00:20:21,496
(dance beat thumping,
men whooping)

540
00:20:21,531 --> 00:20:23,498
Yay!

541
00:20:27,523 --> 00:20:29,675
Well, Peter, I hope
you're not disappointed

542
00:20:29,676 --> 00:20:30,843
we didn't find
any treasure.

543
00:20:30,877 --> 00:20:32,044
No, it's fine.

544
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:33,446
You know, the important thing is

545
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,314
we figured out
those clues together.

546
00:20:35,349 --> 00:20:37,383
I mean, so what
we won't be able to pay

547
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:38,884
to fix them veins
in your legs.

548
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:40,486
You're my treasure, Lois,

549
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,222
and I want you
on my team for everything.

550
00:20:43,256 --> 00:20:44,890
Except for sports.

551
00:20:44,925 --> 00:20:46,258
Me too, Peter.

552
00:20:46,293 --> 00:20:47,460
I love you.

553
00:20:47,494 --> 00:20:49,495
I love you, too, Lois.

554
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:52,231
(knocking on door)
No way that's the shrimp.
