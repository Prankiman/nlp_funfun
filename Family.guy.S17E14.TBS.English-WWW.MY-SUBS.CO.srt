<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

2
00:00:04,984 --> 00:00:08,286
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

3
00:00:08,287 --> 00:00:11,722
<i>But where are those
good old-fashioned values</i>

4
00:00:11,723 --> 00:00:14,793
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

5
00:00:14,794 --> 00:00:18,263
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

6
00:00:18,264 --> 00:00:21,662
<i>Lucky there's a man
who positively can do</i>

7
00:00:21,663 --> 00:00:23,228
<i>All the things that make us</i>

8
00:00:23,229 --> 00:00:24,866
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

00:00:24,867 --> 00:00:30,310
<i>He's... a... Fam... ily... Guy!</i>

00:00:38,084 --> 00:00:40,584
Hold the door.

12
00:00:40,585 --> 00:00:44,121
Great. It's that guy I only have
one thing in common with.

13
00:00:44,122 --> 00:00:46,992
Hey, Peter. How about
that gay encounter we had?

14
00:00:46,993 --> 00:00:48,793
God, every time with this guy.

15
00:00:48,794 --> 00:00:50,529
I'm gonna take the stairs.

16
00:00:55,475 --> 00:00:58,912
Oh, my God, I'm never gonna
get up these stairs.

17
00:01:00,347 --> 00:01:01,748
Okay, it's all right.

18
00:01:01,749 --> 00:01:03,883
I do this every week
in the opening credits.

19
00:01:03,884 --> 00:01:05,751
All right, let's see. How does that go?

20
00:01:05,752 --> 00:01:08,254
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

21
00:01:08,255 --> 00:01:11,075
<i>Lucky there's... a man who</i>

22
00:01:11,754 --> 00:01:13,593
<i>Positively can do</i>

23
00:01:13,594 --> 00:01:15,594
<i>All the things that make us...</i>

24
00:01:17,764 --> 00:01:20,266
I swear he says the F-word.

25
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,070
Everything hurts.

26
00:01:24,071 --> 00:01:25,838
Everything's wet.

27
00:01:25,839 --> 00:01:28,007
I'm just gonna stay here.

28
00:01:28,008 --> 00:01:30,444
Was<i> Labyrinth</i> a good movie?

29
00:01:30,445 --> 00:01:32,546
I can't remember.

30
00:01:32,547 --> 00:01:35,114
I don't want to watch it again, though.

31
00:01:35,115 --> 00:01:37,349
Seems like a chore.

32
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,620
Aw, even Slinky from Accounting
can make it up the stairs.

33
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:42,789
Don't forget to turn in
your time card, Peter.

34
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,757
What are you, allergic to money?

35
00:01:44,758 --> 00:01:46,859
Ha ha. No. No, I want to get paid.

36
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,195
Just forgot.

37
00:01:48,196 --> 00:01:50,197
Ugh, look at me.

38
00:01:50,198 --> 00:01:53,300
I haven't felt this out of shape
since I took surfing lessons.

39
00:01:53,301 --> 00:01:54,967
Boy, this is harder than I thought.

40
00:01:54,968 --> 00:01:56,703
My arms are getting really tired.

41
00:01:56,704 --> 00:01:58,805
Nah, you're fine. Just keep goin'.

42
00:01:58,806 --> 00:02:01,741
Tai, your positivity is infectious!

43
00:02:01,742 --> 00:02:03,877
All right, P-Town, wave comin' in.

44
00:02:03,878 --> 00:02:07,381
I'm just gonna give you a little
push, and you just stand up.

45
00:02:26,234 --> 00:02:29,735
Okay, so, welcome to the first meeting

46
00:02:29,736 --> 00:02:32,712
of our women's
creative writing workshop.

47
00:02:33,607 --> 00:02:35,610
Ladies.

48
00:02:37,344 --> 00:02:39,513
Okay, Donna, you want to read yours?

49
00:02:39,514 --> 00:02:40,992
Oh, I didn't do mine.

50
00:02:40,993 --> 00:02:44,683
Wha...? Well, then you can't
have any more snacks.

51
00:02:44,684 --> 00:02:46,086
You just can't.

52
00:02:46,087 --> 00:02:47,920
Well, I guess it's my turn.

53
00:02:47,921 --> 00:02:50,323
"Louise lowered her velvet hood,

54
00:02:50,324 --> 00:02:52,759
"letting loose her flowing red hair.

55
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,195
"Ignoring her friends' obvious
and understandable envy,

56
00:02:56,196 --> 00:02:59,431
"she confidently approached
the mysterious castle.

57
00:02:59,432 --> 00:03:00,866
"The doors blew open,

58
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:03,537
"as if some magical force
had been expecting her.

59
00:03:03,538 --> 00:03:05,472
"Louise belonged here,

60
00:03:05,473 --> 00:03:08,707
"if only because this is where
Horatio called home.

61
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:11,811
"Then, through the vegetation,
and past the mist

62
00:03:11,812 --> 00:03:15,549
"that sprinkled
her heaving bosom, she saw him.

63
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:20,052
"Horatio, with his long, flowing
hair blowing in the breeze,

64
00:03:20,053 --> 00:03:22,222
"his cape fluttering.

65
00:03:22,223 --> 00:03:23,723
"He had only two loves

66
00:03:23,724 --> 00:03:27,860
"in his life: his horses
and Louise's heaving bosom.

67
00:03:27,861 --> 00:03:31,063
"He grabbed her tighter than
she'd ever been held before.

68
00:03:31,064 --> 00:03:34,401
"A way in which her husband,
Paulter, had not held her

69
00:03:34,402 --> 00:03:36,468
"since before they were married.

70
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:38,572
"Horatio then took Louise by the hand,

71
00:03:38,573 --> 00:03:42,241
"leading her out to his stables
as her bosom heaved.

72
00:03:42,242 --> 00:03:44,711
"Louise's mind was racing
in anticipation

73
00:03:44,712 --> 00:03:48,247
"of the dirty hay sex that was
gonna most definitely happen.

74

"As the two lovers entangled into one

75
00:03:50,585 --> 00:03:52,885
"atop the probably peed-on hay,

00:03:52,886 --> 00:03:54,920
"Louise's bosom heaved.

77
00:03:54,921 --> 00:03:57,056
"They spent the next 18 minutes

78
00:03:57,057 --> 00:04:00,493
"fighting off sneezes,
in the throes of ecstasy.

79
00:04:00,494 --> 00:04:02,195
Heaving bosom."

80
00:04:02,196 --> 00:04:05,532
- Damn, that's steamy, Lois.
- Really?

81
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:08,001
Uh,<i> yeah,</i> really. Phew!

82
00:04:08,002 --> 00:04:10,035
Anybody mind if I open me?

83
00:04:10,036 --> 00:04:12,438
Ah!

84
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:15,509
See you in the shower, ladies.

85
00:04:19,713 --> 00:04:21,114
What am I gonna do?

86
00:04:21,115 --> 00:04:23,215
I've been here all day,
and I can't move.

87
00:04:23,216 --> 00:04:27,889
I got it. I'll do what
James Franco did in<i> 127 Hours.</i>

88
00:04:29,023 --> 00:04:30,887
<i>UCLA admissions office.</i>

89
00:04:30,888 --> 00:04:32,868
Yes, I'd like to enroll
in a couple of classes

90
00:04:32,869 --> 00:04:35,962
so I can have sex with girls
not old enough to get into bars.

91
00:04:35,963 --> 00:04:38,601
Peter! I heard you're in some trouble!

92
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,097
I'm stuck! I don't want to die here!

93
00:04:42,098 --> 00:04:44,970
I just want to go to
my desk and surf the Internet.

94
00:04:44,971 --> 00:04:47,608
Hang on, Peter.
I'll come up and save you.

95
00:04:49,809 --> 00:04:51,410
Stairs.

96
00:04:51,411 --> 00:04:53,979
Why'd it have to be stairs?

97
00:05:10,831 --> 00:05:14,960
I can't do it. Here, you're just
gonna have to kill me.

98
00:05:14,961 --> 00:05:16,932
Wait. Look, Joe.

99
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:19,772
A lever to turn the stairs into a slide.

100
00:05:22,175 --> 00:05:23,443
Damn it, Peter!

101
00:05:23,444 --> 00:05:25,578
It's just a little water.
What's it gonna hurt?

102
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:26,845
Oh, God!

103
00:05:26,846 --> 00:05:29,181
Delete... history.

104
00:05:29,182 --> 00:05:30,651
No.

105
00:05:31,685 --> 00:05:34,521
No!

106
00:05:43,831 --> 00:05:47,545
Peter, you caused millions of
dollars' worth of water damage,

107
00:05:47,546 --> 00:05:50,270
all because you couldn't
make it up the stairs.

108
00:05:50,271 --> 00:05:53,966
Aw, man. This means I'm the work fatty.

109
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:55,207
I haven't been this embarrassed
since I forgot

110
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:58,210
about the silent part
in George Michael's "Faith."

111
00:05:58,211 --> 00:06:00,212
<i>Well, I need someone to hold me</i>

112
00:06:00,213 --> 00:06:02,448
<i>But I wait for something more</i>

113
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:04,717
I've started using these pills
called Stiff for Hours

114
00:06:04,718 --> 00:06:06,152
from the gas station.

115
00:06:06,153 --> 00:06:07,787
<i>'Cause I got to have faith</i>

116
00:06:07,788 --> 00:06:10,624
<i>Mmm, I got to have faith.</i>

117
00:06:15,957 --> 00:06:18,105
<i>Dog walking into a room</i>

118
00:06:18,106 --> 00:06:20,364
<i>There's food left on the table</i>

119
00:06:20,365 --> 00:06:22,234
<i>And my owners aren't around.</i>

120
00:06:22,235 --> 00:06:24,337
Just gonna do a little
paws-on-the-table,

121
00:06:24,338 --> 00:06:26,374
side-of-the-mouth dog eating.

122
00:06:37,601 --> 00:06:40,919
<i>A Stable Affair</i> by Lois Griffin.

123
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,192
Okay, another writer in the house.

124
00:06:48,195 --> 00:06:50,262
Oh, my God, this is amazing!

125
00:06:50,263 --> 00:06:52,031
This is basically a guide

126
00:06:52,032 --> 00:06:54,134
to what Lois is looking for in a lover.

127
00:06:54,135 --> 00:06:55,802
Check this out.

128
00:06:55,803 --> 00:06:58,137
Lois is writing a romance novel
about a woman

129
00:06:58,138 --> 00:07:00,040
who is unhappy with her husband

130
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,975
and begins to have a torrid affair

131
00:07:01,976 --> 00:07:04,276
with a caped lover who has horses.

132
00:07:04,277 --> 00:07:05,946
Don't you know what this is?

133
00:07:05,947 --> 00:07:08,882
It's a description
of her every fantasy and desire.

134
00:07:08,883 --> 00:07:10,827
This could finally be my key to...

135
00:07:10,828 --> 00:07:12,886
To what, banging my mom?

136
00:07:12,887 --> 00:07:14,818
You know, you are the worst.

137
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:16,355
Ladies.

138
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,331
Ugh! You guys, this is so embarrassing.

139
00:07:24,332 --> 00:07:25,632
All this happened

140
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:27,934
because I'm too fat
to make it up some stairs.

141
00:07:27,935 --> 00:07:29,377
Peter, you got to lose weight.

142
00:07:29,378 --> 00:07:31,646
I know. You guys got to help me, though.

143
00:07:31,647 --> 00:07:34,048
I can't do it on my own. I'm too weak.

144
00:07:34,049 --> 00:07:35,517
All right, we'll help you, Peter,

145
00:07:35,518 --> 00:07:37,185
but we're doing it Quagsberry rules.

146
00:07:37,186 --> 00:07:38,452
What's that?

147
00:07:38,453 --> 00:07:40,221
A woman... or in this case, a man...

148
00:07:40,222 --> 00:07:42,690
Has to do anything I say,
no questions asked.

149
00:07:42,691 --> 00:07:44,625
Anything, I promise.

150
00:07:44,626 --> 00:07:46,461
<i>My dearest Lois,</i>

151
00:07:46,462 --> 00:07:47,896
<i>I've taken Quagmire's place</i>

152
00:07:47,897 --> 00:07:50,397
<i>as a Union soldier in the Civil War.</i>

153
00:07:50,398 --> 00:07:53,868
<i>Shortly after I arrived,
they amputated my leg.</i>

154
00:07:53,869 --> 00:07:56,671
<i>I dared them to,
and it was a big mistake.</i>

155
00:07:56,672 --> 00:07:59,541
<i>The other guy in my tent
is a wet dead guy.</i>

156
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:01,766
<i>Yours, Peter.</i>

157
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:10,819
All right, Peter, today we start
helping you lose weight.

158
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,252
First, let me just make sure

159
00:08:12,253 --> 00:08:14,488
you're not hiding any food
in your clothes.

160
00:08:15,825 --> 00:08:19,761
Taste. Taste. Taste the rainbow.

161
00:08:19,762 --> 00:08:21,898
Peter, are you hiding Skittles
in your pants?

162
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,499
Is that all of 'em?

163
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,503
Just-just give me a second.

164
00:08:30,605 --> 00:08:33,507
When I turned about 40,
it started breaking up into two.

165
00:08:33,508 --> 00:08:34,843
Weekend plans?

166
00:08:34,844 --> 00:08:36,512
Please don't talk to me.
I need to focus.

167
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,188
Good morrow!

168
00:08:47,189 --> 00:08:50,425
What is thee, uh, up to?

169
00:08:50,426 --> 00:08:51,959
Brian, is that your horse?

170
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,460
Wh-When did you get a horse?

171
00:08:53,461 --> 00:08:55,262
Oh, I've been an Equus for a while.

172
00:08:55,263 --> 00:08:57,531
The play with Harry Potter's penis?

173
00:08:57,532 --> 00:08:59,868
Just my trusty steed here.

174
00:08:59,869 --> 00:09:01,324
We have a special connection.

175
00:09:01,325 --> 00:09:03,637
Me being an equestrianist
and everything.

176
00:09:03,638 --> 00:09:05,906
I-I had no idea you were into horses.

177
00:09:05,907 --> 00:09:07,374
Sexy, huh?

178
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,643
No, seems like a hassle, and expensive.

179
00:09:09,644 --> 00:09:11,478
How do you pay for it all?

180
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:13,948
Well, the costs are meager
when you're able to dominate

181
00:09:13,949 --> 00:09:17,721
and control the beast with
just... the slightest glance.

182
00:09:18,695 --> 00:09:20,262
Stop it.

183
00:09:20,263 --> 00:09:21,829
Ha, ha! What?!

184
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,264
This is nuts!

185
00:09:23,265 --> 00:09:25,968
Anyway, I've been speaking to
my horse in the silent language

186
00:09:25,969 --> 00:09:27,935
of knowing, and I...

187
00:09:27,936 --> 00:09:30,104
Never walk behind a horse.

188
00:09:30,105 --> 00:09:32,807
You would have to hate horses
not to know that.

189
00:09:32,808 --> 00:09:34,343
Being one with nature.

190
00:09:35,611 --> 00:09:37,179
A mutual bond of trust.

191
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:40,849
Different species, same heart.

192
00:09:51,326 --> 00:09:54,730
You're dethspicable.

193
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,968
Welcome to CrossFit, Peter.

194
00:09:59,969 --> 00:10:01,802
How's it different from a regular gym?

195
00:10:01,803 --> 00:10:03,906
Do regular gyms have open garage doors

196
00:10:03,907 --> 00:10:06,874
where members' large dogs
can charge innocent civilians?

197
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,410
No, I... I guess not.

198
00:10:08,411 --> 00:10:10,012
Okay, to start,
why don't you go meet the owner,

199
00:10:10,013 --> 00:10:11,579
Jayce, over there?

200
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,621
He'll help maximize
your nutrition regimen.

201
00:10:14,622 --> 00:10:17,656
- Hi, I'm Peter.
- Hey, man. Jayce with a "Y."

202
00:10:17,657 --> 00:10:18,670
Yeah, I figured.

203
00:10:18,671 --> 00:10:20,504
So, to start out, like, uh,

204
00:10:20,505 --> 00:10:22,840
tell me, what's
your favorite kind of food?

205
00:10:22,841 --> 00:10:24,843
Pizza.

206
00:10:24,844 --> 00:10:26,667
- Oh, man.
- What?

207
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,012
You, uh...

208
00:10:29,013 --> 00:10:30,681
y-you can't eat pizza.

209
00:10:30,682 --> 00:10:32,349
Why not?

210
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,017
It's, uh... it's...

211
00:10:34,018 --> 00:10:35,519
Uh, it's...

212
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,687
it's bad.

213
00:10:36,688 --> 00:10:38,690
Why?

214
00:10:38,691 --> 00:10:40,959
Because, uh, it's, like, uh...

215
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,960
pretty bad for you.

216
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:44,094
But what makes it bad?

217
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,696
Oh.

218
00:10:45,697 --> 00:10:48,565
Yeah, no, it's, like, uh...

219
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:50,969
like, probably one
of the worst things you can eat.

220
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,304
How come?

221
00:10:53,305 --> 00:10:57,208
Uh, uh, because, of, like,
the ingredients in it.

222
00:10:57,209 --> 00:10:59,310
Which ones?

223
00:10:59,311 --> 00:11:01,311
Uh, I mean, yeah, like,

224
00:11:01,312 --> 00:11:03,214
basically, all of them.

225
00:11:03,215 --> 00:11:04,983
Name one.

226
00:11:04,984 --> 00:11:06,584
Yeah, I... yeah, I mean...

227
00:11:06,585 --> 00:11:08,719
you said... your-your words,

228
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,921
uh... pizza.

229
00:11:09,922 --> 00:11:11,455
All right,
I'm cutting this off right now.

230
00:11:11,456 --> 00:11:14,725
It's clear you're an idiot
and deserve no more of my time.

231
00:11:14,726 --> 00:11:17,494
Oh, Peter, you're home from CrossFit.

232
00:11:17,495 --> 00:11:18,562
Here, have some pizza.

233
00:11:18,563 --> 00:11:20,064
Oh.

234
00:11:20,065 --> 00:11:22,400
Uh, you know what is in that?

235
00:11:22,401 --> 00:11:23,767
It's, like...

236
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:25,436
- It's very bad.
- What?

237
00:11:26,587 --> 00:11:28,907
Uh, wow.

238
00:11:28,908 --> 00:11:31,109
Okay, Peter,
a good and conspicuous workout

239
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,076
is to do lunges on the sidewalk.

240
00:11:33,077 --> 00:11:34,244
Just do like I do.

241
00:11:34,245 --> 00:11:35,747
- Step.
- Uh-huh.

242
00:11:35,748 --> 00:11:38,315
- Step. Step.
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

243
00:11:38,316 --> 00:11:39,751
- Step.
- Uh-huh.

244
00:11:39,752 --> 00:11:42,586
- Step. Step.
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

245
00:11:42,587 --> 00:11:43,921
- Step.
- Uh-huh.

246
00:11:43,922 --> 00:11:46,657
- Step. Step.
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

247
00:11:46,658 --> 00:11:48,091
Step.

248
00:11:48,092 --> 00:11:49,761
- Step.
- Uh-huh.

249
00:11:49,762 --> 00:11:51,195
- Step.
- Uh-huh.

250
00:11:51,196 --> 00:11:54,331
- Step. Step.
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

251
00:11:54,332 --> 00:11:56,835
Step. Step.

252
00:11:56,836 --> 00:11:58,335
Step.

253
00:11:58,336 --> 00:12:00,137
Step. Step.

254
00:12:00,138 --> 00:12:02,473
Okay, Peter, whatever you do,

255
00:12:02,474 --> 00:12:04,275
don't look down the hole.

256
00:12:06,445 --> 00:12:08,613
Oh, God! I looked down the hole!

257
00:12:08,614 --> 00:12:11,215
Oh! I got a sense of what's down there!

258
00:12:11,216 --> 00:12:13,450
Okay, okay. All right,
you can still save this.

259
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:14,618
Just don't smell.

260
00:12:15,687 --> 00:12:17,689
Oh, God! I smelled everything!

261
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,458
Oh, it's so deep in my nose!

262
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,026
Okay, okay, whatever you do,

263
00:12:22,027 --> 00:12:24,528
do not dip your cupped hand
in the water.

264
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:26,864
Oh, God! I'm doing it!

265
00:12:26,865 --> 00:12:29,066
Oh, God! What is wrong with me?!

266
00:12:29,067 --> 00:12:31,569
The chemicals in the water
are not breaking down

267
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,503
the integrity of these movements!

268
00:12:33,504 --> 00:12:35,306
Okay, Peter, you can quit pretending.

269
00:12:35,307 --> 00:12:37,041
- The workout's over.
- Thanks.

270
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:38,810
I was just in there checking my phone.

271
00:12:38,811 --> 00:12:40,177
My phone!

272
00:12:43,047 --> 00:12:44,248
Okay, Peter,

273
00:12:44,249 --> 00:12:45,516
whatever you do,

274
00:12:45,517 --> 00:12:48,555
do not open your eyes underwater.

275
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,990
What the hell?

276
00:12:52,991 --> 00:12:55,158
I thought we were gonna get
a ten-dollar scoop of ice cream

277
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,661
with all the millennials who can afford

278
00:12:56,662 --> 00:12:58,162
ten-dollar scoops of ice cream

279
00:12:58,163 --> 00:13:00,163
but can't afford to move out
of their parents' house.

280
00:13:00,164 --> 00:13:02,099
We are. But first
I need to pick up this wine

281
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,767
that Lois mentioned in her story.

282
00:13:03,768 --> 00:13:06,170
Where's that part about the wine?

283
00:13:06,171 --> 00:13:09,273
"The doors magically opened."

284
00:13:09,274 --> 00:13:11,341
"Chill came over her."

285
00:13:11,342 --> 00:13:13,176
"Through the vegetation."

286
00:13:13,177 --> 00:13:15,846
"Light mist."

287
00:13:15,847 --> 00:13:18,583
Uh, Brian, everything you read
just happened to us.

288
00:13:18,584 --> 00:13:21,719
I think her book
is about the grocery store.

289
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,788
Oh... my... God.

290
00:13:24,789 --> 00:13:25,858
What?

291
00:13:32,697 --> 00:13:35,099
It's the guy, Horatio, from Lois's book.

292
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,536
She's fantasizing about having
an affair with this guy.

293
00:13:38,537 --> 00:13:41,772
Or, who knows, maybe even<i>
is</i> having an affair with him.

294
00:13:41,773 --> 00:13:43,708
Excuse me, where are the crackers?

295
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:45,575
What? We don't work here.

296
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:48,146
We're a dog and a baby. I... do I...

297
00:13:48,147 --> 00:13:50,113
Do my-do my clothes
make it look like I work here?

298
00:13:50,114 --> 00:13:51,883
I think it's the overalls, yeah.

299
00:13:51,884 --> 00:13:53,383
Hey, get back to work.

300
00:13:53,384 --> 00:13:54,585
I'll see you back at home, Brian.

301
00:13:54,586 --> 00:13:55,888
I've got to finish my shift.

302
00:14:05,931 --> 00:14:06,931
I don't get it.

303
00:14:06,932 --> 00:14:08,900
You've gained 12 pounds.

304
00:14:08,901 --> 00:14:11,234
Looks like we're gonna have
to take more drastic measures.

305
00:14:11,235 --> 00:14:13,570
Peter, say you're
not gonna have sex with me.

306
00:14:13,571 --> 00:14:14,738
- What?
- Just say it.

307
00:14:14,739 --> 00:14:16,239
I'm not gonna have sex with you.

308
00:14:18,344 --> 00:14:20,078
Guys, let me out of here!

309
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,080
No! You said you would do
whatever's necessary

310
00:14:22,081 --> 00:14:23,447
to help you lose weight.

311
00:14:23,448 --> 00:14:25,083
Please, let me out!

312
00:14:25,084 --> 00:14:27,417
Glenn, is it okay if I stay the night?

313
00:14:27,418 --> 00:14:28,922
Oh!

314
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,425
Rancor, what are you doing here?

315
00:14:34,426 --> 00:14:35,960
I'm trying to diet, too.

316
00:14:35,961 --> 00:14:37,494
Eating too many pig guys?

317
00:14:37,495 --> 00:14:40,031
I thought it was the pig guys,
but, you know what,

318
00:14:40,032 --> 00:14:42,134
it was the bread.

319
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,507
I'm so hungry!

320
00:14:49,508 --> 00:14:51,109
Let me out!

321
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,777
I'll tell you what...
First guy that lets me out

322
00:14:52,778 --> 00:14:54,445
gets his own spin-off.

323
00:14:54,446 --> 00:14:55,546
Not you, Cleveland.

324
00:14:55,547 --> 00:14:57,382
Sorry, Peter, this is for your own good!

325
00:14:57,383 --> 00:15:00,455
Yeah, you told us you would do
anything to lose weight!

326
00:15:00,456 --> 00:15:02,453
I lied! I just want to be free,

327
00:15:02,454 --> 00:15:05,656
like a recently divorced man
with no kids!

328
00:15:08,893 --> 00:15:10,460
This is nice.

329
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:12,302
This is better.

330
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:17,468
Stewie, I can't believe it.

331
00:15:17,469 --> 00:15:19,637
I mean, do-do you think
Lois could be having an affair

332
00:15:19,638 --> 00:15:20,738
with this Horatio guy?

333
00:15:20,739 --> 00:15:22,407
Brian, will you watch Stewie?

334
00:15:22,408 --> 00:15:23,740
I have to go get groceries

335
00:15:23,741 --> 00:15:25,676
and won't be back until later tonight.

336
00:15:25,677 --> 00:15:27,311
Uh, yeah, sure.

337
00:15:27,312 --> 00:15:28,812
Oh, my God, Stewie,
she's going to the store

338
00:15:28,813 --> 00:15:30,480
and won't be back until tonight?

339
00:15:30,481 --> 00:15:32,215
Do you know what that means?

340
00:15:32,216 --> 00:15:35,018
Disguises?

341
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:37,754
No, but we should follow her and
see what the hell is going on.

342
00:15:37,755 --> 00:15:39,089
Stewie-Chan!

343
00:15:43,494 --> 00:15:44,594
I'll meet you there, Brian.

344
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:46,398
I've got to finish my shift.

345
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,206
All right, Peter, now, I know
you haven't eaten in a while,

346
00:15:56,207 --> 00:15:59,042
so this is something called
the Pocket Diet.

347
00:15:59,043 --> 00:16:00,578
Okay, guys, empty your pockets.

348
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:03,346
Whatever you got in there, he eats.

349
00:16:03,347 --> 00:16:06,716
Uh, Glenn, can we go somewhere
and just talk for a minute?

350
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:07,786
Aah!

351
00:16:09,187 --> 00:16:10,955
Guys, stop saying things, all right?

352
00:16:10,956 --> 00:16:12,553
I will say the things.

353
00:16:22,868 --> 00:16:23,868
Oh, my God.

354
00:16:23,869 --> 00:16:25,204
He's getting in the car.

355
00:16:26,538 --> 00:16:27,705
He's going in for a hug.

356
00:16:27,706 --> 00:16:29,373
They're hugging! This is insane!

357
00:16:29,374 --> 00:16:31,242
I know. This guy.

358
00:16:31,243 --> 00:16:34,313
This guy is a star.

359
00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:40,084
I can't believe it, Stewie.
She picked him up.

360
00:16:40,085 --> 00:16:41,085
They hugged.

361
00:16:41,086 --> 00:16:42,386
Lois is having an affair.

362
00:16:42,387 --> 00:16:44,555
We've got to stop them.

363
00:16:44,556 --> 00:16:47,557
Aw, great.

364
00:16:47,558 --> 00:16:50,560
Just great.

365
00:17:09,614 --> 00:17:12,083
Lois, don't do it!

366
00:17:12,084 --> 00:17:13,084
Brian?

367
00:17:13,085 --> 00:17:14,619
What the hell are you doing here?

368
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,086
Don't do what?

369
00:17:16,087 --> 00:17:17,255
Don't have sex with Horatio!

370
00:17:17,256 --> 00:17:18,421
It's not worth it!

371
00:17:18,422 --> 00:17:19,690
What are you talking about?

372
00:17:19,691 --> 00:17:21,825
Look, I found your book and read it.

373
00:17:21,826 --> 00:17:23,427
I thought that you wrote

374
00:17:23,428 --> 00:17:25,095
everything you were looking for
in a lover,

375
00:17:25,096 --> 00:17:27,931
and, if I could embody some
of those things,

376
00:17:27,932 --> 00:17:30,200
maybe I would have a shot with you.

377
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:31,935
But then I found out Horatio is real,

378
00:17:31,936 --> 00:17:34,104
and-and I couldn't bear to see
you do something like this

379
00:17:34,105 --> 00:17:35,539
to the family.

380
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,374
It's not you, Lois.

381
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,442
Wait, let me get this straight.

382
00:17:39,443 --> 00:17:42,113
You, without asking,
read something I wrote?

383
00:17:42,114 --> 00:17:43,847
Then, thinking I was revealing

384
00:17:43,848 --> 00:17:46,183
all my most intimate wants and desires,

385
00:17:46,184 --> 00:17:47,684
you thought that you could exploit

386
00:17:47,685 --> 00:17:49,953
what you read to seduce me?

387
00:17:49,954 --> 00:17:51,822
But when you thought I might be cheating

388
00:17:51,823 --> 00:17:53,324
with someone other than yourself,

389
00:17:53,325 --> 00:17:56,326
you found that, and only that,
morally objectionable?

390
00:17:56,327 --> 00:17:57,995
And you bring Stewie here,

391
00:17:57,996 --> 00:18:00,064
who doesn't understand any of this?!

392
00:18:00,065 --> 00:18:02,533
I predict, in the finale,
everyone can understand me.

393
00:18:02,534 --> 00:18:04,235
That'd make a good finale, right?

394
00:18:04,236 --> 00:18:06,069
Brian, this is Horatio.

395
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,805
He's special.

396
00:18:07,806 --> 00:18:09,574
I know you think he's special.

397
00:18:09,575 --> 00:18:10,975
No, he's special.

398
00:18:10,976 --> 00:18:12,809
He's learning disabled.

399
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,179
I like Coldplay.

400
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,315
- Ooh...
- Oh...

401
00:18:17,316 --> 00:18:19,482
I'm not having an affair
with him, Brian.

402
00:18:19,483 --> 00:18:22,085
I volunteered at the special
needs living facility,

403
00:18:22,086 --> 00:18:24,221
and Horatio happened to like horses.

404
00:18:24,222 --> 00:18:26,390
So, once a week,
I take him to the stables.

405
00:18:26,391 --> 00:18:29,559
And the cape is from a Darth
Vader costume he had as a kid.

406
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,028
Did you know he's the boss
of the stormtroopers?

407
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:34,664
Yes, I have fantasies
about him dominating me

408
00:18:34,665 --> 00:18:35,999
with his idiot strength.

409
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,335
But it's just that...

410
00:18:37,336 --> 00:18:38,702
A fantasy.

411
00:18:38,703 --> 00:18:40,438
That's why I wrote it in a story,

412
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:43,440
because I knew
that I would never act on it.

413
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:45,042
Ugh. I never thought a dog

414
00:18:45,043 --> 00:18:47,711
could be such a genuine piece
of human garbage.

415
00:18:47,712 --> 00:18:49,046
Lois,

416
00:18:49,047 --> 00:18:51,248
I'm truly sorry for what I thought.

417
00:18:51,249 --> 00:18:53,584
It all just made sense to me
at the time.

418
00:18:53,585 --> 00:18:55,920
But now that I see what it is,

419
00:18:55,921 --> 00:18:58,055
I'm ashamed of myself.

420
00:18:58,056 --> 00:18:59,923
I hope you can find it in your heart...

421
00:18:59,924 --> 00:19:01,259
Hey, Bri.

422
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:04,544
There's a good girl.

423
00:19:08,066 --> 00:19:09,133
Joe and Cleveland,

424
00:19:09,134 --> 00:19:11,370
are you ready to see your new Peter?

425
00:19:16,107 --> 00:19:19,043
What do you guys think?

426
00:19:19,044 --> 00:19:20,377
I don't believe it.

427
00:19:20,378 --> 00:19:21,778
I'm speechless.

428
00:19:23,781 --> 00:19:26,730
Hey, look, it's Jonah Hill sometimes!

429
00:19:33,557 --> 00:19:34,892
Wow!

430
00:19:34,893 --> 00:19:36,893
Looking good, Peter.

431
00:19:36,894 --> 00:19:39,563
Yes. I might want me
a little taste of that.

432
00:19:39,564 --> 00:19:41,565
Oh, well, Sheila, look out.

433
00:19:41,566 --> 00:19:43,800
Be careful what you ask for,
'cause you never know...

434
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:45,670
I might... Are-are you serious?

435
00:19:45,671 --> 00:19:47,270
'Cause I will do this, 100%.

436
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:48,471
My wife's in, too. I'll call her.

437
00:19:48,472 --> 00:19:50,007
We'll do a whole thing.

438
00:19:50,008 --> 00:19:52,677
Hey, Lois, I got a two-top.

439
00:19:52,678 --> 00:19:53,744
Okay.

440
00:19:53,745 --> 00:19:55,748
She's out, but I'm still in.

441
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:02,319
Boy, I got to admit,

442
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,921
I feel a little sheepish
to get so fooled

443
00:20:03,922 --> 00:20:06,123
by a silly little book that Lois wrote.

444
00:20:06,124 --> 00:20:08,425
Yes, but, you know, I think
what we missed in all of this

445
00:20:08,426 --> 00:20:11,862
is that Lois wrote a beginning,
middle, and end to something.

446
00:20:11,863 --> 00:20:13,530
What have you written lately, Brian?

447
00:20:13,531 --> 00:20:15,498
Well, nothing, but, you know,
I think-I think

448
00:20:15,499 --> 00:20:17,133
any writer knows how hard it is

449
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:18,768
to be staring at that blank page.

450
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:21,104
Sounds like you did write something:

451
00:20:21,105 --> 00:20:22,773
your career's obituary.

452
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:26,376
Well, that's our dog and baby.

453
00:20:26,377 --> 00:20:28,278
Hi, this is Chris Griffin.

454
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:31,281
Boy, Lois had some
amorous adventures this week.

455
00:20:31,282 --> 00:20:33,517
But you know what really turns<i> me</i> on?

456
00:20:33,518 --> 00:20:34,852
Reading.

457
00:20:34,853 --> 00:20:36,787
Why don't you get yourself
down to the library

458
00:20:36,788 --> 00:20:38,288
and open up a book.

459
00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:40,524
Here's a few of my favorite books.

460
00:20:40,525 --> 00:20:42,727
J.D. Salinger's<i> Catcher in the Rye.</i>

461
00:20:42,728 --> 00:20:45,395
<i>The Kite Runner</i> by Khaled Hosseini.

462
00:20:45,396 --> 00:20:48,132
And, of course,<i> The Dirt</i> by Motley Crue.

463
00:20:48,133 --> 00:20:50,200
Seriously, read<i> The Dirt.</i>

464
00:20:50,201 --> 00:20:52,969
They snort a row of live ants
like cocaine.

465
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,672
Remember, kids, a library card is free,

466
00:20:55,673 --> 00:20:57,975
but knowledge is priceless.

467
00:20:57,976 --> 00:20:59,982
Get that<i> Dirt</i> book.

468
00:20:59,983 --> 00:21:03,983
