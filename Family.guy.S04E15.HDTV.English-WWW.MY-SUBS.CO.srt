00:00:34,973 --> 00:00:37,646
- A-Team roll call. Face?
- Here and handsome.

2
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:40,247
- Murdock?
- Here, and crazy!

3
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:42,244
- BA?
- I pity the fool.

4
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:45,291
But I also suggest ways
he may better himself.

5
00:00:45,373 --> 00:00:50,447
This is gonna be a fun day. Much better than
that day I tried TAG body spray for sick cats.

6
00:00:54,573 --> 00:00:56,928
Oh. Oh. Oh, God. Oh, God.

7
00:00:58,813 --> 00:01:00,849
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

8
00:01:04,253 --> 00:01:08,804
You're cute. You're cute.
I don't wanna pet you, though.

9
00:01:08,893 --> 00:01:10,884
Oh, all right.

10
00:01:12,413 --> 00:01:15,166
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?

11
00:01:15,253 --> 00:01:18,290
Oh! Oh, no! OK, no.
Yeah, no, this spray is not for me.

12
00:01:21,053 --> 00:01:24,045
- Brian, what are you doing here?
- You lookjust like ALF.

13
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:27,045
<i>I'm not ALF.
I'm Douglas Brackman from L.A. Law.</i>

14
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:29,567
<i>I'm writing an article
for the Daily Shopper.</i>

15
00:01:29,653 --> 00:01:32,690
You'll have a lot to write
after we win the costume contest.

16
00:01:32,773 --> 00:01:34,923
Hey, check it out. Bill Cosby aerobics.

17
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:44,488
OK, everyone, Alan Thicke will be up
in a minute to answer your hate mail,

18
00:01:44,573 --> 00:01:50,443
but first, the winners of this year's costume
contest, the A-Team with the real black guy.

19
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:56,650
OK, you can stop with that cigar now, Gary.
My sinuses will thank you.

20
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:07,969
<i>Brian, I read your article in the Daily Shopper.
It was wonderful.</i>

21
00:02:08,053 --> 00:02:10,726
- Don't oversell it, Lois.
- No, it was good.

22
00:02:10,813 --> 00:02:13,407
It almost felt like it was written
by a real writer.

23
00:02:13,493 --> 00:02:17,122
I read your article too. You should spend
less time working for the paper

24
00:02:17,213 --> 00:02:21,604
and more time working
on that novel you've been working on.

25
00:02:21,693 --> 00:02:22,682
Brian.

26
00:02:22,773 --> 00:02:25,970
<i>This is Wellesley Shepherdson
calling from The New Yorker.</i>

27
00:02:26,053 --> 00:02:30,604
- Perhaps you've heard of us?
- Yeah, of course I've heard of you.

28
00:02:30,693 --> 00:02:34,766
<i>I was using the Daily Shopper to shoo away
a homeless person and I saw your article.</i>

29
00:02:34,853 --> 00:02:38,607
We'd love to talk to you about
becoming a contributor. Come by tomorrow.

30
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:40,524
Wow, yeah, that'd be great.

31
00:02:40,613 --> 00:02:43,844
<i>Two o'clock. They want me
to contribute to The New Yorker.</i>

32
00:02:43,933 --> 00:02:47,562
<i>The New Yorker? You'll fit in there
as well as I did at Woodstock.</i>

33
00:02:47,653 --> 00:02:53,011
Excuse me, it's been brought to my attention
that a few bad apples are smoking marijuana.

34
00:02:53,093 --> 00:02:56,165
I've got news for you, my friend.
Marijuana's illegal.

35
00:02:56,253 --> 00:02:58,084
Not cool. All right, then.

36
00:03:05,053 --> 00:03:06,771
- You suck!
- Learn the rules!

37
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:12,050
Our writers' lounge,
where you'll meet some contributors.

38
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:14,203
- Fielding Wellingtonsworth.
- Hello.

39
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:16,409
- Livingston Winstofford.
- Yes.

40
00:03:16,493 --> 00:03:19,485
- Amelia Bedford-Furthington-Chesterhill.
- Good day.

41
00:03:19,573 --> 00:03:22,212
And James William Bottomtooth.

42
00:03:23,213 --> 00:03:26,888
- This is Brian, our newest contributor.
- Hi, there. How's it going?

43
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,850
- Would you like some tea?
- Cigar?

44
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:31,322
Brandy?

45
00:03:31,413 --> 00:03:34,371
- No, I'm good, thanks.
- We read your article, Brian.

46
00:03:34,453 --> 00:03:38,685
Your study in postmodern American
subcultures was quite illuminating.

47
00:03:38,773 --> 00:03:41,446
Wow, thanks.
That means a lot coming from you guys.

48
00:03:44,733 --> 00:03:46,724
I'm sorry?

49
00:03:49,493 --> 00:03:51,484
Yes?

50
00:03:55,013 --> 00:03:58,688
- Is there a bathroom around here?
- Yes, yes, follow me.

51
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:04,452
<i>- Where are the toilets?
- No one at The New Yorker has an anus.</i>

52
00:04:07,253 --> 00:04:11,929
Peter, it's been two weeks. Don't you think
it's time to take off your A-Team costume?

53
00:04:12,013 --> 00:04:16,882
Yeah, I guess so, but part of me wished we
could just be the A-Team forever, you know?

54
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:20,522
Oh, this damn chair keeps wobbling.
I think one of the legs is short.

55
00:04:20,613 --> 00:04:25,482
- Lance, I told you to fix that chair.
- I checked it earlier. It seems fine.

56
00:04:26,813 --> 00:04:30,044
That chair's always like that. We'll help you.

57
00:04:34,093 --> 00:04:35,162
Wow, thanks.

58
00:04:35,253 --> 00:04:40,566
Hey, if we could fix that wobbly chair, think
of what else we could do for our community.

59
00:04:40,653 --> 00:04:45,932
Cleveland's right. It seems it's our destiny
to be the A-Team after all.

60
00:04:46,013 --> 00:04:48,049
We're the A-Team, yeah!

61
00:04:48,573 --> 00:04:54,330
In 2005, a group of local misfits won
a costume contest at an '80s TV convention.

62
00:04:54,413 --> 00:04:57,689
These men promptly returned home
and drank some beer.

63
00:04:57,773 --> 00:05:00,128
Today they survive as soldiers of fortune.

64
00:05:00,213 --> 00:05:04,206
If you have a problem, if no one else can help,
and if you can find them,

65
00:05:04,293 --> 00:05:06,648
maybe you can hire the A-Team.

66
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:48,571
<i>So I said to him, "Brown liquor before
Labor Day? What, do you work for Esquire?"</i>

67
00:05:48,653 --> 00:05:51,963
Oh, Brian, how droll.
We'll have to put that into a cartoon,

68
00:05:52,053 --> 00:05:54,772
or as we call it,
an illustrated laughing square.

69
00:05:54,853 --> 00:05:58,243
You went to Harvard? I'm an Ivy-League man
myself. I went to Brown.

70
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:02,963
My incarcerated business partner's retarded
gay niece went to Brown. What year?

71
00:06:03,053 --> 00:06:05,362
Well, I mean, I didn't technically graduate.

72
00:06:05,453 --> 00:06:07,842
You're a college dropout?

73
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:12,370
<i>Brian, The New Yorker does not employ
your kind. You, sir, are fired.</i>

74
00:06:25,693 --> 00:06:30,767
I can't believe they fired you. How come you
never told us you dropped out of college?

75
00:06:30,853 --> 00:06:33,321
<i>I saw an Afterschool Special about that.</i>

76
00:06:33,413 --> 00:06:37,929
It didn't work out too well for Kristy
McNichol, but then again, nothing did.

77
00:06:38,013 --> 00:06:42,165
I was only one course shy of graduating
and I just cracked under the pressure.

78
00:06:42,253 --> 00:06:44,528
Now itjust cost me the bestjob I ever had.

79
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:47,923
Don't take it too hard.
You're not the first person to get fired.

80
00:06:48,013 --> 00:06:52,006
Louis, the French people really
wanna thank you for your services as king,

81
00:06:52,093 --> 00:06:58,009
but, it's just not working out
and we've decided to go another way, so...

82
00:06:58,093 --> 00:06:59,446
Yeah.

83
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:02,809
I just heard the dog got fired.
Did I miss it? Did he cry yet?

84
00:07:02,893 --> 00:07:05,965
Oh, come on, dog. cry for me.
Ah, there you are.

85
00:07:06,053 --> 00:07:09,682
Oh, yeah, cry for Stewie.
Life isn't what you thought it would be.

86
00:07:09,773 --> 00:07:12,970
Boy, not graduating from college
has haunted me for years.

87
00:07:13,053 --> 00:07:16,841
Well, if you only had one class left
why don't you just go back and finish?

88
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:20,084
- Plenty of people do that.
- You know, that's not a bad idea.

89
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:24,086
Well, this is boring.
Let's go see what Meg is up to.

90
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:32,724
Hello, Meg...

91
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,563
- What are you doing here?
- Are you kidding?

92
00:07:57,653 --> 00:08:01,612
Miss watching you crash and burn in
this misguided attempt to finish college?

93
00:08:01,693 --> 00:08:04,844
You're not staying. I'll call Lois
and have her pick you up.

94
00:08:04,933 --> 00:08:08,164
Hi, I'm your roommate Caleb.
I like cutting myself.

95
00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:10,972
I bleed a lot. Can I have the top bunk?

96
00:08:11,053 --> 00:08:15,126
He already has a roommate - me.
We're a couple of crazy college kooks.

97
00:08:15,213 --> 00:08:18,364
We're about to make a hilarious
answering-machine message.

98
00:08:18,453 --> 00:08:21,650
You've reached Stewie and Brian.
We're not here right now.

99
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:24,805
If this is Mom, send money
because we're college students

100
00:08:24,893 --> 00:08:27,407
and we need money
for books and highlighters

101
00:08:27,493 --> 00:08:33,648
and ramen noodles and condoms
for sexual relations with our classmates.

102
00:08:36,253 --> 00:08:39,051
All right, fine, you can stay,
but what do I tell Lois?

103
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:42,284
You don't have to tell her.
Gary Coleman owed me a favour.

104
00:08:42,373 --> 00:08:46,685
- Stewie, you want more strained peas?
- What you talkin' 'bout, vile woman?

105
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,484
There she is, boys, all done.

106
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:54,612
The A-Team is ready to help rid the world
of injustice and evil.

107
00:08:55,213 --> 00:08:57,090
Yeah!

108
00:08:57,173 --> 00:08:59,368
- All right!
- Yeah!

109
00:09:12,293 --> 00:09:14,523
Let's do it!

110
00:09:22,413 --> 00:09:24,881
This is advanced physics, right?

111
00:09:24,973 --> 00:09:27,123
I have a right to defend myself as a woman!

112
00:09:27,213 --> 00:09:30,125
- No means no!
- What the hell is wrong with you?

113
00:09:30,213 --> 00:09:34,331
I'm sorry. I just came from that
orientation seminar about college dating.

114
00:09:34,413 --> 00:09:38,088
Hi, I'm Kelly McGillis,
and I'm here to talk to you about rape.

115
00:09:38,173 --> 00:09:40,971
Ladies, look to your left.
Now look to your right.

116
00:09:41,053 --> 00:09:45,205
Statistics indicate
that both of those men will rape you.

117
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,488
- I'm not gonna rape you.
- I might.

118
00:09:48,573 --> 00:09:51,849
- Good morning, class.
- Can I borrow a pencil?

119
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:57,053
- Now, now, it looks like we have a comedian.
- I wasn't making ajoke, I was just asking...

120
00:09:57,133 --> 00:10:01,172
Now, Louie Anderson, our first test is Friday,

121
00:10:01,253 --> 00:10:04,802
and if you don't pass you are out of the class.

122
00:10:06,653 --> 00:10:09,087
Fluffy! Fluffy, come down!

123
00:10:09,173 --> 00:10:11,607
Oh, Mommy, Daddy, what are we gonna do?

124
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:19,965
Don't you worry, sad little girl. The A-Team'll
get your beloved kitty down. Ready, boys?

125
00:10:32,293 --> 00:10:36,127
- No need to thank us, it's what we do.
- Who the hell are you guys?

126
00:10:37,573 --> 00:10:39,962
We're the A-Team.

127
00:10:45,013 --> 00:10:49,291
- Get off my property!
- Yeah, that's probably a good idea. Let's go.

128
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:56,013
What do you think?
I got this at the school store.

129
00:10:56,093 --> 00:11:00,405
<i>It's an MC Escher drawing.
I think it's called Crazy Stairs.</i>

130
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:05,362
Look, Stewie, I gotta finish this assignment
or I'm gonna fail this class.

131
00:11:05,453 --> 00:11:08,729
- All done.
- What? I can't use this. It'd be cheating.

132
00:11:08,813 --> 00:11:13,887
Fine. I'll be out on the quad. You know what
I've discovered since I've been in college?

133
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:17,090
I am so all about Ultimate Frisbee.

134
00:11:27,173 --> 00:11:29,926
<i>Oh, no! Did that hit Crazy Stairs?</i>

135
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,490
I graded your assignments.

136
00:11:34,573 --> 00:11:40,762
Clearly there is only one person here
who understands the material - Brian Griffin.

137
00:11:42,053 --> 00:11:44,248
Just got lucky, I guess.

138
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:47,370
No, Brian, I underestimated you.

139
00:11:47,453 --> 00:11:50,889
Here, let me put a smiley face on your test.

140
00:11:52,093 --> 00:11:54,527
May I borrow your pen?

141
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:58,288
You... Do you...
Do you want me to just stick it in there?

142
00:11:58,373 --> 00:12:00,170
Yes.

143
00:12:07,653 --> 00:12:10,042
There. You have earned that.

144
00:12:19,053 --> 00:12:21,886
- Hey, what's up B-Ri?
- Stewie, just give me a beer.

145
00:12:21,973 --> 00:12:26,330
I've had a bad day.
I cheated on that assignment.

146
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:30,850
You know, I haven't taken a shower since we
got here. I totally reek, man. Check this out.

147
00:12:30,933 --> 00:12:33,208
- Come on!
- Tell me that's not epic.

148
00:12:33,293 --> 00:12:37,445
I didn't come back to college to cheat
my way through. I wanted to do it on my own.

149
00:12:37,533 --> 00:12:39,683
Will you relax? Plenty of people cheat.

150
00:12:39,773 --> 00:12:42,162
Once again, Ashlee Simpson.

151
00:13:03,853 --> 00:13:07,766
Mom, look. They're tearing down
Roger Williams Park to build a strip mall.

152
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:11,243
Oh, no, I take Stewie there all the time,
don't I, sweetie?

153
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,324
Victory shall be mine.

154
00:13:13,413 --> 00:13:18,612
That's where I go to make out with
my boyfriend, Darren Mitchellstork.

155
00:13:18,693 --> 00:13:25,246
Yeah, he's the chairman
of the soccer ball team.

156
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:30,930
Well, all right. Make sure
you practise safe sex, Meg.

157
00:13:33,573 --> 00:13:35,564
You little liar!

158
00:13:35,653 --> 00:13:39,851
Roger Williams Park?
That sounds like ajob for the A-Team.

159
00:13:42,093 --> 00:13:43,765
- Hi, Dad!
- Go to your room.

160
00:13:43,853 --> 00:13:45,650
OK.

161
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:58,291
Ah, Brian, I am glad you could come
to my faculty cocktail party.

162
00:13:58,373 --> 00:14:00,887
Let me introduce my wife, Helen.

163
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:05,330
Dammit, Steve, you forgot
to put out the cheese and crackers.

164
00:14:05,413 --> 00:14:09,201
Helen, don't start with me
in front of our guests.

165
00:14:11,453 --> 00:14:14,206
Do you think I like hitting you?

166
00:14:14,293 --> 00:14:16,853
I am sorry you had to see that.

167
00:14:16,933 --> 00:14:20,482
Look, sir, I need to confess something.
That assignment I turned in...

168
00:14:20,573 --> 00:14:22,450
You know, Brian,

169
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:27,846
before you came along I was so depressed
I was planning to kill myself.

170
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,844
But you have inspired me.

171
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:34,006
If you can learn, maybe one day I can walk.

172
00:14:34,093 --> 00:14:36,687
Now, what was it you wanted to say?

173
00:14:36,773 --> 00:14:39,003
Nothing.

174
00:14:39,093 --> 00:14:42,847
You were supposed to get potato chips,
you jackass.

175
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:48,724
Dammit, Helen, get the hell off my back
or so help me... so help me...

176
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:52,245
Don't worry.
I hear they have great make-up sex.

177
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:57,282
- Oh, that feels so good.
- Oh, oh, oh. Oh, yeah. Like that.

178
00:14:57,373 --> 00:15:00,922
- Oh, baby.
- I thought about this all day.

179
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:08,567
Not so fast. You are hurting me.

180
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:15,807
- All right.
- Stewie, come on, we're going home.

181
00:15:15,893 --> 00:15:18,726
- What are you talking about?
- My final exam is tomorrow.

182
00:15:18,813 --> 00:15:23,250
Only way I'll pass is if I cheat. If I do, what
was the point of coming back to college?

183
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:28,248
We can't leave. It's almost half-time,
and we all pooped in the tuba.

184
00:15:30,493 --> 00:15:31,642
OK, we can go.

185
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:46,493
Hey, what are you guys doing?
This is ajob site.

186
00:15:46,573 --> 00:15:51,408
No, it's not. It's Roger Williams Park and
we're here to stop you from destroying it.

187
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:54,212
Whoa! What are you gonna do? Kill us?

188
00:15:54,293 --> 00:15:56,045
Oh, no, no. We wouldn't do that.

189
00:15:56,133 --> 00:15:59,523
We'll probably shoot the ground around you
to make you scared.

190
00:15:59,613 --> 00:16:03,128
Then you'll jump in your truck, speed off,
hit something and do a flip.

191
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:06,808
- That'd kill us.
- No, you'll just roll out and dust yourself off

192
00:16:06,893 --> 00:16:08,884
and lumber to your hideout, defeated.

193
00:16:08,973 --> 00:16:12,124
I had a cousin got in a fender-bender
at five miles an hour.

194
00:16:12,213 --> 00:16:16,445
Messed his neck up, he's got partial
numbness, he's just not the same guy.

195
00:16:16,533 --> 00:16:18,842
- Was he wearing his safety belt?
- Thank God.

196
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:22,050
Yeah, cos I know this guy
who took his car in for an oil change.

197
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:24,806
Later he got in a wreck
and the air bag didn't deploy.

198
00:16:24,893 --> 00:16:28,044
- Turns out they stole it, sold it for spares.
- No way.

199
00:16:28,133 --> 00:16:31,921
It happens. They call 'em chop shops.
Makes it harder to track stolen parts.

200
00:16:32,013 --> 00:16:34,083
Jeez, that is awful.

201
00:16:34,173 --> 00:16:37,324
Well, you got a lot of work to do.
We should get out of your hair.

202
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,404
- Take it easy, now.
- Yeah, see you.

203
00:16:39,493 --> 00:16:41,688
Be sure to put your tools away.

204
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:46,406
- We blew it, didn't we?
- Boy, you can say that again.

205
00:16:46,493 --> 00:16:51,089
We were ready to save Roger Williams Park
and we got sidetracked by idle conversation.

206
00:16:51,173 --> 00:16:54,643
- We're a terrible A-Team.
- The problem is we didn't stay focused.

207
00:16:54,733 --> 00:16:58,931
That's exactly it. We didn't stay focused.
I mean, we were right there,

208
00:16:59,013 --> 00:17:03,052
and then we just...
Somehow we just... I mean... It...

209
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:05,249
It's been said. We didn't stay focused.

210
00:17:06,773 --> 00:17:08,604
<i>Now back to The Facts of Life.</i>

211
00:17:08,693 --> 00:17:11,924
- Hey, Mrs Garrett, can I ask you something?
- What is it, Jo?

212
00:17:12,013 --> 00:17:14,811
Is it a problem
if your penis and your vagina touch?

213
00:17:14,893 --> 00:17:15,882
What?

214
00:17:15,973 --> 00:17:20,251
I try to keep 'em separated, but I woke up
this morning and they were sort of together.

215
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:23,484
- I just didn't know. Is that OK?
- You have both?

216
00:17:23,573 --> 00:17:27,009
- Well, yeah, doesn't everybody?
- No!

217
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:29,243
Brian, what are you doing home?

218
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:32,484
I couldn't do it.
I thought I'd be able to finish this time,

219
00:17:32,573 --> 00:17:35,770
but I just don't have what it takes
to be a college graduate.

220
00:17:35,853 --> 00:17:39,448
But you're so close.
I mean, your final exam's tomorrow.

221
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:43,048
You can't give up. You could study tonight.
I think if you work at it...

222
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:46,443
Lois, Lois. It's over, all right?
I'm not going.

223
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:48,922
Well, whatever you say.

224
00:17:49,013 --> 00:17:52,972
- Hey, what's in this closet?
- What are you doing?

225
00:17:53,053 --> 00:17:58,650
- Well, my my. Mr Hoover's come to visit.
- I don't wanna see Mr Hoover.

226
00:17:58,733 --> 00:18:01,486
I wonder if Mr Hoover has anything
to say about this.

227
00:18:01,573 --> 00:18:05,361
This is not funny.
I don't wanna see Mr Hoover.

228
00:18:05,813 --> 00:18:08,725
Stop! Stop it! Stop it! It's scaring me!

229
00:18:08,813 --> 00:18:11,646
Leave me alone! It's so loud!

230
00:18:11,733 --> 00:18:16,011
- Stop! Stop it! All right, OK, I'll study!
- I'll help you if you want.

231
00:18:16,093 --> 00:18:19,130
No thanks, Lois.
There's only one person who can help me.

232
00:18:47,013 --> 00:18:49,607
Drago!

233
00:18:53,453 --> 00:18:56,445
- The exam's in three hours.
- Crap. All we did was work out.

234
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:57,852
- We should study.
- Right.

235
00:19:00,653 --> 00:19:02,883
You're not wearing your costume any more.

236
00:19:02,973 --> 00:19:06,602
What's the point? I thought I could
help people with this A-Team thing,

237
00:19:06,693 --> 00:19:11,483
<i>but it turns out I'm as useless as
that nude Playboy spread of Debbie Gibson.</i>

238
00:19:11,573 --> 00:19:14,212
It's like, "She's naked, but who gives a shit?"

239
00:19:14,293 --> 00:19:16,887
Oh, my God, I overslept.
My exam's in 20 minutes.

240
00:19:16,973 --> 00:19:19,009
Brian, you'll never make it.

241
00:19:19,093 --> 00:19:24,247
Unless there was some kind of team
of people who could get you there in time.

242
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:27,006
Peter, do you know anybody like that?

243
00:19:37,453 --> 00:19:40,126
You may start your exam...

244
00:19:41,693 --> 00:19:43,570
now.

245
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,642
- Well, how'd you do?
- I failed.

246
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:53,485
- What? You failed?
- Yep.

247
00:19:53,573 --> 00:19:56,610
- What are you smiling for?
- Because I took it all the way.

248
00:19:56,693 --> 00:20:00,163
I didn't give up on myself, and I didn't cheat.

249
00:20:01,013 --> 00:20:03,447
- You probably should have.
- Yeah.

250
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:06,525
- You would've been better off.
- What were you thinking?

251
00:20:06,613 --> 00:20:09,605
Doesn't matter how it turned out.
I finished what I started,

252
00:20:09,693 --> 00:20:12,924
which means I have my pride,
and that's something.

253
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:15,447
- No, it's not.
- Are you out of your mind?

254
00:20:15,533 --> 00:20:17,649
- I don't understand.
- You're a loser.

255
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:19,451
I hate you!

256
00:20:49,293 --> 00:20:52,365

ENGLISH

258
00:21:30,948 --> 00:21:33,860
I am so bored.

259
00:21:33,948 --> 00:21:37,861
When you take a break from your lipstick,
how about taking me to the park?

260
00:21:37,948 --> 00:21:40,382
My lipstick? What...?

261
00:21:40,468 --> 00:21:44,256
Right. Right. Right, because of my penis.

262
00:21:44,348 --> 00:21:47,021
Yeah, that's fantastic.

263
00:21:47,108 --> 00:21:49,827
Lois, Brian won't take me to the park.

264
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:53,378
Then he talked about his ding-dong. Lois.

265
00:21:53,468 --> 00:21:57,097
Lois. Dammit, woman, pay attention to me.

266
00:21:57,188 --> 00:22:02,057
Stewie, that's not nice. Don't grab Mommy's
pants like that. You could really hurt her.

267
00:22:02,148 --> 00:22:06,107
Yes, I could, couldn't I? I could hurt Mommy.

268
00:22:06,188 --> 00:22:11,103
Shame on us, Rupert. How dare we succumb
to boredom while she continues to breathe?

269
00:22:11,188 --> 00:22:13,702
She must be destroyed.
With Lois out of the way,

270
00:22:13,788 --> 00:22:17,701
I could focus on my life's ambition
of taking pictures of Madison County.

271
00:22:20,108 --> 00:22:23,862
- Let's go back and take a bath.
- How about you go back and take a bath?

272
00:22:28,068 --> 00:22:31,822
- Have you filed those reports yet?
- Angela, come here. Check this out.

273
00:22:31,908 --> 00:22:36,538
Look at what this chick is doing
to this polar bear. Wait. Wait. It's...

274
00:22:36,628 --> 00:22:40,018
Wait. Wait. Wait, it's coming up.

275
00:22:42,668 --> 00:22:49,221
There you are, Opie. Congratulations.
You made employee of the month again.
