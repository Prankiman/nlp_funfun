(crowd yelling and screaming)

13
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,069
There it is,
you guys.

14
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,505
The best roller coaster
in all of Quahog.

15
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:42,742
The League of Extraordinary
Gentlemen: The Ride.

16
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,810
You know, I think they kind
of figured that movie

17
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,200
was going to turn out
to be bigger than it was.

18
00:00:46,225 --> 00:00:47,768
Oh, come on Lois,
it'll be awesome.

19
00:00:47,793 --> 00:00:49,245
It simulates all the fun of...

20
00:00:49,246 --> 00:00:51,446
of, um...
w-what was it now?

21
00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:53,883
It was like a... like a
tall guy in a black hat

22
00:00:53,951 --> 00:00:55,125
and a cape or something?

23
00:00:55,126 --> 00:00:56,227
Yeah, yeah, and there
was the guy

24
00:00:56,235 --> 00:00:58,126
with the
mask who wore a mask.

25
00:00:58,422 --> 00:00:59,789
And one guy
had an umbrella.

26
00:00:59,857 --> 00:01:01,825
Yeah, and I believe he
opened it at one point.

27
00:01:01,892 --> 00:01:03,460
Yeah, and it
wasn't overly long.

28
00:01:03,527 --> 00:01:04,928
Yeah, not-not
overly long.

29
00:01:04,996 --> 00:01:08,098
Sorry, sir, there's a weight
limit on this coaster.

30
00:01:08,165 --> 00:01:09,699
Oh, really,
what's the limit?

31
00:01:09,767 --> 00:01:11,234
The rule is you can't
look hilarious

32
00:01:11,302 --> 00:01:13,136
on this motor scooter.

33
00:01:14,288 --> 00:01:16,022
(laughing)

34
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,457
I'm sorry, there's
just no way.

35
00:01:22,213 --> 00:01:24,414
Big news out of Six Flags
Columbus today,

36
00:01:24,482 --> 00:01:25,982
as they unveil
what promises to be

37
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,385
the largest roller coaster
in the United States.

38
00:01:28,452 --> 00:01:29,419
That's right, Joyce.

39
00:01:29,487 --> 00:01:31,121
They call it The Holocaust.

40
00:01:31,188 --> 00:01:33,156
The ride has several
Jewish groups up in arms...

41
00:01:33,224 --> 00:01:35,091
as they go over
the first rise.

44
00:01:37,161 --> 00:01:38,695
They're actually pretty upset.

45
00:01:38,763 --> 00:01:39,796
Wow.

46
00:01:39,864 --> 00:01:41,047
I had heard about
the Holocaust,

47
00:01:41,115 --> 00:01:42,866
but I never believed it
till right now.

48
00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:44,784
I have to ride
that ride.

49
00:01:44,852 --> 00:01:46,686
Peter, come on, they're not
going to let you that ride either.

50
00:01:46,754 --> 00:01:48,054
You're overweight.

51
00:01:48,122 --> 00:01:49,489
Yeah, if you want to
ride that roller coaster,

52
00:01:49,557 --> 00:01:51,441
you're going to have
to go on a diet.

53
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:52,642
A diet, huh?

54
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,743
All right, well,
how's that work?

55
00:01:53,811 --> 00:01:55,128
Well, I suppose
you can start

56
00:01:55,196 --> 00:01:56,329
by keeping a
food journal,

57
00:01:56,397 --> 00:01:57,597
like Quagmire does.

58
00:01:57,665 --> 00:01:59,149
Yeah, in fact,
I got it right here.

59
00:01:59,216 --> 00:02:01,518
"Today I ate peaches...
ginger...

60
00:02:01,585 --> 00:02:03,420
honey... candy... olive..."
You know what?

61
00:02:03,487 --> 00:02:04,988
This is the wrong list.

62
00:02:05,056 --> 00:02:07,357
All right, if that's what it
takes to ride that ride,

63
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:09,375
I am going on a diet.

64
00:02:09,443 --> 00:02:11,077
And I'm not stopping
till I look as good as my

65
00:02:11,145 --> 00:02:13,329
great Aunt "Legs-Go-All-The-
Way-Up" Griffin.

66
00:02:13,397 --> 00:02:16,666
Hey, baby, do those legs
go all the way up?

67
00:02:16,734 --> 00:02:18,852
Why, yes, they do.

68
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:21,037
(screaming) Oh, my God!
You're a monster!

69
00:02:21,088 --> 00:02:22,255
Come back.

70
00:02:22,339 --> 00:02:24,090
My legs are shaved
like a little girl.

71
00:02:27,194 --> 00:02:29,462
Hey, what do you
got there, Peter?

72
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,680
Rice cakes.

73
00:02:30,748 --> 00:02:32,065
Never had one, but
somebody told me

74
00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:34,050
this is a really good
way to start your diet.

75
00:02:35,586 --> 00:02:37,387
(screaming)

76
00:02:41,776 --> 00:02:43,760
(coughing and gagging)

77
00:02:45,963 --> 00:02:48,581
(retching)

78
00:02:48,649 --> 00:02:50,033
Who...

79
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:52,302
who could think of such
a horrible thing?!

80
00:02:52,369 --> 00:02:54,003
(evil laughter)

81
00:02:54,071 --> 00:02:56,022
We know you not like
rice cake.

82
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,725
♪ Ricey, ricey rice,
no one like rice cakes. ♪

83
00:02:58,793 --> 00:03:00,794
(gong chiming)

84
00:03:02,396 --> 00:03:04,013
All right, Peter, the
most important thing

85
00:03:04,081 --> 00:03:05,682
when you're on a diet
is willpower.

86
00:03:05,749 --> 00:03:07,450
Now I'm going to put
this steaming pie

87
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:09,285
on the windowsill to cool.

88
00:03:09,336 --> 00:03:11,054
Now no matter how many
beckoning fingers

89
00:03:11,121 --> 00:03:13,289
that steam morphs into
or how badly it tries

90
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,759
to sneak its way up your nose,
I want you to resist the urge

91
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:18,294
to levitate
off the ground

92
00:03:18,345 --> 00:03:19,429
and float towards the pie.

93
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,763
Doesn't seem too hard.

94
00:03:20,815 --> 00:03:23,266
All right, go
stand over there.

95
00:03:26,821 --> 00:03:29,522
(laughing)
No, you don't.

96
00:03:30,774 --> 00:03:34,611
No, no,
you can't go in there.

97
00:03:34,662 --> 00:03:36,812
No, no, stay out of there.
That's my special area!

98
00:03:36,864 --> 00:03:37,980
(screams)

99
00:03:38,032 --> 00:03:39,983
No, stop!

100
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,317
I'm saying no!

101
00:03:41,368 --> 00:03:42,452
(screaming)

102
00:03:42,503 --> 00:03:44,220
What kind of pie is this?!

103
00:03:44,288 --> 00:03:46,956
Peter, it's making me watch!

104
00:03:50,327 --> 00:03:52,946
Peter, I don't understand why
we have to drive all the way

105
00:03:53,013 --> 00:03:55,048
to Ohio to ride a
stupid roller coaster.

106
00:03:55,132 --> 00:03:57,217
Yeah, besides, they're still
not going to let you on.

107
00:03:57,284 --> 00:03:58,968
You haven't actually
lost any weight.

108
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:01,955
Oh, I think my lithe figure
would suggest otherwise.

109
00:04:02,022 --> 00:04:04,023
A girdle is not a substitute
for weight loss, Peter.

110
00:04:04,108 --> 00:04:05,225
Hey, I'm riding
that roller coaster,

111
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:06,693
and that's all
there is to it.

112
00:04:06,777 --> 00:04:07,994
Now let's get out of here.

113
00:04:08,062 --> 00:04:09,495
This thing's squishing
all my organs around.

114
00:04:09,563 --> 00:04:11,764
(heart beating)

115
00:04:15,786 --> 00:04:18,521
There it is, kids.
Columbus, Ohio.

116
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:20,123
Now remember, there
are no rules

117
00:04:20,191 --> 00:04:21,991
about who can wear
stretch pants here,

118
00:04:22,059 --> 00:04:23,960
so you're going to see
some pretty shocking things.

119
00:04:24,027 --> 00:04:26,663
Brian, is this
our vacation?

120
00:04:26,714 --> 00:04:27,964
Yeah.

121
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,532
Oh.

122
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,301
Are we trash?

123
00:04:31,368 --> 00:04:32,468
Kind of.

124
00:04:32,536 --> 00:04:33,503
Oh.

125
00:04:39,827 --> 00:04:41,811
I'm sorry, sir. You're too fat
to ride the coaster.

126
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,346
Aw, darn it.

127
00:04:43,414 --> 00:04:45,215
Yeah, why don't you go back
to your pond, hippo?

128
00:04:45,282 --> 00:04:46,282
(laughing)

129
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,650
How about me, sir?

130
00:04:47,718 --> 00:04:49,319
Am I too fat to ride?

131
00:04:49,386 --> 00:04:50,520
No, you don't seem to be.

132
00:04:50,588 --> 00:04:52,121
(laughing crazily)

133
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,225
Well, you got
to hand it to him.

134
00:04:55,292 --> 00:04:57,126
He had a dream
and he made it happen.

135
00:04:57,194 --> 00:04:58,328
That's what
the Wright Brothers did.

136
00:04:58,395 --> 00:05:01,164
So, how's your boyfriend,
Orville, doing?

137
00:05:01,232 --> 00:05:02,699
Ex-boyfriend,
if you don't mind.

138
00:05:02,766 --> 00:05:04,500
And who cares?

139
00:05:04,568 --> 00:05:06,202
He's probably off
in a barn somewhere

140
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,238
working on a contraption
with that weird brother of his.

141
00:05:08,305 --> 00:05:09,422
Ew.

142
00:05:09,506 --> 00:05:11,341
(both laughing)

143
00:05:11,408 --> 00:05:13,960
ORVILLE:
Ha-ha, bitch.

144
00:05:14,044 --> 00:05:15,878
You're so pretty. I miss you.

145
00:05:17,848 --> 00:05:19,349
(gears grinding)

146
00:05:24,855 --> 00:05:27,924
(crashing, people screaming)

147
00:05:27,992 --> 00:05:30,493
PETER: Well, this has given me
a lot to think about.

148
00:05:30,561 --> 00:05:33,029
WOMAN (screaming):
My son is dead!

149
00:05:36,734 --> 00:05:39,619
We are going to have
to send that family money.

150
00:05:39,703 --> 00:05:40,770
I know we are.

151
00:05:40,821 --> 00:05:42,121
Mom, I'm hungry.

152
00:05:42,206 --> 00:05:43,773
Can we stop
and get some food?

153
00:05:43,824 --> 00:05:45,541
Well, I guess it is
close to dinnertime.

154
00:05:45,609 --> 00:05:46,609
Chris, Stewie,
you hungry?

155
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:50,780
(yawning)

156
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:52,298
What are you looking at?

157
00:05:52,383 --> 00:05:53,750
You going to propose?

158
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:55,351
What?
Yeah, exactly.

159
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:56,753
"What?" Eyes front.

160
00:05:56,804 --> 00:05:57,971
(engine sputtering)

161
00:05:58,055 --> 00:05:58,988
What the hell?!

162
00:06:04,094 --> 00:06:05,478
(loud hissing)

163
00:06:05,562 --> 00:06:07,897
Looks like it's the radiator.

164
00:06:07,965 --> 00:06:10,416
Well, we're just going to have
to find a local mechanic.

165
00:06:10,484 --> 00:06:12,101
On a Friday evening?

166
00:06:12,152 --> 00:06:13,536
I don't think we're going to
have any luck till Monday.

167
00:06:13,604 --> 00:06:16,139
Besides, probably not a lot
of mechanics around here.

168
00:06:20,678 --> 00:06:23,096
So, we're stuck here?

169
00:06:23,163 --> 00:06:24,781
Hey, Lois, you see
that barn out there?

170
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:26,215
You know who
it was built by?

171
00:06:26,283 --> 00:06:27,817
♪ By... Mennonites. ♪

172
00:06:27,885 --> 00:06:30,787
Well, I guess we better see if
there's a hotel or something.

173
00:06:30,854 --> 00:06:33,089
I can't believe we're
stuck in Amish country.

174
00:06:33,157 --> 00:06:34,590
Yeah, I thought
something was "a-mish."

175
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:47,640
Hey, uh, excuse me, fella?

176
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,208
Yeah, we're looking for a room.

177
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:51,110
Are ye indeed, outsiders?

178
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:53,846
We do not see many of
your folk in these parts,

179
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,349
but we welcome all of God's
children in their hour of need.

180
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:58,935
Well, actually, I think we need
it for more than an hour.

181
00:06:59,003 --> 00:07:01,104
Or do we, right, Lois?

182
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,506
I-I do not last very long.

183
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,029
Ugh, creepy. What's this?

184
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,681
It's an Amish doll.

185
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:13,032
They're not allowed
to have faces.

186
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,400
Has something to
do with vanity.

187
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:16,019
Looks like a cross-dressing
Cobra Commander.

188
00:07:16,086 --> 00:07:17,553
Who?

189
00:07:17,621 --> 00:07:19,155
Cobra Commander.
He's the head of Cobra.

190
00:07:19,223 --> 00:07:20,890
The bad guys from G.I. Joe.

191
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,659
The guys who oddly
shout the name

192
00:07:22,726 --> 00:07:25,728
of their terrorist organization
as they're attacking.

193
00:07:25,796 --> 00:07:28,064
Guys, we're under attack.
By who?

194
00:07:28,132 --> 00:07:29,032
I don't know.

195
00:07:33,737 --> 00:07:36,356
Cobra!

196
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:37,557
Oh, it's Cobra.

197
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,125
Oh, of course.

198
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:41,277
Look, they have the pictures
of the snakes on their planes.

199
00:07:41,345 --> 00:07:42,879
Duke, what have I been
saying for years?

200
00:07:42,946 --> 00:07:44,981
What makes a good
terrorist organization?

201
00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:46,983
Brand recognition.
Brand recognition.

202
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:49,035
Mom, I can't stay here.

203
00:07:49,103 --> 00:07:51,637
There's no electricity, no
telephones, it's horrible.

204
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:52,939
Excuse me.

205
00:07:53,007 --> 00:07:55,591
I assure you,
our community is quite pleasant.

206
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:57,577
Perhaps I could
show thee around.

207
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,245
(amorously):
Okay.

208
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:00,546
My name is Eli.

209
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:02,181
My parents run the inn.

210
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:04,917
If there is anything we can do
to make your room more plain,

211
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,185
do not be afraid to ask.

212
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:07,537
Ah, we'll be all right.

213
00:08:07,604 --> 00:08:09,238
A hotel in Amish country
can't be any worse

214
00:08:09,306 --> 00:08:10,740
than staying in a youth hostel.

215
00:08:10,808 --> 00:08:12,091
Hi, I'd like a room.

216
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,993
Uh, preferably one
where I have to sleep

217
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:15,795
with my bag
taped to my body.

218
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:18,364
We have one where some Italian
backpackers have laid out

219
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:20,199
every item of clothing
they own on all of the beds.

220
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:21,467
Oh, perfect.

221
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:23,486
Will my bunkmates be
constantly talking about me

222
00:08:23,554 --> 00:08:24,587
in a foreign language?

223
00:08:24,655 --> 00:08:26,322
Yes, they will, sir.
Oh, great.

224
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,191
Uh, also, I'm going to have
some mail delivered here,

225
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,693
and I want it to sit in
that box for four years.

226
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:32,462
Oh, and what street
is the bathroom on?

227
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,433
So, what do you do
for fun around here?

228
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:40,269
We do chores and we watch
other people do chores.

229
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:41,587
Sounds kind of boring.

230
00:08:41,638 --> 00:08:43,940
Alas, there are times
when I feel as if

231
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,558
there is much of life
I am missing.

232
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:48,094
Yeah, it'd be tough
having no technology.

233
00:08:48,145 --> 00:08:49,612
I don't think I could
live without my iPhone.

234
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,263
You have an iPhone?

235
00:08:51,315 --> 00:08:52,765
Yeah. You've heard of it?

236
00:08:52,816 --> 00:08:54,984
Yes, but only because
people sometimes search

237
00:08:55,052 --> 00:08:56,769
for Amish farms
on their iPhones.

238
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,987
Here comes one now.

239
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:10,399
Thanks for a fun evening, Eli.

240
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,902
And-and thanks
for being so nice to me.

241
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,796
I think you are the
most fascinating girl

242
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:16,021
I have ever met, Meg.

243
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:21,544
Here. I want you
to have this.

244
00:09:21,612 --> 00:09:23,045
Your iPhone?

245
00:09:23,113 --> 00:09:24,380
Yeah.

246
00:09:24,448 --> 00:09:27,467
I made you a playlist
of songs that I like.

247
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,218
Who is this I am hearing?

248
00:09:29,286 --> 00:09:30,453
It's Avril Lavigne.

249
00:09:30,521 --> 00:09:31,871
Why does she shout at me?

250
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:33,239
I don't know.

251
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:35,508
Most of my music I just
get pressured to buy.

252
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,076
Thank you for
this gift, Meg.

253
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:46,936
Eli! What are you doing
with that outsider?

254
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,938
Her name is Meg, Father.

255
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:50,506
And I was just showing her
our community.

256
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,958
You stay away from her.

257
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:53,192
She will try
to corrupt you.

258
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,694
That is not true, Father.

259
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:55,862
Meg is wonderful.

260
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,814
She is an outsider.

261
00:09:57,881 --> 00:09:59,665
She does not follow
the one true path.

262
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,717
You are not to see
this girl again.

263
00:10:01,785 --> 00:10:03,653
Do you understand?
I forbid it.

264
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,972
(dejected sigh)
Yes, sir.

265
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:09,008
Now come home at once.

266
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:12,028
And, as for you,

267
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:15,398
I suggest you stay away
from my son, you harlot.

268
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:20,086
(sobbing)

269
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:24,857
Hey, there, young one,
why so sad?

270
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:27,460
It's just that I really like
this boy, but his dad...

271
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:28,528
Oh, look out.

272
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:29,662
(loud smacks)
(screaming)

273
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,963
Sorry, there.

274
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:32,248
Didn't realize
how long it'd been

275
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,267
since Ol' Dumper
did his business.

276
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:35,935
He'll be done soon enough.

277
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:37,937
(smacking continues)
Oh, maybe not.

278
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:40,072
Doesn't sound
like pooping, does it?

279
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,774
Sounds more like someone

280
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:43,876
dropping sandwiches
off a rooftop.

281
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:45,578
Watch out below, right?

282
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,213
Look like Hacky Sacks.

283
00:10:47,281 --> 00:10:49,415
You'll be sorry
if you kick 'em, though.

284
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:52,218
All righty, well he seems
to be all done now.

285
00:10:52,286 --> 00:10:53,386
You have a good evening...

286
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:54,720
(smacking resumes)
Oh, my goodness.

287
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:56,522
He must have gotten into
the chicken feed again.

288
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,124
You'd think they'd know

289
00:10:58,192 --> 00:11:01,027
it wasn't in their diet,
but this is how they find out.

290
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:02,795
You may want
to close your mouth.

291
00:11:08,731 --> 00:11:12,467
(sobbing)

292
00:11:12,535 --> 00:11:14,252
Meg, what's wrong?

293
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,954
Eli's father,
Ezekiel, said

294
00:11:16,022 --> 00:11:18,607
that I can't see him
anymore! (sobs)

295
00:11:18,674 --> 00:11:21,243
He said I was trying
to corrupt his son!

296
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,661
He did, did he?

297
00:11:22,729 --> 00:11:23,845
Well, that does it!

298
00:11:23,913 --> 00:11:26,048
We are gonna teach
this town how to dance!

299
00:11:26,115 --> 00:11:28,200
Oh, Meg, I'm so sorry.

300
00:11:28,267 --> 00:11:30,268
I'd try to talk to Eli's father
for you, honey,

301
00:11:30,336 --> 00:11:32,070
but I don't know
if it's my place.

302
00:11:32,138 --> 00:11:33,455
Ezekiel wouldn't listen
to you anyway, Lois.

303
00:11:33,523 --> 00:11:34,723
You're a woman.

304
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,725
These people live in
a patriarchal society.

305
00:11:36,793 --> 00:11:39,261
The only member of our family
whose word would carry

306
00:11:39,328 --> 00:11:40,996
any weight
would be Meg's father.

307
00:11:41,064 --> 00:11:43,732
Dad, will you talk
to Ezekiel?

308
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,016
Will you tell him

309
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:46,585
I'm not trying to
corrupt his son?

310
00:11:46,652 --> 00:11:47,619
Please?

311
00:11:47,687 --> 00:11:48,987
All right, I'll do it.

312
00:11:49,055 --> 00:11:50,756
But don't expect
any miracles.

313
00:11:50,823 --> 00:11:51,923
I'm not good
with confrontation.

314
00:11:51,991 --> 00:11:53,325
Like when I got stuck

315
00:11:53,392 --> 00:11:54,793
behind that giraffe
at the ballgame.

316
00:11:54,861 --> 00:11:56,394
Yeah! Nice hit!

317
00:11:56,462 --> 00:11:57,896
Frozen rope!
Awesome!

318
00:11:57,964 --> 00:11:58,930
What just happened?

319
00:11:58,998 --> 00:12:00,499
Ground rule double! Whoo!

320
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:01,733
I couldn't
even see it.

321
00:12:01,801 --> 00:12:03,001
Yeah, it was something.

322
00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:04,803
Ducks on a pond!
Let's bring 'em in!

323
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:06,138
Could you please
sit down?

324
00:12:06,205 --> 00:12:07,773
I am sitting down.
You sit up.

325
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,874
I am sitting up,

326
00:12:08,941 --> 00:12:10,609
but I still can't see
a thing.

327
00:12:10,676 --> 00:12:11,843
Yeah, sounds
like a "you" problem.

328
00:12:11,911 --> 00:12:13,011
Let's go, Sox!

329
00:12:15,448 --> 00:12:16,648
Before we commence

330
00:12:16,716 --> 00:12:20,185
with Samuel Fisher's
barn raising, let us pray.

331
00:12:20,253 --> 00:12:21,586
Dear Amish Lord,

332
00:12:21,654 --> 00:12:25,056
thou looketh sternly down
upon us thine flock,

333
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:27,259
even though we did not
do anything wrong

334
00:12:27,326 --> 00:12:30,862
and have been doing
chores like (bleep) crazy,

335
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,865
please make us humble,
and deliver us more hardship,

336
00:12:33,933 --> 00:12:36,401
that we may get thick,
calloused hands,

337
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:38,370
much larger
than other people's.

338
00:12:38,437 --> 00:12:41,173
And grant that we become dull,
like Eric Bana,

339
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,841
who we have never seen,

340
00:12:42,909 --> 00:12:44,342
but are just going
by reputation

341
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,278
because it is your will.

342
00:12:46,345 --> 00:12:48,680
We solemnly believe
that although humans

343
00:12:48,748 --> 00:12:51,049
have been around
for a million years,

344
00:12:51,117 --> 00:12:52,651
you feel strongly
that they had

345
00:12:52,718 --> 00:12:54,586
just the right amount
of technology

346
00:12:54,654 --> 00:12:57,455
between 1835 and 1850;

347
00:12:57,523 --> 00:12:59,691
not too little,
not too much.

348
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:01,693
Please deliver us
from Thomas Edison,

349
00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:04,196
the worst human being
who ever lived.

350
00:13:04,263 --> 00:13:06,131
And protect us
from those who laugh

351
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:08,200
at our buggies or our hats

352
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:10,168
and deliver us
from mustaches.

353
00:13:10,236 --> 00:13:12,220
Amen.

354
00:13:12,288 --> 00:13:13,438
Hey, uh, Ezekiel?

355
00:13:13,523 --> 00:13:15,323
You must be Mr. Griffin.

356
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,393
Look, I-I know you guys are busy
with your barn raising and all,

357
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:20,629
but, um, you know,
I just wanted to tell you

358
00:13:20,696 --> 00:13:22,664
how much my daughter Meg loves
your boy Eli.

359
00:13:22,732 --> 00:13:25,217
I promise you, she ain't trying
to corrupt him or nothing.

360
00:13:25,284 --> 00:13:26,902
Mr. Griffin,
with all due respect,

361
00:13:26,953 --> 00:13:28,453
we live in two
different worlds.

362
00:13:28,538 --> 00:13:31,656
I must do what is best
for my son... and I have.

363
00:13:31,724 --> 00:13:33,391
Hey, how do we know
what's gonna happen?

364
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:35,393
For all we know,
Meg might want to Amish herself.

365
00:13:35,461 --> 00:13:37,696
I had not considered this.

366
00:13:37,763 --> 00:13:40,465
I was verily preoccupied
with Eli's corruption.

367
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:42,484
Plus, it is the time
of the month

368
00:13:42,552 --> 00:13:44,119
when Eli's mother
is on the burlap.

369
00:13:44,187 --> 00:13:46,221
So whaddaya say,
let the kids give it a shot?

370
00:13:46,289 --> 00:13:48,089
Perhaps, Mr. Griffin.
Perhaps.

371
00:13:48,157 --> 00:13:49,290
Good.

372
00:13:49,342 --> 00:13:50,809
Now on another note,
I notice you don't have

373
00:13:50,877 --> 00:13:52,677
a damn lick of music
in this town.

374
00:13:52,745 --> 00:13:54,779
We do not believe in
such ostentations.

375
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:57,983
Well, I am about
to change your mind.

376
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,886
Introducing rock 'n' roll!

377
00:14:00,953 --> 00:14:02,220
♪ Whoo! ♪

378
00:14:02,288 --> 00:14:07,175
♪ I'm on a highway
to hell! ♪

379
00:14:07,243 --> 00:14:10,045
♪ Highway to hell! ♪

380
00:14:10,112 --> 00:14:11,496
♪ I'm on the high... ♪

381
00:14:11,564 --> 00:14:13,982
You are banished from
our community at once!

382
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:16,051
And take your whore
daughter with you!

383
00:14:19,488 --> 00:14:20,755
How did it go, Dad?

384
00:14:20,823 --> 00:14:22,090
Very well, Meg.

385
00:14:22,158 --> 00:14:24,158
My recollection is that
it went extremely well.

386
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,945
Really?! Oh, my God, Dad,
that's fantastic!

387
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:28,546
So I-I can see Eli again?

388
00:14:28,614 --> 00:14:29,748
EZEKIEL:
Griffins!

389
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,802
(crowd clamoring)

390
00:14:33,853 --> 00:14:35,704
What's going on here?

391
00:14:35,771 --> 00:14:37,339
Your family must leave
our community

392
00:14:37,406 --> 00:14:39,574
and return to the outside world.

393
00:14:39,642 --> 00:14:40,742
Dad, what's happening?

394
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,244
I thought you talked to him.

395
00:14:42,311 --> 00:14:45,146
Sir, please, whatever your
quarrel is with my husband,

396
00:14:45,214 --> 00:14:46,681
I'm sure it's
probably justified,

397
00:14:46,749 --> 00:14:49,985
but I'm begging you, don't
punish the children for it.

398
00:14:50,052 --> 00:14:51,253
They're innocent in all this.

399
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,554
Innocent, are they?

400
00:14:52,622 --> 00:14:54,906
I found this
in Eli's corn hole!

401
00:14:54,974 --> 00:14:56,441
Well, I... His what?

402
00:14:56,509 --> 00:14:59,177
A compartment in Eli's room
where he stores his corn.

403
00:14:59,245 --> 00:15:01,463
Oh. Well, okay,
whatever you say.

404
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,764
Look, Ezekiel, we would love

405
00:15:02,832 --> 00:15:04,065
to go back to the city,
believe me.

406
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:05,867
I-I haven't had a drink
in three days.

407
00:15:05,935 --> 00:15:07,402
But our car broke down.

408
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,537
We-we can't go anywhere
until it gets fixed.

409
00:15:09,605 --> 00:15:12,257
I have arranged
to have that taken care of.

410
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:18,847
This ride's gonna be
so frustrating.

411
00:15:18,914 --> 00:15:20,315
I know.
These horses are

412
00:15:20,383 --> 00:15:22,584
so slow.
Sexy.

413
00:15:22,652 --> 00:15:23,985
Sexy.

414
00:15:27,123 --> 00:15:29,390
STEWIE: Good-bye,
Abraham Lincoln people.

415
00:15:31,077 --> 00:15:33,778
(sobbing)

416
00:15:33,863 --> 00:15:34,946
I'm sorry, Meg.

417
00:15:35,031 --> 00:15:38,116
Eli was the best boy
I'll ever meet.

418
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,502
And now I'll never
see him again.

419
00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:43,288
ELI:
Yes, you will, Meg.

420
00:15:43,372 --> 00:15:44,339
(gasps) Eli.

421
00:15:44,406 --> 00:15:46,257
Eli? What are you doing here?

422
00:15:46,325 --> 00:15:48,076
I could not let you
leave without me, Meg.

423
00:15:48,127 --> 00:15:49,294
I love you.

424
00:15:49,378 --> 00:15:52,247
I love you, too.

425
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:55,967
Hey, Lois, watch me lay rubber
in front of these losers.

426
00:15:56,052 --> 00:15:57,052
Hyah!

427
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:02,524
Yeah! Choke on that, nerds.

428
00:16:07,913 --> 00:16:09,947
Eli, I agree
that your father was being

429
00:16:10,015 --> 00:16:11,182
somewhat unreasonable,

430
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,484
but I don't think
running away is the answer.

431
00:16:13,552 --> 00:16:15,553
I know, Mrs. Griffin.
And I am sorry.

432
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:17,455
But I just could
not bear the thought

433
00:16:17,523 --> 00:16:18,973
of never seeing Meg again.

434
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,791
You ever seen one
of these, Eli?

435
00:16:20,859 --> 00:16:22,426
It's a Coleco
football game.

436
00:16:22,494 --> 00:16:23,794
Pretty mind-
blowing, huh?

437
00:16:23,862 --> 00:16:24,962
You know what?

438
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,248
This is garbage to us.

439
00:16:27,332 --> 00:16:28,432
(clattering)

440
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,851
What the hell is that?

441
00:16:35,807 --> 00:16:37,675
Holy crap! Who did this?

442
00:16:37,743 --> 00:16:39,460
It must have been my father.

443
00:16:39,528 --> 00:16:41,229
This is how
the Amish declare a feud.

444
00:16:41,296 --> 00:16:42,747
But I thought they
were nonviolent.

445
00:16:42,814 --> 00:16:43,965
We are,

446
00:16:44,032 --> 00:16:46,500
but Peter must have
really pissed off my dad.

447
00:16:46,568 --> 00:16:47,935
Hey, who raked the leaves?

448
00:16:48,003 --> 00:16:49,103
And look,
somebody mowed the lawn.

449
00:16:49,171 --> 00:16:50,571
I was supposed to do that.

450
00:16:50,656 --> 00:16:52,840
Ha-ha! I have done your chores

451
00:16:52,908 --> 00:16:55,109
to rob you of the joy
of doing chores.

452
00:16:55,177 --> 00:16:56,377
You bastard.

453
00:16:58,197 --> 00:16:59,697
Peter, we don't have
a choice.

454
00:16:59,765 --> 00:17:01,165
We've gotta bring
Eli back.

455
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:02,600
Oh, no, we don't.

456
00:17:02,668 --> 00:17:04,135
What are you talking about?

457
00:17:04,203 --> 00:17:06,437
We-we can't be part of a feud
with the Amish.

458
00:17:06,505 --> 00:17:07,905
I didn't start
this thing, Lois,

459
00:17:07,973 --> 00:17:10,074
but I'm gonna finish it.

460
00:17:12,895 --> 00:17:15,162
Joe, go round up Quagmire

461
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,198
and all the modern-day
technology you can find.

462
00:17:17,266 --> 00:17:19,500
We are going to war.

463
00:17:19,568 --> 00:17:21,335
Oh. Oh, hey, Bonnie.

464
00:17:21,403 --> 00:17:23,371
Is Joe there?

465
00:17:23,438 --> 00:17:25,840
Well, can I leave
a message for him?

466
00:17:25,908 --> 00:17:29,577
Yeah, it's what I said before
about the-the war thing.

467
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,866
(tires screeching)

468
00:17:41,707 --> 00:17:42,807
(beeping)

469
00:17:49,414 --> 00:17:50,848
All right, men,
this is it.

470
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,517
Technology versus
old-timey wooden stuff.

471
00:17:53,585 --> 00:17:55,052
Let's hit 'em hard.

472
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,053
What, again, was
the nature

473
00:17:56,121 --> 00:17:57,455
of your beef
with them?

474
00:17:57,522 --> 00:17:58,756
I don't know.
Something about

475
00:17:58,824 --> 00:17:59,907
a roller coaster.
Let's go.

476
00:18:11,103 --> 00:18:12,770
Apples... fire!

477
00:18:16,641 --> 00:18:17,692
(all gasping, yelling)

478
00:18:17,776 --> 00:18:18,859
Ah! Damn it!
Ow! God!

479
00:18:18,944 --> 00:18:20,861
Quilters... advance!

480
00:18:26,918 --> 00:18:29,120
Oh! Oh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Ooh! Oh! Ooh! Oh!

481
00:18:29,171 --> 00:18:30,487
I bet this hurts so much!

482
00:18:31,957 --> 00:18:32,957
(screams)

483
00:18:33,008 --> 00:18:35,159
Ow! Damn it! I'm bleeding!

484
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,761
Uhp, now it's an AIDS quilt.

485
00:18:39,264 --> 00:18:40,481
(gasps)

486
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,104
Suck on this,
you furry little weirdoes!

487
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,581
Enough of this crap.

488
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,533
Ezekiel.

489
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:22,323
Call off your boys and let's you
and me finish this man-to-man.

490
00:19:22,391 --> 00:19:24,842
Indeed.
Prepare for a goodly beating.

491
00:19:26,378 --> 00:19:27,812
(tires screech)

492
00:19:30,015 --> 00:19:31,766
Dad, stop.
Leave him alone.

493
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,734
Father, what are you doing?

494
00:19:33,802 --> 00:19:35,302
I am going to
kill that man.

495
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,071
That man
is my girlfriend, Meg.

496
00:19:37,139 --> 00:19:38,489
(Peter laughs)

497
00:19:38,557 --> 00:19:40,908
This is against everything
our people stand for.

498
00:19:40,992 --> 00:19:42,793
Will you listen to me
for one moment?

499
00:19:42,861 --> 00:19:45,763
You were so worried
about these outsiders

500
00:19:45,831 --> 00:19:47,898
coming into our community
and corrupting me.

501
00:19:47,966 --> 00:19:49,667
But look at yourself.

502
00:19:49,735 --> 00:19:52,303
You're the one who's allowed
yourself to be corrupted.

503
00:19:52,371 --> 00:19:55,506
God in heaven...

504
00:19:55,574 --> 00:19:56,974
you are right.

505
00:19:57,042 --> 00:19:59,543
I am deeply ashamed.

506
00:19:59,594 --> 00:20:01,829
I only wanted to protect you.

507
00:20:01,897 --> 00:20:03,364
I know you did, Father.

508
00:20:03,432 --> 00:20:06,333
PETER:
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

509
00:20:06,401 --> 00:20:10,037
(sighs)
Son, it is your life to live.

510
00:20:10,105 --> 00:20:12,306
I must accept
the life you choose.

511
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,262
I choose to stay here.

512
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,647
What?!
What?!

513
00:20:19,714 --> 00:20:22,450
Meg, you are the
most beautiful woman

514
00:20:22,517 --> 00:20:23,784
I will ever know.

515
00:20:23,852 --> 00:20:25,903
You have shown me
so many wondrous things

516
00:20:25,954 --> 00:20:29,073
that have opened my eyes
to the world beyond my home.

517
00:20:29,124 --> 00:20:32,059
But this is where I belong.

518
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,761
I'm sorry
if this upsets you, Meg.

519
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:36,097
(voice breaking):
I love you, Eli.

520
00:20:36,164 --> 00:20:37,731
I'll always love you.

521
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:40,067
If this is what you
have to do,

522
00:20:40,135 --> 00:20:42,403
then all I can say is...

523
00:20:42,471 --> 00:20:44,371
I'll never forget you.

524
00:20:47,709 --> 00:20:51,145
(sighs) I am sorry there has been
conflict between us.

525
00:20:51,213 --> 00:20:52,847
Allow me to make amends.

526
00:20:52,914 --> 00:20:56,317
Please help yourself
to anything in my corn hole.

527
00:20:56,384 --> 00:20:57,551
Hey, don't worry
about it.

528
00:20:57,619 --> 00:20:59,019
We can still be pals.

529
00:20:59,087 --> 00:21:00,988
And I know just
the place for us

530
00:21:01,056 --> 00:21:03,157
to go and blow off
all this steam.
