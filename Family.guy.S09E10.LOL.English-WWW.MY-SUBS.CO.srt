12
00:00:35,017 --> 00:00:36,084
All right, come on,
hurry up, Brian.

13
00:00:36,155 --> 00:00:38,456
I don't want to miss the movie
trivia slides before the movie.

14
00:00:38,524 --> 00:00:40,258
Peter, those questions
are the easiest,

15
00:00:40,326 --> 00:00:41,827
most pandering things
in the world.

16
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:47,899
Oh! Oh! Tim Honks!
Tim Honks!

17
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:49,100
<i>Forrest Gump.</i> I win.

18
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,104
Who?

19
00:00:55,374 --> 00:00:56,608
Ah, good.
It's starting.

20
00:00:56,676 --> 00:00:58,109
Yeah, that's what you say.

21
00:00:58,177 --> 00:01:00,645
I can never figure out when
the hell the studio logos end

22
00:01:00,713 --> 00:01:01,947
and the actual movie begins.

23
00:01:02,014 --> 00:01:03,415
(fanfare playing)

24
00:01:03,482 --> 00:01:05,617
All right.
Let's see what you got, FOX.

25
00:01:05,685 --> 00:01:08,520
Oh, I bet that's a sea monst...

26
00:01:08,588 --> 00:01:10,388
Oh, that's not the movie.

27
00:01:10,456 --> 00:01:12,757
That's... yeah,
I think I heard of them.

28
00:01:12,825 --> 00:01:15,594
Here we go. Movie!

29
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:19,064
Well, now, that seems
intentionally misleading.

30
00:01:19,131 --> 00:01:22,000
All right,
someone's coming to town.

31
00:01:22,068 --> 00:01:25,237
Oh, for crying out loud.

32
00:01:25,304 --> 00:01:28,406
Oh, all right. Period movie.

33
00:01:28,474 --> 00:01:30,375
Oh, not a period movie.

34
00:01:32,845 --> 00:01:34,980
Oh, this guy's in trouble.

35
00:01:35,047 --> 00:01:36,648
Can't wait to hear his story.

36
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:39,818
Oh, come on!

37
00:01:42,588 --> 00:01:44,356
Psst. Hey, Brian.
You want a drink?

38
00:01:44,423 --> 00:01:45,991
You snuck in liquor?

39
00:01:46,058 --> 00:01:48,960
Yeah, loosens me up so I can
talk to the people around me.

40
00:01:49,028 --> 00:01:50,662
All right, I'll, uh,
get in on that.

41
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,035
(slurring words):
Hey, I already seen this movie.

42
00:01:57,103 --> 00:02:00,071
Let's talk... Let's talk about
other movies we've seen.

43
00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:01,640
That's an excellent idea.

44
00:02:01,707 --> 00:02:04,142
I like... I like <i>The Madness</i>
<i>of King George.</i>

45
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,911
Well, I don't know
what that is,

46
00:02:05,978 --> 00:02:07,746
but <i>The... The Cat</i>
<i>From Outer Space</i>

47
00:02:07,813 --> 00:02:09,848
is a solid
motion picture.

48
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:12,083
Oh, and... and I like...
I like <i>King Ralph</i>

49
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:13,852
'cause... 'Cause that's...
That's the last guy

50
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,154
you'd expect to be
king of nothing.

51
00:02:16,222 --> 00:02:17,622
Hey, shut up!

52
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,724
Hey, I'm... I'm not
the only one talking.

53
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:22,360
That... That big guy up
there on the screen's

54
00:02:22,428 --> 00:02:24,229
been talking through
the whole movie.

55
00:02:24,297 --> 00:02:26,097
Hey, jerk.
Hey, you keep it down.

56
00:02:26,165 --> 00:02:28,266
I... I don't...
I don't think he's...

57
00:02:28,334 --> 00:02:30,468
That he's listening to you.
Let's get him.

58
00:02:30,536 --> 00:02:32,704
<i>Dear Liesl, I'd like
to be able to tell you</i>

59
00:02:32,772 --> 00:02:34,139
<i>how I feel about you.</i>

60
00:02:34,206 --> 00:02:37,676
Leeza, get a...
Get away from him. He's a "Nazzi."

61
00:02:37,743 --> 00:02:40,578
I... I know Jews is bad,
but thems is worse.

62
00:02:40,646 --> 00:02:42,013
- Sit down!
- Move.

63
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:43,748
Stop blocking the screen,
you jerk!

64
00:02:43,816 --> 00:02:46,251
I don't think... I don't
think you heard me, buddy.

65
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,886
Step away from
the young lady.

66
00:02:49,956 --> 00:02:52,590
All right, Ian Ziering,
you asked for it.

67
00:02:54,894 --> 00:02:58,063
Oh, my God.
I think I'm in Narnia.

68
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,597
Where am I?

69
00:02:59,665 --> 00:03:01,466
Hey, those guys
are backwards now.

70
00:03:01,534 --> 00:03:02,801
Get away from her!

71
00:03:05,504 --> 00:03:07,539
We got a report
of a disturban...

72
00:03:07,606 --> 00:03:09,541
Oh, what the hell, Peter?

73
00:03:09,608 --> 00:03:11,810
Joe, thank God.
There's a situation here.

74
00:03:11,877 --> 00:03:13,511
I've got a sore finger.

75
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:15,613
I don't give a crap.
We got bigger problems!

76
00:03:19,785 --> 00:03:21,820
Mr. Griffin and Mr. Griffin,

77
00:03:21,887 --> 00:03:24,889
this court finds you guilty
of creating a public disturbance

78
00:03:24,957 --> 00:03:26,825
and destruction
of private property.

79
00:03:26,892 --> 00:03:30,028
And all of this while under
the influence of alcohol.

80
00:03:30,096 --> 00:03:32,263
Your Honor,
if you'll just let us explain...

81
00:03:32,331 --> 00:03:34,699
I've heard all the testimony
I'm prepared to hear.

82
00:03:34,767 --> 00:03:36,668
This court sentences you both

83
00:03:36,736 --> 00:03:39,604
to thirty days
of Alcoholics Anonymous.

84
00:03:39,672 --> 00:03:41,573
Well, Your Honor, in that case,

85
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,209
I'll have to call my surprise
witness, Mr. Sockerby.

86
00:03:44,276 --> 00:03:45,543
Mr. Sockerby, before we begin,

87
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:47,445
have you ever been convicted
of a felony?

88
00:03:47,513 --> 00:03:49,114
Yes, but that bitch
had it coming.

89
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:51,282
Ah, okay. Uh, Your Honor, I'm...

90
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,351
I'm afraid I have
to withdraw this witness,

91
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:56,521
and I am going to those things
you said I have to go to.

92
00:04:02,521 --> 00:04:04,088
This sucks.
Can't believe that judge

93
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:05,990
is making us go
to a month of AA.

94
00:04:06,058 --> 00:04:08,292
You know, if you ask me,
this is going to be

95
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,727
a good thing for both of you.

96
00:04:09,795 --> 00:04:11,129
There's a lesson
you need to learn.

97
00:04:11,196 --> 00:04:12,296
What are you talking about?
What lesson?

98
00:04:12,364 --> 00:04:13,865
I don't need to go to AA.

99
00:04:13,932 --> 00:04:15,299
I'm a social drinker,
not an alcoholic.

100
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:17,935
Yeah, that's like saying rappers
are really poets.

101
00:04:19,905 --> 00:04:23,875
I'm not saying she's
a gold digger,

102
00:04:23,942 --> 00:04:27,412
but she's not messing with...

103
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:30,415
Who isn't she messing with?

104
00:04:34,053 --> 00:04:35,486
Hey, y'all.

105
00:04:35,554 --> 00:04:38,923
Okay, we got us a few new
friends here joining us tonight.

106
00:04:38,991 --> 00:04:43,061
So let's all say us
a big hello to Peter and Brian.

107
00:04:43,128 --> 00:04:45,763
- ALL: Hello, Peter and Brian.
- Hi there.

108
00:04:45,831 --> 00:04:48,032
All right, who'd like
to kick us off?

109
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,567
I will.

110
00:04:49,635 --> 00:04:53,004
Um, my name is Greg,
and, uh, I'm an alcoholic.

111
00:04:53,072 --> 00:04:54,572
ALL: Hi, Greg.

112
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,475
One fateful night, I, uh,
got behind the wheel

113
00:04:57,543 --> 00:05:00,244
of my brand-new sports car,
blind-drunk.

114
00:05:00,312 --> 00:05:02,413
I was responsible for the death

115
00:05:02,481 --> 00:05:04,215
of an innocent
eight-year-old girl.

116
00:05:04,283 --> 00:05:05,616
- What kind?
- What?

117
00:05:05,684 --> 00:05:07,051
What kind of car?

118
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:08,853
You said you had
a sports car.

119
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:09,754
That's cool,
but what kind?

120
00:05:09,822 --> 00:05:11,022
It was a Miata.

121
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,757
Oh, come on.
That's not a sports car.

122
00:05:12,825 --> 00:05:14,559
How... How does that
even kill a kid?

123
00:05:14,626 --> 00:05:16,828
What, did you hit her
over the head with it?

124
00:05:16,895 --> 00:05:18,329
- That's a legitimate sports car.
- No. Next.

125
00:05:18,397 --> 00:05:20,732
Jenny, would you
like to talk?

126
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:23,367
My name is Jenny,
and I'm an alcoholic.

127
00:05:23,435 --> 00:05:25,203
Geez, anybody here
in any other line of work?

128
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,537
Ha.

129
00:05:26,605 --> 00:05:28,072
ALL: Hi, Jenny.

130
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,775
Before I found AA,
my ex-boyfriend and I

131
00:05:30,843 --> 00:05:32,376
used to get drunk
and party all night.

132
00:05:32,444 --> 00:05:34,045
I missed work half the time.

133
00:05:34,113 --> 00:05:36,514
One morning, I woke up naked
with three Persians

134
00:05:36,582 --> 00:05:38,783
high-fiving each other
on the way out of my bedroom.

135
00:05:38,851 --> 00:05:40,518
But now that I've joined
the program,

136
00:05:40,586 --> 00:05:42,353
I'm a whole different person.

137
00:05:42,421 --> 00:05:44,155
And my two new cats,
Clean and Sober,

138
00:05:44,223 --> 00:05:45,990
just think I'm tops.

139
00:05:46,058 --> 00:05:47,692
That's wonderful, Jenny.

140
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,995
All right. Peter, do you have
a story that you'd like to share?

141
00:05:51,063 --> 00:05:52,363
Oh, yeah, I got one.

142
00:05:52,431 --> 00:05:54,599
This one time, me and Joe
and Quagmire made a bet

143
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,968
to see who could drink
the most beer and still drive.

144
00:05:57,035 --> 00:05:59,303
And you know that water slide
in South Attleboro?

145
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,245
- Yeah!
- Water slide!

146
00:06:07,312 --> 00:06:09,013
Summer fun!

147
00:06:10,382 --> 00:06:12,517
Peter, it sounds to me
like alcohol

148
00:06:12,584 --> 00:06:15,453
is a very destructive
influence in your life.

149
00:06:15,521 --> 00:06:17,188
You need to relinquish
your dependence

150
00:06:17,256 --> 00:06:19,991
and give yourself over
to a higher power.

151
00:06:20,058 --> 00:06:22,627
(scoffs)
You have a different view, Brian?

152
00:06:22,694 --> 00:06:23,928
Oh, I... I don't know.
Are we...

153
00:06:23,996 --> 00:06:25,530
Are we allowed to have
a different view?

154
00:06:25,597 --> 00:06:28,966
Brian, AA is the only way out
for these people.

155
00:06:29,034 --> 00:06:32,069
Millions are saved every year
by the program.

156
00:06:32,137 --> 00:06:33,504
Hey, people got along just fine

157
00:06:33,572 --> 00:06:35,506
for thousands of years
without AA.

158
00:06:35,574 --> 00:06:36,874
Just like they got along

159
00:06:36,942 --> 00:06:38,676
for thousands of years
without religion.

160
00:06:38,744 --> 00:06:40,945
I like you and have
no reason not to.

161
00:06:41,013 --> 00:06:42,947
I like you and have
no reason not to.

162
00:06:43,015 --> 00:06:44,949
Hey, did you hear
about that magic baby

163
00:06:45,017 --> 00:06:46,117
that was born
in Bethlehem?

164
00:06:46,185 --> 00:06:48,019
(all yelling)

165
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:55,560
Oh, there you boys are.

166
00:06:55,627 --> 00:06:56,961
How was your meeting?

167
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:59,197
29 more and we're done.
That's how it was.

168
00:06:59,264 --> 00:07:01,165
That doesn't sound like
the right attitude.

169
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:03,100
Lois, you weren't there.
It was awful.

170
00:07:03,168 --> 00:07:05,636
Just a bunch of losers
telling boring stories.

171
00:07:05,704 --> 00:07:07,471
"My drinking
ruined my marriage."

172
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:09,507
"My drinking ruined
my family."

173
00:07:09,575 --> 00:07:12,577
My drinking
ruined my TV show, <i>24."</i>

174
00:07:12,644 --> 00:07:14,846
I see you got your own thing
going on this week,

175
00:07:14,913 --> 00:07:16,314
but there's a new teacher
at preschool

176
00:07:16,381 --> 00:07:18,616
who deactivates the camera
and then hits us.

177
00:07:18,684 --> 00:07:20,885
Brian, AA's been around
for years.

178
00:07:20,953 --> 00:07:23,387
It's helped a lot of people
get over their addiction.

179
00:07:23,455 --> 00:07:24,822
No, it hasn't.

180
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,324
They've just traded
one addiction for another.

181
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:27,992
Their life goes
from being all about drinking

182
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,260
to being all about AA.

183
00:07:29,328 --> 00:07:30,795
The only difference is,

184
00:07:30,863 --> 00:07:32,563
when it's all about drinking,
they're more fun.

185
00:07:32,631 --> 00:07:33,764
Well, like it or not,

186
00:07:33,832 --> 00:07:36,868
you got to stick it out
for thirty days.

187
00:07:36,935 --> 00:07:38,102
You know what sucks, Brian?

188
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,937
We don't got a problem
with our drinking.

189
00:07:40,005 --> 00:07:42,139
It's everybody else who's got
a problem with our drinking.

190
00:07:42,207 --> 00:07:44,175
Wait a minute.
Peter, that's it.

191
00:07:44,243 --> 00:07:46,410
The issue isn't that these
people are alcoholics.

192
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:49,313
They just have nowhere to
drink without being judged.

193
00:07:49,381 --> 00:07:51,048
She slams us
into the monkey bars,

194
00:07:51,116 --> 00:07:53,885
but none of us have the language
skills to call her on it.

195
00:07:57,155 --> 00:07:58,990
And then this one time,
I was so drunk,

196
00:07:59,057 --> 00:08:00,825
I gave someone
a back adjustment.

197
00:08:00,893 --> 00:08:02,193
I'm not a chiropractor.

198
00:08:02,261 --> 00:08:04,228
You got to go to a weekend
of school for that.

199
00:08:04,296 --> 00:08:05,663
Hey, hey.

200
00:08:05,731 --> 00:08:07,999
Anyone in the house
addicted to alcohol?

201
00:08:08,066 --> 00:08:09,367
- Hi.
- Hello, Peter.

202
00:08:09,434 --> 00:08:10,735
I enjoy alcohol.

203
00:08:10,802 --> 00:08:12,603
I can't hear you.

204
00:08:12,671 --> 00:08:15,006
- Hello.
- I have a very serious problem.

205
00:08:15,073 --> 00:08:18,276
Mr. Griffin, alcohol
is forbidden at our meetings.

206
00:08:18,343 --> 00:08:19,710
Look, just hear me out.

207
00:08:19,778 --> 00:08:22,079
I sat here and listened
to you bums the other day,

208
00:08:22,147 --> 00:08:24,815
and I got to tell you,
I have never seen a duller bunch

209
00:08:24,883 --> 00:08:26,217
of pathetic bastards in my life.

210
00:08:26,285 --> 00:08:27,985
I don't know who you were
when you were drinking,

211
00:08:28,053 --> 00:08:29,520
but it sure as hell's
got to be better

212
00:08:29,588 --> 00:08:30,554
than who you are
when you're sober.

213
00:08:30,622 --> 00:08:31,856
Yeah, you all stopped drinking

214
00:08:31,924 --> 00:08:33,491
because you were hurting
your loved ones.

215
00:08:33,558 --> 00:08:35,993
But you can't hurt them
if they don't know you're drunk.

216
00:08:36,061 --> 00:08:38,496
Let's make this our sanctuary.

217
00:08:40,098 --> 00:08:42,133
I wants me that beer.

218
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,874
<i>MAN (over radio):
Attention, patrol cars,</i>

219
00:08:49,942 --> 00:08:52,610
<i>we've got a noise complaint
at the Quahog Community Center.</i>

220
00:08:52,678 --> 00:08:54,278
<i>Is anyone in the area?</i>

221
00:08:54,346 --> 00:08:56,514
Wait a minute. That's where
Peter's AA meeting is.

222
00:09:02,254 --> 00:09:03,888
So I clicked on it,
and the...

223
00:09:03,956 --> 00:09:06,290
The girl's got
a bigger wang than I got.

224
00:09:06,358 --> 00:09:07,391
No way.

225
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:08,592
No way, right?

226
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,795
So I did... So I just put
my thumb over it,

227
00:09:10,862 --> 00:09:13,564
and then... And that got me
through the rest of...

228
00:09:13,632 --> 00:09:16,467
of the... of the session.

229
00:09:21,707 --> 00:09:24,675
Oh, no.
There's a policeman coming.

230
00:09:24,743 --> 00:09:25,977
(all gasping)

231
00:09:26,044 --> 00:09:27,645
All right, everybody,
you know what to do.

232
00:09:27,713 --> 00:09:30,648
Alcoholics, transform.

233
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,894
All right, what the hell's
going on in here?

234
00:09:43,962 --> 00:09:46,931
- We got a noise complaint.
- Joe, shh. Peter's about to start.

235
00:09:46,999 --> 00:09:50,368
We are gathered here again
tonight, fellow AA members,

236
00:09:50,435 --> 00:09:52,103
to talk about
the greatest temptation

the Devil ever created:

238
00:09:53,472 --> 00:09:54,805
Alcohol.

a "liberry" book out,

256
00:10:41,353 --> 00:10:44,155
and I fells asleep reading it,
and I left it under the bed.

257
00:10:44,222 --> 00:10:46,757
I forgot about it
for three and a half years.

258
00:10:46,825 --> 00:10:49,326
I was going to take it back
on Amnesty Day,

259
00:10:49,394 --> 00:10:51,729
but on Amnesty Day,
I had a sip of rosé wine,

260
00:10:51,797 --> 00:10:53,998
and I never made it

Very well, my brother.

293
00:12:10,942 --> 00:12:12,877
Let us lead him on the path
of righteousness.

294
00:12:12,944 --> 00:12:14,311

used to speak

295
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:15,513
in long,
eloquent sentences,

296
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,014
but after years of drinking,

297
00:12:17,082 --> 00:12:19,049
he can only speak in short,
choppy utterances.

298
00:12:19,117 --> 00:12:20,684
Why, at one time,
if you asked him

299
00:12:20,752 --> 00:12:21,986
who his favorite
musicians were,

300
00:12:22,053 --> 00:12:24,688
he'd say Leonard Bernstein,
Johann Sebastian Bach

301
00:12:24,756 --> 00:12:26,357
and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

302
00:12:26,424 --> 00:12:29,093
But thanks to that old devil
hooch, it's all changed.

303
00:12:29,161 --> 00:12:30,161
Who's your favorite
musician, Ollie?

304
00:12:30,228 --> 00:12:31,295
Cher!

305
00:12:31,363 --> 00:12:32,763
He doesn't even like Cher.

Wow, you guys.
I'm impressed

339
00:13:54,746 --> 00:13:56,847
that you're taking your
sentence so seriously.

340
00:13:56,915 --> 00:14:00,017
And I know that the court
will be happy to hear this, too.

341
00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:02,186
Now, if you'll just keep it down

342
00:14:02,254 --> 00:14:03,887
so I don't get
any more complaints.

343
00:14:03,955 --> 00:14:05,122
Sure. No problem, Joe.

344
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,690
Thanks for stopping by.

345
00:14:08,526 --> 00:14:11,562
Yay!
(all cheer)

346
00:14:15,934 --> 00:14:17,134
So what do you say, guys?

347
00:14:17,202 --> 00:14:18,569
Should we take this party
to Denny's

348
00:14:18,637 --> 00:14:20,271
and hang out with the cast
of the high school play?

349
00:14:20,338 --> 00:14:22,439
Nah. I think I'm...
I'm just going to go home.

350
00:14:22,507 --> 00:14:23,841
All right.
You okay to drive?

351
00:14:23,908 --> 00:14:25,242
Oh, yeah, I'll be fine.

352
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,044
I'll crank the heat,
roll up the windows

353
00:14:27,112 --> 00:14:28,712
and blast the Lullaby Channel.
I'll be fine.

354
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,913
All right, take it easy.

355
00:14:29,981 --> 00:14:31,448
All right, you, too.
Get out of here.

356
00:14:31,516 --> 00:14:32,850
Hey! Like your jeans.

357
00:14:32,917 --> 00:14:34,118
Thanks. What...
Hey, what size are you?

358
00:14:34,185 --> 00:14:35,853
Yeah, I don't think
we're the same size.

359
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,321
Yeah, we'll figure
it out tomorrow.

360
00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:38,922
Come on, Brian.
You ready to go home?

361
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,624
Uh, no, Peter.

362
00:14:40,692 --> 00:14:42,693
I'm going to... I'm going to...
Going to meet Jenny's cats.

363
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:44,428
What are you talking about?
You hate cats.

364
00:14:44,496 --> 00:14:46,930
I'm going... to meet...
her cats.

365
00:14:46,998 --> 00:14:48,399
Geez. All right.
Okay. All right.

366
00:14:48,466 --> 00:14:50,134
You don't have to get all cat...

367
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:52,069
Hey, hey, cat dog, right?

368
00:14:52,137 --> 00:14:53,737

00:15:00,445 --> 00:15:02,579
where's all the poop go
when the cat...

374

When the... In a...
In a cat dog...?

375

When the cat poops...

376
00:15:05,617 --> 00:15:07,484
What, does it come out
of the dog's mouth?

Oh, God.

Oh, that's...
That's some kind of living hell.

That's some...

385
00:15:35,046 --> 00:15:37,414
Geez. Cat dog.

386
00:15:37,482 --> 00:15:38,916
What... What if... What if they...

387
00:15:38,983 --> 00:15:40,818
What if they want
to marry different people?

388
00:15:40,885 --> 00:15:42,853
You got a lawsuit on your hands.

389
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:44,688
That's what...
That's what happens.

All right... All right, look,

391
00:15:46,157 --> 00:15:47,925
let's get some music
going on in here.

392
00:15:47,992 --> 00:15:49,360

What... What the...
What happened?

406
00:16:32,105 --> 00:16:33,606
You're dead, jackass.

407
00:16:33,673 --> 00:16:35,774
You died in a drunk
driving accident.

408

Oh, God. Did I hold on
to the touchdown pass?

409

What the...?
What's wrong with you?

You know what?

411
00:16:41,648 --> 00:16:43,215
I was so drunk,
my ghost is drunk.

412
00:16:43,283 --> 00:16:45,517
Look, I've been told
I can give you another chance,

we have to do first.

What are you talking about?

415
00:16:48,788 --> 00:16:50,923
I'm talking about you
understanding alcohol

416
00:16:50,991 --> 00:16:52,558
just a little bit better.

417
00:16:52,626 --> 00:16:55,194
Peter, I'm going to show you
where your life is headed

418
00:16:55,262 --> 00:16:57,663
if you keep drinking
as much as you do.

419
00:16:57,731 --> 00:16:59,398
(whooshing)

420

421
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:06,305
All right, Peter.
Here we are.

422
00:17:06,373 --> 00:17:07,606
Well, everything looks fine.

423
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,045
(slurring): All right, family.
Line up for cigar burns.

424
00:17:14,581 --> 00:17:15,514
Ah!

425
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,317
Oh!

426
00:17:18,385 --> 00:17:20,286
Yow!

427
00:17:20,353 --> 00:17:21,754
Ah!

428
00:17:21,821 --> 00:17:23,656
Ah!

429
00:17:23,723 --> 00:17:25,357
Wait a minute.
Who are you?

430
00:17:25,425 --> 00:17:27,226
(British accent):
I'm your other son, MacCawber.

431
00:17:27,294 --> 00:17:29,395
Here for my cigar burn,
good sir.

432
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:31,397
Stewie, go on,
get out of here,

433
00:17:31,464 --> 00:17:33,098
you stupid "laugh and cry,
effin' cry."

434
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,099
What's the difference?

435
00:17:38,305 --> 00:17:39,538
What's this?

436
00:17:39,606 --> 00:17:41,273
This is the bathroom
at my work.

437
00:17:41,341 --> 00:17:42,341
That's right.

438
00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:43,942
And there you are
in the stall

439
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,344
- with your boss, Angela.
- What?!

440
00:17:45,412 --> 00:17:47,413
Oh, my God, Angela.

441
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,982
That was... That was...
That felt so good.

442
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,551
All I want to do is
please you, Griffin.

443
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:54,720
Well that... That was
a good idea you had

444
00:17:54,788 --> 00:17:56,889
dunking your hand
in the toilet.

445
00:17:56,956 --> 00:17:58,791
Oh, my God!
I wouldn't have sex with Angela!

446
00:17:58,858 --> 00:18:00,092
She's disgusting!

447
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,627
Not when you're drunk,
she's not.

448
00:18:01,695 --> 00:18:02,895
All right, Death, I get it.

449
00:18:02,962 --> 00:18:05,597
I wish I'd never touched
a drop of alcohol in my life.

450
00:18:05,665 --> 00:18:06,965
Never touched a drop, huh?

451
00:18:07,033 --> 00:18:08,233
Well, guess what.

452
00:18:08,301 --> 00:18:09,768
I'm going to show you
that, too.

453
00:18:09,836 --> 00:18:11,737
(whooshing)

454
00:18:13,406 --> 00:18:14,973
Okay, get ready for this.

455
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,209
Hey, hey, hey, gang!

456
00:18:17,277 --> 00:18:19,044
Everybody line up
for a triple "H":

457
00:18:19,112 --> 00:18:23,315
a hug, a handshake
or a high five. Your call.

458
00:18:23,383 --> 00:18:26,285
Lois, hug! You got it.

459
00:18:26,353 --> 00:18:28,554
Stewie, hug! Two in a row.

460
00:18:28,621 --> 00:18:30,289
Try for three, Chris?

461
00:18:30,357 --> 00:18:32,024
Oh, no, high five.

462
00:18:32,092 --> 00:18:34,793
Well, that's okay.
High five's great, too.

463
00:18:34,861 --> 00:18:36,795
Meg, back to the hug.
All right.

464
00:18:36,863 --> 00:18:38,397
Hugs may win it today.

465
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:40,366
And we close
with a handshake.

466
00:18:40,433 --> 00:18:43,669
And all in time for my big
bike ride announcement.

467
00:18:43,737 --> 00:18:45,637
Who the (bleep)
is this jerk?

468
00:18:45,705 --> 00:18:48,374
That's you, Peter,
alcohol-free.

469
00:18:48,441 --> 00:18:50,209
(whooshing)

470
00:18:52,812 --> 00:18:55,347
(both laughing)
Ooh.

471
00:18:55,415 --> 00:18:56,582
Hey, look, there's
Joe and Quagmire.

472
00:18:56,649 --> 00:18:57,950
Hey, let's have a
drink with them.

473
00:18:58,017 --> 00:18:59,418
You've never touched
a drop, Peter.

474
00:18:59,486 --> 00:19:01,153
You don't even know
those guys.

475
00:19:01,221 --> 00:19:03,455
<i>Those</i> are your
friends over there.

476
00:19:03,523 --> 00:19:05,357
Hey, do you guys mind
keeping it down?

477
00:19:05,425 --> 00:19:07,459
We're trying to have
a conversation here.

478
00:19:07,527 --> 00:19:10,229
Some people. Gee whiz.

479
00:19:10,296 --> 00:19:12,931
Those are your friends,
Phillip, Ernest and Jonathan.

480
00:19:12,999 --> 00:19:15,134
Do I at least call him Jon?

481
00:19:15,201 --> 00:19:18,937
- No, he prefers Jonathan.
- Aw, one of those guys?

482
00:19:19,005 --> 00:19:20,606
You know, I have started taking

483
00:19:20,673 --> 00:19:22,441
a Bufferin baby aspirin
every day.

484
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:24,843
It's improved my heart
one heck of a heap,

485
00:19:24,911 --> 00:19:26,512
I'll tell you that,
pardon my French.

486
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:28,347
This is even worse
than the other one.

487
00:19:28,415 --> 00:19:29,915
I mean, it's cool I know French,

488
00:19:29,983 --> 00:19:31,016
but, Death, this ain't me.

489
00:19:31,084 --> 00:19:32,317
What am I
supposed to do?

490
00:19:32,385 --> 00:19:34,086
If I'm a drunk,
I'm a jerk,

491
00:19:34,154 --> 00:19:35,587
and if I'm sober,
I'm a douche.

492
00:19:35,655 --> 00:19:36,688
Exactly, Peter.

493
00:19:36,756 --> 00:19:38,023
It's called moderation.

494
00:19:38,091 --> 00:19:40,926
You don't have to give up
the booze cold turkey.

495
00:19:40,994 --> 00:19:42,761
You just have to be
responsible with it.

496
00:19:42,829 --> 00:19:44,530
You members of the human race

497
00:19:44,597 --> 00:19:46,799
have the ability
to send a man to the moon

498
00:19:46,866 --> 00:19:49,268
and make Justin Long
a movie star.

499
00:19:49,335 --> 00:19:51,804
With that kind of willpower,
don't you think you can learn

500
00:19:51,871 --> 00:19:54,373
to put the bottle down
just sometimes?

501
00:19:54,441 --> 00:19:56,809
We did it with Justin Long,
didn't we?

502
00:19:56,876 --> 00:19:58,844
America said no,
but we kept at it.

503
00:19:58,912 --> 00:20:00,279
All right, Death.

504
00:20:00,346 --> 00:20:01,480
I'll try.

505
00:20:14,527 --> 00:20:15,861
Well, we're home.

506
00:20:15,929 --> 00:20:18,897
Thirty days of sobriety,
and we can finally drink again.

507
00:20:18,965 --> 00:20:20,332
Oh, for God's sake, Peter,

508
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,134
didn't you learn
anything from this?

509
00:20:22,202 --> 00:20:24,069
Yes, I did, Lois.

510
00:20:24,137 --> 00:20:26,071
These are going
in the garbage.

511
00:20:26,139 --> 00:20:28,474
But these...
I'm keeping for myself.

512
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,142
Moderation, Lois.

513
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,410
Wow, Peter.

514
00:20:31,478 --> 00:20:33,078
I never thought
I'd see the day.

515
00:20:33,146 --> 00:20:34,713
Good for you.

516
00:20:34,781 --> 00:20:36,548
From now on, half
of every six-pack I buy

517
00:20:36,616 --> 00:20:38,484
is going in the trash.

518
00:20:43,456 --> 00:20:45,457
Hey, how... How come
we're the only animals

519
00:20:45,525 --> 00:20:47,526
with poo that's white?

520
00:20:47,594 --> 00:20:49,361
I know. What the hell?

521
00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:51,797
Right? We're not...
We're not eating white stuff.

522
00:20:51,865 --> 00:20:53,465
Hey, you want
something good?

523
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:56,535
Just look for the containers
that say "KFC" on them.

524
00:20:56,603 --> 00:20:58,470
There's always
something good in there.

525
00:20:58,538 --> 00:21:00,005
Dude, that's birds in there.

526
00:21:00,073 --> 00:21:02,107
You're eat...
You're eating another bird.

527
00:21:02,175 --> 00:21:04,042
- What?
- That's bird meat, dude.

528
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,677
What? No.

529
00:21:05,745 --> 00:21:06,812
You're eating a bird.

530
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,081
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
(squawks)
