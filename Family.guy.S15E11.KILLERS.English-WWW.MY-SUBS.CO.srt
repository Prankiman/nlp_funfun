11
00:00:35,601 --> 00:00:36,767
Touchdown Patriots!

12
00:00:36,802 --> 00:00:39,003
Beautiful pass by Tom Brady.

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,071
Yeah, Brady!

14
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:41,272
He's awesome.

15
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:44,242
I can't believe Gisele
gets to sleep with him.

16
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:45,709
I wish I was a supermodel.

17
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:46,744
Hey, it's a commercial.

18
00:00:46,779 --> 00:00:48,412
Jerome, switch over to the RedZone.

19
00:00:48,447 --> 00:00:50,547
Screw that, I say we
put on the BoneZone.

20
00:00:50,582 --> 00:00:52,115
- What's that?
- Oh, it's awesome.

21
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:54,151
They show every sex scene on TV

22
00:00:54,186 --> 00:00:56,753
without all the boring
dialogue and plot.

23
00:00:56,788 --> 00:00:58,388
Okay, once again,

24
00:00:58,424 --> 00:01:00,223
nothing is happening on Homeland,

25
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:02,059
but over on Masters
of Sex, Lizzie Caplan

26
00:01:02,094 --> 00:01:04,727
is hooked up to electrodes
and getting it from a guy

27
00:01:04,763 --> 00:01:06,328
who sounds American, but probably isn't.

28
00:01:06,364 --> 00:01:07,796
Hey, we're gonna split the screens now

29
00:01:07,831 --> 00:01:10,232
because my producer is
telling me on Game of Thrones

30
00:01:10,268 --> 00:01:12,401
we got a malnourished
Albino plowing a girl

31
00:01:12,437 --> 00:01:14,403
in a tub as he names dragons.

32
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:17,358
Oh, there's a Bone Zone
alert for Girls,

33
00:01:17,383 --> 00:01:18,273
which we'll ignore,

34
00:01:18,308 --> 00:01:20,276
'cause it's Gabby Hoffmann
Donald Ducking it.

35
00:01:20,311 --> 00:01:22,610
Last time we went to that,
we lost a lot of subscribers,

36
00:01:22,645 --> 00:01:24,145
and we're keeping
an eye on The Knick.

37
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:25,580
We don't want to bring
you dead boobs,

38
00:01:25,615 --> 00:01:28,249
but if they're alive,
we'll get you over there.

39
00:01:28,285 --> 00:01:29,750
Ah, crap.

40
00:01:29,786 --> 00:01:31,586
It's almost 3:00. I
got to get out of here.

41
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:32,920
For what? It's Sunday.

42
00:01:32,956 --> 00:01:35,090
Eh, the airline's making
us all attend a seminar

43
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:36,757
about what do to if
someone flies a drone

44
00:01:36,793 --> 00:01:38,025
into your flight path.

45
00:01:38,061 --> 00:01:39,926
Yeah, I hear that kind
of obnoxious behavior

46
00:01:39,962 --> 00:01:42,862
is very big right now in the
dangerous idiot community.

47
00:01:42,898 --> 00:01:45,031
Really? I didn't see that
in the newsletter this month.

48
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:48,068
Just a big article about how to
tailgate a speeding fire truck

49
00:01:48,104 --> 00:01:49,786
to get places faster.

50
00:01:52,007 --> 00:01:53,974
Wait till they
get to the golf course

51
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:56,509
and find out there's no fire.

52
00:01:56,544 --> 00:01:57,810
No, It's a serious problem.

53
00:01:57,845 --> 00:01:58,978
Nowadays any moron

54
00:01:59,013 --> 00:02:00,580
could just order a drone online.

55
00:02:00,615 --> 00:02:02,381
- Oh.
- There's no regulation.

56
00:02:02,417 --> 00:02:04,250
- Oh!
- And most of them have cameras

57
00:02:04,285 --> 00:02:05,985
so people can spy on whoever they want

58
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,320
and invade their privacy.

59
00:02:07,355 --> 00:02:09,054
Oh!

60
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,090
Peter, are you ordering
a drone right now?

61
00:02:11,126 --> 00:02:12,825
You bet your ass I am.

62
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,993
Owning a drone is gonna be a blast.

63
00:02:15,028 --> 00:02:17,357
Even more fun than when
I had breakfast in bread.

64
00:02:18,927 --> 00:02:20,549
Hi, Lois. It's a great morning,

65
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,767
no matter how you slice it.

66
00:02:22,802 --> 00:02:24,402
Yeah, I don't know what this is Peter,

67
00:02:24,438 --> 00:02:26,338
but we're four months
behind on our mortgage.

68
00:02:26,373 --> 00:02:27,606
Well, that's odd.

69
00:02:27,641 --> 00:02:29,874
It's not like we're
short on dough.

70
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:31,908
I'm taking the kids and
I'm staying at my parents'

71
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:32,953
for a while.

72
00:02:32,978 --> 00:02:36,121
That's the yeast of my concerns.

73
00:02:40,486 --> 00:02:42,186
Ah, Brian, you finally made it.

74
00:02:42,221 --> 00:02:43,754
I'm having a tea party. Sit down.

75
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:45,689
Yeah, you texted me, like, 80 times.

76
00:02:45,724 --> 00:02:47,790
Look, Stewie, I don't
have time to sip air

77
00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:49,759
and pretend to eat a
wooden hamburger patty.

78
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,094
Yeah? Tell me why you don't have time.

79
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,730
All right, I have time.

80
00:02:54,766 --> 00:02:56,399
And there's nothing pretend about this.

81
00:02:56,434 --> 00:02:58,100
Real tea, real milk,

82
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,303
and the best honey you'll
ever taste in your whole life.

83
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,239
Wow, this is good.

84
00:03:04,275 --> 00:03:05,307
Where'd you buy the honey?

85
00:03:05,342 --> 00:03:06,841
I didn't, I'm raising bees.

86
00:03:06,877 --> 00:03:08,577
You're raising bees?

87
00:03:08,612 --> 00:03:09,844
Like-like a beekeeper?

88
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,913
Yup, Mom missed soccer registration,

89
00:03:11,948 --> 00:03:14,149
so this is my weekends.

90
00:03:14,185 --> 00:03:16,117
Mmm, I got to say, you're good at it.

91
00:03:16,153 --> 00:03:18,153
You know, you could
probably sell this stuff.

92
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:19,788
Really? You think it's that good?

93
00:03:19,823 --> 00:03:20,822
Yeah, plus it's local.

94
00:03:20,857 --> 00:03:22,156
It's straight from the hive.

95
00:03:22,192 --> 00:03:24,725
People at farmers' markets
would go nuts for this.

96
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,795
You know, you could probably
charge, like, $20, $30 a jar.

97
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,463
Oh, now I'm excited about this, Brian.

98
00:03:29,499 --> 00:03:32,610
I feel like an eighth
grader who just had sex.

99
00:03:32,635 --> 00:03:33,901
So, you go all the way?

100
00:03:33,936 --> 00:03:34,968
Oh, yeah.

101
00:03:35,004 --> 00:03:36,237
I'm gonna need some proof.

102
00:03:36,272 --> 00:03:38,638
Hmm, how can I prove it?

103
00:03:38,674 --> 00:03:40,740
Maybe with Father O'Leary's briefs.

104
00:03:40,775 --> 00:03:43,243
- Oh!
- The king.

105
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:46,369
He said he loved me.

106
00:03:50,485 --> 00:03:52,118
All right, time to take flight.

107
00:03:52,153 --> 00:03:53,653
Drone of Arcadia.

108
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:54,821
Oh, Amber Tamblyn.

109
00:03:54,856 --> 00:03:56,121
I love that show.

110
00:03:56,156 --> 00:03:57,956
Now married to David Cross.

111
00:04:01,662 --> 00:04:03,128
Can I have a turn? I want a turn.

112
00:04:03,163 --> 00:04:04,330
No.

113
00:04:04,365 --> 00:04:05,931
Hey, does Cleveland have a bald spot?

114
00:04:05,966 --> 00:04:07,199
No.

115
00:04:07,235 --> 00:04:08,711
Hey, what's this do?

116
00:04:28,255 --> 00:04:30,220
Check it out, Here comes a hawk.

117
00:04:35,661 --> 00:04:36,460
Uh-oh.

118
00:04:36,495 --> 00:04:37,994
What's happening?

119
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:39,829
Ah, no!

120
00:04:39,865 --> 00:04:41,898
I don't think this is consensual!

121
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:45,674
Look at that pervert
squirrel just watching.

122
00:04:51,175 --> 00:04:52,675
Oh, crap, it's busted.

123
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,311
And I bet it's completely traumatized.

124
00:04:55,346 --> 00:04:56,879
I wasn't traumatized actually.

125
00:04:56,914 --> 00:04:58,013
It was planned.

126
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,982
Part of the games we play.

127
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:04,218
I've been a bad drone.

128
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,222
Peter, you've been knocking a while.

129
00:05:08,258 --> 00:05:09,524
I don't think anyone's in there.

130
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,025
Yeah, look at all this mail.

131
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,262
Maybe he's on vacation or something.

132
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:18,166
Oh, my God, he's dead!

133
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:20,268
And his face and earlobes are missing.

134
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:24,037
Oh, that's a relief.

135
00:05:24,072 --> 00:05:27,073
It's just the cat that
ate his face and ears off.

136
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:34,047
So, Brian, this is my hive.

137
00:05:34,082 --> 00:05:35,849
Now, how many bees do
you think are in here?

138
00:05:35,884 --> 00:05:37,350
I don't know, a-a million?

139
00:05:37,385 --> 00:05:39,218
No, it's 4,000.

140
00:05:39,253 --> 00:05:40,386
Now that seems like nothing

141
00:05:40,422 --> 00:05:42,188
because of your idiot million guess.

142
00:05:42,223 --> 00:05:44,290
All right, now, if
you're going to sell honey

143
00:05:44,326 --> 00:05:46,426
at the farmers' market,
you need to practice.

144
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:48,961
So you be the salesman,
and I'll be the customer.

145
00:05:48,996 --> 00:05:51,597
Ooh, what do we have here?

146
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:52,765
Uh, honey.

147
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:54,200
Like the sign says.

148
00:05:54,235 --> 00:05:55,801
I find your attitude cavalier.

149
00:05:55,836 --> 00:05:57,402
May I speak to your manager?

150
00:05:57,438 --> 00:05:58,403
Stewie, come on.

151
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,705
I'm sorry, is there a problem here?

152
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,573
I was just in the back
and I heard a commotion.

153
00:06:01,608 --> 00:06:03,542
- How do we have a back?
- I simply came here

154
00:06:03,577 --> 00:06:04,909
to enquire about honey

155
00:06:04,945 --> 00:06:07,879
and your employee spoke to
me loudly and with profanity.

156
00:06:07,914 --> 00:06:09,214
Stewie, this is ridiculous.

157
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:12,383
Brian, please, I trust that
this handsome young customer

158
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:13,751
knows what he's talking about.

159
00:06:13,786 --> 00:06:17,120
Oh, my, and I thought only
bees pour on the honey.

160
00:06:17,156 --> 00:06:18,121
I'm going inside.

161
00:06:18,157 --> 00:06:19,657
So, are you from around here?

162
00:06:19,692 --> 00:06:22,092
No I'm just in town for the
John Singer Sargent exhibit

163
00:06:22,127 --> 00:06:23,894
at the museum. Really?

164
00:06:23,929 --> 00:06:26,129
I've been looking for
an excuse to go again.

165
00:06:26,165 --> 00:06:28,398
Well, looks like I won't
need that audio tour.

166
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:29,399
Great. Give me one minute.

167
00:06:29,434 --> 00:06:30,767
Let me text my fiancée.

168
00:06:30,802 --> 00:06:33,092
Your what?

169
00:06:36,174 --> 00:06:37,607
That was Bonnie.

170
00:06:37,642 --> 00:06:39,986
She said they already
sold the house behind us.

171
00:06:40,361 --> 00:06:41,478
Poor Mr. Seigel.

172
00:06:41,513 --> 00:06:44,681
What the hell is that?

173
00:06:44,716 --> 00:06:45,981
Yeah, that party bus is awesome.

174
00:06:46,016 --> 00:06:47,983
Yeah, let's go, let's go.

175
00:06:48,018 --> 00:06:49,585
- Here we go, baby.
- Yeah!

176
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,788
Oh, God, please don't let
that be our new neighbors.

177
00:06:52,823 --> 00:06:54,757
- What is it?
- Some kind of crazy van

178
00:06:54,792 --> 00:06:57,125
with the number 87 on the side.

179
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,428
87?

180
00:06:59,463 --> 00:07:01,663
That's not a van, Lois,
that's a party bus.

181
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:04,432
Rob Gronkowski's party bus!

182
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:05,466
Who's that?

183
00:07:05,502 --> 00:07:06,768
Only the star tight end

184
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:07,935
of the New England Patriots

185
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,337
and America's most athletic Polish.

186
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,441
Did you guys see?

187
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:15,643
Oh, my God, that was Rob Gronkowski.

188
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,017
Am I running?

189
00:07:24,052 --> 00:07:26,152
Is this what running is?

190
00:07:26,187 --> 00:07:28,187
I hate it.

191
00:07:33,028 --> 00:07:34,795
What's up, butt munchers?

192
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,796
That's us! He called us butt munchers!

193
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,130
We're butt munchers!

194
00:07:40,034 --> 00:07:43,736
All right, time to Gronk
a dump in my new house.

195
00:07:43,771 --> 00:07:46,038
Oh. My. God!

196
00:07:46,073 --> 00:07:48,541
Our new neighbor is Gronk.

197
00:07:48,576 --> 00:07:50,309
Hey, I'm your new mailman.

198
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:53,045
Former star of The Incredible
Hulk, Lou Ferrigno.

199
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,647
On any other day that
would be so exciting.

200
00:07:55,682 --> 00:07:57,433
Please give me my mail and go.

201
00:08:03,498 --> 00:08:04,795
What the hell are you doing?

202
00:08:04,826 --> 00:08:06,787
I wanted to bring over
something to welcome Gronk

203
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:08,876
to the neighborhood. So I
scraped all the cool ranch

204
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:10,699
off of 15 bags of Doritos.

205
00:08:10,801 --> 00:08:12,442
You're bringing him a bowl of powder?

206
00:08:12,622 --> 00:08:13,807
Yeah, I thought he could
eat it by the fistful

207
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:15,564
or rub it on his balls.

208
00:08:15,604 --> 00:08:17,730
Peter, I don't know what
you're so excited about.

209
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,035
Rob Gronkowski is probably the
worst neighbor we could ask for.

210
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,832
You know he's gonna be
partying day and night.

211
00:08:23,864 --> 00:08:26,715
It's not like it's that tasty
piece of ass, Julian Edelman.

212
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:29,684
Now there's a Patriot
you can get excited about.

213
00:08:29,746 --> 00:08:33,424
I know he's a wide receiver,
but if he's giving, I'm taking.

214
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,455
I'll take it all.

215
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,822
I'll take it wherever.

216
00:08:37,663 --> 00:08:39,430
Ah!

217
00:08:39,611 --> 00:08:40,564
Anyway,

218
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:42,759
go suck up to your big dumb monster.

219
00:08:42,784 --> 00:08:45,119
I'll be here hooking the
"G" to thoughts of Edelman.

220
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:51,812
So, what'd you get him, Cleveland?

221
00:08:52,024 --> 00:08:53,726
Oreo middles.

222
00:08:53,937 --> 00:08:55,875
Whoa, four standing dogs?

223
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,171
No, we're people, sir.

224
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:59,171
Um, Mr. Gronk? I'm Peter Griffin.

225
00:08:59,227 --> 00:09:00,792
I live in the house behind yours.

226
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,753
We wanted to welcome
you to the neighborhood.

227
00:09:02,778 --> 00:09:03,862
Awesome!

228
00:09:05,106 --> 00:09:06,253
Ha-ha, he spiked it.

229
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:07,581
I was hoping he would do that.

230
00:09:07,606 --> 00:09:08,756
My eyes!

231
00:09:08,811 --> 00:09:10,115
Hey, you guys seem great.

232
00:09:10,153 --> 00:09:12,099
You want to come in and
eat pizza standing up?

233
00:09:12,388 --> 00:09:14,231
- Uh, yeah.
- Cool.

234
00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:15,700
You mind if I call you all Grover?

235
00:09:15,872 --> 00:09:17,051
I don't like learning names.

236
00:09:17,076 --> 00:09:18,426
Yeah, sure, that'd be sweet.

237
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:19,840
Well, come on in, Grover.

238
00:09:19,965 --> 00:09:21,559
He knows my name!

239
00:09:25,099 --> 00:09:28,263
Oh, my God, you guys, having
Gronk here is gonna be the best.

240
00:09:28,412 --> 00:09:30,906
Kind of like those years when
it was just Marley and me.

241
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:35,406
Hey, my dog's chewing
up that thing I need.

242
00:09:35,648 --> 00:09:38,531
Hey, my dirty dog's jumping
in the neighbor's pool.

243
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,234
Wait, Marley, don't shake your wet fur

244
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:43,158
in the middle of this fancy party.

245
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,102
I'm gonna lay down these
work blueprints on the floor

246
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:49,105
and I sure hope you don't walk
across them with muddy paws.

247
00:09:50,134 --> 00:09:51,313
Marley!

248
00:09:51,798 --> 00:09:54,476
Aw, my nightmare dog is dead.

249
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:56,093
Marley and me.

250
00:10:00,257 --> 00:10:03,389
Workout room, kegerator cellar,

251
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,896
another workout room,

252
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:07,639
and over here's a room
that's just got a lit candle

253
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,404
on a bale of hay.

254
00:10:09,623 --> 00:10:11,607
I-Is that just 'cause of the danger?

255
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:13,108
That's exactly why.

256
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:15,787
My dumb wife won't let
me have a room like that.

257
00:10:15,858 --> 00:10:16,983
Do you have a wife?

258
00:10:22,234 --> 00:10:23,063
What's going on?

259
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:24,867
Let's go check out the hot tub.

260
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,523
Check it out, my hot tub
is filled with coffee.

261
00:10:33,558 --> 00:10:35,191
Grab a donut, go to town!

262
00:10:35,227 --> 00:10:37,427
Sponsored by Dunkin' Donuts.

263
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:40,769
And the pool is filled
with my favorite food:

264
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:42,285
soup with little shapes in it.

265
00:10:42,402 --> 00:10:43,847
Sponsored by Campbell Soup.

266
00:10:43,871 --> 00:10:46,472
Oh, alphabet soup is my favorite, too.

267
00:10:46,507 --> 00:10:47,907
What's a "albaphet"?

268
00:10:47,942 --> 00:10:50,142
Nothing. What you said is not anything.

269
00:10:50,177 --> 00:10:51,644
And check out the shower!

270
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:54,780
Ultra Sunrise Monster Energy Drink.

271
00:10:54,816 --> 00:10:56,515
Sponsored by Monster Energy Drink.

272
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,317
Why do you keep saying what
things are sponsored by?

273
00:10:59,352 --> 00:11:00,585
My manager said if I don't,

274
00:11:00,621 --> 00:11:01,987
I won't go to heaven.

275

Sponsored by SMS Audio
Sweatproof Sport Headphones.

276
00:11:09,863 --> 00:11:10,996
Well, you were right,

277
00:11:11,031 --> 00:11:12,463
the farmers' market is wonderful.

278
00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:14,499
You've got your yoga pants moms,

279
00:11:14,534 --> 00:11:17,167
you got your mixed-race
kids riding a pony,

280
00:11:17,202 --> 00:11:18,869
a confused Jerome...

281
00:11:18,904 --> 00:11:20,203
What is this?

282
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:22,106
A vegetable parking lot?

283
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:23,507
Now, remember to tell customers

284
00:11:23,542 --> 00:11:25,442
that this honey is farm-to-table.

285
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,177
We're not a restaurant,
that doesn't make any sense.

286
00:11:27,212 --> 00:11:28,178
Doesn't have to.

287
00:11:28,213 --> 00:11:29,680
Say anything-to-anything,

288
00:11:29,715 --> 00:11:31,181
people lose their minds.

289
00:11:31,216 --> 00:11:32,349
Just so you know,

290
00:11:32,384 --> 00:11:34,450
this is all grass-to-bottle.

291
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,985
- Ooh!
- I know, right?

292
00:11:36,021 --> 00:11:38,054
That'll be $68.

293
00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:39,689
Is this a superfood?

294
00:11:39,724 --> 00:11:41,791
Total superfood. Full of GMOs.

295
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,026
GMOs are bad.

296
00:11:43,061 --> 00:11:44,326
No GMOs whatsoever.

297
00:11:44,362 --> 00:11:45,862
Amazing.

298
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:47,964
Wow, this is great,

299
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,065
we've only been here an hour

300
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,632
and we're almost totally sold out.

301
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,200
Yes, I didn't see that coming.

302
00:11:52,235 --> 00:11:54,202
Just like Dan Cortese

303
00:11:54,237 --> 00:11:56,805
didn't see the end of the '90s coming.

304
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,806
Three...

305
00:11:57,841 --> 00:11:58,974
two...

306
00:11:59,009 --> 00:11:59,975
one...

307
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,743
Happy New Year!

308
00:12:05,783 --> 00:12:09,050
Dan Cortese was the only
thing in the entire world

309
00:12:09,085 --> 00:12:11,652
affected by Y2K.

310
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,059
Grovers, you made it!

311
00:12:18,094 --> 00:12:19,060
Here, have a beer.

312
00:12:19,095 --> 00:12:20,227
Thanks.

313
00:12:20,262 --> 00:12:21,361
Hey, Gronk, you know, there's something

314
00:12:21,397 --> 00:12:22,529
I always wanted to ask you.

315
00:12:22,565 --> 00:12:24,230
When you know you have single coverage,

316
00:12:24,265 --> 00:12:25,765
do you give a hand signal to Brady,

317
00:12:25,801 --> 00:12:27,033
or is it just eye contact?

318
00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:28,034
I don't know,

319
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,435
want to see me dance?

320
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,104
Well, no, I ask because sometimes

321
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:32,471
you're being covered by a little guy,

322
00:12:32,507 --> 00:12:34,774
and then you and Brady'll
look at each other and...

323
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,910
A-Am I... am I supposed to touch you?

324
00:12:36,945 --> 00:12:39,079
What... what am I...
what am I doing here?

325
00:12:39,114 --> 00:12:41,279
Oh, I'm sorry, bro.
What was the question?

326
00:12:41,315 --> 00:12:43,048
I ju... I just want to know if
you and Brady have, like, a...

327
00:12:43,084 --> 00:12:44,950
Like, a secret hand signal or something.

328
00:12:44,985 --> 00:12:46,585
Whoa, that is top secret,

329
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,887
but lean in and I'll tell you.

330
00:12:50,691 --> 00:12:52,390
How rude.

331
00:12:52,426 --> 00:12:53,926
Hey, want to meet my family?

332
00:12:53,961 --> 00:12:55,094
These are my brothers.

333
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:56,929
Actually, one of them is my dad,

334
00:12:56,964 --> 00:12:58,362
I'm not sure which.

335
00:12:58,397 --> 00:12:59,463
Probably the gray-haired one

336
00:12:59,498 --> 00:13:01,099
with the whiskey-face sunburn?

337
00:13:01,134 --> 00:13:02,800
Oh, it's an honor to meet you, sir.

338
00:13:02,836 --> 00:13:04,102
You must be very proud.

339
00:13:04,137 --> 00:13:05,103
Hell yeah.

340
00:13:05,138 --> 00:13:06,470
I think every dad's dream

341
00:13:06,505 --> 00:13:08,806
is taking his son's sloppy seconds.

342
00:13:08,842 --> 00:13:10,441
Is your mom here, too?

343
00:13:10,476 --> 00:13:11,575
They don't have a mom.

344
00:13:11,611 --> 00:13:12,910
My ex-wife raised them,

345
00:13:12,946 --> 00:13:14,645
God bless her, but genetically,

346
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,948
they're a product of me
blammin' onto a side of beef.

347
00:13:20,986 --> 00:13:22,986
All right, since we sold out so fast,

348
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:24,888
we've got to make these
bees more productive,

349
00:13:24,923 --> 00:13:26,123
get them to make more honey.

350
00:13:26,158 --> 00:13:27,290
How are we gonna do that?

351
00:13:27,325 --> 00:13:28,792
Steroids, Brian.

352
00:13:28,827 --> 00:13:30,260
This here is the same stuff

353
00:13:30,295 --> 00:13:31,827
that turned Barry Bonds' head

354
00:13:31,863 --> 00:13:33,729
into a prize-winning squash.

355
00:13:33,765 --> 00:13:35,731
Okay. Well, how much are
we supposed to give them?

356
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:36,766
Hmm.

357
00:13:36,801 --> 00:13:39,101
It says this is enough for a horse, so,

358
00:13:39,137 --> 00:13:41,170
I don't know, how many bees is a horse?

359
00:13:41,205 --> 00:13:42,972
Well, you can't fit a horse in this box,

360
00:13:43,007 --> 00:13:44,974
so I'd just use the whole thing.

361
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:46,142
That makes sense.

362
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:52,647
Barry Bonds says that's
too much steroids.

363
00:13:52,682 --> 00:13:54,448
Time for bed, Barry.

364
00:14:04,795 --> 00:14:06,293
God, they're still going?

365
00:14:06,328 --> 00:14:08,528
Peter, this is exactly what
I told you would happen!

366
00:14:08,563 --> 00:14:10,630
Not so much fun anymore, is it?

367
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,166
Oh, thank God,

368
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:14,001
maybe they're wrapping it up.

369
00:14:20,575 --> 00:14:22,176
Damn it, I can't take anymore!

370
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:24,177
He is the worst neighbor ever.

371
00:14:24,212 --> 00:14:26,145
You won't believe what he did yesterday.

372
00:14:27,215 --> 00:14:28,647
Hey, Grover, catch!

373
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,493
Uh, listen, Gronk, um,

374
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:44,029
it's gettin' kind of late.

375
00:14:44,064 --> 00:14:46,497
Don't you think maybe it's
time to call it a night?

376
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:47,532
Yeah, sure.

377
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:49,500
Hey, you ever seen a nard explode?

378
00:14:49,536 --> 00:14:51,469
A... a what? A wha... a nard?

379
00:14:51,504 --> 00:14:52,704
I don't...

380
00:14:52,739 --> 00:14:54,005
Is that something on the Internet?

381
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,073
Uh, 'cause I...

382
00:14:55,108 --> 00:14:56,341
Ah, damn it, what the hell?!

383
00:14:57,376 --> 00:14:58,709
Oh, nice shot there.

384
00:14:58,744 --> 00:15:00,377
Come on, don't get mad, bro.

385
00:15:00,412 --> 00:15:01,478
I was just kidding.

386
00:15:01,513 --> 00:15:02,479
You were kidding?!

387
00:15:02,514 --> 00:15:03,547
What was the joke?!

388
00:15:03,582 --> 00:15:04,681
This was!

389
00:15:04,717 --> 00:15:06,550
Oh, damn it, you hit the seam!

390
00:15:06,585 --> 00:15:07,718
Oh!

391
00:15:07,753 --> 00:15:08,719
Yeah.

392
00:15:08,754 --> 00:15:09,720
You know what?

393
00:15:09,755 --> 00:15:11,322
You're a jerk, Gronk!

394
00:15:11,357 --> 00:15:12,323
That's it,

395
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:13,724
I'm getting rid of that bastard.

396
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:15,225
Just like I helped kick the British

397
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,659
out of America.

398
00:15:16,694 --> 00:15:19,262
This tyranny shall not stand!

399
00:15:19,297 --> 00:15:20,830
For without liberty...

400
00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:22,832
Ah, crap, he's even in the cutaways!

401
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:27,536
Just...
Just go to commercial.

402
00:15:27,572 --> 00:15:29,405
I'm gonna squat here
and hold onto this bench.

403
00:15:36,413 --> 00:15:38,313
Peter, you got to figure something out.

404
00:15:38,349 --> 00:15:40,315
They haven't stopped
partying the whole night.

405
00:15:40,351 --> 00:15:41,583
- Yeah!
- Gronk!

406
00:15:41,618 --> 00:15:43,551
- Party!
- I'm the dad!

407
00:15:43,587 --> 00:15:45,587
I'm sorry, you were right all along.

408
00:15:45,622 --> 00:15:46,922
But don't worry, I'll take care of it.

409
00:15:46,957 --> 00:15:48,656
Well, you better do something soon.

410
00:15:48,692 --> 00:15:49,992
I can't live like this.

411
00:15:50,027 --> 00:15:51,558
I know. That guy's more annoying

412
00:15:51,594 --> 00:15:52,994
than going to an Italian restaurant

413
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:54,896
with someone who's been to Italy.

414
00:15:54,931 --> 00:15:56,597
They call this a trattoria?

415
00:15:56,632 --> 00:15:58,565
More like a ristorante to me.

416
00:15:58,601 --> 00:16:00,401
Look at that fresco.

417
00:16:00,436 --> 00:16:02,236
Supposed to be the hills of Elba?

418
00:16:02,272 --> 00:16:03,905
Not once you've seen 'em.

419
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,906
Are you ready to order?

420
00:16:04,941 --> 00:16:07,074
Si. Let me handle this, Peter.

421
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:10,143
Two spaghettis and a chicken fingers.

422
00:16:14,413 --> 00:16:16,449
God, look at all the
honey the bees made!

423
00:16:16,484 --> 00:16:18,718
Those steroids were
a great idea, Stewie.

424
00:16:18,753 --> 00:16:21,454
Hey, look, that bee is
trying to get our honey.

425
00:16:21,489 --> 00:16:22,956
Okay, Mr. Bee,

426
00:16:22,991 --> 00:16:24,757
we'll give you the employee discount.

427
00:16:24,793 --> 00:16:25,757
After all, you...

428
00:16:25,793 --> 00:16:27,259
Holy crap!

429
00:16:27,295 --> 00:16:29,561
That thing just lifted
a whole jar of honey!

430
00:16:29,596 --> 00:16:33,265
Oh, God, do you think that's
one of our steroid bees?

431
00:16:35,136 --> 00:16:37,202
Well, this one's wearing
a hoodie as a shirt.

432
00:16:37,238 --> 00:16:39,471
So, yeah, I think these are ours.

433
00:16:39,506 --> 00:16:40,973
Stewie, I have a bad feeling abo...

434
00:16:41,008 --> 00:16:42,907
Oh, God, it just ate the other bee!

435
00:16:42,943 --> 00:16:45,944
Okay, so a few of them
had a bad reaction to...

436
00:16:45,979 --> 00:16:47,278
Oh, crap.

437
00:16:51,151 --> 00:16:53,351
Oh, my God. Brian, run!

438
00:16:58,258 --> 00:17:00,424
I think maybe giving those bees steroids

439
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:01,658
was a bad idea.

440
00:17:02,694 --> 00:17:04,661
Turn on the wipers!

441
00:17:12,871 --> 00:17:14,137
You sure this is gonna work, Peter?

442
00:17:14,173 --> 00:17:15,272
Absolutely.

443
00:17:15,307 --> 00:17:17,340
Gronk went to the University of Arizona,

444
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,741
and everyone who went to
the University of Arizona

445
00:17:19,777 --> 00:17:21,410
believes leprechauns are real.

446
00:17:21,446 --> 00:17:24,347
And since Cleveland already owns
a green suit and a top hat...

447
00:17:24,382 --> 00:17:26,715
This is my Easter clothes.

448
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,652
Whoa, a leprechaun!

449
00:17:30,688 --> 00:17:31,854
Say the thing.

450
00:17:31,889 --> 00:17:32,921
Top
of the morning to you,

451
00:17:32,957 --> 00:17:34,155
Mr. Gronkowski.

452
00:17:34,191 --> 00:17:36,491
Have you any interest in a pot of gold?

453
00:17:36,526 --> 00:17:39,527
All you have to do is
move to Tallahassee!

454
00:17:39,562 --> 00:17:40,528
Wait a minute,

455
00:17:40,563 --> 00:17:42,430
this is just a disguise!

456
00:17:42,466 --> 00:17:44,699
Aah, son of a bitch!

457
00:17:44,734 --> 00:17:45,833
What's going on here?

458
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:47,369
Are you guys trying to get rid of me?

459
00:17:47,404 --> 00:17:48,536
Yeah, we're tryin' to get rid of you!

460
00:17:48,571 --> 00:17:49,837
Why?

461
00:17:49,873 --> 00:17:52,172
'Cause you're a pain in
the ass to live next to!

462
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,474
I mean, what the hell, Gronk?

463
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:54,674
Why you got to be like this?

464
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,809
You're a millionaire,

465
00:17:55,844 --> 00:17:57,444
you have the sweetest job in the world,

466
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,812
you can do whatever you want.

467
00:17:58,847 --> 00:18:00,881
Why you got to act like
such an idiot all the time?

468
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,283
It's not a choice, Grover.

469
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:05,386
But rather, an obligation.

470
00:18:05,421 --> 00:18:07,053
You see, I've been groomed for this

471
00:18:07,088 --> 00:18:08,054
my entire life.

472
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:09,622
Scoring touchdowns,

473
00:18:09,657 --> 00:18:10,623
making people laugh,

474
00:18:10,658 --> 00:18:11,991
punishing my body,

475
00:18:12,027 --> 00:18:13,326
enduring the pain.

476
00:18:13,361 --> 00:18:15,361
All in the name of entertainment.

477
00:18:15,397 --> 00:18:16,529
Don't you understand?

478
00:18:16,564 --> 00:18:18,364
I'm a commodity, a product.

479
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,033
A modern day gladiator.

480
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:22,068
You ask about the
whys and the wherefores

481
00:18:22,103 --> 00:18:23,403
behind the boorish facade?

482
00:18:23,438 --> 00:18:24,802
The answer is simple:

483
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:28,240
I play the jester because
society deems it necessary.

484
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:31,309
Also, I'm insane!

485
00:18:32,913 --> 00:18:33,878
Eat a butt, fatty!

486
00:18:33,914 --> 00:18:35,713
Gronk ain't going nowhere!

487
00:18:35,749 --> 00:18:37,249
Oh, that's it!

488
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,885
Oh, cool, we're fighting?

489
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:44,721
You guys mind if I eat
while I beat you up?

490
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,199
What the hell are we supposed to do?

491
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:56,233
We're surrounded!

492
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:57,601
Hang on, I got this.

493
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,669
"Meg, come outside.

494
00:18:59,704 --> 00:19:01,771
We have Pinkberry."

495
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:06,209
Ow! Ow, ow! Stop... stop it!

496
00:19:06,244 --> 00:19:07,210
All right, they're distracted,

497
00:19:07,245 --> 00:19:08,911
let's go!

498
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,780
Quick! We just have to
get rid of the queen!

499
00:19:10,815 --> 00:19:11,781
She's in the hive!

500
00:19:11,816 --> 00:19:12,949
What's that gonna do?

501
00:19:12,984 --> 00:19:14,750
The bees instinctively
stay with the queen,

502
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,585
so if she's gone, they'll follow her!

503
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,220
Okay, great, but how we gonna do it?

504
00:19:28,632 --> 00:19:30,265
You guys are bad fighters.

505
00:19:30,301 --> 00:19:31,800
That's his third sub.

506
00:19:34,137 --> 00:19:35,436
Ah, cool!

507
00:19:35,472 --> 00:19:36,937
Honey rain!

508
00:19:36,973 --> 00:19:37,938
Aah, oh, my God,

509
00:19:37,974 --> 00:19:38,939
is that a bee?!

510
00:19:38,975 --> 00:19:40,274
You have bees here?

511
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,876
Uh, yeah, it's the world.

512
00:19:45,482 --> 00:19:46,481
Holy crap!

513
00:19:46,516 --> 00:19:47,482
There's a ton of them!

514
00:19:47,517 --> 00:19:49,216
Dad, start up the party bus!

515
00:19:49,251 --> 00:19:50,217
We're moving!

516
00:19:50,252 --> 00:19:51,218
Bees?

517
00:19:51,253 --> 00:19:52,219
Yeah, bees!

518
00:19:52,254 --> 00:19:53,286
And they're showing blitz!

519
00:19:53,322 --> 00:19:54,821
We got to leave on two!

520
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:04,264
You think their Wi-Fi is "Vag-Town"?

521
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:06,432
Yeah, that's probably them.

522
00:20:06,467 --> 00:20:08,867
Look at that, no password.

523
00:20:12,673 --> 00:20:14,106
Oh, well, thank goodness

524
00:20:14,142 --> 00:20:16,074
we finally have our neighborhood back.

525
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,075
Yeah, now maybe Wilson

526
00:20:17,111 --> 00:20:18,110
can move back in and

527
00:20:18,146 --> 00:20:20,146
give me homespun wisdom over the fence.

528
00:20:20,181 --> 00:20:22,148
Peter, that was Home Improvement.

529
00:20:22,183 --> 00:20:23,681
It's exhausting

530
00:20:23,716 --> 00:20:26,083
that you never just go
with something I say.

531
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,785
Coming up, yesterday's brisket.

532
00:20:29,556 --> 00:20:30,988
But first, breaking news:

533
00:20:31,024 --> 00:20:33,991
Rob Gronkowski has been
suspended from the Patriots

534
00:20:34,027 --> 00:20:35,660
following a failed drug test

535
00:20:35,695 --> 00:20:38,029
that showed evidence of
steroids in his system.

536
00:20:38,064 --> 00:20:40,264
The star athlete claims he has no idea

537
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:42,432
how the banned substance
got into his body.

538
00:20:42,468 --> 00:20:43,500
Oh, no way!

539
00:20:43,536 --> 00:20:44,668
That's terrible.

540
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:46,203
When pressed for further comment,

541
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,012
Mr. Gronkowski said simply,

542
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,606
"Grover, go long."

543
00:20:49,636 --> 00:20:50,689
Uh-oh.

544
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,949
