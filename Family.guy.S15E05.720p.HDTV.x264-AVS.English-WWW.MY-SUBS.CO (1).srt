11
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:36,868
Peter, I need you to take
Chris and Meg to school.

12
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:38,970
Today's the day I finally
kill that squirrel

13
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:40,972
that's been eating our tomatoes.

14
00:00:40,973 --> 00:00:42,907
Try to get, like, eight
of them this time.

15
00:00:42,908 --> 00:00:44,876
I want to make bruschetta.

16
00:00:44,877 --> 00:00:46,444
Oh, can't the kids just walk?

17
00:00:46,445 --> 00:00:49,381
You know I like to watch two
full movies before I go to work.

18
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:52,283
No, Peter, they can't
walk, it's three miles.

19
00:00:52,284 --> 00:00:54,119
Fine, I'll take them.

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,887
But you better keep those goggles

21
00:00:55,888 --> 00:00:59,057
'cause I'm gonna put them
to good use tonight.

22
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,961
Once the floor is full of sawdust,

23
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:04,807
we can eat peanuts in here.

24
00:01:10,269 --> 00:01:12,570
Dad, are you sure it's okay
that we took Brian's car?

25
00:01:12,571 --> 00:01:13,772
Yeah, it's his own fault.

26
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:15,440
He's the one who keeps
his key in the visor

27
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:17,019
like a carefree hillbilly.

28
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,143
Okay, everybody out.

29
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:20,744
I don't want the cool kids
to know I'm your dad.

30
00:01:23,482 --> 00:01:24,949
Hey, Chris.

31
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,419
Guess who I just scored as my
date to the homecoming dance.

32
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,054
- Vice Principal McGuire.
- Really?

33
00:01:30,055 --> 00:01:32,123
Yeah, her husband just died of ALS,

34
00:01:32,124 --> 00:01:34,058
so she is ready to get at it.

35
00:01:34,059 --> 00:01:36,327
Hey there, strong guy.

36
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:38,610
Not now, Brenda!

37
00:01:39,465 --> 00:01:42,901
She says I have the body of a
50-year-old before it gets ALS.

38
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:44,235
So who are you gonna go with?

39
00:01:44,236 --> 00:01:46,571
I was thinking of asking Kara Morris.

40
00:01:46,572 --> 00:01:48,006
Why don't you ask her now?

41
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:49,574
Her locker's right over there.

42
00:01:49,575 --> 00:01:51,890
Um... y... uh, yeah, okay.

43
00:01:52,511 --> 00:01:54,446
Hi, Kara.

44
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,815
I was wondering, um, if you'd like to go

45
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,616
to the homecoming dance with me?

46
00:01:58,617 --> 00:02:00,919
Oh, hi, robot from<i> Big Hero 6.</i>

47
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,221
No, but thank you.

48
00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:07,090
His name is Baymax, you gorgeous moron!

49
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,564
All right, red light.

50
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:15,600
Time to text and shave
and whittle and floss.

51
00:02:17,369 --> 00:02:19,237
- Thanks for getting here so quickly.
- What?

52
00:02:19,238 --> 00:02:20,772
I'm sorry. You're in a Prius.

53
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:22,474
I just assumed you were my Uber.

54
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,510
I don't know what that is
on account of being dull.

55
00:02:25,511 --> 00:02:27,946
Uber... it's like a cab
except it feels like a game

56
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:29,113
'cause it's from your phone.

57
00:02:29,114 --> 00:02:30,281
Anyway, I'm late for a meeting.

58
00:02:30,282 --> 00:02:32,350
Can I just give you 20
bucks to drop me off?

59
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:34,853
Wow, 20 bucks just to
drive you across town?

60
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,488
Maybe I should be an Uber driver.

61
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,323
I mean, I could use the extra money.

62
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,226
And it's got to be easier than
when I was delivering pizzas.

63
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:42,393
All right, push. Push.

64
00:02:42,394 --> 00:02:43,761
Come on, come on, almost there.

65
00:02:43,762 --> 00:02:45,497
Almost there, just one more push.

66
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,067
Here it is!

67
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:49,868
Oh, it's half Hawaiian.

68
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,703
I believe that's ours.

69
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,551
You poor fool.

70
00:03:00,212 --> 00:03:01,212
Hey, Stewie.

71
00:03:01,213 --> 00:03:02,547
What's up, big guy?

72
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:05,316
None of the girls at school want
to go to homecoming with me.

73
00:03:05,317 --> 00:03:08,520
Probably 'cause everyone calls
me names like "Big Nips"

74
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,022
and "Fat Nips" and "Big Fat Nips."

75
00:03:11,023 --> 00:03:13,157
Oh, don't listen to them, Big Fat Nips.

76
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:14,359
They're just being haters.

77
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,493
What's a "hater"?

78
00:03:15,494 --> 00:03:16,728
Oh, it's just something people say

79
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:18,879
instead of working to
change their own flaws.

80
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,632
Anyway, you just got to
do what Taylor Swift does

81
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:21,799
and shake it off.

82
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,667
Who's Taylor Swift?

83
00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:29,607
Oh, my God!

84
00:03:29,608 --> 00:03:32,277
Am I about to introduce
you to Taylor Swift?

85
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,112
W-What is she, a singer?

86
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:36,314
She's much more than a singer, Chris.

87
00:03:36,315 --> 00:03:38,917
She's... she's... she's the queen!

88
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:39,951
A goddess!

89
00:03:39,952 --> 00:03:42,453
A gazelle in a high-waisted swimsuit!

90
00:03:42,454 --> 00:03:44,722
Uh, sorry, if you're neither insane,

91
00:03:44,723 --> 00:03:47,659
nor clowns, nor a posse,
I'm not interested.

92
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,927
I have an idea.

93
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:51,629
You should ask Taylor Swift
to the homecoming dance!

94
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,299
What? Why would she go
to a dance with me?

95
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,068
I'm telling you, this is exactly
the kind of thing she would do.

96
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:58,836
She's such a sweetheart.

97
00:03:58,837 --> 00:04:00,638
Oh, I'm going limp.

98
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,441
I'm just gonna lie here moaning,

99
00:04:03,442 --> 00:04:05,143
thinking about Taylor Swift.

100
00:04:08,013 --> 00:04:09,180
Tay-Tay.

101
00:04:09,181 --> 00:04:10,748
How would I even ask her?

102
00:04:10,749 --> 00:04:13,084
Oh, it's easy. You and I
will just make a video

103
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:15,253
about how sad you are and put it online.

104
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:17,522
She's very interactive
with all her fans.

105
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,051
I guess it's worth a shot.

106
00:04:19,052 --> 00:04:20,058
Of course it is.

107
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,327
If she says yes, you'll
surprise everyone,

108
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:24,162
just like you did on New Year's Eve.

109
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:26,698
Three, two, one!

110
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,299
Some animals give me boners!

111
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:39,177
Hi. Uh, I'd like to be an Uber driver.

112
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:41,613
Okay, sure. Welcome aboard.

113
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,449
Don't I... don't I need
to fill out a form or...?

114
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,426
Oh, right, yeah, of course.

115
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,620
"Name."

116
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,088
Peter Griffin.

117
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,689
"Criminal history."

118
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,125
This section is optional.
I will skip this.

119
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:55,426
And done.

120
00:04:55,427 --> 00:04:57,462
Here you go. Yeah, none
of this really matters.

121
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,597
All I need to know is:
do you have a car,

122
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:01,065
a phone and a face?

123
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:02,133
It's my dog's car.

124
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:03,601
Oh, and I know you didn't ask,

125
00:05:03,602 --> 00:05:05,934
- but I am quick to anger.
- Okay, great.

126
00:05:05,935 --> 00:05:08,706
Now get out there and try to
kiss as many ladies as you can.

127
00:05:08,707 --> 00:05:10,408
The record is 60 in a month.

128
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:12,976
You, sir, are officially an Uber driver.

129
00:05:59,032 --> 00:06:00,291
This is some good stuff, Chris.

130
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:01,859
I think it's ready to post.

131
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,095
Actually, Stewie, I changed my mind.

132
00:06:04,096 --> 00:06:06,164
I made my own video and posted it.

133
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:07,732
What? How could you do that?

134
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:10,268
Stewie, I didn't want to
do all that fancy stuff,

135
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:13,371
so I just did a video of me
speaking from the heart.

136
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:15,373
You know, telling her
how much it would mean

137
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:18,743
if a girl like her went to
homecoming with a guy like me.

138
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:21,546
I couldn't even stay awake
during that description.

139
00:06:23,315 --> 00:06:25,516
Hey, she already posted a response.

140
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:27,218
What?!

141
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:29,020
Hey, Chris Griffin.

142
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:30,221
I just saw your video,

143
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:32,256
and I'd love to go to
your dance with you.

144
00:06:32,257 --> 00:06:34,292
All right, I got to go
eat an ice cream cone.

145
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:36,828
'Cause us stars are just like you.

146
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:37,829
Oh, my God!

147
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:43,267
Uh-oh. This means I have an
awkward phone call to make.

148
00:06:43,268 --> 00:06:45,203
What? No, no, it was stupid.

149
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:47,146
What, two guys going to homecoming?

150
00:06:47,147 --> 00:06:49,340
I-I assumed it was a
goof this whole time.

151
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:50,475
Take it out.

152
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,459
I'm ugly and unlovable.

153
00:06:58,903 --> 00:07:00,437
Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker.

154
00:07:00,438 --> 00:07:01,805
Our top story tonight,

155
00:07:01,806 --> 00:07:04,240
pop star Taylor Swift
is coming to Quahog

156
00:07:04,241 --> 00:07:07,277
to attend a dance with local
high-schooler Chris Griffin.

157
00:07:07,278 --> 00:07:10,213
But first we go to commercial
while our sports reporter smiles

158
00:07:10,214 --> 00:07:12,315
and spins a football for some reason.

159
00:07:17,455 --> 00:07:19,589
Wow, Chris, I'm so excited!

160
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,025
You actually have a
date with Taylor Swift!

161
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:24,194
Thanks, Mom. Did I do good?

162
00:07:24,195 --> 00:07:25,829
Can I wear Grandpa's jacket now?

163
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,797
I-I don't know why you
always ask for that.

164
00:07:27,798 --> 00:07:29,966
Th-That's not a thing in our family.

165
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:31,835
Oh, Rupert, I can't believe Taylor Swift

166
00:07:31,836 --> 00:07:33,837
is actually going to be in our house.

167
00:07:33,838 --> 00:07:35,071
I haven't been this excited

168
00:07:35,072 --> 00:07:36,706
since I abused those caffeine pills

169
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:38,541
to get ready for the big show.

170
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:41,211
Everything will be fine, as
long as I take one of these.

171
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:43,880
Pills? You actually <i>are</i> taking drugs?

172
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:45,014
Stewie, give me those.

173
00:07:45,015 --> 00:07:46,716
I can't, Zach! I need them to sing!

174
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:51,688
♪ I'm so excited, I'm so excited ♪

175
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:55,425
I'm... so... scared!

176
00:07:59,597 --> 00:08:02,698
Screech is going to stab
someone on Christmas.

177
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:10,240
Oh, Chris, you look so
handsome in your tux.

178
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:13,176
This must be how Meat Loaf
looked when he went to the prom.

179
00:08:13,177 --> 00:08:15,111
Oh, that must be her!

180
00:08:20,651 --> 00:08:23,052
Hi. You must be Chris. I'm Taylor.

181
00:08:23,053 --> 00:08:24,320
What's up?!

182
00:08:25,489 --> 00:08:27,390
It's so nice to finally meet you.

183
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,958
Your video was so sweet.

184
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,194
And I can't wait to go
to the dance tonight.

185
00:08:31,195 --> 00:08:32,662
Me, too.

186
00:08:32,663 --> 00:08:34,864
Would you like to come in?

187
00:08:34,865 --> 00:08:36,566
Hi. Peter Griffin, leering dad.

188
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:38,301
Quick question: in "Shake It Off,"

189
00:08:38,302 --> 00:08:42,372
you invite us to get down to,
quote, "this sick beat."

190
00:08:42,373 --> 00:08:44,841
Yet the beat you then
provide is rather mild.

191
00:08:44,842 --> 00:08:47,544
My question is this:
may I lick your legs?

192
00:08:47,545 --> 00:08:49,846
Hi, Taylor. Stewie Griffin.
I'm your biggest fan.

193
00:08:49,847 --> 00:08:52,015
I don't mean that like
a psycho, I just...

194
00:08:52,016 --> 00:08:53,516
I-I'm not, I'm not a psycho!

195
00:08:53,517 --> 00:08:55,218
Oh, you're a cutie.

196
00:08:55,219 --> 00:08:57,353
Okay, so let's talk about Harry Styles.

197
00:08:57,354 --> 00:08:59,022
Now, you don't have to say anything.

198
00:08:59,023 --> 00:09:01,424
I'm just gonna slowly pull
out this tape measure,

199
00:09:01,425 --> 00:09:03,460
and you indicate when I should stop.

200
00:09:03,461 --> 00:09:05,328
Okay, here I go.

201
00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:06,428
Still going.

202
00:09:07,431 --> 00:09:08,998
Still going.

203
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:11,601
Oh, my God, you bitch! Seriously?

204
00:09:11,602 --> 00:09:15,205
Taylor, this is my sister
Meg and our dog Brian.

205
00:09:15,206 --> 00:09:16,606
Nice to meet you both.

206
00:09:16,607 --> 00:09:18,107
We're not all so impressed.

207
00:09:18,108 --> 00:09:19,909
I've met Dan Aykroyd.

208
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:23,346
I'm sorry, uh, which cast
member of<i> Hee Haw</i> are you?

209
00:09:23,347 --> 00:09:25,582
Will... you... be... nice!

210
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,917
Okay, well, we should probably go.

211
00:09:27,918 --> 00:09:31,721
It was so nice to meet you all,
except for the girl and the dog.

212
00:09:31,722 --> 00:09:34,257
Sorry about my family.

213
00:09:34,258 --> 00:09:36,326
Don't apologize. They seem nice.

214
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:39,528
Well, you wouldn't say that if
you ever saw us at the movies.

215
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:44,067
All right, we got our popcorn from home,

216
00:09:44,068 --> 00:09:46,302
our soda from home, our snacks from home

217
00:09:46,303 --> 00:09:47,637
and<i> Braveheart.</i>

218
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,277
- Where you headed?
- The airport.

219
00:09:54,278 --> 00:09:56,645
Great. Just a couple of errands
and we'll get you there.

220
00:10:10,794 --> 00:10:13,096
That was one bitch of a class.

221
00:10:13,097 --> 00:10:14,497
Anyways, what time's your flight?

222
00:10:14,498 --> 00:10:15,665
It's in 20 minutes!

223
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,600
Oh, boy, I can't make it in 20 minutes.

224
00:10:17,601 --> 00:10:19,035
I better call you a Lyft.

225
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:21,671
Come on, hurry up, get in!

226
00:10:21,672 --> 00:10:24,140
I hope you like The Offspring.

227
00:10:24,141 --> 00:10:26,709
Let's go!

228
00:10:35,853 --> 00:10:37,854
Oh, my God! Taylor Swift!

229
00:10:37,855 --> 00:10:39,489
She's here with<i> him?</i>

230
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,790
You guys, Mr. Buell's taking

231
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,059
a door-open dook in the bathroom!

232
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,428
I hope this isn't too boring for you.

233
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:47,664
No, this is so cool!

234
00:10:47,665 --> 00:10:49,098
I always sing about high school,

235
00:10:49,099 --> 00:10:51,067
but I've never actually
seen one in person.

236
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:53,870
Would you like to dance?

237
00:10:53,871 --> 00:10:55,905
Sure. But you're gonna
have to stand back,

238
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:58,541
like, five and a half feet.

239
00:10:58,542 --> 00:10:59,676
Cool!

240
00:10:59,677 --> 00:11:03,513
You dance like an unattended fire hose.

241
00:11:03,514 --> 00:11:06,082
Wow! It's like your dance
tells a whole story.

242
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,483
Right?

243
00:11:07,484 --> 00:11:09,619
You are the only one
who's ever gotten that.

244
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,688
Usually people just shove
a wallet in my mouth

245
00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:13,356
and call 911.

246
00:11:13,357 --> 00:11:15,425
You know, Chris, I'm
having a great time.

247
00:11:15,426 --> 00:11:17,660
You're so cool and down-to-earth.

248
00:11:17,661 --> 00:11:19,195
I like you, too, Taylor.

249
00:11:19,196 --> 00:11:20,930
I was scared meeting a celebrity,

250
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:22,665
but you're so nice and normal.

251
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:25,368
I feel totally comfortable around you.

252
00:11:25,369 --> 00:11:27,727
Well, why don't you
just kiss her, Griffin?

253
00:11:28,205 --> 00:11:31,358
Sorry, I just smoked a joint
with the pickup truck kids.

254
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:39,331
That was really fun, Chris.

255
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:40,850
I hope you don't mind I made the band

256
00:11:40,851 --> 00:11:42,952
pay me a royalty for each
of my songs they played.

257
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:43,953
Of course not.

258
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:45,154
And I hope you didn't mind

259
00:11:45,155 --> 00:11:46,956
I showed you who every
locker belongs to.

260
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:49,292
No, I thought that was nice.

261
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:50,727
I've never had a locker.

262
00:11:50,728 --> 00:11:54,030
I just keep my stuff in stupid mansions.

263
00:11:54,031 --> 00:11:55,498
Can I finger you?

264
00:11:55,499 --> 00:11:56,633
Sure!

265
00:11:56,634 --> 00:11:58,334
Hi. I'm Taylor Swift.

266
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,670
I'm famous, but I'm really nice.

267
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:04,374
Aw, that's one of the best
fingerings I've ever had.

268
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:26,629
What are you working on there, Chris?

269
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,531
Oh, I'm making a collage for Taylor

270
00:12:28,532 --> 00:12:30,600
of some of her favorite things.

271
00:12:30,601 --> 00:12:32,769
Here's flowers and crop tops

272
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:35,605
and pictures of Kanye
West with his mouth shut.

273
00:12:35,606 --> 00:12:38,753
Wow, you two seem to have
a wonderful connection.

274
00:12:38,754 --> 00:12:39,956
We do, Mom.

275
00:12:39,957 --> 00:12:42,879
You know, she's the first girl
to ever really understand me.

276
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,247
Uh, you guys?

277
00:12:44,248 --> 00:12:46,949
You might want to see this video
Bonnie posted on Facebook.

278
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,052
Why are you on Bonnie's Facebook page?

279
00:12:49,053 --> 00:12:52,121

What the hell?

290
00:13:30,027 --> 00:13:31,427
Why would she do this?

291
00:13:31,428 --> 00:13:33,229
Wait, wait, wait.
What's that next video?

292
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:36,232
Oh, Daughtry!

293
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:38,567
I'm a mom, so I love this.

294
00:13:45,856 --> 00:13:47,256
Chris, what happened?

295
00:13:47,257 --> 00:13:49,325
I-I thought you said Taylor had
a good time the other night.

296
00:13:49,326 --> 00:13:50,459
We did!

297
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,428
She even let me grab
the part of her body

298
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:54,230
which on others would be a butt.

299
00:13:54,231 --> 00:13:55,764
Wow, look at these comments.

300
00:13:55,765 --> 00:13:57,132
Everyone hates you, Chris.

301
00:13:57,133 --> 00:13:58,199
She's right. Check it out.

302
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,667
You're already a meme.

303
00:14:02,705 --> 00:14:04,939
Aw, man, Chris, this
computer is telling me

304
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,374
that you done Swifted up.

305
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,866
Why would she do something like this?

306
00:14:08,867 --> 00:14:11,015
Because this is what Taylor Swift does.

307
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,414
She gets into relationship with guys,

308
00:14:12,415 --> 00:14:15,116
sabotages them, and then
writes angry songs about it.

309
00:14:15,117 --> 00:14:16,885
I just wish I could talk to her.

310
00:14:16,886 --> 00:14:19,220
Well, why can't we? She has
a house in Rhode Island.

311
00:14:19,221 --> 00:14:20,221
We could go today.

312
00:14:20,222 --> 00:14:21,856
Oh, my God, we can go today!

313
00:14:21,857 --> 00:14:23,391
My schedule is wide-ass open!

314
00:14:23,392 --> 00:14:25,060
Well, we can't just show up there.

315
00:14:25,061 --> 00:14:27,062
Why not? We've done
crazier things before.

316
00:14:27,063 --> 00:14:29,431
Remember when we sent that tweet?

317
00:14:29,432 --> 00:14:30,731
All right, you ready?

318
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,370
Freeze!

319
00:14:35,371 --> 00:14:36,805
We're the Internet police!

320
00:14:36,806 --> 00:14:39,874
You guys are going away for a long time.

321
00:14:40,491 --> 00:14:42,169
Hey, what are you in for?

322
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,846
I said Caitlyn Jenner
wasn't brave and beautiful.

323
00:14:44,847 --> 00:14:47,915
Brian, there's some bad people in here.

324
00:14:50,753 --> 00:14:53,362
Hey, what's up? I'm just
going to Quahog Stadium.

325
00:14:53,363 --> 00:14:55,853
Okay, would you like the
AC on or the windows down?

326
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:56,991
How about both?

327
00:15:00,396 --> 00:15:01,896
Pretty great, right?

328
00:15:01,897 --> 00:15:04,231
It is! It really is!

329
00:15:07,776 --> 00:15:09,554
Thank you, genius person!

330
00:15:09,555 --> 00:15:10,437
No problem.

331
00:15:10,438 --> 00:15:13,608
Hey, you ever go in a hot tub
when it's snowing outside?

332
00:15:13,609 --> 00:15:15,809
Oh... What?!

333
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,818
Ms. Swift, your
songwriting team is here.

334
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:26,087
We got a socko tune for you, Taylor.

335
00:15:26,088 --> 00:15:27,188
Hit it, Morty!

336
00:15:28,557 --> 00:15:31,192
♪ Lox and bagels and bagels and lox ♪

337
00:15:31,193 --> 00:15:33,995
♪ I like being a girl. ♪

338
00:15:34,492 --> 00:15:35,693
Okay, one thought.

339
00:15:35,694 --> 00:15:37,565
What if we change "lox" to "boys"

340
00:15:37,566 --> 00:15:39,534
and "bagels" to "problems"?

341
00:15:39,535 --> 00:15:40,802
Oh, that's perfect.

342
00:15:40,803 --> 00:15:42,806
Like when you changed "pickle it good"

343
00:15:42,807 --> 00:15:43,805
to "shake it off."

344
00:15:43,806 --> 00:15:45,940
All right, we got our homework.

345
00:15:46,334 --> 00:15:47,435
Hi, Taylor.

346
00:15:47,436 --> 00:15:49,750
Chris? What are you guys doing here?

347
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:51,049
I wanted to talk to you.

348
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,258
Your house is way nicer
than Anne Murray's.

349
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:54,315
We broke in there, too.

350
00:15:54,316 --> 00:15:56,584
Taylor, why'd you write
that song about me?

351
00:15:56,585 --> 00:15:58,887
I thought we had a real connection.

352
00:15:58,888 --> 00:16:01,442
We do. I really like you, Chris.

353
00:16:01,443 --> 00:16:02,725
I just...

354
00:16:02,726 --> 00:16:04,823
I'm sorry. I always do this.

355
00:16:04,824 --> 00:16:07,493
I ruin relationships with
nice guys and John Mayer

356
00:16:07,494 --> 00:16:10,362
just so I can write songs about
heartbreak and moving on.

357
00:16:10,363 --> 00:16:12,464
But don't you think that's unhealthy?

358
00:16:12,465 --> 00:16:14,333
You're never gonna find
a real relationship

359
00:16:14,334 --> 00:16:15,734
if you keep doing this.

360
00:16:15,735 --> 00:16:17,970
Listen, I'm sorry I hurt
your feelings, Chris.

361
00:16:17,971 --> 00:16:19,571
Let me make it up to you.

362
00:16:19,572 --> 00:16:22,307
Why don't you guys all come to
my show tonight as my guests?

363
00:16:22,308 --> 00:16:23,308
Are you serious?!

364
00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:25,110
Backstage with Taylor Swift?

365
00:16:25,111 --> 00:16:27,679
Well, that'll be even cooler
than when I was in that remake

366
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,249
of<i> The Princess Bride</i> with Bill Cosby.

367
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,253
Now, one of these has the
iocane powder, you see,

368
00:16:34,254 --> 00:16:37,624
and one of them makes you go
sleepy-bye with your mouth open.

369
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,062
Hey, pal, where we heading again?

370
00:16:44,063 --> 00:16:46,063
Just go down this dark alley.

371
00:16:53,273 --> 00:16:54,406
What the hell's going on?

372
00:16:54,407 --> 00:16:57,176
This is what we do to Uber
drivers in this town.

373
00:17:01,047 --> 00:17:02,915
Stop! Stop! Please stop!

374
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,951
The sound of your leather
jackets is excruciating!

375
00:17:05,952 --> 00:17:09,054
You can't just buy a phone
and become a cab driver!

376
00:17:09,055 --> 00:17:11,690
Please, I have two families!

377
00:17:16,696 --> 00:17:17,696
Stay back!

378
00:17:17,697 --> 00:17:19,264
Where-where did you get that?

379
00:17:19,265 --> 00:17:21,300
Judd Hirsch himself.

380
00:17:21,301 --> 00:17:23,735
I was a boy, no more than 11 or 12.

381
00:17:23,736 --> 00:17:25,370
Was on the side of the road.

382
00:17:25,371 --> 00:17:27,105
Man with a hat pulled up next to me.

383
00:17:27,106 --> 00:17:29,541
Said I reminded him of
him when he was my age.

384
00:17:29,542 --> 00:17:31,143
I was just a boy husking corn.

385
00:17:31,144 --> 00:17:32,511
Didn't know what it meant.

386
00:17:32,512 --> 00:17:34,446
Of course, we were all
husking corn back then

387
00:17:34,447 --> 00:17:36,148
just to keep the lights on.

388
00:17:36,149 --> 00:17:38,016
And you burned my car

389
00:17:38,017 --> 00:17:40,953
while I was telling my
fake Judd Hirsch story.

390
00:17:52,765 --> 00:17:55,767
God, I hate everybody
who's not backstage.

391
00:17:55,768 --> 00:17:57,836
This next song is a new one.

392
00:17:57,837 --> 00:18:00,172
It's about my boyfriend Chris.

393
00:18:05,278 --> 00:18:08,247
♪ I'm pretty and I'm
rich and I'm in love ♪

394
00:18:08,248 --> 00:18:09,781

I've been dreaming of ♪

397
00:18:15,688 --> 00:18:17,421
Wow, they hate it.

398
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,158
This stinks!

399
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:22,094
We like you when you're miserable!

400
00:18:22,095 --> 00:18:25,797
You guys, Mr. Buell's taking a
door-open dook in the bathroom!

401
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:28,467
Why were they being so mean to you?

402
00:18:28,468 --> 00:18:30,502
Well, I guess they're
just used to me being sad

403
00:18:30,503 --> 00:18:31,670
and hurt by men.

404
00:18:31,671 --> 00:18:33,739
But I don't care if they like it, Chris.

405
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,307
I'm happy with you.

406
00:18:35,308 --> 00:18:36,975
I'm happy with you, too.

407
00:18:36,976 --> 00:18:39,144
But it doesn't seem like
your fans like this

408
00:18:39,145 --> 00:18:40,746
new happy Taylor.

409
00:18:40,747 --> 00:18:42,481
Are you willing to risk losing them

410
00:18:42,482 --> 00:18:46,385
and jeopardize your career
and your art just for us?

411
00:18:46,386 --> 00:18:48,720
I think I am.

412
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,760
Oh, well, I don't know if am.

413
00:18:54,761 --> 00:18:57,229
What? What are you saying?

414
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,065
I'm saying that

415
00:19:00,066 --> 00:19:03,302
Taylor Swift, you are a
spoiled ostrich-legged,

416
00:19:03,303 --> 00:19:05,804
no talent, big-footed freak.

417
00:19:05,805 --> 00:19:07,506
You pretend to relate to your fans,

418
00:19:07,507 --> 00:19:09,908
but you make your bodyguards
carry your purse.

419
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:11,910
All your songs sound the same.

420
00:19:11,911 --> 00:19:14,745
And your cats aren't that cute.

421
00:19:19,252 --> 00:19:21,252
Thank you, Chris.

422
00:19:24,624 --> 00:19:27,626
This next song is about
my dumb ex-boyfriend,

423
00:19:27,627 --> 00:19:29,961
who either mistreated me, cheated on me

424
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:33,231
or went to massage parlors
when I was out of town.

425
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,640
Wow, Chris, that was really nice of you.

426
00:19:41,641 --> 00:19:43,241
Yeah, I guess.

427
00:19:43,242 --> 00:19:45,310
Don't worry, there'll be
plenty of girls for you.

428
00:19:45,311 --> 00:19:47,646
No one will ever be close
to as good as her,

429
00:19:47,647 --> 00:19:48,914
but we'll find you someone.

430
00:19:48,915 --> 00:19:50,782
What about, like, a motorcycle lady?

431
00:19:50,783 --> 00:19:52,117
You know, like an old gal?

432
00:19:52,118 --> 00:19:54,152
Her grandchildren call
her by her first name?

433
00:19:54,153 --> 00:19:56,142
Let's get out of here.
I called us an Uber.

434
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:01,063
How many tooths
is not enough tooths?

435
00:20:05,665 --> 00:20:08,300
Well, kids, your father
may have gotten beat up,

436
00:20:08,301 --> 00:20:09,935
but Uber's still a great job

437
00:20:09,936 --> 00:20:11,670
for anyone afraid to sell their blood.

438
00:20:11,671 --> 00:20:13,505
And, Chris, I'm sorry it didn't work out

439
00:20:13,506 --> 00:20:14,940
with you and Taylor Swift.

440
00:20:14,941 --> 00:20:16,641
I think we're all sorry
about that, Brian,

441
00:20:16,642 --> 00:20:18,910
but I'm afraid we are out of time.

442
00:20:18,911 --> 00:20:21,279
I would like to thank our
guests Taylor Swift,

443
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,281
Chris Griffin, Stewie and Brian,

444
00:20:23,282 --> 00:20:26,218
Cleveland Brown and his
band of Brown Renown.

445
00:20:26,219 --> 00:20:28,787
Hey, we'll see you down in
Brown Town, huh, Cleveland?

446
00:20:28,788 --> 00:20:31,123
Oh, I ain't even gonna go there, Peter.

447
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,192
We apologize to the greased-up deaf guy.

448
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:35,427
Didn't have time for him tonight,

449
00:20:35,428 --> 00:20:37,229
but let's see if we can
get him back next week

450
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,965
when Amanda Peet will be here
with stand-up Dom Irrera.

451
00:20:39,966 --> 00:20:41,333
Good night, everybody.

452
00:20:42,836 --> 00:20:47,927
