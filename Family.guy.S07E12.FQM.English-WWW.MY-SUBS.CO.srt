1
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:40,004
Hey Quagmire.

2
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:42,801
Peter, I want you
and the guys to come
over to my house right now.

3
00:00:42,802 --> 00:00:43,987
We're drinking. What for?

4
00:00:43,988 --> 00:00:45,731
Just come over.
I want you to see something.

5
00:00:45,773 --> 00:00:46,848
Alright.

6
00:00:46,849 --> 00:00:48,648
C'mon guys, we're going to Quagmire's.

7
00:00:48,664 --> 00:00:51,156
Alright, hang on. I gotta
go to the bathroom first.

8
00:00:52,656 --> 00:00:53,756
OK, let's go.

9
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:57,020
Oh, finally!

10
00:00:57,021 --> 00:00:58,720
C'mon, c'mon. C'mon inside.

11
00:00:59,361 --> 00:01:01,605
Well, what is it?
What's the big damn deal?

12
00:01:01,688 --> 00:01:02,788
Look.

13
00:01:04,529 --> 00:01:05,596
It's a cat.

14
00:01:05,597 --> 00:01:06,991
Yeah, I just got him today.

15
00:01:06,992 --> 00:01:08,148
His name's James.

16
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:09,822
Isn't he just the cutest
thing you've ever seen?

17
00:01:10,023 --> 00:01:11,823
Hi, James.

18
00:01:12,174 --> 00:01:14,316
Oh my God!

19
00:01:14,317 --> 00:01:17,257
Watch when I scratch his
bottom. He sticks his fanny in the air.

20
00:01:18,143 --> 00:01:21,358
Oh, oh. We have
lift off. We have lift off.

21
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,127
Oh, come here, James.

22
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,709
What the hell we doin'.

23
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,553
Quagmire, since when do you like cats?

24
00:01:28,601 --> 00:01:31,343
Since I found this little
guy living under my house.

25
00:01:31,363 --> 00:01:32,801
I'll tell you this ...

26
00:01:32,802 --> 00:01:36,407
I understand now why the
pharoahs worshipped these animals.

27
00:01:36,588 --> 00:01:39,032
Oh look, Joe. He's making friends.

28
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:41,158
Oh, sorry.

29
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,226
Y'know ... y'know what?
It's alright, Quagmire

30
00:01:43,227 --> 00:01:45,196
That leg is mostly pus.

31
00:01:51,556 --> 00:01:52,000
Oh, OK.

32
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:52,719
Here it comes, James.

33
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,147
Here comes the part
I was telling you about.

34
00:01:55,769 --> 00:01:58,630
Aaaaah! You're one of those.

35
00:02:02,224 --> 00:02:04,172
I hate Quagmire lately.

36
00:02:04,173 --> 00:02:04,905
Me too.

37
00:02:04,906 --> 00:02:07,198
That cat has totally
changed his personality.

38
00:02:07,205 --> 00:02:10,009
Yeah, like when I went
over to his house the other day.

39
00:02:11,957 --> 00:02:12,913
Who is it?

40
00:02:12,914 --> 00:02:16,146
It's me, Quagmire. I need
to borrow your lawnmower.

41
00:02:16,147 --> 00:02:18,482
Oh, Quagmire's not
here It's just me, James.

42
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,083
I'm supposed to watch the house.

43
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:23,085
C'mon, Quagmire. It's 97Â° out here.

44
00:02:23,086 --> 00:02:24,365
We're 2 grown men.

45
00:02:24,366 --> 00:02:27,024
Are you selling yarn? 'Cos I love yarn.

46
00:02:27,025 --> 00:02:29,082
No, I need to borrow your lawnmower.

47
00:02:29,258 --> 00:02:31,843
Oh, I don't think
Quagmire wants me to do that.

48
00:02:31,844 --> 00:02:32,959
Oh, come on!

49
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,736
I don't think Quagmire appreciated
the condition you returned it in last time.

50
00:02:36,737 --> 00:02:37,613
Glenn, can I just ...

51
00:02:37,614 --> 00:02:38,714
No, you can't have it.

52
00:02:39,383 --> 00:02:41,143
Hey guys, it's James' birthday tomorrow.

53
00:02:41,144 --> 00:02:42,644
Would you all sign his card?

54
00:02:42,809 --> 00:02:44,926
You want us to sign a card for your cat?

55
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:47,022
Yeah. Don't just put your
name, write something clever.

56
00:02:47,426 --> 00:02:49,585
God, I hate having to come
up with something on the spot.

57
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,584
Ummm.

58
00:02:50,785 --> 00:02:52,378
Have a 'mice' day.

59
00:02:53,022 --> 00:02:54,522
Best fishes.

60
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,349
Peter.

61
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,427
Thanks ...... that's great.

62
00:02:57,622 --> 00:02:58,693
Well, I gotta get going.

63
00:02:58,694 --> 00:03:01,319
I'm heading off to Vermont
to get James' birthday present.

64
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,470
There's this neat little store called "Cattitudes"

65
00:03:03,471 --> 00:03:05,254
that makes all this neat cat stuff.

66
00:03:05,255 --> 00:03:06,755
See you guys later.

67
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,311
What a queer.

68
00:03:08,612 --> 00:03:11,943
He's goin' all the way to
Vermont for cat gifts and what-not?

69
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,317
You can get a scratcing post down at Wal Mart for $2.00

70
00:03:15,618 --> 00:03:18,020
A pair of Lee jeans for $9.00

71
00:03:18,021 --> 00:03:21,743
Y'know they got seats for children
now? You put 'em right in your car.

72
00:03:21,895 --> 00:03:23,610
Supposed to make 'em safer.

73
00:03:23,755 --> 00:03:26,446
Only problem is, you can't lean
your seat all the way back ... oh.

74
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:33,003
We gotta do somethin' about this.

75
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,363
His whole life is about that stupid cat.

76
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:38,113
Hey, y'know the cat's
alone at Quagmire's right now.

77
00:03:38,114 --> 00:03:39,181
Y'know what we should do?

78
00:03:39,182 --> 00:03:41,286
We should go over there and shave it.

79
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:42,687
That's a great idea!

80
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,471
Let's do it!

81
00:03:43,472 --> 00:03:44,883
Let's shave the cat!

82
00:03:44,884 --> 00:03:46,677
Oh boy, I usually only get this excited

83
00:03:46,678 --> 00:03:49,095
when they say the title
of the movie in the movie.

84
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,486
I'm telling you
these drug dealers represent

85
00:03:51,487 --> 00:03:54,206
a Clear and Present
Danger to the United States.

86
00:03:54,298 --> 00:03:56,290
Eh? Eh? He said it. He said it.

87
00:03:56,491 --> 00:04:00,254
All I'm sayin' is what
if this As Good As It Gets?

88
00:04:00,334 --> 00:04:02,634
Eh? Eh? There it is! There it is!

89
00:04:02,641 --> 00:04:06,429
The only way for me to solve
this crisis is to be Superman IV.

90
00:04:06,465 --> 00:04:07,706
The Quest for Peace.

91
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:09,481
So that's why they call it that.

92
00:04:17,804 --> 00:04:19,908
Alright, the cat's gotta be in here.

93
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:22,752
Hey, lets take a man-
sized poop in his cat box

94
00:04:22,753 --> 00:04:24,658
so he thinks there's
something really wrong with him.

95
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:25,259
There it is!

96
00:04:27,044 --> 00:04:28,716
Rock and roll!

97
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:30,249
Yeah! Shaving time!

98
00:04:30,313 --> 00:04:31,813
Alright, hand me the razor.

99
00:04:35,874 --> 00:04:37,005
Oh, my God!

100
00:04:37,006 --> 00:04:38,128
Peter, you killed it!

101
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:39,419
Will you guys relax.

102
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,876
He's got 8 more lives.

103
00:04:41,277 --> 00:04:42,620
OK, 7 more lives.

104
00:04:42,821 --> 00:04:44,121
6.

105
00:04:44,148 --> 00:04:45,389
5.

106
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,111
4.

107
00:04:46,512 --> 00:04:47,012
3.

108
00:04:47,112 --> 00:04:48,803
Peter, stop doin' what you're doin.

109
00:04:48,804 --> 00:04:49,928
What'll we do?

110
00:04:49,929 --> 00:04:51,075
Altight, alright. I have an idea.

111
00:04:51,076 --> 00:04:54,199
How 'bout we hide the cat's
body and leave that window open

112
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,287
and that way, it'll
seem like the cat ran away.

113
00:04:56,288 --> 00:04:57,788
We'll never get away with that.

114
00:04:57,827 --> 00:04:59,427
Oh, we just might.

115
00:04:59,428 --> 00:05:02,678
You see, I've got a lucky cat's foot.

116
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:08,361
Y'know, Peter, it's
sorta adding insult to injury

117
00:05:08,362 --> 00:05:11,500
raiding Quagmire's fridge
for beer after you killed his cat.

118
00:05:11,571 --> 00:05:13,333
Or is it?

119
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,741
Is my response.

120
00:05:17,422 --> 00:05:18,922
Ah, crap!

121
00:05:18,956 --> 00:05:20,343
God, I hate cops.

122
00:05:20,344 --> 00:05:23,419
Almost as much as I hated
my overly sensitive car alarm.

123
00:05:39,628 --> 00:05:41,060
Son of a bitch!

124
00:05:41,851 --> 00:05:43,057
Whatta we got, partner?

125
00:05:43,058 --> 00:05:44,443
Empty alcohol containers.

126
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,519
The driver's inebriated
and covered in blood.

127
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,189
He's got scratches
on his face and arms.

128
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,330
There's a blood soaked
corpse in the back seat.

129
00:05:50,331 --> 00:05:53,034
He's got shovels in there,
and a hand drawn map titled

130
00:05:53,035 --> 00:05:54,843
"This is where we'll hide the body."

131
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,238
Well, that all seems fine.

132
00:05:56,239 --> 00:05:57,339
Sorry to bother you. sir.

133
00:06:00,851 --> 00:06:02,498
Pot! Small amount of pot!

134
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,246
You're under arrest, dirtbag!

135
00:06:04,247 --> 00:06:05,205
Oh, come on!

136
00:06:05,206 --> 00:06:07,736
I don't appreciate
drug addicts in my town!

137
00:06:07,753 --> 00:06:09,373
I'm a family guy.

138
00:06:09,474 --> 00:06:11,427
Eh? Eh? He said it.

139
00:06:15,755 --> 00:06:18,393
Alright, Brian, your
family's here to bail you out.

140
00:06:18,848 --> 00:06:19,662
Brian, if you don't mind,

141
00:06:19,663 --> 00:06:22,192
we'll start thinkin' up our
prison rape jokes immediately.

142
00:06:22,193 --> 00:06:23,361
I'll break the ice.

143
00:06:23,362 --> 00:06:26,647
Hey, Brian, did you do
'Hard Time' or 'Hardly Working?'

144
00:06:28,148 --> 00:06:29,348
Penis.

145
00:06:29,825 --> 00:06:31,243
Alright, well all the pieces are there.

146
00:06:31,244 --> 00:06:32,474
Somebody make somethin' outta that.

147
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,977
Hey, Brian, who's your
favorite baseball player?

148
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,549
Albert Pujols?

149
00:06:36,572 --> 00:06:38,559
Chris, stop it! Come on.

150
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,879
Brian, we're happy you're out of jail.

151
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,642
And when we get to the car
would you like a donut to sit on?

152
00:06:43,895 --> 00:06:49,467
Ha ha ha. Y'see, I'm part of it.
I'm part of it like everyone else.

153
00:06:50,191 --> 00:06:53,395
I can't believe they threw me
in jail for a quarter ounce of pot.

154
00:06:53,396 --> 00:06:55,066
Well, Brian, it's your own fault.

155
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:56,951
I mean, pot is illegal for a reason.

156
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,300
Lois, don't be a hypocrite.

157
00:06:58,301 --> 00:06:59,365
You've smoked pot.

158
00:06:59,366 --> 00:07:00,446
Well sure, Brian,

159
00:07:00,447 --> 00:07:02,524
but I'm thinkin' about the children.

160
00:07:02,525 --> 00:07:04,781
Pot's illegal mainly to protect them.

161
00:07:04,782 --> 00:07:08,129
No, no. Pot is illegal
because William Randolph Hearst

162
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:11,310
ran a smear campaign
against marijuana in the 1930's

163
00:07:11,314 --> 00:07:14,021
to protect his interests
in the timber industry

164
00:07:14,022 --> 00:07:16,106
because hemp was
poised to replace wood

165
00:07:16,107 --> 00:07:19,088
as an inexpensive raw material
for the manufacture of paper.

166
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:23,529
There's your smear
campaign right there, Brian.

167
00:07:23,641 --> 00:07:24,641
Ah-ha-ha.

168
00:07:24,642 --> 00:07:25,540
Mom's right.

169
00:07:23,641 --> 00:07:26,909
Drugs are bad, Brian.

170
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,571
I mean, haven't you
seen those commercials?

171
00:08:12,844 --> 00:08:14,691
Open up, Brian, it's Joe.

172
00:08:14,757 --> 00:08:15,271
Crap!

173
00:08:15,272 --> 00:08:16,772
Uh, uh, j-just a sec.

174
00:08:20,955 --> 00:08:22,402
Brian, under your probation

175
00:08:22,403 --> 00:08:24,763
you're required to
submit to random drug tests.

176
00:08:24,896 --> 00:08:25,937
I need some urine.

177
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,231
You mean .... right now?

178
00:08:27,232 --> 00:08:28,794
Yes. Right now.

179
00:08:28,795 --> 00:08:30,713
Here's some
magazines to get you going.

180
00:08:30,872 --> 00:08:32,595
Uh, how's that gonna ... ?

181
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,733
Oh, sorry. It's been a while.

182
00:08:34,734 --> 00:08:37,482
Look, I don't really feel
comfortable doing this in front of you.

183
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:38,855
Fine, I'll wait outside.

184
00:08:38,856 --> 00:08:40,157
Here's a bottle of lotion.

185
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:41,268
Aah, Joe ...

186
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:42,769
Right. Sorry.

187
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,232
Stewie, I need your urine.

188
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:47,067
Huh ... Really?

189
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,476
Yeah. Joe's doing a drug test
and if I give him some of mine

190
00:08:49,477 --> 00:08:50,880
he's gonna know
I've been smoking pot

191
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:52,407
so I need some
of your urine so I can ...

192
00:08:53,131 --> 00:08:55,411
Uh ... you don't have
to be naked for this.

193
00:08:55,412 --> 00:09:00,231
But I don't have to NOT
be naked for it, either. Ah-ha ...

194
00:09:02,104 --> 00:09:02,915
Come on, Stewie,

195
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:03,757
hurry up and pee.

196
00:09:03,758 --> 00:09:04,798
Joe's waiting for me.

197
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:07,272
Brian, you know I
can't go unless you stare at it.

198
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,705
Brian, what the hell ... ?

199
00:09:09,706 --> 00:09:11,591
Uhh ... hey, Lois

200
00:09:11,734 --> 00:09:12,818
The jig's up, Brian.

201
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:13,719
Run!

202
00:09:14,694 --> 00:09:17,308
Brian, is this how you're
trying to pass your drug test?

203
00:09:17,313 --> 00:09:19,170
By stealing a baby's urine?

204
00:09:19,171 --> 00:09:21,188
My God, that is just sick!

205
00:09:21,189 --> 00:09:23,312
No, what's sick is
making marijuana illegal

206
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,947
when it's been proven that it
does less damage to you than alcohol.

207
00:09:25,948 --> 00:09:28,918
No, what's sick is the
plot of the movie "Baby Mama."

208
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,489
What happens when
a 40 year old woman

209
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:34,989
asks her 41 year old
friend to carry her baby?

210
00:09:35,146 --> 00:09:38,084
Push, Angie, push harder ...
Oh, it's dead.

211
00:09:38,147 --> 00:09:39,881
Brian, when you
have to go to these lengths

212
00:09:39,882 --> 00:09:41,544
just to get away with smoking pot

213
00:09:41,545 --> 00:09:43,328
it's time to make a change.

214
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:44,352
You're right, Lois.

215
00:09:44,353 --> 00:09:45,798
It is time to make a change.

216
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:46,702
Thank you.

217
00:09:46,703 --> 00:09:49,403
It's time for Quahog
to legalize marijuana!

218
00:09:49,404 --> 00:09:51,466
But that's not exactly what I meant.

219
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:53,453
Hey, check out
the size of Stewie's penis.

220
00:09:53,454 --> 00:09:54,911
Oh, come on guys,

221
00:09:54,912 --> 00:09:56,437
it's just the way God made me.

222
00:10:00,043 --> 00:10:01,324
No more oppression!

223
00:10:01,325 --> 00:10:03,639
We, as American adults with free will

224
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,374
have the right to
use marijuana if we choose to!

225
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:09,548
Enough government profiteering
under the guise of morality!

226
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:11,949
Enough with this phony war on drugs!

227
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:18,952
You know, you're going
about this all wrong, Brian.

228
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:20,264
If you want to win people over,

229
00:10:20,265 --> 00:10:22,325
you can't just drone on like Ben Stein.

230
00:10:22,326 --> 00:10:24,091
You've got to have a
little more showmanship.

231
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:25,603

As mayor of Quahog

281
00:13:26,191 --> 00:13:31,929
I hereby sign into law,
the legalization of marijuana.

282
00:13:32,501 --> 00:13:33,457
Good evening everyone.

283
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:36,610
Our top story:
"Marijuana is now legal"

284
00:13:37,064 --> 00:13:39,032
Le..le... is now legal.

285
00:13:40,102 --> 00:13:42,270
Legal in Quahog

286
00:13:42,835 --> 00:13:44,335
And it's made everything ...

287
00:13:45,056 --> 00:13:46,498
... just so great.

288
00:13:46,499 --> 00:13:48,295
OK, you ... you can
read the next one.

289
00:13:49,234 --> 00:13:50,398
No, you can.

290
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,070
No, you.

291
00:13:51,071 --> 00:13:51,978
OK, OK, OK.

292
00:13:51,979 --> 00:13:53,777
L..let..let's read it both together.

293
00:13:53,778 --> 00:13:55,060
- Ready?
- OK ... OK

295
00:13:58,787 --> 00:14:00,356
How's the weather look, Ollie?

296
00:14:00,537 --> 00:14:01,883
Not too bad.

297
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:03,066
Right on!

298
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:04,186
See Lois?

299
00:14:04,187 --> 00:14:06,354
Tell me things in
Quahog aren't better now.

300
00:14:06,368 --> 00:14:07,681
It's just weird, Brian.

301
00:14:07,682 --> 00:14:10,256
I still don't think I'm
comfortable with the whole idea.

302
00:14:10,396 --> 00:14:12,674
Look Lois, ever since
marijuana was legalized ...

303
00:14:12,675 --> 00:14:14,658
... crime has gone down,
productivity is up,

304
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:17,200
and ratings forl Dr. Who
are through the roof.

305
00:14:17,201 --> 00:14:19,046
Yeah, but Peter's so vague lately

306
00:14:19,047 --> 00:14:21,113
he can hardly set up a cut away.

307
00:14:21,245 --> 00:14:23,130
Man, this is even better than ...

308
00:14:23,726 --> 00:14:25,707
Uh, no, wait ...

309
00:14:25,722 --> 00:14:27,222
No, this is worse than ...

310
00:14:28,011 --> 00:14:29,511
Thi ... Ah, better ...

311
00:14:29,894 --> 00:14:30,383
I dunno.

312
00:14:30,384 --> 00:14:32,319
Here's a list of
celebrities I don't like:

313
00:15:07,597 --> 00:15:08,922
Hello, Griffin

314
00:15:08,923 --> 00:15:10,115
Mr Pewterschmidt?

315
00:15:10,116 --> 00:15:11,877
- Hey, how ya been?
- Not good.

316
00:15:11,939 --> 00:15:13,319
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

317
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,826
Wow, a limo, huh?

318
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,080
Hey, are these
Diet Rites just to take?

319
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:17,859
No!

320
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,360
Those are my Diet Rites!

321
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:20,536
Now listen, Griffin.

322
00:15:20,537 --> 00:15:23,046
Thanks to your dog's
stupid marijuana crusade,

323
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,029
people are using hemp for everything.

324
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,670
Fabric, fuel ... and paper.

325
00:15:27,811 --> 00:15:30,574
Which means I'm
losing billions in timber dollars.

326
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,655
I had to sell my Bangles records.

327
00:15:32,685 --> 00:15:34,862
I was still working on
memorizing all the words.

328
00:15:34,908 --> 00:15:38,625
My back is hurting
from the chair I'm sitting on.

329
00:15:38,626 --> 00:15:39,756
Where's the Tylenol?

330
00:15:39,757 --> 00:15:42,294
If I lay down flat on the floor

331
00:15:42,295 --> 00:15:44,349
It usually kinda fixes it.

332
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,271
Tony Danza

333
00:15:45,272 --> 00:15:46,471
from Who's the Boss says

334
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,587
Eh-oh ... Eh-oh ...

335
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,766
Oh-eh .. oh-eh-ohhhhh ...

336
00:15:52,239 --> 00:15:54,566
I'm losing money,
and it's your dog's fault.

337
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,862
Now, I have to get
hemp illegalized again.

338
00:15:56,863 --> 00:15:59,748
And the only way to do that
is to start a fear campaign

339
00:15:59,755 --> 00:16:01,847
designed to turn people against pot.

340
00:16:02,256 --> 00:16:03,294
Will you help me?

341
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,578
Gosh, Mr. Pewterschmidt

342
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:06,397
I .. I could never go
against Brian like that.

343
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:09,142
I'll give you this
light up butterfly yo-yo.

344
00:16:09,404 --> 00:16:11,132
- Ohhh, to keep?
- Not to keep!

345
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:13,680
You can use it today, and
one more day in the summer.

346
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,169
- Yeah!
- Pull over.

347
00:16:24,172 --> 00:16:25,072
Bye.

348
00:16:27,804 --> 00:16:28,565
Alright, Carter

349
00:16:28,566 --> 00:16:30,875
I've finished cutting
together our anti-pot video.

350
00:16:30,876 --> 00:16:32,076
Take a look.

351
00:16:32,381 --> 00:16:34,223
Hey, I got a great idea.

352
00:16:34,266 --> 00:16:36,701
Let's kill 6 million Jews.

353
00:16:36,702 --> 00:16:37,977
Hooray! Yeah!

354
00:16:37,978 --> 00:16:39,330
Yeah, I'm on board.

355
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,818
How did you come up with that?

356
00:16:40,819 --> 00:16:43,783
I got the idea ...
from ... from ... while ...

357
00:16:43,784 --> 00:16:45,358
... from while I was smoking pot.

358
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:48,693
Anyone else who likes
pot, reach for my joint.

359
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:50,143
Oh, there it is.

360
00:16:50,144 --> 00:16:51,344
Give us some of that.

361
00:16:51,365 --> 00:16:53,561
Ha  ha  ha, perhaps later.

362
00:16:53,562 --> 00:16:57,890
Now let's go to France and steal
all their objects ... de... arte ...

363
00:16:57,893 --> 00:17:00,150
Yay! Alright! Let's go to France!

364
00:17:00,151 --> 00:17:02,588
- Not bad, uh?
- Ah, damn it.

365
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:03,797
That was FOX News.

366
00:17:03,798 --> 00:17:05,995
Apparently they own
the rights to Hitler's likeness

367
00:17:05,996 --> 00:17:07,659
and they won't
have him slandered.

368
00:17:10,718 --> 00:17:11,988
Hi, I'm Peter.

369
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,335
You know me from the movie

370
00:17:13,336 --> 00:17:15,930
"Harold, Kumar and
Peter go to White Castle"

371
00:17:15,965 --> 00:17:18,709
As you can see, I'm
enjoying a White Castle burger.

372
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:19,466
Why?

373
00:17:19,467 --> 00:17:21,197
Because I don't do drugs.

374
00:17:21,198 --> 00:17:23,680
It took me 5 minutes
to get to White Castle.

375
00:17:23,681 --> 00:17:26,658
I didn't get diverted
by all those crazy hijinks.

376
00:17:26,753 --> 00:17:28,284
'Cos I don't get high.

377
00:17:30,036 --> 00:17:31,626
It was a good movie, though.

378
00:17:32,568 --> 00:17:36,208
Y'know, Neil Patrick Harris
got the job on "How I Met Your
Mother" 'cos of that movie?

379
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,423
Y'know, I've only
seen that show once

380
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,768
but I gotta tell ya,
 what's really weird to me

381
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:43,842
is why is the voice of the
guy from the future, Bob Saget?

382
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:46,862
I mean, the guy on the show
... he's already an adult.

383
00:17:46,863 --> 00:17:49,583
Y'know, so it's not like he's
gonna grow in to Bob Saget.

384
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,250
Doesn't make sense.

385
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,730
Thank you for your time.

386
00:17:53,938 --> 00:17:55,131
Well, what do you think?

387
00:17:55,332 --> 00:17:57,831
Look, daddy, I agree with
what you're trying to do,

388
00:17:57,832 --> 00:17:59,858
but I just don't
think this is gonna work.

389
00:18:00,118 --> 00:18:01,671
It's so artificial.

390
00:18:01,672 --> 00:18:03,547
You're asking for
a spanking, young lady.

391
00:18:03,548 --> 00:18:04,056
Yeah!

392
00:18:04,057 --> 00:18:05,000
All right!

393
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,174
Peter, the reason
Brian succeeded in his cause

394
00:18:07,175 --> 00:18:09,576
is that he spoke with such passion.

395
00:18:09,615 --> 00:18:10,507
No offence,

396
00:18:10,508 --> 00:18:12,772
but you two just
don't have that talent.

397
00:18:12,805 --> 00:18:13,612
Are you kiddin'?

398
00:18:13,613 --> 00:18:15,282
I can be very persuasive.

399
00:18:15,283 --> 00:18:17,650
That's how I used
to lure wayward sailors

400
00:18:17,651 --> 00:18:20,141
to their deaths with my Siren song.

401
00:18:49,437 --> 00:18:50,456
Hello, Brian.

402
00:18:50,457 --> 00:18:51,560
You're looking good.

403
00:18:51,561 --> 00:18:53,111
Nice shiny coat.

404
00:18:53,112 --> 00:18:54,387
Don't try to butter me up, Carter.

405
00:18:54,388 --> 00:18:55,386
Why did you call me here?

406
00:18:55,387 --> 00:18:56,314
Come inside.

407
00:18:56,315 --> 00:18:57,925
There's something
I want to show you.

408
00:19:02,888 --> 00:19:03,628
What's this?

409
00:19:03,629 --> 00:19:05,294
It's your novel, Brian,

410
00:19:05,295 --> 00:19:07,451
"Faster than the speed of Love"

411
00:19:07,611 --> 00:19:09,245
Ready to ship out tomorrow.

412
00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:12,422
All you have to do is
publicly come out against pot.

413
00:19:12,423 --> 00:19:13,516
Forget it, Carter

414
00:19:13,517 --> 00:19:14,940
I'm not gonna take your bribe.

415
00:19:14,941 --> 00:19:16,623
I don't care if
you printed a million copies.

416
00:19:16,624 --> 00:19:18,260
I printed TWO million.

417
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:21,247
And I even commissioned an oil
painting for your author's photo.

418
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,423
And what's this?

419
00:19:24,424 --> 00:19:26,739
Is this an Oprah Book Club sticker?

420
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,043
I think it is.

421
00:19:28,044 --> 00:19:29,315
Wait! Really?

422
00:19:29,316 --> 00:19:30,346
Oh, my God.

423
00:19:30,347 --> 00:19:32,965
Plus I can get you a
night in bed with Oprah.

424
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:35,450
- Eeerrrr ......?
- OK, just the sticker then.

425
00:19:35,451 --> 00:19:36,299
So whatta you say?

426
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,072
Is it a deal?

427
00:19:37,073 --> 00:19:38,838
You don't have to
sell out like this, Brian

428
00:19:39,862 --> 00:19:45,431
Your novel .. is good enough .. to
be published .. on it's own .. merits

429
00:19:45,432 --> 00:19:46,328
You think so?

430
00:19:46,329 --> 00:19:47,998
Yeah, you bet.

431
00:19:48,032 --> 00:19:49,285
This is your shot, Brian

432
00:19:49,286 --> 00:19:51,933
You can be a superstar author.

433
00:19:51,975 --> 00:19:55,894
All you gotta do is make an
impassioned anti-pot speech in public.

434
00:19:55,926 --> 00:19:57,016
Forget it, Carter

435
00:19:57,017 --> 00:19:59,209
Even Stewie says the
book is good enough on its own.

436
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,451
Right, Stewie?

437
00:20:00,191 --> 00:20:04,327
... Ermmm ... maybe do
a song about why pot is bad.

438
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,215
♪ And that's why pot is bad ♪

439
00:20:09,305 --> 00:20:12,511
I've heard all I need
to make an informed decision.

440
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,091
Marijuana is hereby re-illegalized.

441
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,521
In other news,

442
00:20:21,522 --> 00:20:25,964
a local Quahog author
has set a record for the
worst selling novel of all time.

443
00:20:26,064 --> 00:20:28,882
Brian Griffin's "Faster
than the speed of Love"

444
00:20:28,883 --> 00:20:31,419
 has astonishingly
not sold a single copy

445
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,055
thanks to universal
panning by literary critics.

446
00:20:34,571 --> 00:20:36,824
Coming up, children
are getting sexier ...

447
00:20:36,825 --> 00:20:38,154
and that's ...

448
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:40,114
... that's pretty cool.

449
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,163
This is so humiliating.

450
00:20:42,164 --> 00:20:44,007
I sold out everything I believed in,

451
00:20:44,008 --> 00:20:45,678
and I have nothing to show for it.

452
00:20:45,761 --> 00:20:47,227
My book's a bomb!

453
00:20:47,228 --> 00:20:48,651
Well, look at it this way ....

454
00:20:48,652 --> 00:20:50,169
you did accomplish something.

455
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,248
Marijuana's illegal because of you,

456
00:20:52,249 --> 00:20:56,156
and Stewie got
to build a nice little fort
with all of your unsold books.

457
00:20:56,417 --> 00:20:58,476
My house is made of mediocrity.

458
00:21:00,704 --> 00:21:01,410
Hey, guys.

459
00:21:01,411 --> 00:21:04,017
I want you to know I'm
raising my reward to 50 dollars

460
00:21:04,018 --> 00:21:05,922
for anyone who can
help me find James.

461
00:21:05,923 --> 00:21:07,423
No questions asked.

462
00:21:07,596 --> 00:21:09,334
I killed your cat.

463
