00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:36,775
("Around the World"
by Daft Punk playing)

13
00:00:38,846 --> 00:00:41,513
Oh, cool, somebody put
Billy Joel on the jukebox.

14
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:43,916
Billy Joel?
This is Daft Punk.

15
00:00:43,951 --> 00:00:45,784
Dappunk?
Wh-- I-- What is that?

16
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,019
That's not even words.

17
00:00:47,054 --> 00:00:48,654
What are you saying?
This is Billy Joel.

18
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:50,656
It's "Anthony's Song,"
parentheses, "Movin' Out."

19
00:00:50,691 --> 00:00:53,792
First of all, it's "Movin' Out,"
parentheses, "Anthony's Song."

20
00:00:53,828 --> 00:00:56,595
And second of all,
this is 100% not Billy Joel!

21
00:00:56,631 --> 00:00:58,464
You know, when they
recorded "Movin' Out,"

22
00:00:58,499 --> 00:01:00,332
someone left the
studio doors open,

23
00:01:00,368 --> 00:01:02,668
and that's why, at the end,
you hear that car sound.

24
00:01:02,703 --> 00:01:05,037
That's not true either!
No, this is it.

25
00:01:05,072 --> 00:01:06,972
He's talking about going
all around the world

26
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:08,774
'cause this Anthony fella,
he's moving out.

27
00:01:08,809 --> 00:01:10,476
You know, to live
with Mr. Cacciatore

28
00:01:10,511 --> 00:01:11,844
down on Mulberry Street.

29
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:14,179
And that's all I'm gonna
say about those two.

30
00:01:14,215 --> 00:01:15,948
Peter, I'm gonna punch
you with this beer mug

31
00:01:15,983 --> 00:01:17,216
till I'm holding
just the handle!

32
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:18,484
Guys, calm down.

33
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:19,985
There's one way
to solve this.

34
00:01:20,021 --> 00:01:21,353
I'll just use my phone.

35
00:01:21,389 --> 00:01:23,055
(phone beeps,
song continues playing)

36
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,190
It says "'Around the World'
by Daft Punk."

37
00:01:25,226 --> 00:01:26,458
Thank you!

38
00:01:26,494 --> 00:01:28,027
God, you idiots are exhausting.

39
00:01:28,062 --> 00:01:29,395
Hey, Cleveland, how'd you
do that with your phone?

40
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,663
I'm not an idiot.

41
00:01:30,698 --> 00:01:32,197
I used Shazam.

42
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:34,333
It recognizes songs and
tells you their names.

43
00:01:34,368 --> 00:01:36,235
Yeah? Hey, what if
I farted into it?

44
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,470
I don't know.
Be my guest.

45
00:01:38,506 --> 00:01:40,906
(farts loudly)

46
00:01:40,941 --> 00:01:42,741
It says "Lana Del Rey."

47
00:01:42,777 --> 00:01:44,410
Wow, how do I get
this on my phone?

48
00:01:44,445 --> 00:01:45,711
You just download it.

49
00:01:45,746 --> 00:01:47,079
It's a app.
What's an app?

50
00:01:47,114 --> 00:01:48,514
They're little programs

51
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:50,149
you use on your phone
while driving.

52
00:01:50,184 --> 00:01:51,984
Oh, man,
apps sound awesome!

53
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:53,519
This is a real
game changer!

54
00:01:53,554 --> 00:01:54,920
Like the guy who invented

55
00:01:54,955 --> 00:01:56,655
wearing a sport jacket
with jeans.

56
00:01:56,691 --> 00:01:57,890
So, what can
I do for you?

57
00:01:57,925 --> 00:01:59,258
Well, I've got
to go to church,

58
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:01,160
but I don't have time
to change from the rodeo.

59
00:02:01,195 --> 00:02:03,262
Excuse me, I thought
you were helping me find a look

60
00:02:03,297 --> 00:02:05,164
that'll let me cling
to my youth in my 40s.

61
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:06,365
Yes, I'm interested

62
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,333
in cheating on my wife
in Las Vegas.

63
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:11,570
Gentlemen, I think I can
help all three of you.

64
00:02:15,142 --> 00:02:16,942
Brian, I'm in a bind.

65
00:02:16,977 --> 00:02:18,711
Joanne was supposed to
drive me to the club,

66
00:02:18,746 --> 00:02:20,245
but she's having
throat surgery.

67
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:22,114
20 years of
menthol slims.

68
00:02:22,149 --> 00:02:23,789
I don't understand
anything you just said.

69
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:25,451
Just drive me to
the racquet club.

70
00:02:25,486 --> 00:02:27,352
Since when do you belong
to a racquet club?

71
00:02:27,388 --> 00:02:29,688
You know, I do have a life
outside this house.

72
00:02:29,724 --> 00:02:32,191
For example, I also write
restaurant reviews

73
00:02:32,226 --> 00:02:34,727
for the newspaper
under the name Hugh Cornwallis.

74
00:02:34,762 --> 00:02:36,595
Hugh Cornwallis?
He's, like...

75
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,464
Super bitchy, I know.
Now come on, let's go.

76
00:02:38,499 --> 00:02:40,265
So, what? You're gonna
play tennis all day?

77
00:02:40,301 --> 00:02:41,934
No, I might also
hit the treadmill

78
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:43,235
and watch
<i>Kelly and Michael</i>

79
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,070
on mute with
closed captioning.

80
00:02:45,106 --> 00:02:47,239
"Kelly: It's like kale

81
00:02:47,274 --> 00:02:49,374
"is everywhere these days,
am I right?

82
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,943
Michael: unintelligible."

83
00:02:50,978 --> 00:02:52,277
I love them.

84
00:02:52,313 --> 00:02:54,446
They have such
an amazing chemistry.

85
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,953
Yeah!

86
00:03:00,988 --> 00:03:02,121
Awesome!

87
00:03:02,156 --> 00:03:03,555
Peter, will you
keep it down?

88
00:03:03,591 --> 00:03:05,457
I'm trying to look at
lamps I'll never buy.

89
00:03:05,493 --> 00:03:06,992
Oh, yeah, sorry.

90
00:03:07,027 --> 00:03:08,927
Sweet!
What are you doing?

91
00:03:08,963 --> 00:03:10,896
Well, I just found out about
these things called apps,

92
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:12,698
so that's kind of
all I do now.

93
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:15,100
This one's a cool
bowling app I got.

94
00:03:15,136 --> 00:03:16,769
Aw, yeah, strike!

95
00:03:16,804 --> 00:03:19,138
Peter, your phone's
streaming to the TV.

96
00:03:19,173 --> 00:03:20,606
You're clearly
watching porn.

97
00:03:20,641 --> 00:03:22,107
Will you turn it off?

98
00:03:22,143 --> 00:03:23,809
I'm already caught, Lois.
I'm gonna finish.

99
00:03:23,844 --> 00:03:25,244
Peter, I'm...
I'm gonna finish!

100
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:27,012
Just go over there!

101
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:29,681
We're gonna be fine,
Lois, you and me.

102
00:03:33,954 --> 00:03:35,454
There you are, Dad.

103
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:37,656
Where have you been?
I haven't seen you in days.

104
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:39,625
Ugh. I went out of town
for a little while,

105
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,993
but I made the
mistake of using

106
00:03:41,028 --> 00:03:42,861
this app called
Bear B'n'B.

107
00:03:42,897 --> 00:03:44,596
We're so happy you're
staying with us.

108
00:03:44,632 --> 00:03:47,633
Just a reminder, we ask that
you not use the DVD player,

109
00:03:47,668 --> 00:03:49,468
but you can watch
any of the VHSs.

110
00:03:49,503 --> 00:03:50,702
We have<i> Clear and</i>
<i>Present Danger,</i>

111
00:03:50,738 --> 00:03:52,104
<i>Son of the Mask...</i>

112
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:53,705
oh, and here's
most of a puzzle.

113
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:55,641
Okay, well, I don't
want any of that stuff.

114
00:03:55,676 --> 00:03:57,109
Fine. Well,
if the phone rings

115
00:03:57,144 --> 00:03:58,710
and we're not around,
just take a message.

116
00:03:58,746 --> 00:04:00,145
I'm kind of on vacation.

117
00:04:00,181 --> 00:04:03,048
Oh, and just a heads up,
the dog doesn't like men.

118
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,717
Now, we serve breakfast from
6:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m.

119
00:04:05,753 --> 00:04:06,985
I'll skip breakfast.

120
00:04:07,021 --> 00:04:08,387
Uh, everyone
eats breakfast.

121
00:04:08,422 --> 00:04:09,788
I'm on vacation.

122
00:04:09,824 --> 00:04:11,223
All the more reason
to treat yourself.

123
00:04:11,258 --> 00:04:13,492
The house specialty
is a half-chewed trout

124
00:04:13,527 --> 00:04:15,527
we yanked out of the
river with our teeth.

125
00:04:15,563 --> 00:04:17,229
Ah, there's the bear stuff.

126
00:04:20,768 --> 00:04:21,768
(phone chimes)

127
00:04:23,504 --> 00:04:24,703
Where are you going?

128
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:25,971
Oh, I'm meeting up
with someone

129
00:04:26,006 --> 00:04:27,406
from my Grinder app.

130
00:04:27,441 --> 00:04:28,807
Isn't that for
anonymous gay hookups?

131
00:04:28,843 --> 00:04:30,742
No, no, no.
This one's a way for guys

132
00:04:30,778 --> 00:04:32,611
who enjoy sandwiches
to connect.

133
00:04:34,548 --> 00:04:36,181
MAN:
You "Meatballfreak"?

134
00:04:36,217 --> 00:04:37,182
Uh-huh.

135
00:04:37,218 --> 00:04:38,550
All right,
let's do this.

136
00:04:42,356 --> 00:04:44,523
Are you also married?

137
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,629
My phone's broken.

138
00:04:50,664 --> 00:04:51,830
I'm not surprised.

139
00:04:51,866 --> 00:04:53,365
It's probably because
of all those apps

140
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,900
you've been downloading.

141
00:04:54,935 --> 00:04:56,668
Don't say "apps"
like you're young.

142
00:04:56,704 --> 00:04:57,936
No, I took it
in the shower

143
00:04:57,972 --> 00:04:59,538
'cause I didn't know
you could pause a game.

144
00:04:59,573 --> 00:05:00,772
Here, Chris.
Your first cell phone!

145
00:05:00,808 --> 00:05:02,074
Yay!

146
00:05:02,109 --> 00:05:04,376
Something my dad held
in the bathroom!

147
00:05:04,411 --> 00:05:06,745
You know, Chris, you could
probably salvage that phone.

148
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,548
If you put it in a bag of
uncooked rice, it'll dry out.

149
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:10,549
Really?

150
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:12,217
Yeah. And then you
can use the rice

151
00:05:12,253 --> 00:05:14,186
to pretend someone
wanted to marry you.

152
00:05:14,221 --> 00:05:15,754
Ladies and gentlemen,

153
00:05:15,789 --> 00:05:19,224
Mr. and Mrs. Dog
and Meg the Bounty Hunter!

154
00:05:27,601 --> 00:05:29,334
Holy moley!

155
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,702
Marcy Miller!

156
00:05:30,738 --> 00:05:32,571
She bought feminine products
at my dad's pharmacy,

157
00:05:32,606 --> 00:05:34,873
so you know
she's up and running.

158
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:37,209
Yeah, I wish I had
the guts to talk to her.

159
00:05:37,244 --> 00:05:38,377
Talk to her?

160
00:05:38,412 --> 00:05:40,245
Chris, no one talks
to each other anymore.

161
00:05:40,281 --> 00:05:41,914
If you want to get
a girl's attention,

162
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:43,949
you text her a picture
of your penis.

163
00:05:43,984 --> 00:05:45,250
What? Really?

164
00:05:45,286 --> 00:05:46,818
Are-Are you sure?
Oh, yeah.

165
00:05:46,854 --> 00:05:48,487
People who send their daughters
to public high schools

166
00:05:48,522 --> 00:05:49,922
are basically
asking for this.

167
00:05:49,957 --> 00:05:53,158
Well, I did just get
this new phone from my dad.

168
00:05:55,963 --> 00:05:56,929
(camera clicks)

169
00:05:56,964 --> 00:05:58,463
All right, what could go wrong?

170
00:05:58,499 --> 00:05:59,765
It worked out great for...

171
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,800
("Yakety Sax" playing)

172
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:13,412
Ah. This is it, Bri.

173
00:06:13,447 --> 00:06:15,314
The Quahog Racquet Club.

174
00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:18,951
Where frail old men come
to weigh themselves in the nude.

175
00:06:18,986 --> 00:06:22,521
Does that say 84 or 85?

176
00:06:22,556 --> 00:06:24,289
It says 63.

177
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:25,824
Oh, dear.

178
00:06:25,859 --> 00:06:28,260
How'd you get all those
cuts on your butt?

179
00:06:29,563 --> 00:06:32,164
Wow, they allow drinking here
at 10:30 in the morning?

180
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:35,067
Oh, yes, half the bathroom trash
is thrown-up scrambled eggs.

181
00:06:35,102 --> 00:06:36,835
Okay, so this place
has hot women,

182
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,037
morning booze
and free vomit?

183
00:06:39,073 --> 00:06:41,039
Maybe I'll join you.
You don't play tennis.

184
00:06:41,075 --> 00:06:43,075
What are you talking about?
I'm a great tennis player.

185
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,643
You are? Well, that's perfect.

186
00:06:44,678 --> 00:06:46,011
There's a doubles tournament
coming up,

187
00:06:46,046 --> 00:06:47,546
and I could really
use a partner.

188
00:06:47,581 --> 00:06:48,814
Well, you found him!

189
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:51,216
All right, all right,
I suppose we can make this work.

190
00:06:51,251 --> 00:06:52,751
Like that actress
from<i> Rizzoli & Isles</i>

191
00:06:52,786 --> 00:06:54,219
and her husband do.

192
00:06:54,254 --> 00:06:56,154
Honey, I thought
we could do

193
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,656
a little
role-playing tonight.

194
00:06:57,691 --> 00:06:59,691
Oh, yeah? What'd
you have in mind?

195
00:06:59,727 --> 00:07:02,094
Maybe I could be
my character from the show.

196
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:03,562
Oh! Yeah!

197
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:04,896
From the show!

198
00:07:04,932 --> 00:07:05,932
Sure.

199
00:07:05,966 --> 00:07:07,666
Um... oh, no!

200
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:09,901
It's the... law
enforcement woman.

201
00:07:09,937 --> 00:07:12,404
Part of that great team
of Rizzoli and Isles.

202
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:14,272
You don't know
what part I play, do you?

203
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,708
Hey, look, you didn't marry me
because of my brains.

204
00:07:16,744 --> 00:07:18,043
You married me
because I play

205
00:07:18,078 --> 00:07:20,078
one of the main bad
guys in<i> Blue Bloods.</i>

206
00:07:20,114 --> 00:07:23,415
Now let's just stop talking
and have idiot actor sex.

207
00:07:27,388 --> 00:07:29,287
Thank you for coming,
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin.

208
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,123
We've got a bit
of a situation,

209
00:07:31,158 --> 00:07:33,458
which is why I've asked
Officer Swanson to join us.

210
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,927
It appears Chris sent an
inappropriate photo of himself

211
00:07:35,963 --> 00:07:37,396
to one of his
classmates.

212
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:38,397
That's right.

213
00:07:38,432 --> 00:07:40,232
He texted a picture
of his peenie.

214
00:07:40,267 --> 00:07:41,433
Oh, my God!

215
00:07:41,468 --> 00:07:43,535
And apparently the girl...
Oh, thank God.

216
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,737
...he sent it to
doesn't like him back,

217
00:07:45,773 --> 00:07:47,139
so she turned him in.

218
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:49,541
Okay, I can see
everybody's mad, but...

219
00:07:49,576 --> 00:07:51,209
what'd you think?

220
00:07:51,245 --> 00:07:52,611
Thank you for
bringing this

221
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:54,279
to our attention,
Principal Shepherd.

222
00:07:54,314 --> 00:07:56,415
We'll make sure
Chris apologizes

223
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,949
to that little
knob-tease.

224
00:07:57,985 --> 00:08:00,118
I'm sorry, Lois,
but it's not that simple.

225
00:08:00,154 --> 00:08:01,953
When Chris sent
that picture,

226
00:08:01,989 --> 00:08:05,223
he was technically
distributing child pornography.

227
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:07,092
Child pornography?!

228
00:08:07,127 --> 00:08:08,593
Joe, that's crazy!

229
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:11,129
He's just a teenager
who made a bad choice.

230
00:08:11,165 --> 00:08:14,232
I don't know what to say, but
the laws just haven't caught up

231
00:08:14,268 --> 00:08:15,934
to how cool kids are now.

232
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:18,336
I'm sorry, but this makes Chris
a sex offender.

233
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,738
Oh, my God!

234
00:08:19,773 --> 00:08:21,006
Huh.

235
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,508
Well, I'm not about to make
a Batman exit right now,

236
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:26,011
but has that thing
always been over there?

237
00:08:26,046 --> 00:08:27,512
Over where?

238
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,780
What are you doing, Peter?

239
00:08:28,816 --> 00:08:30,282
Ah, you looked back
too fast.

240
00:08:36,301 --> 00:08:37,967
Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker.

241
00:08:38,002 --> 00:08:41,003
Today, we bring you a disturbing
case of child pornography.

242
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,306
Local teenage scumbag
Chris Griffin,

243
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:44,974
whose name will be omitted here,

244
00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:46,642
was caught sending,
quote-unquote,

245
00:08:46,678 --> 00:08:48,344
"graphic selfies of his hog"--

246
00:08:48,379 --> 00:08:50,146
not sure where
that quote is from--

247
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:51,948
to another underage student.

248
00:08:51,983 --> 00:08:55,685
Coming up next, teleprompter guy
puts the period in a weird.

249
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,286
Place.

250
00:08:57,322 --> 00:08:58,754
Oh, this is awful.

251
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,424
Now everyone in town
knows I'm a sex offender!

252
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:03,459
We know you didn't
mean any harm, Chris.

253
00:09:03,494 --> 00:09:05,194
We're just living
in a different time.

254
00:09:05,229 --> 00:09:06,596
When I was your age,

255
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:08,698
boys used to just
whip it out on the bus.

256
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:11,300
Can't I just go on the news
and tell everyone I'm sorry?

257
00:09:11,336 --> 00:09:13,102
Oh, I wish you
could, sweetie,

258
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:15,471
but the law says that,
as a sex offender,

259
00:09:15,506 --> 00:09:17,873
you have to complete
a rehabilitation course.

260
00:09:17,909 --> 00:09:19,842
Oh, that sounds awful.

261
00:09:19,877 --> 00:09:22,278
Eh, can't be any worse
than our trip to Hawaii.

262
00:09:22,313 --> 00:09:24,680
Okay, before you do
anything else,

263
00:09:24,716 --> 00:09:27,049
I'm deathly allergic
to pineapple, pork,

264
00:09:27,085 --> 00:09:28,684
rum, macadamia nuts,

265
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,987
stupid tiny guitars,
overpriced golf,

266
00:09:31,022 --> 00:09:33,189
sentimental
military stuff, lava,

267
00:09:33,224 --> 00:09:35,224
people who I can't tell
are black or Asian,

268
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:37,526
apostrophes,
anyone twirling flames,

269
00:09:37,562 --> 00:09:39,328
second weddings
and linen pants.

270
00:09:39,364 --> 00:09:41,130
Is there anything
you're not allergic to?

271
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:42,531
Yeah, the Epcot Center.

272
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:44,734
Where I<i> wanted</i> to go.

273
00:09:48,573 --> 00:09:50,973
Good evening, I'm Glenn
Quagmire, your instructor.

274
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:52,475
Everyone look to your left.

275
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,010
Now look to your right.

276
00:09:54,045 --> 00:09:55,845
All of you are sex offenders,

277
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,080
and statistically
you will all be here again.

278
00:09:58,116 --> 00:10:01,083
Because this has never worked
in the history of doing this.

279
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:03,986
Now, today, we have a new
member-- giggity-- Chris G.

280
00:10:04,022 --> 00:10:05,488
ALL:
Hi, Chris.

281
00:10:05,523 --> 00:10:06,722
All right, before we begin,

282
00:10:06,758 --> 00:10:08,157
whoever's driving
a windowless van

283
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:10,232
painted like an ice cream truck,
your lights are on.

284
00:10:12,897 --> 00:10:14,864
Okay, next,
let's take a few minutes

285
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:16,766
to talk about
our new, fake interests.

286
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:18,534
Here's a clay pot I made.

287
00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:20,569
I've started following
girls' field hockey.

288
00:10:20,605 --> 00:10:21,671
No, come on.

289
00:10:21,706 --> 00:10:23,372
You're supposed to pick
from the list.

290
00:10:23,408 --> 00:10:25,608
Mr. Quagmire,
this is terrible.

291
00:10:25,643 --> 00:10:27,843
And do I really
have to be here?

292
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:29,612
Well, the law does
give you a choice.

293
00:10:29,647 --> 00:10:31,047
This or chemical
castration.

294
00:10:31,082 --> 00:10:33,049
What's that?
You take a ton of pills

295
00:10:33,084 --> 00:10:34,884
that completely wipe
out all sexuality.

296
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:36,519
Oh, is that what
Michael Moore did?

297
00:10:36,554 --> 00:10:38,521
No, but I understand
why you'd think that.

298
00:10:38,556 --> 00:10:40,356
Now, do you want
to see the list?

299
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:42,758
I could take a whack at
hand-distressing furniture.

300
00:10:42,794 --> 00:10:44,427
We don't say "whack."

301
00:10:50,902 --> 00:10:52,902
(grunting loudly)

302
00:10:59,644 --> 00:11:00,676
Very good, Stewie.

303
00:11:00,712 --> 00:11:02,445
You grunt like
a Hungarian lesbian.

304
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,913
(sighs)
Thanks, Dimitri.

305
00:11:03,948 --> 00:11:06,515
And, uh, your testicle's hanging
out of your shorts again.

306
00:11:06,551 --> 00:11:07,850
I am cooling it.

307
00:11:07,885 --> 00:11:09,685
But where is
this partner of yours?

308
00:11:09,721 --> 00:11:12,121
I don't know. He was supposed
to be here 15 minutes ago.

309
00:11:12,156 --> 00:11:13,856
(laughter)
You're right.

310
00:11:13,891 --> 00:11:15,291
So, anyway,
my ex said,

311
00:11:15,326 --> 00:11:17,293
"If you bring home
one more tennis trophy,

312
00:11:17,328 --> 00:11:18,694
I am out of here."

313
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,129
Well, she was gone
in two days.

314
00:11:20,164 --> 00:11:22,131
(laughter)

315
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,365
Oh, Brian.

316
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:25,534
"O'Brien"?
That's my Irish cousin.

317
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,970
(laughter)

318
00:11:28,005 --> 00:11:29,271
What are you doing?!

319
00:11:29,307 --> 00:11:31,006
We're supposed to be
practicing for the tournament.

320
00:11:31,042 --> 00:11:32,842
Stewie, relax.
I promise we'll practice,

321
00:11:32,877 --> 00:11:34,243
but we just ordered bisque.

322
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:35,478
How are you
paying for that?

323
00:11:35,513 --> 00:11:36,979
Well, if you must know,

324
00:11:37,014 --> 00:11:38,914
we're putting it on Philippa's
husband's account.

325
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,416
Does Burt know
about this?

326
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:42,384
He would if he wasn't
working all the time.

327
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,386
Thank you, Brian.

328
00:11:44,422 --> 00:11:47,156
Now, come on, let's have more
hard liquor and creamy soups.

329
00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:48,591
Ugh.

330
00:11:52,363 --> 00:11:54,764
Meg, can you hand me
the paper plates?

331
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,766
I can't believe we're
having an ice cream cake

332
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:59,201
to celebrate Chris graduating
from sex offender school.

333
00:11:59,237 --> 00:12:01,203
Well, the opportunities
to celebrate

334
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:03,005
don't come often
in this household.

335
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,876
There he is, Mr.
Former Sex Offender.

336
00:12:06,911 --> 00:12:08,577
Mom, it's not
that big a deal.

337
00:12:08,613 --> 00:12:10,713
All I did was finish
those creepy classes.

338
00:12:10,748 --> 00:12:12,848
I know, but now your
record is clear.

339
00:12:12,884 --> 00:12:15,117
You can go back to
being a normal boy

340
00:12:15,153 --> 00:12:16,919
and put all this
behind you.

341
00:12:16,954 --> 00:12:18,587
Hey, Chris, wait till
you see the funny thing

342
00:12:18,623 --> 00:12:20,356
I had 'em put
on your cake.

343
00:12:20,391 --> 00:12:22,558
"Happy sixth
birthday, Timmy"?

344
00:12:22,593 --> 00:12:24,260
Uh-oh, they must
have mixed them up.

345
00:12:24,295 --> 00:12:27,096
"Nice crank,
you dirty little bastard"?

346
00:12:27,131 --> 00:12:28,297
Sorry, I'll take that.

347
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:30,499
Here's your cake.
I ate a great deal of it.

348
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:37,006
Oh, there you are.

349
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,774
How was your first
day out of rehab?

350
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,209
It was terrible.

351
00:12:40,244 --> 00:12:42,044
Taking that class
made no difference.

352
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,213
Nobody wants anything
to do with me.

353
00:12:44,248 --> 00:12:45,414
Hi, Mr. Herbert.

354
00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:46,415
Oh, my God.

355
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,416
Children, run!

356
00:12:47,451 --> 00:12:48,818
It's that pervert!

357
00:12:48,853 --> 00:12:51,353
Everybody into my
safety basement!

358
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:53,656
Oh! Oh, that
was a bad snap.

359
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:55,090
I'm hurt, kids!

360
00:12:55,126 --> 00:12:58,127
Don't eat those popsicles
till I get down there!

361
00:13:02,867 --> 00:13:05,267
Well, I'm glad we're finally
getting some practice in.

362
00:13:05,303 --> 00:13:06,836
Yeah, nothing like
running around

363
00:13:06,871 --> 00:13:09,305
after eating
a seafood tower.

364
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,739
What are you
doing here?

365
00:13:10,775 --> 00:13:12,141
You're supposed to
be at the baseline.

366
00:13:12,176 --> 00:13:13,576
Yeah, baseline,
baseline.

367
00:13:13,611 --> 00:13:15,411
Right, right.
He's serving to you.

368
00:13:15,446 --> 00:13:16,512
Get back there!

369
00:13:22,653 --> 00:13:24,253
You've never played
tennis, have you?

370
00:13:24,288 --> 00:13:25,654
Not once.
Damn it, Brian!

371
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,089
I entered us in
that tournament

372
00:13:27,124 --> 00:13:28,490
because you said
you could play!

373
00:13:28,526 --> 00:13:29,925
And I will not
be humiliated

374
00:13:29,961 --> 00:13:32,361
in front of shallow,
rich alcoholics!

375
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:37,967
Hey, Chris.

376
00:13:38,002 --> 00:13:39,969
I see you walked
across the grass again

377
00:13:40,004 --> 00:13:41,604
instead of
using the walk.

378
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:43,339
You're really wearing
a path, aren't you?

379
00:13:43,374 --> 00:13:44,840
We call that
Chris's Trail.

380
00:13:44,876 --> 00:13:45,841
Right there.

381
00:13:45,877 --> 00:13:47,343
Chris's Trail.

382
00:13:47,378 --> 00:13:49,778
Mr. Quagmire,
I completed that sex rehab

383
00:13:49,814 --> 00:13:51,480
and I paid my debt to society,

384
00:13:51,515 --> 00:13:54,183
but people are still afraid of
me, like I'm some kind of creep.

385
00:13:54,218 --> 00:13:55,851
How do I get them to treat me

386
00:13:55,887 --> 00:13:57,686
the way they did
before all this happened?

387
00:13:57,722 --> 00:13:59,388
You can't. I'm sorry, Chris,

388
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,523
but you're just gonna have
to accept that from now on,

389
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:03,525
people are gonna see you
as a sex-crazed pervert.

390
00:14:03,561 --> 00:14:05,728
And there's nothing
you can do to change that.

391
00:14:05,763 --> 00:14:08,564
Wait a minute,
maybe there is.

392
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:10,199
Thanks, Mr. Quagmire.

393
00:14:10,234 --> 00:14:11,200
No problem, Chris.

394
00:14:11,235 --> 00:14:12,401
You keep that
chin up, huh?

395
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:13,469
I will.

396
00:14:13,504 --> 00:14:15,037
Hey, can I ring
your doorbell?

397
00:14:15,072 --> 00:14:16,238
No, I'd rather you...
(doorbell rings)

398
00:14:16,274 --> 00:14:17,239
(cat shrieks)

399
00:14:17,275 --> 00:14:18,674
That's why "no," Chris.

400
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:19,909
That's why "no."

401
00:14:26,684 --> 00:14:29,051
Chris? What the hell
happened to you?

402
00:14:29,086 --> 00:14:30,519
(androgynous voice):
Mother, Father,

403
00:14:30,554 --> 00:14:33,322
I decided to have myself
chemically castrated.

404
00:14:33,357 --> 00:14:34,924
Why the hell would
you do that?!

405
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,359
Now nobody will have
any reason to be afraid of me

406
00:14:37,395 --> 00:14:38,994
or think I'm a pervert,

407
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,997
and everybody can just
treat me like normal again.

408
00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:45,401
Oh, my God, I can't believe
my son's some kind of weirdo!

409
00:14:45,436 --> 00:14:46,869
Uh, here comes
another sandwich.

410
00:14:49,573 --> 00:14:51,340
I can't even look at you.

411
00:14:57,317 --> 00:14:59,283
(androgynous voice):
Has anyone seen my sandals?

412
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:01,118
Yeah, no, nobody's seen
your sandals.

413
00:15:01,154 --> 00:15:03,654
Well, I'll just have
to make another pair.

414
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,657
Look, Chris, I know you
think chemical castration

415
00:15:06,693 --> 00:15:08,092
is gonna solve
your problems,

416
00:15:08,127 --> 00:15:10,661
but you have to stop
taking those pills.

417
00:15:10,697 --> 00:15:11,963
I don't have to do anything,

418
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:14,231
besides get to the wind chime
store before it closes.

419
00:15:14,267 --> 00:15:16,133
There can't be
a whole store.

420
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:18,536
To be fair, they also have
a couple of kaleidoscopes.

421
00:15:18,571 --> 00:15:19,904
Ah, can I come?

422
00:15:19,939 --> 00:15:21,973
Lois, can I go to the store
with that thing?

423
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:25,576
Splendid. I'll go get
my burlap wallet.

424
00:15:25,611 --> 00:15:29,413
Wow, we rolled three gutter
balls on these kids, huh?

425
00:15:40,927 --> 00:15:43,327
My word, Brian,
you're really improving.

426
00:15:43,363 --> 00:15:44,729
We might actually
win this thing.

427
00:15:44,764 --> 00:15:46,364
Thanks. You know,
I just pretend

428
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,032
that tennis ball
is Mitch McConnell

429
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:50,234
trying to roll back subsidies
on the Affordable Care Act,

430
00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:51,736
and I'm like, "Nope!"

431
00:15:51,771 --> 00:15:53,738
Yeah, I-I don't... I don't
need to hear your process.

432
00:15:53,773 --> 00:15:55,172
Look, I'm just happy
you pushed me,

433
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,574
'cause now I can't wait
for that tournament.

434
00:15:56,609 --> 00:15:58,409
I know,
it's gonna be great.

435
00:15:58,444 --> 00:16:01,379
And I already know exactly
where I'm gonna put that trophy.

436
00:16:01,414 --> 00:16:02,813
So the baby died?

437
00:16:02,849 --> 00:16:04,215
Yeah, the baby died.

438
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,417
But, look, first place.

439
00:16:10,723 --> 00:16:13,691
Chris, your mother and I want
you to stop taking them pills.

440
00:16:13,726 --> 00:16:16,027
There's a lot of great things
about having a sex drive

441
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:18,095
that you're missing out on.
Like what?

442
00:16:18,131 --> 00:16:20,765
Well, there's the post-orgy
meals at a swingers party.

443
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,067
Come on, let's eat with
these wonderful people.

444
00:16:23,102 --> 00:16:25,436
Hey, everybody,
try my wife's ambrosia.

445
00:16:25,471 --> 00:16:28,506
If you liked my wife's snizz,
you're gonna love her ambrosia.

446
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,508
I was thinking about
this seven-layer dip

447
00:16:30,543 --> 00:16:32,676
the whole time I
was chowing Ronald.

448
00:16:32,712 --> 00:16:34,111
I don't like this.

449
00:16:34,147 --> 00:16:35,546
I want to go home.

450
00:16:35,581 --> 00:16:36,747
You know what's sad?

451
00:16:36,783 --> 00:16:39,617
There's hardly any other
fathers and sons here.

452
00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:44,922
I don't know, Lois.

453
00:16:44,957 --> 00:16:47,091
I just don't think
Chris is gonna change his mind.

454
00:16:47,126 --> 00:16:48,526
(sighs)
I know.

455
00:16:48,561 --> 00:16:49,794
It's only a matter of time

456
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:51,362
before he shaves
one side of his head

457
00:16:51,397 --> 00:16:53,364
and swoops the rest
of the hair over.

458
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:55,699
Why, is that...
is that bad?

459
00:16:55,735 --> 00:16:57,802
Good early
evening, everyone.

460
00:16:57,837 --> 00:16:59,804
I have celebratory news.

461
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,974
With all the free time, I'm
no longer devoting to onanism...

462
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,810
That's spanking it?
Yes, Peter.

463
00:17:05,845 --> 00:17:08,646
...I have managed to redirect
that energy into my studies.

464
00:17:08,681 --> 00:17:12,083
In fact, today I received
the Kaplan Prize in biology.

465
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:14,018
Chris, that's great!

466
00:17:14,053 --> 00:17:17,421
Not only that, I got the highest
score on my Spanish test,

467
00:17:17,457 --> 00:17:19,523
and I even joined
the debate team.

468
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,425
That's amazing!

469
00:17:21,461 --> 00:17:24,428
All right, well, I'm gonna
put some flowers in a wagon

470
00:17:24,464 --> 00:17:26,297
and walk around town.

471
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,400
You know what, Peter?

472
00:17:29,435 --> 00:17:31,769
Maybe there's a silver
lining to this fiasco.

473
00:17:31,804 --> 00:17:33,771
Not thinking about
sex all the time

474
00:17:33,806 --> 00:17:36,607
seems to have allowed Chris
to excel in other areas.

475
00:17:36,642 --> 00:17:38,008
He does seem sharper.

476
00:17:38,044 --> 00:17:39,844
Heck, the old Chris
couldn't even figure out

477
00:17:39,879 --> 00:17:41,846
the self-checkout
at the supermarket.

478
00:17:41,881 --> 00:17:44,281
REGISTER: (beeps) Please place
the item in the bagging area.

479
00:17:44,317 --> 00:17:46,684
Please remove the item
from the bagging area.

480
00:17:46,719 --> 00:17:49,687
Please take a plastic bag
from the bagging area.

481
00:17:49,722 --> 00:17:52,156
Please put the bag over
your head and tighten.

482
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:55,559
(gasping)

483
00:17:58,564 --> 00:17:59,964
(laughing)
(laughing)

484
00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:01,966
I told you I could
make him do it.

485
00:18:02,001 --> 00:18:03,200
That's hard-core, man.

486
00:18:03,236 --> 00:18:05,202
You're hard-core.

487
00:18:10,476 --> 00:18:12,109
All right, Brian,
we win this set,

488
00:18:12,145 --> 00:18:13,310
the tournament's ours.

489
00:18:13,346 --> 00:18:14,645
Yeah, come on,
let's do this.

490
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,780
I can already see our
names in the newsletter,

491
00:18:16,816 --> 00:18:19,150
right below the deaths
from the previous quarter.

492
00:18:27,527 --> 00:18:29,360
Out.
What?!

493
00:18:29,395 --> 00:18:30,561
Your ball was long.

494
00:18:30,596 --> 00:18:31,795
Are you (bleep) me?!

495
00:18:31,831 --> 00:18:32,997
That thing was in!

496
00:18:33,032 --> 00:18:34,365
You're gonna penalize us

497
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,368
because you're a blind (bleep)
blue jacket (bleep)?!

498
00:18:37,403 --> 00:18:38,569
Stewie, calm down.

499
00:18:38,604 --> 00:18:40,204
I will drop you
to your knees

500
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:42,206
and shove my racket so
far down your throat

501
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:44,375
you'll be (bleep)
my grip for a week!

502
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:45,809
Warning, Mr. Griffin.

503
00:18:45,845 --> 00:18:48,212
Oh, you're warning me?!
I'm warning you!

504
00:18:48,247 --> 00:18:50,848
I'm gonna go to your house
and (bleep) your wife!

505
00:18:50,883 --> 00:18:53,851
You proud of yourself,
tennis club security guard?

506
00:18:53,886 --> 00:18:55,686
Your kids look up to you?
Big man.

507
00:18:55,721 --> 00:18:58,088
Throwing out a baby and a dog.
Tough guy.

508
00:18:58,124 --> 00:19:00,524
Maybe I'll see you later when
you don't have that name tag on.

509
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,926
I thought your
shot was in.

510
00:19:01,961 --> 00:19:03,694
Oh, hey, pound it, dude.

511
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,700
So to find the area
of this circle,

512
00:19:09,735 --> 00:19:13,103
we're going to need to use pi,
whose digits go on forever.

513
00:19:13,139 --> 00:19:16,540
(chuckles) Can you imagine
if our pi was endless?

514
00:19:16,576 --> 00:19:18,909
We'd all be changing
our belt sizes.

515
00:19:18,945 --> 00:19:20,911
(chuckles)

516
00:19:20,947 --> 00:19:22,913
Thanks, Chris.

517
00:19:22,949 --> 00:19:24,548
Wow, that was
really something.

518
00:19:24,584 --> 00:19:26,050
Marcy?

519
00:19:26,085 --> 00:19:29,053
I had no idea you were
such an amazing tutor.

520
00:19:29,088 --> 00:19:30,487
And I really like
your pendant.

521
00:19:30,523 --> 00:19:33,891
Thanks, but why are you
being so nice to me?

522
00:19:33,926 --> 00:19:35,893
You got me in so much
trouble before.

523
00:19:35,928 --> 00:19:37,895
Yeah, I'm really
sorry about that.

524
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:40,130
That was just my dumb,
overprotective dad.

525
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,532
Really?

526
00:19:41,567 --> 00:19:44,201
Yeah, he took my phone to look
at pictures of my friends,

527
00:19:44,237 --> 00:19:45,803
and he found the
one you sent.

528
00:19:45,838 --> 00:19:47,338
I bet that caught him
by surprise.

529
00:19:47,373 --> 00:19:48,639
Definitely.

530
00:19:48,674 --> 00:19:52,076
Well, I hope you know
that's not who I am anymore.

531
00:19:52,111 --> 00:19:56,013
I do, and I hope I didn't
cause you too much trouble.

532
00:20:00,286 --> 00:20:02,253
(alarm blaring)

533
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:03,654
This is not a drill!

534
00:20:03,689 --> 00:20:05,522
I repeat, not a drill!

535
00:20:07,326 --> 00:20:09,727
Good to be back doing
this again, huh, Bill?

536
00:20:09,762 --> 00:20:11,562
What, shoveling
coal into a penis?

537
00:20:11,597 --> 00:20:12,696
I was sleeping.

538
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,399
What's happening?!

539
00:20:15,434 --> 00:20:16,800
(normal voice):
I don't know.

540
00:20:16,836 --> 00:20:18,969
Someone... someone get me
nude art books!

541
00:20:19,005 --> 00:20:21,071
I need nude art books!

542
00:20:21,107 --> 00:20:22,906
Oh, good, Chris.

543
00:20:22,942 --> 00:20:24,908
You can hang this
<i>New York Times</i> back on...

544
00:20:24,944 --> 00:20:27,678
(gasps):
Oh, a pee-pee!

545
00:20:31,517 --> 00:20:33,917
Well, Chris, you
killed that librarian,

546
00:20:33,953 --> 00:20:36,320
but we're glad to have you
back to your old self.

547
00:20:36,355 --> 00:20:38,956
Mrs. Lapardo worked at
that school for 54 years.

548
00:20:38,991 --> 00:20:40,591
Well, at least
she saw a little Wang

549
00:20:40,626 --> 00:20:41,925
before taking that dirt nap.

550
00:20:41,961 --> 00:20:43,260
Thanks, you guys.

551
00:20:43,296 --> 00:20:46,363
I guess chemical castration
isn't for everyone.

552
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:49,366
I-Is that... is that
the lesson for this week?

553
00:20:49,402 --> 00:20:52,691
Uh, I guess it's that or
be kinder on the tennis court.

554
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,859
Where have you been?

555
00:20:54,939 --> 00:21:01,439
