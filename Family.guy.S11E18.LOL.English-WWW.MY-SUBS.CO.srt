﻿1
00:00:05,336 --> 00:00:07,003
Peter, come on, it's
time to wake up.

2
00:00:07,021 --> 00:00:08,605
You got to get to work.

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,490
Uh, Lois, I ain't feeling good.

4
00:00:10,524 --> 00:00:12,258
Peter, what happened
to your voice?

5
00:00:12,293 --> 00:00:14,193
It-It's so deep.

6
00:00:14,228 --> 00:00:15,662
I think I'm sick.

7
00:00:15,696 --> 00:00:17,530
Well, you don't
sound like yourself.

8
00:00:17,564 --> 00:00:20,733
In fact, you sound
kind of hot.

9
00:00:20,768 --> 00:00:23,336
I just threw up
two chicken gyros out my nose.

10
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,804
They're on your side of the bed.

11
00:00:24,838 --> 00:00:26,873
Oh, say that again.

12
00:00:28,225 --> 00:00:30,560
But I want you to
keep talking to me

13
00:00:30,594 --> 00:00:32,303
in that sexy voice
while we do it.

14
00:00:32,456 --> 00:00:35,444
Okay great. Let's pretend
you're a tollbooth worker

15
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:36,858
and I'm molesting you.

16
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:38,060
Okay.

17
00:00:38,094 --> 00:00:39,628
I don't have any change.

18
00:00:39,662 --> 00:00:40,929
Now take off that parka.

19
00:00:40,963 --> 00:00:42,097
Uh-uh-uh.

20
00:00:42,131 --> 00:00:43,765
You're gonna have
to pay a high toll

21
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,701
if you want to get
into this tunnel.

22
00:00:45,735 --> 00:00:47,569
Come on,
don't say stuff like that.

23
00:00:47,603 --> 00:00:50,072
I want you to be scared,
not make puns.

30
00:01:05,888 --> 00:01:07,205
Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker.

31
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,673
For those of you who turned out

32
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:11,376
to see my stand-up comedy debut
at Zany's last night,

33
00:01:11,411 --> 00:01:14,246
I again apologize
for what I said about Moroccans.

34
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,647
But today's breaking news

35
00:01:15,681 --> 00:01:17,549
is that the New England Toy
and Game Company

36
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:20,218
has issued an immediate recall
of all of its stuffed bears,

37
00:01:20,253 --> 00:01:21,753
like the one shown here.

38
00:01:21,788 --> 00:01:23,855
The bear's eyes
can become easily detached

39
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,324
and pose a potential
choking hazard.

40
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:29,161
Oh, my God, that's the same
teddy bear Stewie has.

41
00:01:29,195 --> 00:01:31,146
We got to send that thing
back right away.

42
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,614
Boy, I wonder
if there's anything more

43
00:01:32,648 --> 00:01:34,166
on Channel Two about this.

44
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,968
Our top story, Channel Five
News anchor, Tom Tucker,

45
00:01:37,003 --> 00:01:40,005
has a meltdown
at a local comedy club.

46
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,923
Look at you, you fat,
gross Moroccans

47
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:44,176
with your ooga-booga food.

48
00:01:48,998 --> 00:01:51,666
Oh, my God, that
was amazing.

49
00:01:51,684 --> 00:01:53,635
I'm gonna have to
crawl to the bathroom.

50
00:01:53,669 --> 00:01:55,353
Yeah, that was incredible.

51
00:01:55,388 --> 00:01:57,255
It was the first time
I had an orgasm

52
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,857
out the front and back.

53
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:01,993
God, Peter, this voice of
yours is really something.

54
00:02:02,028 --> 00:02:03,812
Oh, I can't get
enough of it.

55
00:02:03,846 --> 00:02:05,347
Yeah, it's been pretty great.

56
00:02:05,381 --> 00:02:07,215
You know,
I even won a deep voice contest

57
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,134
with Joe yesterday.

58
00:02:11,988 --> 00:02:13,021
I heard you coming.

59
00:02:13,055 --> 00:02:14,222
I made myself heard.

60
00:02:14,257 --> 00:02:15,323
Where have you come from?

61
00:02:15,358 --> 00:02:16,591
I've come from
where I've been.

62
00:02:16,626 --> 00:02:18,360
You still riding with that
mangy polecat Fletcher?

63
00:02:18,394 --> 00:02:19,995
Fletcher met the
long arm of the law

64
00:02:20,029 --> 00:02:22,898
at the wrong end of a shotgun
and the deep end of a grave

65
00:02:22,932 --> 00:02:24,583
at the far end of
a dead-end road.

66
00:02:24,617 --> 00:02:26,618
Winner!

67
00:02:28,221 --> 00:02:29,838
Well, I should
probably get going.

68
00:02:29,872 --> 00:02:31,973
Me, Joe and Quagmire
are going bowling again.

69
00:02:32,008 --> 00:02:33,942
We got a big tournament
coming up next week.

70
00:02:33,976 --> 00:02:35,544
Well, hurry
back, handsome.

71
00:02:35,578 --> 00:02:37,596
Oh, Peter, this
is so much fun.

72
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,448
I feel like I have
a secret lover

73
00:02:39,482 --> 00:02:40,866
nobody else knows about.

74
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,601
Just like Carly Simon.

75
00:02:42,635 --> 00:02:44,503
Ms. Simon, enough
years have gone by

76
00:02:44,537 --> 00:02:46,838
since you wrote your classic
hit, "You're So Vain."

77
00:02:46,873 --> 00:02:48,740
Don't you think it's
time to tell the world

78
00:02:48,774 --> 00:02:50,609
who that song was
written about?

79
00:02:50,643 --> 00:02:54,329
No. That will always be a secret
between me and him.

80
00:02:54,363 --> 00:02:58,533
♪ You're so vain

81
00:02:58,568 --> 00:03:01,720
♪ You probably think this song
is about you ♪

82
00:03:01,754 --> 00:03:05,490
♪ You're so vain
♪ <i>You're so vain.</i> ♪

83
00:03:08,528 --> 00:03:09,911
Come on, Rupert, let's go.

84
00:03:09,929 --> 00:03:11,379
This is the first day
we're allowed

85
00:03:11,413 --> 00:03:12,597
to the end of the driveway,

86
00:03:12,632 --> 00:03:14,533
and I intend
to take full advantage.

87
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:16,485
Rupert?

88
00:03:18,254 --> 00:03:20,055
Rupert?

89
00:03:21,257 --> 00:03:22,507
Hey, what's going on?

90
00:03:22,542 --> 00:03:24,059
Brian, I can't find
Rupert anywhere.

91
00:03:24,093 --> 00:03:25,177
Have you seen him?

92
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:26,578
Oh, I thought Lois
would've told you.

93
00:03:26,612 --> 00:03:28,113
She sent him back
to the factory.

94
00:03:28,147 --> 00:03:29,314
What? Why?!

95
00:03:29,365 --> 00:03:30,845
She was afraid he
was gonna choke you.

96
00:03:30,867 --> 00:03:32,050
Oh, that was
a game we played.

97
00:03:32,084 --> 00:03:33,804
Believe me,
I was in control the whole time.

98
00:03:33,836 --> 00:03:35,237
No, the company
issued a recall.

99
00:03:35,271 --> 00:03:36,621
But don't worry, they
sent a replacement.

100
00:03:36,656 --> 00:03:37,806
Here, the guy just
delivered it.

101
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,940
Replacement?

102
00:03:40,943 --> 00:03:42,611
What the hell is this?

103
00:03:42,645 --> 00:03:45,046
What? Come on,
he's a cute little giraffe.

104
00:03:45,081 --> 00:03:47,132
Maybe you could call him,
like, Gizmo or something.

105
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,850
Oh, look, he can fly.

106
00:03:48,885 --> 00:03:50,685
Whoosh.

107
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,953
I hate him.

108
00:03:51,988 --> 00:03:53,939
His mouth is always open
like P. Diddy.

109
00:03:53,973 --> 00:03:55,140
Well, what do you mean?

110
00:03:55,174 --> 00:03:57,209
You ever notice how
in every photo of P. Diddy,

111
00:03:57,243 --> 00:03:58,727
his mouth is hanging open?

112
00:03:58,761 --> 00:04:01,346
Well, actually, Diddy hired a
guy to close his mouth for him.

113
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,965
I'm telling you, this kid
is the next Justin Bieber.

114
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,201
Young girls love him, but
he makes real music that...

115
00:04:06,235 --> 00:04:07,385
Sorry I'm late.

116
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,687
Traffic.

117
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:13,558
Good morning, Lois!

118
00:04:13,593 --> 00:04:15,026
How's it going, Brian?

119
00:04:15,061 --> 00:04:17,279
Peter, what happened
to your voice?

120
00:04:17,313 --> 00:04:18,847
Oh, ho, ho.

121
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:21,116
You know what happened,
you sexy minx.

122
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,552
My white blood cells
attacked the pathogens

123
00:04:23,586 --> 00:04:25,754
and created antibodies,
and then the pathogens

124
00:04:25,788 --> 00:04:28,056
were filtered out
by my kidneys into my urine

125
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,875
and then expelled from my body,
you slut.

126
00:04:30,927 --> 00:04:32,360
Peter, not now.

127
00:04:32,395 --> 00:04:33,461
What the hell, Lois?

128
00:04:33,496 --> 00:04:34,763
Yesterday you were
all over me.

129
00:04:34,797 --> 00:04:37,132
And then, for a confusing
period, inside of me.

130
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:40,001
I had no control over what
I did yesterday, Peter.

131
00:04:40,036 --> 00:04:41,770
I mean, I'm glad
you're feeling better,

132
00:04:41,804 --> 00:04:44,706
but, boy, that sick
voice of yours was hot.

133
00:04:46,075 --> 00:04:47,375
Damn it,
this sucks, Brian.

134
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,910
I was getting laid
left and right.

135
00:04:48,945 --> 00:04:51,162
Yeah, sounds like being sick
was really working for you.

136
00:04:51,197 --> 00:04:52,948
Well, you know
what I got to do?

137
00:04:52,982 --> 00:04:55,717
I got to make myself sick again
and get that voice back.

138
00:04:55,751 --> 00:04:57,485
Peter, that might
be the worst idea

139
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,004
anyone has ever had.

140
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:00,272
Well, you're wrong there.

141
00:05:00,306 --> 00:05:02,907
The worst idea anyone ever had
was silver bullets.

142
00:05:02,942 --> 00:05:06,144
Barbara Liebowitz's husband just
bought her a diamond brooch.

143
00:05:06,178 --> 00:05:08,096
You know how he
afforded that?

144
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,431
He uses regular bullets.

145
00:05:09,465 --> 00:05:11,600
He uses regular bullets.

146
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:16,972
Meg, have you seen Dad?

147
00:05:17,006 --> 00:05:18,406
Yeah, he's at the dentist.

148
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:19,874
He's trying to get sick.

149
00:05:22,111 --> 00:05:24,596
Okay, go ahead
and spit.

150
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,748
It's okay, go ahead.

151
00:05:28,618 --> 00:05:29,884
All right, Chris,

152
00:05:29,902 --> 00:05:31,686
I figured out a great
way to get sick.

153
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:35,140
I'm gonna be a woman at work
who cannot get sick right now.

154
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:38,159
Sweetie, maybe you
need to go home.

155
00:05:38,194 --> 00:05:39,277
I'm not going home.

156
00:05:39,328 --> 00:05:40,728
I cannot get sick right now.

157
00:05:40,746 --> 00:05:42,197
I have way too much to do.

158
00:05:42,231 --> 00:05:44,032
It's okay, everyone
will understand.

159
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:46,217
No. I cannot get sick
right now.

160
00:05:46,252 --> 00:05:48,119
There's Kendra's birthday
and the baby shower,

161
00:05:48,154 --> 00:05:50,488
and with this move, I-I just
cannot get sick right now.

162
00:05:50,523 --> 00:05:51,906
I have to finish typing this...

163
00:05:51,924 --> 00:05:53,241
typing this...

164
00:05:54,527 --> 00:05:56,928
That's it; I'm
taking you home.

165
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,714
You did this to me!

166
00:06:01,517 --> 00:06:02,717
Miss Lohan!
Lindsay!

167
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,969
Over here, Lindsay!

168
00:06:05,021 --> 00:06:07,589
Excuse me, which one was
Lindsay Lohan's dessert fork?

169
00:06:07,623 --> 00:06:09,624
I think it
was that one.

170
00:06:11,727 --> 00:06:14,329
Give me cocaine!

171
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:19,501
The History Channel presents

172
00:06:19,535 --> 00:06:22,037
<i>Where in World War Two</i>
<i>is Waldo?</i>

173
00:06:26,475 --> 00:06:28,543
Do I sound sexy?

174
00:06:28,577 --> 00:06:30,645
Tell me I sound sexy.

175
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,247
Peter, what the hell?
You look terrible.

176
00:06:32,281 --> 00:06:33,698
Clear off the couch, kids.

177
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:35,767
I'm gonna do your mother
right here.

178
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,937
Oh, my God, Peter!

179
00:06:38,971 --> 00:06:40,538
Oh, I'm leaving.

180
00:06:40,573 --> 00:06:42,390
I cannot get
sick right now.

181
00:06:48,614 --> 00:06:51,383
Dr. Hartman,
is Peter gonna be okay?

182
00:06:51,384 --> 00:06:53,885
If one more person
asks me about a patient today,

183
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,921
I'm gonna scream.

184
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,657
What time is it?

185
00:06:58,691 --> 00:07:00,008
Peter, what are you doing?

186
00:07:00,042 --> 00:07:01,309
Get back in bed.

187
00:07:01,344 --> 00:07:02,511
I can't, Lois.

188
00:07:02,545 --> 00:07:04,212
I got the bowling
tournament this afternoon.

189
00:07:04,247 --> 00:07:06,047
Quagmire and Joe
are counting on me.

190
00:07:06,082 --> 00:07:07,616
Forget about bowling, Peter.

191
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,050
You're very sick.

192
00:07:09,085 --> 00:07:10,452
You're not going anywhere.

193
00:07:10,486 --> 00:07:12,554
But if I don't go,
we'll have to forfeit.

194
00:07:12,588 --> 00:07:15,490
I'm sorry, but you need
to stay here and get better.

195
00:07:15,525 --> 00:07:17,893
Well, then, you're gonna
have to bowl for me.

196
00:07:17,927 --> 00:07:19,344
What?

197
00:07:19,378 --> 00:07:21,146
Peter, I haven't bowled
since college.

198
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,998
Please, you got to do
me this favor, Lois.

199
00:07:23,032 --> 00:07:25,901
You owe me from when I took you
to see Shakespeare in the Park,

200
00:07:25,935 --> 00:07:27,702
even though it was
the part of the park

201
00:07:27,737 --> 00:07:29,237
where the gay guys
go to have sex.

202
00:07:29,272 --> 00:07:31,406
To be, or not to be...

203
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,874
Aah!

204
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:34,242
Aah! Right there!

205
00:07:34,277 --> 00:07:36,244
Ignore that;
that's not part of the play.

206
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:38,146
That is the question.

207
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:39,514
Whether 'tis nobler...

208
00:07:39,549 --> 00:07:41,216
This isn't
love, by the way.

209
00:07:44,921 --> 00:07:46,822
Brian, get your keys.

210
00:07:46,873 --> 00:07:48,590
I need you to drive me
to that toy factory

211
00:07:48,624 --> 00:07:49,891
so I can get Rupert back.

212
00:07:49,926 --> 00:07:52,027
Stewie, Lois sent him back
'cause he's not safe.

213
00:07:52,061 --> 00:07:53,595
But, Brian, I miss him!

214
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:55,297
Without Rupert, I...

215
00:07:55,331 --> 00:07:57,599
Are you watching
porn in the kitchen?

216
00:07:57,633 --> 00:07:59,384
Come on, man,
we eat in here.

217
00:07:59,418 --> 00:08:01,536
Anyway, I need you to
drive me to Middleborough.

218
00:08:01,571 --> 00:08:03,338
Middleborough? That's, like,
two hours from here.

219
00:08:03,372 --> 00:08:05,106
I'm not doing that.
Come on, Brian.

220
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:06,791
Tell you what, you drive
me to Middleborough,

221
00:08:06,826 --> 00:08:09,461
and I'll teach you my secret
to picking up chicks.

222
00:08:09,495 --> 00:08:11,129
Hey.

223
00:08:11,164 --> 00:08:12,998
You-me, ba-boom, huh?

224
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:18,770
Thanks for filling
in for Peter, Lois.

225
00:08:18,804 --> 00:08:20,655
Yeah, okay, but I hope
you brought it today,

226
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,051
'cause this ain't
no ladies' lunch.

227
00:08:22,058 --> 00:08:23,792
Well, I'll certainly do
the best I can.

228
00:08:23,826 --> 00:08:25,126
But don't worry, Glenn,

229
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:27,562
I'm one woman who knows
a thing or two about sports.

230
00:08:27,597 --> 00:08:28,997
Yeah, I know you think you are.

231
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:31,499
Your softball chatter
made that quite clear.

232
00:08:31,534 --> 00:08:33,835
Okay, that's two down, guys,
two outs.

233
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,420
Two out of the three outs
required.

234
00:08:35,454 --> 00:08:36,788
Okay, guys, let's go.

235
00:08:36,822 --> 00:08:38,273
Tom Brady is a quarterback.

236
00:08:38,307 --> 00:08:39,891
Okay, heads up, two down.

237
00:08:39,926 --> 00:08:41,626
College football is on Saturday.

238
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,111
Okay, come on, look alive.

239
00:08:43,145 --> 00:08:45,797
NBA players
are predominantly black.

240
00:08:45,831 --> 00:08:47,549
Oh, hi, Lois.

241
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:48,817
What are you doing here?

242
00:08:48,851 --> 00:08:50,018
I'm filling in
for Peter.

243
00:08:50,052 --> 00:08:51,119
He's sick.

244
00:08:51,153 --> 00:08:53,154
All right,
finally a little harpoon

245
00:08:53,189 --> 00:08:55,023
in the bowling alley.

246
00:08:55,057 --> 00:08:58,243
All right, what do you say
we get this thing started, huh?

247
00:09:02,198 --> 00:09:03,899
Nice roll, Lois!

248
00:09:03,933 --> 00:09:05,567
My God.

249
00:09:05,601 --> 00:09:08,169
If she chews gum,
she's got the whole package.

250
00:09:08,204 --> 00:09:09,754
Yes!
That's what I'm talking about!

251
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:11,156
Take that, you jagoffs!

252
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,390
I hope you die!

253
00:09:12,424 --> 00:09:14,759
God, Quagmire gets so
competitive with sports.

254
00:09:14,794 --> 00:09:16,428
Hey, Quagmire,
it's just a game.

255
00:09:16,462 --> 00:09:17,562
Ta it kesy.

256
00:09:17,597 --> 00:09:18,630
I'm not gonna take it easy!

257
00:09:18,664 --> 00:09:19,831
These guys are going down!

258
00:09:19,865 --> 00:09:22,217
You're going down
in front of all these people!

259
00:09:30,576 --> 00:09:32,777
All right, Lois,
it's all up to you.

260
00:09:32,812 --> 00:09:35,280
We only need six to
beat the Pinheads.

261
00:09:35,314 --> 00:09:36,648
And it would be four

262
00:09:36,682 --> 00:09:39,184
if someone could've hit
that seven-ten split, right?

263
00:09:39,218 --> 00:09:40,201
Joe!

264
00:09:40,236 --> 00:09:42,053
Joe, Joey, Joey,
Joey, Joe, Joey, Joe!

265
00:09:58,854 --> 00:10:00,155
Yes!
Yeah!

266
00:10:00,189 --> 00:10:01,923
Yeah! We did it!

267
00:10:03,092 --> 00:10:04,759
Oh, what's this?
What's this?

268
00:10:04,794 --> 00:10:06,111
It says right here we won!

269
00:10:06,145 --> 00:10:08,013
We won, you dicks!
You suck!

270
00:10:08,047 --> 00:10:10,348
Um, excuse me,
would you mind keeping it down?

271
00:10:10,383 --> 00:10:12,584
We're having my son's
birthday party over here.

272
00:10:12,618 --> 00:10:13,778
Yeah, sure, sure,
sure, honey.

273
00:10:13,786 --> 00:10:15,620
What's his name?
Mikey.

274
00:10:15,655 --> 00:10:18,039
Happy  birthday, Mikey!

275
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,291
Yeah!

276
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:24,529
Well, this is great.

277
00:10:24,563 --> 00:10:25,924
So when you guys
aren't celebrating

278
00:10:25,931 --> 00:10:28,199
a big bowling victory,
what do you normally do here?

279
00:10:28,234 --> 00:10:30,635
Uh, well,
sometimes we compare women.

280
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,620
Talk about who we'd rather
have sex with.

281
00:10:32,655 --> 00:10:33,855
Oh, that sounds fun.

282
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:35,190
How do you play?

283
00:10:35,224 --> 00:10:36,324
Well, it's like, um--

284
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:37,726
Okay, who would you rather do,

285
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,561
Kristen Stewart
or Scarlett Johansson?

286
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:41,696
Oh, definitely
Scarlett Johansson.

287
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:43,164
For one thing,
there's the boobs,

288
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:45,400
which Kristen Stewart
does not have.

289
00:10:45,434 --> 00:10:47,369
Also, I get the sense
that Kristen Stewart

290
00:10:47,403 --> 00:10:50,038
is more of a bath person
when she really needs a shower.

291
00:10:50,072 --> 00:10:51,639
She does seem
kind of dirty.

292
00:10:51,674 --> 00:10:53,842
Yeah, someone should write
"wash me"

293
00:10:53,876 --> 00:10:55,510
in the dust
on that flat ass.

294
00:10:55,544 --> 00:10:56,845
Ha!
Ho-ho!

295
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,513
Move over funnyman
Richard Lewis.

296
00:10:58,547 --> 00:11:00,582
We got Richard Lois!

297
00:11:05,571 --> 00:11:06,604
Well, here we are.

298
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:09,174
great.
Hey, may on the ride home,

299
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,775
someone else can tell
a story.

300
00:11:12,978 --> 00:11:14,846
So what exactly is
your plan here?

301
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,348
I've got it all
figured out, Brian.

302
00:11:16,382 --> 00:11:18,850
This tour will take us
deep into the factory,

303
00:11:18,884 --> 00:11:21,636
and when the time is right,
we'll slip away and find Rupert.

304
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,139
Does anyone have
any questions so far?

305
00:11:24,173 --> 00:11:25,523
Who's that up there?

306
00:11:25,557 --> 00:11:26,858
Oh, that's our gunman.

307
00:11:26,892 --> 00:11:29,394
Every once in a while,
one of our toys becomes real,

308
00:11:29,428 --> 00:11:31,596
and we have to make sure
it doesn't get out.

309
00:11:39,722 --> 00:11:43,041
Brian, look!
That must be where Rupert is!

310
00:11:45,728 --> 00:11:48,029
Rupert!
My God, you're all right!

311
00:11:48,064 --> 00:11:49,531
Oh, you missed so much!

312
00:11:49,565 --> 00:11:51,900
I had to deliver a speech
to Britain,

313
00:11:51,934 --> 00:11:54,519
and I overcame my stutter
through some pretty kooky means.

314
00:11:54,553 --> 00:11:55,954
Brian, don't say
anything.

315
00:11:55,988 --> 00:11:57,522
Uh, Stewie?

316
00:11:59,141 --> 00:12:00,742
Oh, crap.

317
00:12:00,776 --> 00:12:04,462
This is not the way out!
This is not the way out!

318
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,201
Hey, Horace, get that
wiener out of your hand

319
00:12:10,236 --> 00:12:12,237
and give us three more beers
over here!

320
00:12:12,271 --> 00:12:14,939
Lois, you're always
giving me the business.

321
00:12:16,826 --> 00:12:19,010
Hey, I meant
to tell you guys.

322
00:12:19,044 --> 00:12:20,845
We shot some drug dealer
this morning,

323
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,415
and he had three Red Sox
tickets in his pocket.

324
00:12:23,449 --> 00:12:24,416
That's awesome!

325
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,351
Oh, this'll be so fun!

326
00:12:26,385 --> 00:12:28,069
You know, if we leave
right now,

327
00:12:28,104 --> 00:12:30,655
we can probably still get there
before the first pitch.

328
00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:31,790
Hey, you guys.

329
00:12:31,824 --> 00:12:33,558
Oh, hey, Peter.
How's it going?

330
00:12:33,592 --> 00:12:35,727
Peter, it's so good
to see you up and around!

331
00:12:35,761 --> 00:12:37,395
Yeah, how ya feeling?

332
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,613
I'm feeling shipshape.

333
00:12:38,647 --> 00:12:40,548
If the ship is
the S.S. <i>Minnow!</i>

334
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,317
Doctor said I'd be
making bland jokes

335
00:12:42,351 --> 00:12:44,686
for about a week,
then I'd be good as new.

336
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,887
Ah, that's good to hear.

337
00:12:45,921 --> 00:12:48,356
Well, we were just on
our way up to Fenway.

338
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,724
Aw, you got tickets?
That's sweet.

339
00:12:49,758 --> 00:12:51,192
You know, there's
no better outing

340
00:12:51,227 --> 00:12:53,361
than watching
nine innings.

341
00:12:54,463 --> 00:12:56,030
Sorry, I'll perk up
at the game.

342
00:12:56,065 --> 00:12:58,600
Oh, well, actually,
we only have three tickets,

343
00:12:58,634 --> 00:13:00,001
and we're going with Lois.

344
00:13:00,035 --> 00:13:01,336
With Lois?

345
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,637
Oh, yeah, we've actually been

346
00:13:02,671 --> 00:13:04,005
having a great time with her.

347
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:05,507
And she's quite
a bowler, too.

348
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:06,708
Is that all right,
Peter?

349
00:13:06,742 --> 00:13:09,511
Do you mind if I go
to the game with the guys?

350
00:13:09,545 --> 00:13:10,645
Yeah, no, that's,
that's fine.

351
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:12,680
I mean, yeah, you only
got three tickets.

352
00:13:12,715 --> 00:13:14,215
I mean, that's cool.
Have fun.

353
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,950
Okay, we'll see you later.

354
00:13:17,786 --> 00:13:19,354
Hey, Horace,

355
00:13:19,388 --> 00:13:21,473
why don't you take that
wiener out of your hand

356
00:13:21,507 --> 00:13:22,640
and get me a beer.

357
00:13:22,675 --> 00:13:25,126
Don't talk to me that way,
you son of a bitch!

358
00:13:32,852 --> 00:13:33,819
Oh, hey, Peter!

359
00:13:33,853 --> 00:13:34,853
Oh, hey.

360
00:13:34,887 --> 00:13:36,521
Did you have fun
at the game?

361
00:13:36,556 --> 00:13:38,056
Oh, yeah,
it was so exciting.

362
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:40,392
They scored the winning hit
right at the buzzer.

363
00:13:40,426 --> 00:13:41,660
I'm sorry you missed it.

364
00:13:41,694 --> 00:13:43,195
Yeah, no,
th-that's okay.

365
00:13:43,229 --> 00:13:46,031
I've just been hanging out here
having a great time with...

366
00:13:46,065 --> 00:13:47,299
Meg?!
Hey.

367
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,734
I thought you was a bag
of peeling potatoes.

368
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:51,236
Well, maybe next time
you can come

369
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,271
with us when we go
to Red Sock Field.

370
00:13:53,306 --> 00:13:54,873
Nobody calls it that.

371
00:13:54,907 --> 00:13:58,076
Quags and Swanny were so funny
yelling things at the visitors.

372
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,177
Quags and Swanny?!

373
00:13:59,212 --> 00:14:00,979
Lois, it's one thing
to steal my friends,

374
00:14:01,013 --> 00:14:02,998
but don't go giving them
stupid new nicknames.

375
00:14:03,032 --> 00:14:04,316
What are you
talking about?

376
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,917
I didn't steal
your friends, Peter.

377
00:14:05,952 --> 00:14:08,220
I'm only doing
what you asked me to do.

378
00:14:08,254 --> 00:14:10,322
No, I asked you
to take my place

379
00:14:10,356 --> 00:14:12,224
at the bowling
tournament, that's it!

380
00:14:12,258 --> 00:14:13,658
Look, Lois, I have
my friends,

381
00:14:13,693 --> 00:14:14,926
and you have groceries

382
00:14:14,961 --> 00:14:16,928
and all those rusty
pink razors in the shower.

383
00:14:16,963 --> 00:14:18,897
Now just stick to what's
intended for you

384
00:14:18,931 --> 00:14:20,232
and leave my
things to me.

385
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:21,700
Are you saying
you want me

386
00:14:21,734 --> 00:14:23,702
to stop hanging out
with Joe and Quagmire?

387
00:14:23,736 --> 00:14:25,437
They're <i>my</i> friends.
They're all I got!

388
00:14:25,471 --> 00:14:27,205
And you know
how hard it is

389
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,707
for me to make
new friends.

390
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,848
Is this friends?

391
00:14:41,704 --> 00:14:43,138
Stewie, we're never
gonna find him.

392
00:14:43,172 --> 00:14:44,639
They're all
exactly the same.

393
00:14:44,674 --> 00:14:48,009
Wow. I wish you could hear how
racist you sound right now.

394
00:14:48,044 --> 00:14:49,311
Come on. Can't you give

395
00:14:49,345 --> 00:14:50,979
that giraffe at home
another chance?

396
00:14:51,013 --> 00:14:52,681
You know, for every one
they sell,

397
00:14:52,715 --> 00:14:54,449
they save a giraffe
in the wild.

398
00:14:56,502 --> 00:15:00,305
Sorry, giraffes!
They only bought one!

399
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:02,791
Nah, they returned it!

400
00:15:06,612 --> 00:15:08,446
And so Lois sweet-talks
her way backstage.

401
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:09,814
Next thing you know,

402
00:15:09,849 --> 00:15:11,716
we're partying all night
with the trapeze people!

403
00:15:11,751 --> 00:15:13,552
One of them drives a Volvo!

404
00:15:13,586 --> 00:15:16,121
Drives a super-safe car,
does <i>that</i> for a living!

405
00:15:16,155 --> 00:15:17,155
Go figure!

406
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,393
So what? She can name
a kind of car.

407
00:15:21,427 --> 00:15:23,228
Big whoop.
I can do that, too.

408
00:15:23,262 --> 00:15:24,329
Vikki.

409
00:15:24,363 --> 00:15:25,597
Vikki Carr.

410
00:15:25,631 --> 00:15:27,265
Peter, relax.
It just happens

411
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,467
that your wife has some
funny stories, that's all.

412
00:15:29,502 --> 00:15:31,870
Well, I got some
funny stories.

413
00:15:31,904 --> 00:15:34,139
I knew a guy
who choked on an almond.

414
00:15:34,173 --> 00:15:35,473
And he had a stroke.

415
00:15:35,508 --> 00:15:37,809
Now he can't take care
of his own bathroom needs.

416
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:40,929
That's not funny.
That sounds sad.

417
00:15:40,963 --> 00:15:42,464
Yeah, I feel
bad for him.

418
00:15:42,498 --> 00:15:43,932
Oh, don't feel bad
for him.

419
00:15:43,966 --> 00:15:45,533
He got his name
in the paper.

420
00:15:45,568 --> 00:15:47,819
What?

421
00:15:47,853 --> 00:15:49,454
Please look at me!

422
00:15:49,488 --> 00:15:51,089
What the hell's wrong
with you, Peter?

423
00:15:51,123 --> 00:15:53,003
Nothing. What the hell's
wrong with you, Swanny?

424
00:15:53,025 --> 00:15:54,326
I'm Quags.

425
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,262
I don't know
who any of you are anymore!

426
00:15:57,296 --> 00:15:58,964
Oh, he's really upset.

427
00:15:58,998 --> 00:16:00,632
I haven't seen him like this

428
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,667
since he saw
that Rocky Dennis movie.

429
00:16:02,702 --> 00:16:06,254
Take off the mask!
That's your problem!

430
00:16:06,289 --> 00:16:07,489
Right?

431
00:16:11,661 --> 00:16:14,045
That's it, Brian.
He's not here.

432
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,947
None of these
bears are Rupert.

433
00:16:15,982 --> 00:16:17,282
Stewie...

434
00:16:17,316 --> 00:16:20,218
You don't have
to say it, Brian. I know.

435
00:16:21,504 --> 00:16:24,673
So this is what it feels
like to be a grown-up, huh?

436
00:16:24,707 --> 00:16:26,741
All alone in the world.

437
00:16:26,776 --> 00:16:29,945
Look, Stewie,
nothing lasts forever.

438
00:16:29,979 --> 00:16:32,347
You and Rupert had
some special times together,

439
00:16:32,381 --> 00:16:33,882
and you'll always have that.

440
00:16:35,117 --> 00:16:36,584
What the deuce?
What's that noise?

441
00:16:36,619 --> 00:16:37,619
I don't know.

442
00:16:47,346 --> 00:16:49,664
Oh, my God!
Brian, look!

443
00:16:52,935 --> 00:16:54,085
That's him!
That's Rupert!

444
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,553
How do you know?

445
00:16:55,588 --> 00:16:57,188
You can't hear
him calling me?

446
00:16:57,223 --> 00:16:58,657
He's calling me,
clear as day!

447
00:16:58,691 --> 00:17:00,458
Ah. Yeah,
now I hear him.

448
00:17:00,493 --> 00:17:02,861
Rupert, yes, we're here
to rescue you!

449
00:17:02,895 --> 00:17:04,212
Stewie, wait!
It's too dangerous!

450
00:17:04,246 --> 00:17:06,414
I won't let it end
like this, Brian!

451
00:17:21,263 --> 00:17:23,214
Don't you give up on me, Rupert!

452
00:17:23,265 --> 00:17:24,933
Hang on, Stewie!
Maybe I can help!

453
00:17:24,967 --> 00:17:26,334
Maybe I can use this helicopter

454
00:17:26,352 --> 00:17:28,053
to knock Rupert off
the conveyor belt...

455
00:17:28,104 --> 00:17:29,504
Ah! Son of a bitch!

456
00:17:29,538 --> 00:17:31,222
Recall room, Brian.
Nothing works in here.

457
00:17:31,273 --> 00:17:32,891
Now come on!
Rupert's in trouble!

458
00:17:32,942 --> 00:17:34,893
Okay, I'm coming, I'm coming.

459
00:17:42,568 --> 00:17:44,786
Almost there.
You can do this, Stewie.

460
00:18:02,871 --> 00:18:05,090
♪

461
00:18:25,511 --> 00:18:26,244
Damn it!

462
00:18:26,278 --> 00:18:29,247
Brian, do something!

463
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,469
Oh, Rupert!
Thank God, you're alive!

464
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,688
I'm... I'm ready now.

465
00:18:53,722 --> 00:18:55,690
I'm ready to get off the pill.

466
00:18:55,724 --> 00:18:58,759
I think we should start trying.

467
00:19:02,348 --> 00:19:04,249
Look, Peter, I think
there's something

468
00:19:04,283 --> 00:19:05,817
we should talk about.

469
00:19:05,851 --> 00:19:08,219
I'm not reading the last page
of that dinosaur book.

470
00:19:08,254 --> 00:19:10,088
I know something bad
happens to 'em.

471
00:19:10,122 --> 00:19:11,689
No, Peter, we need
to talk about

472
00:19:11,724 --> 00:19:13,091
this situation
with the guys.

473
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:16,611
Look, of course I like hanging
out with Joe and Quagmire.

474
00:19:16,629 --> 00:19:19,447
But I like hanging out
with you more.

475
00:19:19,465 --> 00:19:22,750
I mean, it's nice to make
new friends, but not if it means

476
00:19:22,784 --> 00:19:25,086
losing the best friend
I've ever had.

477
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,405
Yeah, well, I was
probably kind of a jerk, too.

478
00:19:27,439 --> 00:19:29,641
I guess I shouldn't be
telling you who you can

479
00:19:29,675 --> 00:19:31,142
and can't be
friends with.

480
00:19:33,078 --> 00:19:34,312
Hey, you guys want to go

481
00:19:34,346 --> 00:19:36,164
with me and Joe
to the roller derby?

482
00:19:36,198 --> 00:19:38,133
It's great. You get
to see big, husky chicks

483
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:39,884
elbow each other
right in the jugs.

484
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,186
Oh, that sounds like fun.

485
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,453
Yeah, and I'm bringing
my grill

486
00:19:42,488 --> 00:19:45,240
so we can eat corn in the
parking lot before we go in.

487
00:19:45,274 --> 00:19:46,457
What do you say?
Who's in?

488
00:19:46,492 --> 00:19:47,458
Sounds great!

489
00:19:47,493 --> 00:19:49,377
Yeah, that'll be really...

490
00:19:52,248 --> 00:19:53,581
You know what, you guys?

491
00:19:53,616 --> 00:19:55,950
I think I'm gonna
just stay in tonight.

492
00:19:55,985 --> 00:19:58,586
I got a huge stack
of coupons to go through.

493
00:19:58,621 --> 00:20:00,788
Plus, I'm planning on having
my period really hard later,

494
00:20:00,823 --> 00:20:03,491
and I want to be
in the tub when it happens.

495
00:20:03,526 --> 00:20:05,360
You what?!
Gross.

496
00:20:05,394 --> 00:20:06,711
Oh, I get it.

497
00:20:06,745 --> 00:20:08,580
Guys, I think Lois
is getting a visit

498
00:20:08,614 --> 00:20:09,848
from her Aunt Period.

499
00:20:09,882 --> 00:20:11,583
Yeah, and lots
of other chick stuff

500
00:20:11,617 --> 00:20:13,801
you guys wouldn't be
interested in.

501
00:20:13,835 --> 00:20:17,288
Peter, go have fun
with your friends.

502
00:20:17,323 --> 00:20:19,357
Thanks, Lois.

503
00:20:22,728 --> 00:20:25,730
Oh, hey, Brian.
Where have you been?

504
00:20:25,764 --> 00:20:27,465
Oh, just reuniting
some old friends.

505
00:20:27,499 --> 00:20:28,783
Huh. Me, too.

506
00:20:28,817 --> 00:20:30,518
Feels good, doesn't it?

507
00:20:30,553 --> 00:20:32,220
Sure does.

508
00:20:33,589 --> 00:20:34,923
I love you, Rupert.

509
00:20:34,957 --> 00:20:36,925
Don't you ever leave me again.

510

511
00:20:46,402 --> 00:20:49,170
Mom, Stewie's dead!
