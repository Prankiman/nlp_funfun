00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,136
- Peter, did you brush your teeth?
- Nah.

4
00:00:36,152 --> 00:00:38,265
- Peter, brush your teeth.
- I don't want to.

5
00:00:38,282 --> 00:00:40,849
- Peter, brush your teeth.
- No, it's stupid.

6
00:00:40,864 --> 00:00:43,141
Well, I guess we're going to
have to do this the hard way.

7
00:00:43,152 --> 00:00:44,486
- No!
- Open your mouth.

8
00:00:46,216 --> 00:00:48,029
Show me your teeth!

9
00:00:48,397 --> 00:00:49,863
Peter, did you hear that?

10
00:00:56,862 --> 00:00:59,461
Oh, my God, there are men
breaking into our house.

11
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:01,393
Dad, what is it?
What's going on?

12
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:03,594
I heard a noise.
Is somebody downstairs?

13
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:06,630
Oh, God, Meg, you startled me.
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:06,658 --> 00:01:08,913
What the hell's your
problem, you dumbass?

15
00:01:08,926 --> 00:01:10,482
What the deuce is all the commotion?

16
00:01:10,635 --> 00:01:12,333
Quick, everyone get in the attic.

17
00:01:16,596 --> 00:01:17,913
Peter, what is that?

18
00:01:18,948 --> 00:01:20,950
Well, I got the idea
to build a panic room

19
00:01:20,967 --> 00:01:23,261
after I saw that movie
The Butterfly Effect.

20
00:01:23,428 --> 00:01:25,631
I thought, "Wow, this is terrible.

21
00:01:25,695 --> 00:01:28,861
I wish I could escape to a place
where this movie couldn't find me,"

22
00:01:28,898 --> 00:01:31,251
- and then...
- What the hell are we waiting for?!

23
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:36,140
These monitors are for
watching the house.

24
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:38,853
See, there's Stewie's room,
Chris' room, Meg's room...

25
00:01:38,876 --> 00:01:41,391
Peter, there's no phone in here.
How are we going to call the police?

26
00:01:41,406 --> 00:01:43,022
Oh, my God, we're all going to die!

27
00:01:43,045 --> 00:01:45,642
That's not true. We'll survive
by eating each other.

28
00:01:45,676 --> 00:01:48,390
But I think it's important for
the last one of us left alive

29
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:49,671
to know this story.

30
00:01:49,696 --> 00:01:52,603
The story of the Griffin family history.

31
00:01:52,637 --> 00:01:54,340
Here's how it all began.

32
00:01:54,376 --> 00:01:56,763
<i>Everything started with the big bang.</i>

33
00:01:56,785 --> 00:01:58,072
<i>It was a Saturday night</i>

34
00:01:58,096 --> 00:02:00,720
<i>and God and his roommate
Chugs were arm wrestling.</i>

35
00:02:01,466 --> 00:02:03,151
You're going down, man.

36
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,353
Oh, dude, that is sick.

37
00:02:07,376 --> 00:02:09,073
Undefeated!

38
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:11,741
Oh, wait, wait, here comes another one.
Quick, give me your lighter.

39
00:02:18,826 --> 00:02:22,662
<i>Then over millions of years
evolution took its course.</i>

40
00:02:30,788 --> 00:02:33,151
<i>Of course, I'm obligated
by the State of Kansas</i>

41
00:02:33,178 --> 00:02:36,100
<i>to present the church's alternative
to the theory of evolution.</i>

42
00:02:50,697 --> 00:02:53,070
<i>After that, a meteor hit the Earth</i>

43
00:02:53,095 --> 00:02:55,300
<i>turning it into a block
of ice for some reason,</i>

44
00:02:55,325 --> 00:02:57,961
<i>but then it thawed and cavemen came.</i>

45
00:03:00,207 --> 00:03:01,740
Why Peter look sad?

46
00:03:01,757 --> 00:03:03,621
Brian, Peter invent wheel.

47
00:03:03,648 --> 00:03:06,751
Peter show wheel to people in town,
but no one want wheel.

48
00:03:06,785 --> 00:03:08,793
Everyone excited about trapezoid.

49
00:03:08,817 --> 00:03:10,073
No one buy wheel.

50
00:03:10,095 --> 00:03:11,593
Peter, you invent wheel?

51
00:03:11,627 --> 00:03:14,161
That big breakthrough.
This maybe make you millionaire.

52
00:03:14,186 --> 00:03:16,340
Then how come no one buy Peter wheel?

53
00:03:16,368 --> 00:03:18,861
Maybe sales pitch not good enough.
Brian help.

54
00:03:21,817 --> 00:03:23,942
Okay, sell wheel just like practice.

55
00:03:23,967 --> 00:03:26,931
- Not sure can do it.
- You so money. Don't know it.

56
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:30,111
Hi, me Peter.
Tired walking everyplace?

57
00:03:30,138 --> 00:03:31,822
Need something make you go?

58
00:03:31,847 --> 00:03:33,510
Peter wheel make you go.

59
00:03:33,536 --> 00:03:35,792
Maybe Joe want try wheel on chair.

60
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:37,822
For last time, Joe no want.

61
00:03:41,477 --> 00:03:43,541
Brian, Peter fail again.

62
00:03:43,566 --> 00:03:46,061
Not so fast.
Brian have other idea.

63
00:03:46,805 --> 00:03:49,700
Anyone buy wheel get dead bird.

64
00:03:51,217 --> 00:03:53,310
Not working.
Try drastic measure.

65
00:03:53,617 --> 00:03:55,280
Brian, what hell?!

66
00:03:55,315 --> 00:03:58,073
Hot lady next to wheel...

67
00:03:58,096 --> 00:04:00,750
Maybe if me buy wheel,

68
00:04:00,777 --> 00:04:01,861
I buy wheel.

69
00:04:03,888 --> 00:04:06,870
People want Peter wheel
thanks to sexy wife.

70
00:04:06,906 --> 00:04:09,583
Tonight you and me party like it's 9.

71
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,661
Damn all.
What deuce?

72
00:04:12,688 --> 00:04:14,121
Victory's Stewie's.

73
00:04:14,277 --> 00:04:16,860
There have been many great
Griffins through out history,

74
00:04:16,887 --> 00:04:20,261
including Moses Griffin who
led the Jews out of Egypt.

75
00:04:22,376 --> 00:04:24,673
All right, it's going to be
a long journey everyone,

76
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:26,631
but I will lead you to freedom.

77
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,801
Now, Jews, ho!

78
00:04:32,837 --> 00:04:34,780
Here we are, the Red Sea.

79
00:04:34,806 --> 00:04:36,631
Now, we got to do is swim across.

80
00:04:36,647 --> 00:04:39,280
- I didn't bring my trunks.
- I don't want to step on on a shell.

81
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:42,721
- I can't get water in my ears.
- I ate 20 minutes ago.

82
00:04:42,737 --> 00:04:45,542
You know, what they flush
in Cairo ends up right here.

83
00:04:45,996 --> 00:04:48,372
All right, I'll see what I can do.

84
00:04:55,945 --> 00:04:57,852
Oh, I can part the Red Sea.

85
00:04:57,877 --> 00:05:00,781
You know he hasn't talked
to his brother in three years.

86
00:05:03,187 --> 00:05:05,140
All right, listen up.
Before we go any further,

87
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:07,063
I'm going to lay down
a few rules, all right?

88
00:05:07,086 --> 00:05:09,311
Commandment number one:
"Shut the hell up. "

89
00:05:09,337 --> 00:05:12,841
Commandment number two: "There's
nothing I can do about the sun. "

90
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,750
Commandment number three:
"There are no more Jolly Ranchers,

91
00:05:15,777 --> 00:05:16,943
they're all gone. "

92
00:05:16,976 --> 00:05:19,531
Commandment number four:
"When we pass a billboard,

93
00:05:19,557 --> 00:05:22,912
please don't read it out loud. " All
right? Now, come on, let's get going.

94
00:05:26,116 --> 00:05:29,481
Ooh, look at that.
"Danny Gans, Entertainer of the Year. "

95
00:05:29,506 --> 00:05:30,870
What did I say?!

96
00:05:31,018 --> 00:05:32,960
- "Hassle Free Checking. "
- Damn it!

97
00:05:32,986 --> 00:05:35,440
- "Mancow in the Morning. "
- Shut up!

98
00:05:35,895 --> 00:05:38,112
Peter, can we stop the
stories for a minute?

99
00:05:38,147 --> 00:05:40,212
We need to figure out
how we're going to survive.

100
00:05:40,246 --> 00:05:42,161
I mean, is there even any food in here?

101
00:05:42,198 --> 00:05:44,721
Right, good thinking.
Meg, go get us some sandwiches.

102
00:05:44,758 --> 00:05:47,511
Wait a minute, that's a great idea.
If Meg can get through the vent,

103
00:05:47,536 --> 00:05:50,681
- she can sneak out and go get help.
- Dad, I can't go through the vent.

104
00:05:50,698 --> 00:05:53,363
Yeah, she's right. We need to grease
her up so she doesn't get stuck.

105
00:05:53,378 --> 00:05:54,763
Everybody spit on Meg.

106
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,011
Stop! Stop!

107
00:05:56,346 --> 00:05:57,802
Stop! Okay! Okay!

108
00:05:57,826 --> 00:06:01,023
I meant I can't do it because
there are burglars down there.

109
00:06:01,035 --> 00:06:03,651
Come on, they're not going to
touch you. You're covered with spit.

110
00:06:03,668 --> 00:06:05,171
Be careful, Meg.

111
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:09,132
I hate you all!

112
00:06:09,165 --> 00:06:10,652
I hate you, too, bitch.

113
00:06:10,685 --> 00:06:12,703
Oh, no, no, I'm just kidding.
Can you imagine?

114
00:06:15,995 --> 00:06:18,152
You think Meg made it through the vent?

115
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:19,573
Well, let's find out.

116
00:06:21,216 --> 00:06:22,822
Oh, there she is.
She's in the kitchen.

117
00:06:22,857 --> 00:06:25,851
Hey, Meg.
I see you there in the kitchen.

118
00:06:25,876 --> 00:06:27,862
Put my sandwich on
whole wheat please.

119
00:06:27,895 --> 00:06:30,513
No, no, no, don't use that mustard.
Use the other mustard.

120
00:06:30,685 --> 00:06:32,341
Oh, God, Meg, they know you're there.

121
00:06:32,378 --> 00:06:34,553
Quick, scrape that mustard off.
Use the other mustard!

122
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:37,802
Oh, no. The burglars got my baby.

123
00:06:38,848 --> 00:06:41,661
I think they're making a
sign to tell us something.

124
00:06:41,695 --> 00:06:43,631
Better not be using my crayons...

125
00:06:43,675 --> 00:06:44,872
mixing 'em up.

126
00:06:46,408 --> 00:06:48,202
"We have your son"?

127
00:06:48,235 --> 00:06:49,892
Meg's our daughter.

128
00:06:53,175 --> 00:06:54,742
Peter, do something!

129
00:06:54,778 --> 00:06:58,501
You know, Meg being captured by
evil men reminds me of another story.

130
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,462
It's distracting.
Um...

131
00:07:00,495 --> 00:07:03,501
This is the story of my
ancestor Nate Griffin.

132
00:07:03,537 --> 00:07:05,833
Of course, Nate Griffin
was his slave name.

133
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,963
His real name was Richard Bachman.

134
00:07:07,986 --> 00:07:10,870
And this is the story of his roots.

135
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:15,782
<i>It all began in Africa in the
tiny village of Quahog-swana</i>

136
00:07:15,806 --> 00:07:19,410
<i>where he was a proud member
of the tribe of Tootie-an-Blair.</i>

137
00:07:19,538 --> 00:07:21,982
Hey, Quagdingo, how was
your date last night?

138
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,831
Oh, it was awesome. You never
feel as big as you do with a pygmy.

139
00:07:24,855 --> 00:07:27,862
Hey, you guys want to
go get a drink at Club 227?

140
00:07:27,886 --> 00:07:30,613
Not today, Joemama.
I'm going off to find a log

141
00:07:30,646 --> 00:07:33,653
to build a drum so I can play the
opening part from "Hot For Teacher. "

142
00:07:33,675 --> 00:07:34,980
I'll see you guys later.

143
00:07:35,012 --> 00:07:37,481
Coming up in this half hour,
flies on your face

144
00:07:37,508 --> 00:07:38,883
how many is too many?

145
00:07:38,897 --> 00:07:42,034
But first, that orange thing in the sky
and what you can do to please it.

146
00:07:46,838 --> 00:07:48,993
You know, you shouldn't be
poking around out here.

147
00:07:49,005 --> 00:07:50,793
White men have been spotted nearby

148
00:07:50,816 --> 00:07:54,463
laying traps and forming
slow-pitch softball leagues.

149
00:07:54,485 --> 00:07:57,922
Well, whatever makes them happy.
Live and let live, that's what I say.

150
00:07:57,946 --> 00:07:59,743
And I'm sure that's what they say, too.

151
00:07:59,768 --> 00:08:03,120
Hello. I'm Cleveland
from South Carolina.

152
00:08:03,157 --> 00:08:04,892
Wow, you're a different color than me.

153
00:08:04,926 --> 00:08:06,482
Would you like to be equals?

154
00:08:12,788 --> 00:08:15,431
Hey, Quagdingo, you want
to play I-Spy again?

155
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,952
- No!
- I spy something beige.

156
00:08:17,978 --> 00:08:19,430
- Wood.
- Yeah.

157
00:08:19,497 --> 00:08:22,342
Hello and welcome to the
news at what I suspect is dawn.

158
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:26,152
Our top story continues to be
where is this giant canoe heading?

159
00:08:26,187 --> 00:08:29,353
But first let's go to Ollie Williams
with the port side window report.

160
00:08:29,377 --> 00:08:30,660
- Ollie?
- I saw a fish!

161
00:08:30,698 --> 00:08:32,352
Thanks, Ollie.
And now sleep.

162
00:08:40,068 --> 00:08:42,251
Hey, guys, one of my cuffs is loose.

163
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,713
If we can break out of here,
I've got an idea

164
00:08:44,728 --> 00:08:47,651
how to give the captain of
this boat what he deserves.

165
00:08:54,685 --> 00:08:56,170
Hey, where's the captain?

166
00:08:56,195 --> 00:08:58,063
I don't know.
I haven't seen him all morning.

167
00:08:58,836 --> 00:09:01,101
<i>Are you ready for the summer?</i>

168
00:09:01,896 --> 00:09:04,560
<i>Are you ready for the sunshine?</i>

169
00:09:04,996 --> 00:09:08,883
<i>Are you ready for the birds
and bees, the apple trees</i>

170
00:09:08,917 --> 00:09:11,373
<i>And a whole lot of swimming to do?</i>

171
00:09:11,448 --> 00:09:14,481
This is going to be
the best summer ever.

172
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,270
<i>And it was.</i>

173
00:09:16,297 --> 00:09:20,052
<i>But Nate soon found himself put
to work on a Southern plantation.</i>

174
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:23,173
<i>It was way down there. You know,
when you stop seeing Howard Johnson's</i>

175
00:09:23,198 --> 00:09:26,132
<i>and you start seeing Stuckey's.
Anyway, it was a horrible place</i>

176
00:09:26,155 --> 00:09:29,711
<i>where they took away everybody's
African names and gave them new names.</i>

177
00:09:30,657 --> 00:09:33,380
- What's you name?
- Tobi with an "I."

178
00:09:33,428 --> 00:09:35,133
With an accent over the "I,"

179
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,312
and a little lineover
the "O" so you know

180
00:09:37,338 --> 00:09:39,573
it's a long vowel sound
and not a short one.

181
00:09:39,617 --> 00:09:41,923
And sometimes I like
to dot the "I" with a

182
00:09:41,947 --> 00:09:44,262
little smiley face or
a heart or something.

183
00:09:44,297 --> 00:09:46,140
Something to brighten the reader's day.

184
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:47,980
I asked you what your name was.

185
00:09:48,015 --> 00:09:50,843
Honey, you keep that up
it's what every you want it to be.

186
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:54,652
<i>Of course, back then the South was
a very different place than it is today.</i>

187
00:09:54,686 --> 00:09:57,000
<i>A backward place where
they didn't believe in science</i>

188
00:09:57,037 --> 00:09:59,161
<i>and hated others just
for being different.</i>

189
00:09:59,197 --> 00:10:02,182
<i>Time has a way of changing
a place and its people.</i>

190
00:10:02,348 --> 00:10:04,063
Excuse me. Hi. Yeah...

191
00:10:04,088 --> 00:10:07,203
Is there like a human resources
guy we could talk to?

192
00:10:07,897 --> 00:10:09,963
I have a work-related grievance.

193
00:10:09,968 --> 00:10:10,663
What?

194
00:10:10,686 --> 00:10:13,980
The quarters are too crowded,
the hours are long and...

195
00:10:14,015 --> 00:10:16,922
you know, I don't like
to be "this guy," but...

196
00:10:17,047 --> 00:10:20,982
a couple of the overseers
have been making racial slurs.

197
00:10:24,027 --> 00:10:26,712
<i>And then, all of a sudden, he saw her.</i>

198
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:29,620
<i>Lois-Laura-Bush-Lyn-Cheney
Pewterschmidt,</i>

199
00:10:29,648 --> 00:10:31,531
<i>the plantation owner's daughter.</i>

200
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:34,470
<i>Of course, ordinarily black guys
aren't attracted to white women,</i>

201
00:10:34,498 --> 00:10:36,413
<i>but she was something different.</i>

202
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:37,953
<i>As a poet might say,</i>

203
00:10:37,976 --> 00:10:41,943
<i>she was the kind of woman you just
want to have sex with over and over.</i>

204
00:10:41,997 --> 00:10:44,142
<i>With the kind of breasts
you just want to</i>

205
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:47,281
<i>push together so she
looks like a cross-eyed torso.</i>

206
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:49,930
<i>He knew he had to have her.</i>

207
00:11:06,016 --> 00:11:07,812
Is someone there?

208
00:11:07,855 --> 00:11:09,611
- Lois!
- Who are you?

209
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:12,692
Hi. I'm Nate Griffin. I work
against my will for your dad.

210
00:11:12,717 --> 00:11:14,731
Oh, yeah? Well, what do you do?

211
00:11:14,748 --> 00:11:17,122
Well, let's just say I know
my way around a hoe.

212
00:11:19,697 --> 00:11:23,501
<i>And, from the moment that piece
of off-color blue comedy was uttered,</i>

213
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:25,873
<i>their lives were changed forever.</i>

214
00:11:25,897 --> 00:11:29,243
- You wanna do it?
- You bet your sweet black ass I do.

215
00:11:29,286 --> 00:11:33,563
<i>So, for the next 15 years,
they raised a family in secrecy.</i>

216
00:11:34,018 --> 00:11:36,610
Supper's ready!
Come and get it, kids!

217
00:11:36,658 --> 00:11:39,572
You know the best part about
being half black and half white?

218
00:11:39,608 --> 00:11:42,133
When I grow up, I'll be
accepted by everybody.

219
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:46,571
- Daddy!
- Just as I thought!

220
00:11:46,598 --> 00:11:49,621
Lois, how in God's name, could
you embarrass the family like this?

221
00:11:50,506 --> 00:11:51,943
Sitting right here.

222
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:55,312
Daddy, you're the embarrassment.
Nate and I love each other!

223
00:11:55,336 --> 00:11:58,140
Tell it to the authorities,
because you're all going to jail!

224
00:11:58,996 --> 00:11:59,983
Run!

225
00:12:00,947 --> 00:12:03,783
<i>And so they set off on
their escape to the north.</i>

226
00:12:03,795 --> 00:12:06,923
<i>Luckily, they were helped by
Nate's good friend, Al Cowlings,</i>

227
00:12:06,957 --> 00:12:09,313
<i>who showed up on his
trusty white bronco.</i>

228
00:12:09,338 --> 00:12:11,590
<i>But the law was hot on their trail.</i>

229
00:12:15,616 --> 00:12:18,351
Well, we're getting a good view
of the chase from up here, Tom.

230
00:12:18,378 --> 00:12:21,172
That's right, Diane. We're looking
at Nate Griffin and Al Cowlings

231
00:12:21,188 --> 00:12:23,912
the man we believe to be Al Cowlings.
We'll stay with the chase.

232
00:12:23,937 --> 00:12:26,543
Uh... it seems like a futile
effort on their part, Diane.

233
00:12:26,566 --> 00:12:29,431
At some point, that horse is going
to have to stop and eat some grain.

234
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:33,403
<i>But luck was on their side and
eventually, they made it to the north.</i>

235
00:12:33,468 --> 00:12:36,581
<i>After that, Nate devoted his life
to getting back at the white man</i>

236
00:12:36,615 --> 00:12:38,251
<i>for the injustice of slavery,</i>

237
00:12:38,286 --> 00:12:41,190
<i>by inventing the
Department of Motor Vehicles.</i>

238
00:12:41,248 --> 00:12:43,751
- Sir, did you fill out the 1170?
- I think I did.

239
00:12:43,766 --> 00:12:46,052
- Did you fill out the 1170?
- I filled this out.

240
00:12:46,068 --> 00:12:48,590
That's the 1190. You're gonna
have to go stand in the blue line.

241
00:12:48,616 --> 00:12:50,952
- I was already in that line.
- Sir, don't get snippy with me.

242
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,310
- I've been here all morning.
- That is not my prerogative, sir.

243
00:12:53,325 --> 00:12:55,182
I wait in one line,
they send me to another line...

244
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:57,212
You can always call
to make an appointment.

245
00:12:57,227 --> 00:12:59,292
The line's always busy!
That's ridiculous.

246
00:12:59,326 --> 00:13:01,501
- Wait in the appointment line.
- I know! I don't want to wait!

247
00:13:01,526 --> 00:13:02,660
I haven't got all day!

248
00:13:02,677 --> 00:13:04,390
You're going to have to
take that somewhere else.

249
00:13:04,396 --> 00:13:05,852
You know what? I'm on break.

250
00:13:06,488 --> 00:13:08,350
Peter, enough with the storytelling.

251
00:13:08,366 --> 00:13:10,652
We gotta get outta here!
They're gonna kill Meg!

252
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:13,093
Oh, yeah? Over Meg's dead body.

253
00:13:14,637 --> 00:13:17,033
Hey! A flare gun.
Good idea, Peter.

254
00:13:17,045 --> 00:13:20,381
If we angle it through the vent, we
might be able to alert the authorities.

255
00:13:22,046 --> 00:13:26,020
- Oh, my God! We're gonna drown!
- We'll be fine. Here, put these on.

256
00:13:26,135 --> 00:13:29,541
Peter, these are parachutes.
What are we supposed to do with these?

257
00:13:29,565 --> 00:13:32,662
They're supposed to distract you
while I put on the one scuba suit.

258
00:13:41,748 --> 00:13:43,902
- What's the matter?
- That wasn't oxygen.

259
00:13:43,925 --> 00:13:47,901
That was a tank of Tony Danza's breath.
I wonder who got my oxygen tank.

260
00:13:49,088 --> 00:13:52,810
Kiss me, Tony.
I want your breath inside me.

261
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:59,231
Well, as long as death
is staring us in the face,

262
00:13:59,258 --> 00:14:01,701
I might as well tell you
about my great grandfather,

263
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:04,812
who was the greatest
silent movie star of the '20s.

264
00:14:04,866 --> 00:14:07,583
<i>His name was Willy "Black-Eye" Griffin,</i>

265
00:14:07,608 --> 00:14:10,593
<i>and his ocular misadventures
made him a star.</i>

266
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:36,863
<i>Black-Eye Griffin and his family were
among the wealthiest people in Hollywood.</i>

267
00:15:36,887 --> 00:15:39,973
<i>They spent their idle time
cavorting, doing the Charleston</i>

268
00:15:39,995 --> 00:15:43,190
<i>and enjoying America's prosperity
following World War I,</i>

269
00:15:43,238 --> 00:15:46,501
<i>which, at that time, was called
International Civil War II.</i>

270
00:15:46,527 --> 00:15:48,763
<i>But the golden years soon ended.</i>

271
00:15:48,787 --> 00:15:52,701
<i>Sadly, Black-Eyed Griffin's voice just
wasn't right for the talking pictures.</i>

272
00:15:55,905 --> 00:15:58,321
Pardon me, madam.
I'm the truant officer.

273
00:15:58,336 --> 00:16:01,411
I found these two children of yours
playing hooky from school.

274
00:16:01,448 --> 00:16:05,190
Oh, my! This will never do.
Will it, Dear?

275
00:16:05,395 --> 00:16:07,372
You gotta, Chris... you gotta...

276
00:16:07,395 --> 00:16:09,942
It's important for you
to get an education!

277
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:12,150
Get in there and finish your homework!

278
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:15,681
It was a simpler time.
It was a better time.

279
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:19,302
Well, no matter what happens to us,
I just hope Meg's okay.

280
00:16:20,496 --> 00:16:24,450
So, is, uh... is this, like, the part
where you guys have your way with me?

281
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:25,671
- What?
- You know,

282
00:16:25,687 --> 00:16:28,290
where I'm, like, helpless,
and you guys taketurns.

283
00:16:28,317 --> 00:16:30,742
- You know?
- Oh, no! Oh!

284
00:16:30,758 --> 00:16:32,880
God! Oh, no, no, no, no!

285
00:16:32,898 --> 00:16:33,992
<i>What did she say?</i>

286
00:16:33,996 --> 00:16:36,022
She asked if we were gonna
have our way with her.

287
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,302
<i>- Ew!
- No, seriously</i>

288
00:16:37,315 --> 00:16:39,743
- I won't scream or anything.
- No! No! I... I...

289
00:16:39,755 --> 00:16:41,252
No. No sale.

290
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:42,861
Come on! I'm pretty!

291
00:16:46,365 --> 00:16:48,691
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I was so scared.

292
00:16:49,018 --> 00:16:51,052
Well, it sure would suck
if you guys died

293
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:53,620
without hearing the story
of my great uncle, Peter Hitler,

294
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,272
who was Adolf's favorite brother.

295
00:16:58,385 --> 00:16:59,640
Hey, there you are.

296
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:02,882
Hey, you ready to go check out that new
skin flick over at the booben garden?

297
00:17:02,907 --> 00:17:05,940
- Peter, can't you see I'm busy?
- Yeah. What are you doing?

298
00:17:06,298 --> 00:17:08,010
- Stuff?
- Yes.

299
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:11,610
- Nazi stuff?
- Yes, Peter. Nazi stuff.

300
00:17:11,855 --> 00:17:13,630
- Can I help?
- No, Peter.

301
00:17:13,656 --> 00:17:16,370
- Just let me work, all right?!
- All right, all right. Okay.

302
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,922
Hey. Hey, Addy. Addy, look.
Addy, I'm Tojo.

303
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,501
Addy. Addy, look.
I'm... Look. I'm Tojo.

304
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:36,891
I am from Japan.

305
00:17:41,546 --> 00:17:42,821
Sweet!

306
00:17:47,936 --> 00:17:50,973
- That's what a gun sounds like.
- Will you stop that?!

307
00:17:50,996 --> 00:17:52,832
Hey, can I borrow 50 marks?

308
00:17:52,918 --> 00:17:55,412
What happened to the 50 marks
I gave you last week?

309
00:17:55,437 --> 00:17:57,621
Aw, come on.
Your girlfriend's not cheap.

310
00:17:59,636 --> 00:18:00,752
Just kidding.

311
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,121
Ah! Look at your face.

312
00:18:02,135 --> 00:18:03,813
Hey, whatever happened
with that art school?

313
00:18:03,835 --> 00:18:05,771
You ever gonna take
another crack at that?

314
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:08,711
Look, I'm going to do a rally.
I'll be back in an hour.

315
00:18:09,057 --> 00:18:11,061
A rally. Sweet.

316
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:16,251
The days of despair
and hardship are over!

317
00:18:16,266 --> 00:18:18,712
Today begins a New Order!

318
00:18:18,728 --> 00:18:23,130
All of Europe will tremble
as Germany take sits rightful place

319
00:18:23,158 --> 00:18:24,872
as ruler of the world!

320
00:18:24,885 --> 00:18:25,983
Oh, yeah!

321
00:18:25,997 --> 00:18:27,761
Yes. As I was saying,

322
00:18:27,786 --> 00:18:30,070
the time for victory is upon us!

323
00:18:30,095 --> 00:18:32,491
Victory up the ass, baby!
Yeah, come on!

324
00:18:32,566 --> 00:18:35,940
A new... a new world! A better world!

325
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:39,373
- A German world!
- Yeah! Germanator!

326
00:18:39,388 --> 00:18:41,843
I'll be back! Whoo! Yeah!

327
00:18:41,858 --> 00:18:44,532
We will emerge as the dominant people!

328
00:18:44,565 --> 00:18:46,201
And it's all 'cause of you guys.

329
00:18:46,218 --> 00:18:47,942
You know what?
You guys, with your marching

330
00:18:47,946 --> 00:18:49,640
and your letters and your phone calls,

331
00:18:49,647 --> 00:18:52,671
this is all thanks to you.
You made this happen,

332
00:18:52,705 --> 00:18:56,501
you guys... My God! Give yourselves
a round of applause! Come on.

333
00:18:56,538 --> 00:18:58,582
You deserve it. You deserve it.

334
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:03,290
Hey, what do you say we all
head over to the Buzenpuken, eh?

335
00:19:03,318 --> 00:19:06,072
Free beer on this motherfuhrer!
Eh?! Come on!

336
00:19:08,498 --> 00:19:11,052
Well, that's pretty much
all there is to tell, kids.

337
00:19:11,077 --> 00:19:14,192
The Griffin family history
is a rich tapestry.

338
00:19:14,227 --> 00:19:16,142
But, since we're all gonna die,

339
00:19:16,157 --> 00:19:18,901
there's one more secret
I feel I have to share with you:

340
00:19:19,287 --> 00:19:21,570
I did not care for The Godfather.

341
00:19:21,588 --> 00:19:23,921
- What?
- Did not care for The Godfather.

342
00:19:23,945 --> 00:19:26,773
- How can you even say that, Dad?
- Didn't like... didn't like it.

343
00:19:26,788 --> 00:19:29,453
Peter, it's so good.
It's like the perfect movie.

344
00:19:29,466 --> 00:19:31,342
This is what everyone
always says whenever...

345
00:19:31,385 --> 00:19:34,833
Robert De Niro, Al Pacino...
I mean, you never see...

346
00:19:34,857 --> 00:19:36,212
Robert Duvall!

347
00:19:36,248 --> 00:19:39,120
I know. Fine, fine actor.
Did not like the movie.

348
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,853
- Why not?
- Couldn't get into it.

349
00:19:40,866 --> 00:19:42,762
Explain yourself.
What didn't you like about it?

350
00:19:42,777 --> 00:19:45,171
- It insists upon itself, Lois.
- What?

351
00:19:45,197 --> 00:19:47,401
- It insists upon itself.
- What does that even mean?

352
00:19:47,425 --> 00:19:50,463
'Cause it has a valid point
to make, it's insistent!

353
00:19:50,487 --> 00:19:53,823
It takes forever getting in, and then you
spend, like six and half hours, and then,

354
00:19:53,838 --> 00:19:55,810
I can't even get through it.
I can't even finish the movie.

355
00:19:55,817 --> 00:19:56,943
I've never even seen the ending.

356
00:19:56,955 --> 00:19:59,691
- You've never seen the ending?!
- How can you say you don't like it

357
00:19:59,718 --> 00:20:01,292
if you haven't even given it a chance?

358
00:20:01,316 --> 00:20:03,150
I agree with Stewie.
It's not really fair.

359
00:20:03,175 --> 00:20:06,243
I have tried, on three separate
occasions, to get through it, and I...

360
00:20:06,268 --> 00:20:08,860
I get to the scene where all the guys
are sitting around on easy chairs...

361
00:20:08,885 --> 00:20:10,682
Yeah. That's a great scene.
I love that scene.

362
00:20:10,696 --> 00:20:12,162
It's noted in every annal.

363
00:20:12,175 --> 00:20:14,003
I have no idea what
they're talking about.

364
00:20:14,016 --> 00:20:16,610
Like they're speaking a different language.
That's why I lose interest and I go away.

365
00:20:16,618 --> 00:20:17,932
They're speaking Italian!

366
00:20:17,946 --> 00:20:20,143
The language they're speaking
is the language of subtlety,

367
00:20:20,158 --> 00:20:21,423
something you don't understand.

368
00:20:21,447 --> 00:20:22,882
I love The Money Pit.

369
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:25,052
That is my answer to that statement.

370
00:20:25,087 --> 00:20:26,903
- Exactly.
- Well, there you go.

371
00:20:27,045 --> 00:20:29,082
- Whatever.
- I like that movie, too.

372
00:20:30,967 --> 00:20:33,053
Thank God, you guys are okay!

373
00:20:33,087 --> 00:20:35,821
Wow! You saved our lives, Mr. Swanson!

374
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:38,310
- We've captured the burglars.
- Oh, thank God.

375
00:20:38,335 --> 00:20:42,752
Unfortunately, they're pressing sexual
harassment charges against your daughter.

376
00:20:42,788 --> 00:20:45,610
- Well, that was a close call.
- You know, uh...

377
00:20:45,638 --> 00:20:47,613
Meg should probably get a lawyer.

378
00:20:47,636 --> 00:20:51,590
Oh, sweetie, thank you for keeping
our spirits up with your stories.

379
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:53,280
Your daughter's a sexual predator.

380
00:20:53,315 --> 00:20:56,001
If you don't do anything,
she could go to jail for a long time.

381
00:20:56,035 --> 00:21:00,501
Don't thank me, Lois. Thank my
ancestors for living lives of greatness.

382
00:21:00,547 --> 00:21:03,392
- All right, guys, just take her away.
- Dad, help!

383
00:21:04,536 --> 00:21:07,083
- Dad!
- Have fun at the dance, Meg.

384
00:21:07,096 --> 00:21:09,480
I hope she does.
That kid really deserves it.

385
00:21:09,487 --> 00:21:10,001
