Quagmire: It's the new Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue.
Check it out.

12
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:10,180
Joe: Those swimsuit issues don't excite me like they used to. I've been spoiled by internet porn.

13
00:01:10,181 --> 00:01:11,404
Peter: It's true.
Brian: Totally.

14
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,266
Quagmire: What do you mean internet porn?

15
00:01:13,267 --> 00:01:15,605
Joe: You, uh, don't know about internet porn?

16
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:17,651
Quagmire: Don't know what? I'm 
not really a computer guy.

17
00:01:17,652 --> 00:01:21,760
Quagmire, I would think you of all people would know about internet porn.

18
00:01:21,761 --> 00:01:25,681
They got like thousands, literally
million of naked pictures on the internet.

19
00:01:26,495 --> 00:01:27,180
What?

20
00:01:27,181 --> 00:01:29,169
And videos! Thousands of them!

21
00:01:29,308 --> 00:01:30,430
You guys are messing with me.

22
00:01:30,431 --> 00:01:31,995
Quagmire, you don't use the Internet?

23
00:01:31,996 --> 00:01:34,384
You mean that crappy dial-up thing?
It's a pain in the ass!

24
00:01:34,384 --> 00:01:37,907
No I don't use the damn internet!  I thought that was for nerds!
Why didn't you guys tell me!

25
00:01:37,907 --> 00:01:41,218
Oh yeah, you can even see Tonya Harding's honeymoon video on there.

26
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:45,465
I mean... It's gross, but it's like famous gross.

27

You know, these women don't compare to the old swimsuit issues with Kathy Ireland.

Joe: Yeah, she had it going on!

29
00:01:50,858 --> 00:01:53,968
You know, Horace still has one of
those old beer promotional cutouts of her from like

30
00:01:54,003 --> 00:01:57,025
1994, in the backroom.
Don't you, Horace?

31

Horace: Hey, you mean this thing? I was about to throw
it out. If anyone wants it, it's theirs.

Peter: [softly] I'm taking you home with me.

34
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:47,819
Chris: Hey dad, Where you going with that cutout?

35
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,815
Peter: Hey kids, this is Kathy.

36
00:02:49,815 --> 00:02:52,080
We are designing lifestyle products together.

37
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,371
It's completely legitimate, but don't
tell your mother.

38
00:02:58,882 --> 00:03:01,279
I had a great time today at the museum.

39
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:03,392
You were the most beautiful woman there.

40
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:09,622
You know... Lois won't be home from groceries
for a while. I have an idea.

Hey Kathy, guess what?

44
00:03:30,395 --> 00:03:35,223

Peter: Oh, no...

Lois: What the hell is going on? I sent
you to pick up dinner an hour ago!

47
00:03:41,131 --> 00:03:43,131
What are you doing with that cutout?

Peter: You know what, Lois, I'm glad
you found out!

49

I can't carry on this charade anymore!

I have an announcement to make.

51

No no, I'll do it, I'll do it.

52

I know I been able to keep this a secret.  
But Kathy and I

53

are not actually working on

but I do want you guys to get along.

61
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:27,239
Just give her a chance, I think you'll like it.

62
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:30,132
Maybe she'll let us do things 
that Lois won't let us do.

63
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:33,443
Yeah! Hey mom, 
can I pull my pants down?

64
00:04:34,344 --> 00:04:36,297
If she doesn't answer, does that mean yes?

65
00:04:36,298 --> 00:04:39,123
- That's what I been going with.

Mine's better, mine's better, mine's better!

68
00:04:50,828 --> 00:04:54,068
Oh, hello Lois... I would've thought 
you would've moved in with your mother by now.

69
00:04:54,103 --> 00:04:56,860
No Peter, I'm just pretty much letting this run its course.

70
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:59,930
Well I'm sorry you're handling this so poorly,
but have you seen Kathy?

71
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,576
We were gonna go get our passports renewed.

72
00:05:01,576 --> 00:05:04,143
Uh Chris took her into his room about 10 minutes ago.

73
00:05:04,144 --> 00:05:06,280
What? That whore!

74
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,825
She's betrayed me worst than
Lady Macbeth betrayed Duncan!

75

I uhh... I don't know Shakespeare very well.

76
00:05:23,162 --> 00:05:27,161
There you are! Oh, don't give me that look.
You don't think I know where you been?

77
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:29,436
How dare you make a fool of me!

78
00:05:29,436 --> 00:05:33,070
Did you have sex with that fat kid?
Did you? Answer me!

79
00:05:33,411 --> 00:05:35,787
Oh my god, look
what you made me do!

80
00:05:38,912 --> 00:05:42,632
Why did you have to provoke me?
Whay did you hav...

81
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:45,967
Quagmire? Hey uh... 
Nobody seen you in days!

82
00:05:46,156 --> 00:05:47,187
Hey, Peter

83
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:52,182
I just been uhh...  checking out
some of that internet porn.

84
00:05:52,304 --> 00:05:53,196
You okay?

85
00:05:53,197 --> 00:05:55,619
Yeah yeah I'm good I'm good I'm good...
I'm just gonna...

86
00:05:56,144 --> 00:05:58,287
Go... go and check my mail over there.

87
00:05:58,472 --> 00:05:59,623
You been lifting weights?

88
00:05:59,624 --> 00:06:04,756
Uhh no... no... I don't think uhh ... no

89
00:06:06,322 --> 00:06:09,235
I'm... I'm sorry Peter, I gotta...
I gotta get back.

90
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,520
I'm sorry, Lois,
I was a fool!

91
00:06:17,521 --> 00:06:19,950
I'm done with Kathy!
Can you ever forgive me?

92
00:06:21,216 --> 00:06:26,386
Peter, settle down. Yes I forgive you, just as 
long as you are done with that stupid cutout.

93
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:30,342
I just want you to know that everytime I was with her,
I was thinking of you.

94
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,514
Peter, stop.
Come on, I'm not in the mood.

95
00:06:40,217 --> 00:06:44,867
Oh, Lois, I've missed you! You and your
wonderful smile and your beautiful eyes

96
00:06:44,867 --> 00:06:47,465
and your awesome third boob that's
on top of the other boob.

97
00:06:47,466 --> 00:06:52,385
What? Oh my god! Peter, that's
not a boob, that's a lump!

98
00:06:52,386 --> 00:06:53,976
A lump?  Holy crap!

99
00:06:56,654 --> 00:07:00,959
Peter, stop that! We're not having sex!
I just told you I have a lump!

100
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,414
I got a lump too and mine is easier to get rid of.

101
00:07:07,372 --> 00:07:11,101
Mrs. Griffin, I've got good news.
Your test results came back negative

102
00:07:11,194 --> 00:07:14,747
It appears the lump in your breast is not
"black gross boob death"

103
00:07:14,748 --> 00:07:15,662
Breast cancer?

104
00:07:15,663 --> 00:07:17,217
That's the layman's term yes.

106
00:07:18,902 --> 00:07:21,189
- What a relief!
- Yeah that was scary.

107
00:07:21,294 --> 00:07:24,561
Now Mrs. Griffin, although you are
in the clear for the moment, we need to have a look

108
00:07:24,562 --> 00:07:27,669
at your family medical history to
determine your future risk.

109
00:07:28,602 --> 00:07:32,220
Huh, that's curious. I didn't realize your 
mother was a Holocaust survivor.

110
00:07:32,221 --> 00:07:36,451
My mother? Oh no that's...  That's 
impossible, she's not Jewish.

111
00:07:36,511 --> 00:07:38,874
According to her birth certificate, she is.

112
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,815
Oh my god!

113
00:07:40,816 --> 00:07:44,184
Wow, breast cancer starting
to look pretty good.

114
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,845
Mom, you're Jewish?

115
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:53,400
I'm sorry I never told you, dear.

116
00:07:53,401 --> 00:07:56,129
When we were married,
Your father made me conceal the fact

117
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,652
so he can get into country clubs.

118
00:07:58,653 --> 00:08:02,338
- It was the right thing to do
- It was the right thing to do, dear.

119
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:03,553
Oh my god!

120
00:08:03,554 --> 00:08:06,381
So grandmother Hebrewberg is actually Jewish?

121
00:08:06,382 --> 00:08:10,351
Yes, when she moved to America, 
her family changed their name.

122
00:08:10,352 --> 00:08:13,448
It was originally Hebrewberg Moneygrabber.

123
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:16,933
That makes you Jewish, Lois,
and your children too.

124
00:08:16,934 --> 00:08:18,315
Well, this kinda rocks my world.,

125
00:08:18,544 --> 00:08:20,970
even more than the time
When I went to that pediatrician.

126
00:08:21,856 --> 00:08:25,449
Woah, Stewie, you're getting to be a big boy.

127
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,856
I think somebody is gonna be a football star.

128
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:29,668
Oh, you ...

129
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:31,389
Oops, forgot your chart, be right back.

130
00:08:32,449 --> 00:08:36,105
Woah, Jason, you're getting to be a big boy.

131
00:08:36,106 --> 00:08:38,856
I think somebody is gonna be a football star.

132
00:08:39,045 --> 00:08:41,106
I can't believe I fell for that line.

133
00:08:41,107 --> 00:08:44,094
I actually let myself believe I could 
be a doctor's wife.

134
00:08:44,282 --> 00:08:47,028
You're just fat, Stewie,
silly and fat.

135
00:08:50,638 --> 00:08:52,479
Thanks you for coming over, Max.

136
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,618
I really need some advice from
an actual Jewish person.

137
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,062
Oh, it's my pleasure, Lois.

138
00:08:57,063 --> 00:08:59,509
I'm sure this all must be
very overwhelming.

139
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,009
I just don't know what to do with this information.

140
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,571
I spent my whole life as a Christian.

141
00:09:04,572 --> 00:09:07,040
I'll tell you what you should do with it,
absolutely nothing!

142
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,277
That's the problem with this world.

143
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:10,419
Too many people go overboard 
with what they believe.

144
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:13,572
Like Quagmire, when he thought
he was the one getting the spin-off

145
00:09:13,744 --> 00:09:15,258
See you later, bitches.

146

Have fun with your stupid *BEEP* giant chickens jokes
and your Conway Twitty

147

Hey, why is there a moving truck
outside Cleveland's house?

148
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:25,258
Well, I wouldnt put it quite like that
but essentially Brian's right

149
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:28,968
Being Jewish doesn't really have to 
change you or your family's life

150
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:30,446
Wow, I guess you're right.

151
00:09:30,447 --> 00:09:33,102
There's no reason things should
be any different around here.

152
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:35,232
Shalom, Jews!

153
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:38,758
Wow dad, where did you get all
that glistening chest hair?

154
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,310
Came with my Star of David.

155
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:41,571
Peter, What is all this?

156
00:09:41,572 --> 00:09:45,166
Look, this is my way of letting you know
that I'm embracing who you are.

157
00:09:45,181 --> 00:09:46,820
Oh, and I don't respond to Peter.

158
00:09:46,821 --> 00:09:48,743
From now on I want you to use my Hebrew name.

159
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,965
Well, I... I caution you uhh...

160
00:09:56,078 --> 00:09:59,165
that becoming Jewish
doesn't happen overnight.

161
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:03,385
It's a process that involves
spiritual education and good works.

162
00:10:03,386 --> 00:10:05,651
So what you're saying is that it happens overnight?

163
00:10:05,652 --> 00:10:07,869
Look, Peter, I am the one 
with the Jewish heritage,

164
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,276
and I really don't want to make
a big deal out of this.

165
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:13,102
Leave it to a Jew to take all 
the fun outta being a Jew.

166
00:10:13,103 --> 00:10:16,531
Now listen up, I like the hat and I
like the scarf, so we are doing this.

167
00:10:20,431 --> 00:10:23,717
Kids, from now on, this is where we will celebrate the Sabbath

168
00:10:23,718 --> 00:10:25,726
Peter, this is all unnecessary

170
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,804
Check it out! I'm one of you guys now huh.

171
00:10:29,805 --> 00:10:33,666
I'm Jewish, yeah!
Holocaust! We're number one!

172
00:10:33,696 --> 00:10:36,071
Look at all these short, hairy men

173
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:38,758
God I feel like I'm on the forest moon of Endor

174
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,450
Good afternoon

175
00:10:40,451 --> 00:10:42,839
As we approach the passover holiday,

176
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,213
let us remember the struggle of our people

177
00:10:45,214 --> 00:10:49,163
as they labored under the yoke
of Pharaoh's despotic rule.

178
00:10:49,164 --> 00:10:51,870
Hey, if anyone appreciate a good yoke
it's the yews

179
00:10:54,743 --> 00:10:57,087
That's my Jewish laugh.
I'm working on a Jewish laugh.

180
00:10:57,088 --> 00:10:59,272
Peter, I am so embarrassed right now

181
00:10:59,273 --> 00:11:00,838
Can we please just go?

182
00:11:01,107 --> 00:11:04,274
- Hi, you're pretty
- Oh, thank you

183
00:11:05,836 --> 00:11:09,006
Mom, is sodomy illegal for Jewish?

184
00:11:09,007 --> 00:11:11,637
I hope to so, Meg. I really do.

186
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,367
Dad, this isn't the 
way to school

187
00:11:21,368 --> 00:11:22,632
Yes it is, Chris

188
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:24,427
One of the best parts about being Jewish

189
00:11:24,428 --> 00:11:26,943
is getting to take advantage
of their excellent schools

190
00:11:26,944 --> 00:11:28,709
I'm not going to no Jewish school

191
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:31,618
Sitting around all day with a bunch of short, hairy guys,

192
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:34,105
I feel like I'm on the forest moon of Endor

193
00:11:34,153 --> 00:11:36,943
Didn't you... didn't you make
that joke the other day?

194
00:11:36,944 --> 00:11:40,857
Oh... yeah... No I was...
I wasn't sure that everybody had umm ...

195
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:43,883
had heard

196
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:48,302
And instead of lasting for one day,

197
00:11:48,303 --> 00:11:51,074
the oil in the lamp lasted for eight days,

198
00:11:51,075 --> 00:11:53,443
And this is why we celebrating Hanukkah.

199
00:11:53,444 --> 00:11:54,834
Yeah yeah yeah, how long before we play

200
00:11:54,835 --> 00:11:57,307
"Pin the eviction notice on the black guy's door. "

201
00:11:57,308 --> 00:11:59,054
Now does anyone have any questions?

202
00:11:59,055 --> 00:12:01,585
Yeah I have a question.
What are you gonna do when Jesus comes back

203
00:12:01,586 --> 00:12:03,086
and puts a boot up your ass?

204
00:12:03,087 --> 00:12:07,444
And it's also why many families
gives their children eight days of presents

205
00:12:07,668 --> 00:12:09,973
Wait, did she say eight days of presents?

206
00:12:09,974 --> 00:12:10,645
Yeah.

207
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,332
Well, this Judaism thing is
gonna be better than I thought.

208
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,569
Alright class, that's all for today's lesson.,

209
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,239
Now everyone off to gym class.

210
00:12:17,741 --> 00:12:19,896
Alright, today we gonna play soccer.

211
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:29,083
Huh, that was easy.

212
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:35,568
Hey Lois, the kids are all asleep

213
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:37,567
I suppose they are

214
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:42,755
You know what else? I picked out a sexy 
little Jewish outfit for you at the store

215
00:12:42,756 --> 00:12:43,936
What is that?

216
00:12:43,937 --> 00:12:47,798
Oh my God Lois, if you put on this long,
thick dress right now I will lose it.

217
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:49,682
Peter, I'm not wearing that thing.

218
00:12:49,776 --> 00:12:51,338
And if you put this
shawl over your head ...

219
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:54,206
Ooh, you have clunky,
unfashionable, peasant shoes?

220
00:12:54,326 --> 00:12:57,055
Oh, I swear to God, Lois. I swear
to God that I would lose it.

221
00:12:57,075 --> 00:12:58,956
Peter, get off me!

222
00:12:59,464 --> 00:13:02,064
Tell me I don't earn as much
as your friend's husband!

223
00:13:02,432 --> 00:13:04,948
Peter, stop it! I'm going to sleep

224
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,331
Fine, I'll just sit here and watch TV

225
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:12,355
We now return to Mark
Wahlberg in "Annoyed and confused"

226
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:14,941
What? What's going on?

227
00:13:14,976 --> 00:13:17,487
I don't get it. man,
I gotta work out.

228
00:13:17,522 --> 00:13:21,435
What's going on here?
Where am I? What the... huh?

229
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:24,794
What the hell is
going on here? Huh? What?

230
00:13:31,075 --> 00:13:32,527
Peter

231
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:37,264
Dad?

232
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:39,139
What do you think you're doing, Peter?

233
00:13:39,174 --> 00:13:40,995
You were raised Catholic

234
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:45,302
If you rescind your religion,
you will spend eternity... in hell!

235
00:13:45,337 --> 00:13:47,033
Oh God, I don't want that!

236
00:13:47,068 --> 00:13:49,700
Then you better not fall for all the Jewish stuff.

237
00:13:49,756 --> 00:13:52,406
Oh ... alright, if that's what you think is best.

238
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:58,392
Oh wait, dad, before you to go, can you say:
"Peter, you must go to the Degobah System"?

239
00:13:58,627 --> 00:14:02,558
Peter, you must go to the Degobah System

240
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:04,761
Thanks

241
00:14:08,631 --> 00:14:10,943
Anybody want toast or bagel?

242
00:14:12,828 --> 00:14:14,184
Peter, what the hell!

243
00:14:14,184 --> 00:14:16,634
Lois, last night my father came to me

244
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:18,271
and reminded me that I am a good Catholic

245
00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:21,802
If I don't rid the house of this Jewish curse,
This family is gonna go to hell!

246
00:14:21,802 --> 00:14:23,259
And I won't let that happen!

247
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:26,741
Peter, you were the only one who was even
taking this thing seriously

248
00:14:26,776 --> 00:14:27,968
Jews are gross, Lois

249
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:29,906
It's the only religion with the word 'ew' in it.

250
00:14:29,906 --> 00:14:34,381
Ah, come on. You're acting crazy, like when
you were going through your Parker Lewis phase

251
00:14:34,381 --> 00:14:36,087
Peter, you ready for dinner?

252
00:14:36,122 --> 00:14:38,006
Ah, that's just like the Parker Lewis episode

253
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,429
when Parker Lewis ate dinner.

254
00:14:39,429 --> 00:14:41,898
Peter, nobody cares about your canceled show.

255
00:14:41,898 --> 00:14:46,164
Lois, Parker Lewis can't lose.
Don't even try and make him lose,

256
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:48,568
because it's just gonna be that much more embarrassing for you

257
00:14:48,603 --> 00:14:50,799
When you realize that he can't lose.

258
00:14:50,834 --> 00:14:52,494
Would he win in a fight with Batman?

259
00:14:52,494 --> 00:14:54,513
Well, Chris, think about what you're saying.

260
00:14:54,548 --> 00:14:56,296
Parker Lewis can't lose.

261
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:58,851
Heretofor, Batman can suck on that.

262
00:14:58,893 --> 00:15:03,761
Suck on that?  Suck on this!
TicTacs only have 1.5 calories!

263
00:15:03,796 --> 00:15:04,673
Well played

264
00:15:04,673 --> 00:15:06,096
I love you, dad

265
00:15:06,096 --> 00:15:08,232
I love you too, son

266
00:15:18,002 --> 00:15:20,084
What the ... what the hell!

267
00:15:20,084 --> 00:15:22,654
How do you like it? Huh? 
How do you like it?

268
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:24,437
Peter, what in God's name is this?

269
00:15:24,437 --> 00:15:27,281
Wait a minute, are these pieces of Stewie's crib?

270
00:15:27,657 --> 00:15:29,437
I hate it here!

271
00:15:32,845 --> 00:15:35,012
Well, thanks for spending time with me today, Mom

272
00:15:35,012 --> 00:15:38,757
I just had to get out of that house,
Peter is being such a jackass

273
00:15:38,757 --> 00:15:42,003
Lois, I think this more serious than you realize.

274
00:15:42,003 --> 00:15:43,514
Don't you see what he's doing?

275
00:15:43,514 --> 00:15:45,386
Oh, he's just being immature.

276
00:15:45,386 --> 00:15:47,360
It's happened before and it will pass.

277
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,646
Lois, what Peter is doing to you is

278
00:15:49,647 --> 00:15:52,357
exactly what Carter did to me for years

279
00:15:52,392 --> 00:15:55,633
He's repressing your Jewish identity!

280
00:15:56,445 --> 00:16:01,733
But Mom, I don't really care about being Jewish, 
or even Christian for that matter!

281
00:16:01,768 --> 00:16:04,525
I just want to be a good person on my own.

282
00:16:05,367 --> 00:16:07,546
All I'm saying is I let your father take

283
00:16:07,581 --> 00:16:11,774
my Jewish identity and I regreted it ever since.

284
00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:14,768
I don't want to see you make the same mistake

285
00:16:14,803 --> 00:16:17,971
I don't know, mom. I'll think about it

286
00:16:18,006 --> 00:16:19,085
Carter, knock it off!

287
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,086
Come on, you know you Jew girls want that dollar!

288
00:16:22,121 --> 00:16:24,024
Follow the dollar and it'll lead you to...

289
00:16:24,368 --> 00:16:27,742
What... what does Jews like?
Salmon! There's salmon over here!

290
00:16:27,973 --> 00:16:29,438
Is there really salmon over there?

291
00:16:29,438 --> 00:16:32,867
No, you walk over there and he squirts you with a squirt gun

292
00:16:49,434 --> 00:16:51,133
What the hell!

293
00:16:58,606 --> 00:17:00,515
Are you out of your *BEEP* mind?

294
00:17:00,515 --> 00:17:04,297
Relax, Lois, I was aiming for the mailbox, 
I'm just trying to make point

295
00:17:04,298 --> 00:17:05,488
Good morning, Lois

296
00:17:06,374 --> 00:17:09,068
Peter, for God sake! I am sorry, Mort

297
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:12,033
No problem, Lois. that's just how people say hello to me.

298
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,089
- Hey, Joe
- Hey, Mort

299
00:17:17,284 --> 00:17:19,730
Peter, you and I are gonna have a conversation

300
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:22,440
- I am very angry with you
- Gees, what's your problem?

301
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:25,873
What you did this morning was so far outta line, I just...

302
00:17:25,874 --> 00:17:28,236
Let me tell you this, mom was right

303
00:17:28,484 --> 00:17:31,770
I can't just sit here and let you dump all over my heritage

304
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:34,064
I'm not gonna make the mistake she did.

305
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:36,238
I'm Jewish and I am proud of it

306
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:38,814
And this weekend we're having a Passover Seder

307
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:41,414
- You can't do that, it's Easter!
- Not in this house

308
00:17:41,415 --> 00:17:43,800
Lois, this family believes in the Easter bunny

309
00:17:43,801 --> 00:17:46,418
He died for our sins in that helicopter crash

310
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:48,341
Now, if you want to go hell, that's fine

311
00:17:48,342 --> 00:17:52,282
But don't drag the rest of us down with you 
like a mentally handicapped rooster.

312
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,924
Good night everybody!

313
00:18:01,532 --> 00:18:03,032
Ok everyone, 

314
00:18:03,132 --> 00:18:05,210
This is my first time doing a Seder

315
00:18:05,211 --> 00:18:09,128
which is where we tell the story of the Jews escaped from bondage in Egypt

316
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,703
Doesn't it seem like every Jewish holiday

317
00:18:11,703 --> 00:18:13,702
has to do with them escaping from stuff?

318
00:18:13,703 --> 00:18:14,836
No, Chris

319
00:18:14,837 --> 00:18:18,728
And you know, tricking some bigger, more atheletic people...

320
00:18:18,728 --> 00:18:20,314
Uhh... Lois, not that I'm rushing you,

321
00:18:20,315 --> 00:18:21,806
but when do we get to the wine drinking?

322
00:18:21,807 --> 00:18:23,887
Hang on! Hang on! Before
do anything I

323
00:18:23,888 --> 00:18:26,044
like to say a blessing over
the candles, if I may.

325
00:18:41,512 --> 00:18:42,521
Can't we just eat?

326
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,437
And now I shall continue with the prayer

327
00:18:56,049 --> 00:18:58,711
And now let's move on to the washing of hands

328
00:18:58,746 --> 00:19:00,940
This is a very important part of the cerem...

329
00:19:01,854 --> 00:19:03,658
The Easter Bunny is here!

330
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:05,289
Happy Easter!

331
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:07,773
Peter, what the hell are you doing in that...

332
00:19:07,774 --> 00:19:08,786
Have you been drinking?

333
00:19:08,821 --> 00:19:10,364
Not since I got out of the car

334
00:19:10,364 --> 00:19:12,657
Who here thinks I can 
kick my ass?

335
00:19:12,658 --> 00:19:15,691
Peter, you are not gonna ruin this
Seder. Now get outta here.

336
00:19:15,726 --> 00:19:17,296
I'm sorry kids

337
00:19:17,297 --> 00:19:20,271
I just wanted to help Brian run for mayor

338
00:19:20,662 --> 00:19:23,386
I guess I forgot what was really important

340
00:19:24,978 --> 00:19:28,556
Alright, I'm gonna go lie down, then I'm 
gonna come back and mess up your Seder

341
00:19:29,399 --> 00:19:32,080
Alright, I'm back and I'm much more sober

342
00:19:32,081 --> 00:19:33,360
Lois, what you doing is wrong

343
00:19:33,361 --> 00:19:35,542
I want you to get all this Jew food off the table.

344
00:19:35,543 --> 00:19:37,145
I most certainly will not!

345
00:19:37,146 --> 00:19:38,977
It's me or your religion, Lois

346
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:41,537
I am a Catholic and I want
live in a Catholic house

347
00:19:41,538 --> 00:19:44,122
Well, I'm a Jew and I want
live in a nicer house.

348
00:19:44,123 --> 00:19:45,782
Do you really think I should
run formayor?

349
00:19:45,782 --> 00:19:48,887
Peter, you have got to stop
living in your own stupid worlds!

350
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:52,234
I'm sorry, but I can't be with someone who doesn't believe in Jesus.

351
00:19:52,397 --> 00:19:54,504
Hey hey, heard my name!

352
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:55,695
Wow Jesus!

353
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:58,087
Oh, you're dead now Lois.  Jesus is gonna kill ya.

354
00:19:58,088 --> 00:20:00,668
And then we gonna bury you in the
yard, next to Kathy Irel ...

355
00:20:01,672 --> 00:20:03,340
Er, I mean uhh... nice weather we're having!

356
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:07,001
Look Peter, I thought it might interest you to know that I'm Jewish

357
00:20:07,382 --> 00:20:08,078
What?

358
00:20:08,113 --> 00:20:09,740
He's Jewish, Peter

359
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,622
Jewish, like full on, like you practice Judaism?

360
00:20:12,623 --> 00:20:13,479
I am a Jew

361
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,270
Prove it! What's a nine percent
tip on a $200 bill?

362
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,704
$18, which is fair...

363
00:20:18,705 --> 00:20:20,553
Oh my god, it's true!

364
00:20:20,711 --> 00:20:22,084
But I'm so confused

365
00:20:22,085 --> 00:20:23,627
Peter, really doesn't matter

366
00:20:23,628 --> 00:20:26,384
Catholicism and Judaism
are not that different.

367
00:20:26,385 --> 00:20:27,996
They are two sides of same coin

368
00:20:28,256 --> 00:20:31,033
In fact, the Last Supper, one of
the most iconic image of the

369
00:20:31,034 --> 00:20:33,656
Catholic faith was a Passover Seder

370
00:20:33,657 --> 00:20:37,037
And if I'm not mistaken, Islam
is also in that same spiritual family

371
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:38,927
Uhh... Let's not muddy things up here

372
00:20:38,927 --> 00:20:41,880
The most important thing is to treat other people

373
00:20:41,915 --> 00:20:43,950
the same way you would want to be treated.

374
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,045
Ooooh ... an eye for an eye!

375
00:20:46,317 --> 00:20:49,222
Well Lois, I guess I owe you an apology

376
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:52,688
I was scared because my dad convinced me I was going to hell.

377
00:20:52,689 --> 00:20:55,855
And I was doing it to make up for my mother's mistake.

378
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:59,552
Look, I don't know if being Jewish is
the right thing for our family

379
00:20:59,787 --> 00:21:03,347
I just want the chance to explore it so I can know for sure.

380
00:21:03,482 --> 00:21:06,323
But to tell you the truth, I thought we were fine before.

381
00:21:06,524 --> 00:21:09,638
But, then Jesus, what religion
should our family be?

382
00:21:09,638 --> 00:21:11,384
Six to one, they are all complete crap.

383
00:21:11,385 --> 00:21:12,385
Thank you!

384
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,000
