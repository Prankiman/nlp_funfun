00:00:33,902 --> 00:00:35,903
(Brian and Stewie scream)

13
00:00:38,758 --> 00:00:41,059
Hurry, Brian,
they're gaining on us!

14
00:00:43,696 --> 00:00:45,330
(gunfire)

15
00:00:47,467 --> 00:00:48,900
Damn it,
we're surrounded!

16
00:00:54,874 --> 00:00:56,475
Crap, they got away.

17
00:00:56,509 --> 00:00:58,043
Better call the boss.

18
00:00:59,645 --> 00:01:02,514
Damn, I'm not getting
a smoke signal here.

19
00:01:02,548 --> 00:01:03,515
(plays rim shot)

20
00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:05,050
(rainstick rattles)

21
00:01:12,692 --> 00:01:14,593
Damn it, Stewie, what
the hell did you do?!

22
00:01:14,627 --> 00:01:16,128
I know, I know,
I messed up.

23
00:01:16,162 --> 00:01:17,262
(mocks):
"I messed up."

24
00:01:17,296 --> 00:01:18,563
You went back
to 17th-century Jamestown

25
00:01:18,598 --> 00:01:20,132
and you gave guns
to the Indians.

26
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:21,299
And now they're
running everything!

27
00:01:21,334 --> 00:01:23,001
I said I messed up,
all right?!

28
00:01:23,035 --> 00:01:24,302
I guess I just have

29
00:01:24,337 --> 00:01:25,704
this pathological need
to be liked.

30
00:01:25,738 --> 00:01:27,072
Well, it's not
a good trait.

31
00:01:27,106 --> 00:01:28,473
Aw, come on.
Don't say that.

32
00:01:28,508 --> 00:01:29,975
Let me buy you lunch.

33
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:32,310
Thanks to you, the Indians
killed all the white people

34
00:01:32,345 --> 00:01:33,545
and took over America.

35
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:35,447
I mean, you're the one
who's always saying,

36
00:01:35,481 --> 00:01:36,681
"Never alter the past."

37
00:01:36,716 --> 00:01:38,183
Oh, come on, Brian,
let's be honest.

38
00:01:38,217 --> 00:01:39,584
I frequently alter
the past.

39
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:43,188
All right, so, I guess
we'll split the bill 13 ways?

40
00:01:43,222 --> 00:01:46,158
Hey, Judas, he ordered,
like, five margaritas.

41
00:01:46,192 --> 00:01:48,760
All you had
was a salad.

42
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,137
You know, it actually
looks like

43
00:01:59,172 --> 00:02:01,173
the Native Americans have
done all right for themselves.

44
00:02:01,207 --> 00:02:03,208
They do seem to have
a lot of shops.

45
00:02:09,582 --> 00:02:12,284
And it looks like they have
medical care as well.

46
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:14,886
Ma'am, I'm sorry,
but I've done this

47
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:17,823
several times today, and your
husband just isn't responding.

48
00:02:17,857 --> 00:02:19,558
Well, have you
tried this?

49
00:02:19,592 --> 00:02:21,626
Ma'am, this is a place
of medicine.

50
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:23,895
And their popular music
is interesting.

51
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,097
And here it is,
the number one song

52
00:02:26,132 --> 00:02:28,567
for the 10,000th week in a row,

53
00:02:28,601 --> 00:02:30,669
"Huya-Huya-Huya"!

54
00:02:30,703 --> 00:02:33,305
(chanting):
♪ Huya-Huya-Huya-Huya

55
00:02:33,339 --> 00:02:36,274
♪ Huya-Huya-Huya-Huya...

56
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:37,442
Well, no matter..

57
00:02:37,477 --> 00:02:39,211
We better restore things
to the way they were.

58
00:02:39,245 --> 00:02:40,812
Let's go back to Jamestown
and undo...

59
00:02:40,847 --> 00:02:42,581
Oh, dear.
What? What is it?

60
00:02:42,615 --> 00:02:43,682
The return pad.

61
00:02:45,218 --> 00:02:47,486
Looks like it took some
bullets during our escape.

62
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,254
Doesn't seem
to be working.

63
00:02:49,288 --> 00:02:50,255
Hmm.

64
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:51,590
What?
Wha-What is that?

65
00:02:51,624 --> 00:02:52,724
What is that, "Hmm"?

66
00:02:52,758 --> 00:02:54,192
Wha-What are
you looking for?

67
00:02:54,227 --> 00:02:56,094
What are you looking
for specifically?

68
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,128
Yeah, that's right.

69
00:02:57,163 --> 00:02:58,697
But I'm afraid
our only hope

70
00:02:58,731 --> 00:03:00,131
is that perhaps
the alternate Stewie

71
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,299
in this universe
has created

72
00:03:01,334 --> 00:03:03,068
his own time machine
that we can use.

73
00:03:03,102 --> 00:03:04,169
Well, let's hope so,

74
00:03:04,203 --> 00:03:05,637
because otherwise
they're gonna kill us.

75
00:03:05,671 --> 00:03:06,972
Yeah, or stick us on

76
00:03:07,006 --> 00:03:08,486
some kind of white
people reservation.

77
00:03:10,243 --> 00:03:11,743
Don't give them
any money.

78
00:03:11,777 --> 00:03:14,212
They're just gonna spend
it all on deviled eggs.

79
00:03:21,921 --> 00:03:24,556
Well, there's my brave warrior.

80
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,891
How was work today?

81
00:03:25,925 --> 00:03:27,058
Oh, it was so annoying.

82
00:03:27,093 --> 00:03:28,627
Everyone was coming around
with their daughters,

83
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:29,828
selling Girl Scout corn.

84
00:03:29,862 --> 00:03:32,697
Made me feel so guilty,
I had to buy, like, 20 ears.

85
00:03:32,732 --> 00:03:36,034
Hey, shot in the dark, but,
uh, is anyone else in the mood

86
00:03:36,068 --> 00:03:40,739
to run really fast
in one direction?

87
00:03:40,773 --> 00:03:42,874
Look, there it is!

88
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:45,143
And it looks like he has
a return pad, too.

89
00:03:45,177 --> 00:03:46,511
All right, come on.

90
00:03:46,546 --> 00:03:49,614
Let's get back to Jamestown
and set things right.

91
00:03:49,649 --> 00:03:51,650
(zapping, whirring)

92
00:03:57,323 --> 00:03:59,658
Look, there you are
giving them the guns!

93
00:04:04,196 --> 00:04:05,564
What the hell
are you doing there?

94
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:07,399
You told me you were
checking on the horses.

95
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:08,554
Well, she's a
sizeable woman.

96
00:04:08,568 --> 00:04:09,568
That's what I meant.

97
00:04:15,107 --> 00:04:16,107
All right, come on.

98
00:04:16,142 --> 00:04:17,422
We've got to get
those guns back.

99
00:04:17,443 --> 00:04:19,077
Hey, hi,
how are you today?

100
00:04:19,111 --> 00:04:20,478
Good to see you.

101
00:04:20,513 --> 00:04:22,013
Listen, uh, we've
just been informed

102
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:23,481
that these guns
are defective.

103
00:04:23,516 --> 00:04:25,450
Uh, we're from
the gun company.

104
00:04:25,484 --> 00:04:26,885
Um, anyway, you know how

105
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:29,321
we like to take things back
from you people?

106
00:04:29,355 --> 00:04:31,590
Well, we're gonna go ahead
and take these back.

107
00:04:31,624 --> 00:04:32,991
That's right.
We're from GunCo..

108
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:34,492
(hushed): Shut up,
you're blowing it.

109
00:04:34,527 --> 00:04:36,461
Where you taking guns?

110
00:04:36,495 --> 00:04:39,164
Brian, grab
the return pad!

111
00:04:39,198 --> 00:04:41,499
Get 'um paleface!

112
00:04:43,369 --> 00:04:46,304
They're gone.
We can talk normal now.

113
00:04:50,576 --> 00:04:52,310
Well, everything looks
like it should.

114
00:04:52,345 --> 00:04:54,245
Only one way
to be certain.

115
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,247
Okay, let's do
a quick search here.

116
00:04:56,282 --> 00:04:57,882
"Native American
role models."

117
00:04:57,917 --> 00:04:58,950
"Zero results found."

118
00:04:58,985 --> 00:05:00,518
Looks like we did it, Brian.

119
00:05:00,553 --> 00:05:01,753
Ah, thank God!

120
00:05:01,787 --> 00:05:03,955
Hey, what are you gonna do
with all those guns?

121
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,391
I don't know, sell 'em
to some messed up kid?

122
00:05:09,996 --> 00:05:11,196
(metallic banging)

123
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,731
What the hell is that?

124
00:05:12,765 --> 00:05:14,165
Stewie?

125
00:05:18,704 --> 00:05:20,271
Oh, my God!
What are you doing?!

126
00:05:20,306 --> 00:05:22,941
This time machine has
almost killed us

127
00:05:22,975 --> 00:05:24,175
a hundred times, Brian.

128
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,111
And yesterday was
just too close a call.

129
00:05:26,145 --> 00:05:28,013
So I've decided
to get rid of it

130
00:05:28,047 --> 00:05:29,648
before something
irreparable happens.

131
00:05:29,682 --> 00:05:31,483
But, Stewie,
your-your time machine,

132
00:05:31,517 --> 00:05:32,851
it's, like, your crowning
achievement.

133
00:05:32,885 --> 00:05:34,486
I-I can't believe
you'd just destroy it.

134
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,054
Trust me, Brian,
it's for the best.

135
00:05:36,088 --> 00:05:38,323
And, hey, at least I've
had some fun with it.

136
00:05:38,357 --> 00:05:40,191
Do you know what
I did last week?

137
00:05:40,226 --> 00:05:41,493
I time-traveled
ahead to Christmas

138
00:05:41,527 --> 00:05:43,361
so I wouldn't have
to wait all year

139
00:05:43,396 --> 00:05:44,963
for the new toys
to come out.

140
00:05:44,997 --> 00:05:46,898
Wow, good timing,
little fella.

141
00:05:46,932 --> 00:05:48,466
This just came out today.

142
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:50,261
(chuckles) Yeah, I kind
of knew that already.

143
00:05:50,269 --> 00:05:52,037
Would you like to donate
an extra dollar

144
00:05:52,071 --> 00:05:53,271
to the Quahog Food Bank?

145
00:05:53,305 --> 00:05:54,639
Oh, sure.

146
00:05:54,674 --> 00:05:57,108
And would you like to come
home and clean my toilet,

147
00:05:57,143 --> 00:05:58,977
while we're both doing
stuff for each other?

148
00:06:10,623 --> 00:06:12,724
(sighs)
Well, I guess that's it.

149
00:06:12,758 --> 00:06:14,693
This is, like,
the end of an era.

150
00:06:14,727 --> 00:06:16,227
Oh, sack up, you twink.

151
00:06:16,262 --> 00:06:17,595
It's just a machine.

152
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,330
God, look at all
the perfectly good stuff

153
00:06:19,365 --> 00:06:21,066
that people just throw out
for no reason.

154
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,567
I don't know.
It's mostly twin mattresses.

155
00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:23,968
If you have
a twin mattress,

156
00:06:24,003 --> 00:06:26,137
aren't you pretty much
a failure as a human being?

157
00:06:26,172 --> 00:06:27,238
No, I mean it.

158
00:06:27,273 --> 00:06:28,840
Like, here, look at this
street hockey net.

159
00:06:28,874 --> 00:06:30,008
It's in great shape.

160
00:06:30,042 --> 00:06:32,243
You know, we should take this
home and set it up.

161
00:06:32,278 --> 00:06:33,678
Get some fresh air,
get some exercise.

162
00:06:33,713 --> 00:06:35,547
Well, I suppose I could
use a new hobby

163
00:06:35,581 --> 00:06:37,048
now that the time
machine is gone.

164
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,750
You sure you're
not gonna miss that thing?

165
00:06:38,784 --> 00:06:40,385
Nah, I was getting
bored of it anyway.

166
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:41,619
You know, not every
historical event

167
00:06:41,654 --> 00:06:43,321
is all it's
cracked up to be.

168
00:06:43,355 --> 00:06:45,223
Women, we've spent
decades fighting

169
00:06:45,257 --> 00:06:46,758
for our right to vote.

170
00:06:46,792 --> 00:06:50,061
So, when you go to those
booths and cast your ballot,

171
00:06:50,096 --> 00:06:53,832
remember, Warren G. Harding
is way the cutest!

172
00:06:53,866 --> 00:06:55,266
(all squealing, giggling)

173
00:06:55,301 --> 00:07:00,004
♪ Oh, girls just
want to have fun... ♪

174
00:07:01,874 --> 00:07:03,908
Okay, Brian, I'm just
putting this out there,

175
00:07:03,943 --> 00:07:05,076
but I'm a baby,

176
00:07:05,111 --> 00:07:07,412
and only dicks
don't let babies win.

177
00:07:07,446 --> 00:07:08,913
God, look at
this day, huh?

178
00:07:08,948 --> 00:07:10,882
You know, usually, I'd be
sitting inside writing,

179
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,650
you'd be working on one
of your machines.

180
00:07:12,685 --> 00:07:14,385
But here we are
enjoying it.

181
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,354
Yes, it is a nice change
of pace.

182
00:07:16,388 --> 00:07:18,523
Oh, wait, I got to go
grab my knee pads.

183
00:07:18,557 --> 00:07:20,759
I was using them for...
for-for this other thing.

184
00:07:20,793 --> 00:07:22,393
Anyway,
I'll be right back.

185
00:07:26,398 --> 00:07:27,699
Brian, look out!

186
00:07:32,071 --> 00:07:33,772
Ah, Brian!

187
00:07:33,806 --> 00:07:35,673
Oh, my God!

188
00:07:36,675 --> 00:07:39,144
Brian! Brian, can you hear me?!

189
00:07:39,178 --> 00:07:42,280
Holy crap!
What the hell happened?!

190
00:07:42,314 --> 00:07:44,349
That guy sucked.

191
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,325
Mom, is Brian gonna be okay?

192
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,660
I don't know, Meg.

193
00:07:53,694 --> 00:07:55,995
But this is the best
veterinarian in Quahog.

194
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,164
Brian's getting
the finest care there is.

195
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,500
He had to share the ambulance
with a chicken.

196
00:08:00,534 --> 00:08:03,603
Um, aren't you supposed
to be running around?

197
00:08:03,637 --> 00:08:04,971
Don't talk to me.

198
00:08:05,005 --> 00:08:07,707
You have a bad reputation
in the chicken community.

199
00:08:07,742 --> 00:08:09,242
Doctor, how is Brian?

200
00:08:09,276 --> 00:08:10,710
Is he gonna be okay?

201
00:08:10,745 --> 00:08:13,480
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Griffin,
but Brian's injuries

202
00:08:13,514 --> 00:08:15,815
are just too severe
for us to save him.

203
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,884
I don't know
how much longer he has,

204
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:20,687
but I suggest that you all go in
and say your good-byes.

205
00:08:31,332 --> 00:08:33,333
(monitor beeping steadily)

206
00:08:36,337 --> 00:08:38,071
Oh, my God!

207
00:08:38,105 --> 00:08:39,272
Brian, no!

208
00:08:39,306 --> 00:08:40,774
I can't believe it.

209
00:08:40,808 --> 00:08:42,475
Y-You're really...

210
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,277
Damn it, Brian,
you can't die!

211
00:08:44,311 --> 00:08:46,379
We were gonna do
so many things together.

212
00:08:46,414 --> 00:08:47,647
We were gonna become
windsurfers.

213
00:08:47,681 --> 00:08:49,883
I was gonna be
a little better than you,

214
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:51,384
but we were both
gonna be good!

215
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:52,886
(groans softly)

216
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,621
You guys,
I think, I think

217
00:08:54,655 --> 00:08:56,389
Brian's trying
to say something!

218
00:08:56,424 --> 00:09:01,428
You... you've given me
a wonderful life.

219
00:09:01,462 --> 00:09:03,329
I love you all.

220
00:09:06,867 --> 00:09:08,401
(monitor flatlines)

221
00:09:10,671 --> 00:09:13,406
I'm sorry, he's gone.

222
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:15,542
Oh, my God, he's...

223
00:09:15,576 --> 00:09:18,945
(voice breaking):
Yes, Chris, I'm afraid...

224
00:09:18,979 --> 00:09:21,915
I'm afraid that
our Brian is dead!

225
00:09:50,845 --> 00:09:53,813
Guys, I'm gonna need a few
minutes alone upstairs.

226
00:09:53,848 --> 00:09:57,383
I got to do, like,
a-a sad yank.

227
00:09:57,418 --> 00:09:59,452
Stupid street hockey.

228
00:09:59,487 --> 00:10:01,554
I wish we never went
to that dump.

229
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:03,089
Oh, this is all my fault.

230
00:10:03,123 --> 00:10:05,925
I'm the one who had to throw
away the damn time machine.

231
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,327
Wait a minute. That's it!

232
00:10:07,361 --> 00:10:09,496
I've just got to rebuild
the time machine,

233
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,664
and then I can go back
and save Brian!

234
00:10:12,967 --> 00:10:14,868
(tires screech)

235
00:10:14,902 --> 00:10:17,637
Oh, happy birthday, Neil!

236
00:10:20,741 --> 00:10:22,509
Stewie! How are you?

237
00:10:22,543 --> 00:10:25,211
Oh, not well, Yusuf.
I need your help.

238
00:10:25,246 --> 00:10:27,380
I have to track down
a titanium capacitor

239
00:10:27,414 --> 00:10:29,682
for a high-wattage mainframe
I'm going to construct.

240
00:10:29,717 --> 00:10:30,817
Titanium capacitors?

241
00:10:30,851 --> 00:10:32,919
Sorry, there's no way
to get those anymore.

242
00:10:32,953 --> 00:10:34,053
What do you mean?

243
00:10:34,088 --> 00:10:35,755
You've gotten them
for me before.

244
00:10:35,789 --> 00:10:39,325
I know, but the one guy who made
those drew a doodle of Mohammed,

245
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,194
so he's not around anymore.

246
00:10:41,228 --> 00:10:43,129
He wasn't even doing it
on purpose,

247
00:10:43,163 --> 00:10:45,265
just absentmindedly
while talking on the phone.

248
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:47,333
But it was Mohammed, so...

249
00:10:47,368 --> 00:10:48,535
you know.

250
00:10:48,569 --> 00:10:49,536
Oh, that's awful.

251
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:52,005
Okay, Yusuf,
thanks, anyway.

252
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,840
Oh, dear, Rupert,
without those capacitors,

253
00:10:53,874 --> 00:10:55,608
it'll be completely impossible

254
00:10:55,643 --> 00:10:57,310
to build
a functioning time machine.

255
00:10:57,344 --> 00:10:58,444
(sighs)

256
00:10:58,479 --> 00:11:02,181
I guess that means Brian
is really gone for good.

257
00:11:05,219 --> 00:11:07,220
(sobbing)

258
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,658
Thank you so much
for coming, guys.

259
00:11:11,692 --> 00:11:13,793
Brian would be very
thankful that you're here.

260
00:11:13,827 --> 00:11:14,961
No problem, Lois.

261
00:11:14,995 --> 00:11:16,596
You know, I usually
don't come to funerals.

262
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,931
Since I'm a cop,

263
00:11:17,965 --> 00:11:20,633
I always wind up getting hit
by a black woman with a purse.

264
00:11:20,668 --> 00:11:22,502
You find the man
who did this.

265
00:11:22,536 --> 00:11:24,704
Uh, ma'am, what's your relationship to Brian?
You bring him to justice!

266
00:11:24,738 --> 00:11:26,472
You make sure this angel child
didn't die for nothing!

267
00:11:26,507 --> 00:11:28,241
Are you sure you're at
the right funeral?

268
00:11:28,275 --> 00:11:29,625
Ma'am, Brian's a dog.

269
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:30,977
You show the world
why you became a cop!

270
00:11:30,978 --> 00:11:32,545
Okay.

271
00:11:34,582 --> 00:11:37,317
Thank you, everyone,
for coming today.

272
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:39,953
None of you people came
to my funeral!

273
00:11:42,456 --> 00:11:45,959
I know Peter wanted
to say a few words.

274
00:11:45,993 --> 00:11:47,160
(sighs))

275
00:11:47,194 --> 00:11:49,462
Oh, boy, this is, um...

276
00:11:49,496 --> 00:11:52,665
this is probably the worst pain
I've ever had to go through,

277
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,335
and I've sprained
my ankle twice.

278
00:11:55,369 --> 00:11:57,737
Um... the truth is,

279
00:11:57,771 --> 00:11:59,505
Brian wasn't just my dog.

280
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,208
He was my best friend
in the whole world.

281
00:12:02,242 --> 00:12:04,877
He was smart, he was loyal,

282
00:12:04,912 --> 00:12:08,047
and I guess what
I'm trying to say is

283
00:12:08,082 --> 00:12:10,316
he was like a brother to me.

284
00:12:10,351 --> 00:12:12,552
(voice breaking):
And I-I'm gonna spend

285
00:12:12,586 --> 00:12:14,721
the rest of my life missing him.

286
00:12:14,755 --> 00:12:16,356
(sniffling)

287
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,324
We're all gonna
miss him, Peter.

288
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:21,194
We're all gonna miss him
very much.

289
00:12:21,228 --> 00:12:23,229
(crying)

290
00:12:24,231 --> 00:12:25,431
Damn it, Ortiz.

291
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:27,467
Stop swinging at junk.

292
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:58,564
My God, I almost served
Brian again.

293
00:12:58,599 --> 00:13:01,200
I can't believe he's been gone
a whole month.

294
00:13:01,235 --> 00:13:03,069
Can we at least get rid
of the doggie door

295
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,871
so Chris doesn't keep
getting stuck in it?

296
00:13:04,905 --> 00:13:07,640
Every day I get
a little further in.

297
00:13:07,675 --> 00:13:09,208
You know, I hate to say it,

298
00:13:09,243 --> 00:13:10,943
but I-I'm starting to think
the only way

299
00:13:10,978 --> 00:13:13,846
to stop missing Brian
is to get a new dog.

300
00:13:13,881 --> 00:13:16,616
Or do we all get
Ghostbuster jumpsuits

301
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:17,817
with our names on them?

302
00:13:17,851 --> 00:13:19,452
♪ Who you gonna call?

303
00:13:19,486 --> 00:13:21,354
♪ The Griffins.

304
00:13:21,388 --> 00:13:22,689
I'm serious, Peter.

305
00:13:22,723 --> 00:13:24,957
I know it might take time
to find the right dog,

306
00:13:24,992 --> 00:13:26,893
but I really feel like
it might be

307
00:13:26,927 --> 00:13:28,728
the best way for us
to move on.

308
00:13:28,762 --> 00:13:30,196
Yeah, Dad.
That would be nice.

309
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,799
All right, well, I guess
it couldn't hurt to look.

310
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,267
Really? Another dog?

311
00:13:34,301 --> 00:13:36,169
Look, I miss Brian
more than any of you,

312
00:13:36,203 --> 00:13:37,870
but at least now
no one's forcing us

313
00:13:37,905 --> 00:13:40,406
to watch
those awful PBS documentaries.

314
00:13:40,441 --> 00:13:44,143
ANNOUNCER: <i>And now PBS presents</i>
Albino Children Are Normal.

315
00:13:44,178 --> 00:13:47,613
So, with the exception of not
being able to go out in the sun,

316
00:13:47,648 --> 00:13:48,915
you're completely normal?

317
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:50,950
Yes. The moon is my sun.

318
00:13:50,984 --> 00:13:52,618
I like to kill beetles.

319
00:13:52,653 --> 00:13:54,420
Beetles are teachers.

320
00:13:54,455 --> 00:13:56,856
I sleep with a fork.

321
00:13:59,893 --> 00:14:02,428
(birds singing, dogs barking)

322
00:14:02,463 --> 00:14:05,364
All right, guys, time to
find a new family dog.

323
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:06,966
Hey, Chris,
you're kind of a creep.

324
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,134
You should get a ferret.

325
00:14:08,168 --> 00:14:09,869
You're right, I am.

326
00:14:09,903 --> 00:14:11,204
And I will!

327
00:14:11,238 --> 00:14:12,572
(dogs barking)

328
00:14:12,606 --> 00:14:15,241
I don't know how to choose
between all these dogs.

329
00:14:15,275 --> 00:14:16,709
(New Jersey accent):
Hey, you, green pants.

330
00:14:16,744 --> 00:14:18,945
I hear you're looking for a dog
or something.

331
00:14:18,979 --> 00:14:21,447
Oh, finally, someone who sounds
like they went to college.

332
00:14:21,482 --> 00:14:23,082
Hi, I'm Peter.
Vinny.

333
00:14:23,117 --> 00:14:24,684
Oh, Vinny, like the Pooh.

334
00:14:24,718 --> 00:14:26,085
Hey, that's kind of cool.

335
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,186
So, what's your story?

336
00:14:27,221 --> 00:14:28,855
Well, you know,
I'm just a regular guy.

337
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:30,723
You throw a stick,
maybe I bring it back.

338
00:14:30,758 --> 00:14:33,793
Maybe I bring back
an iPhone that fell off a truck.

339
00:14:33,827 --> 00:14:34,961
So, what do you say?

340
00:14:34,995 --> 00:14:36,329
You want me as your dog?

341
00:14:36,363 --> 00:14:39,365
Yeah, I think I do!

342
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:41,400
Hey, just out of curiosity,
what breed are you?

343
00:14:41,435 --> 00:14:43,236
Actually, I'm a pussy hound.

344
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,704
Really? All right!

345
00:14:44,738 --> 00:14:47,039
That just means
I'm one-sixteenth cat.

346
00:14:47,074 --> 00:14:48,841
Oh, I wish you
hadn't told me that.

347
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,608
Well, Vinny,
welcome to our home.

348
00:14:57,642 --> 00:14:59,043
All right,
this is good.

349
00:14:59,077 --> 00:15:00,711
This is good.

350
00:15:00,745 --> 00:15:02,613
Hey, you guys got a good
banging-broads couch,

351
00:15:02,647 --> 00:15:03,681
you know that?

352
00:15:03,715 --> 00:15:05,149
Vinny,
you must be starving.

353
00:15:05,183 --> 00:15:06,684
What can I make you
for dinner?

354
00:15:06,718 --> 00:15:07,718
Are you kidding?

355
00:15:07,752 --> 00:15:08,986
You're a hardworking lady.

356
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,721
So, tonight, I'm gonna
make you dinner.

357
00:15:10,755 --> 00:15:12,089
Wow.
(chuckles)

358
00:15:12,123 --> 00:15:13,757
Well, thank you, Vinny.

359
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:14,925
Whoa, whoa, hang on, Lois.

360
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,393
You promised me
we were all eating

361
00:15:16,428 --> 00:15:17,761
my Play-Doh pasta tonight.

362
00:15:17,796 --> 00:15:20,264
Oh, Stewie, did you
make something?

363
00:15:20,298 --> 00:15:22,833
Mmm, oh, it's so yummy.

364
00:15:22,867 --> 00:15:24,835
Num, num, num, num, num.

365
00:15:24,869 --> 00:15:27,638
You better mean
those "nums."

366
00:15:27,672 --> 00:15:29,206
Hey, you,
what's your name?

367
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,374
Chris.

368
00:15:30,408 --> 00:15:32,109
How about I call
you Hat Boy?

369
00:15:32,143 --> 00:15:33,611
Hell yeah!

370
00:15:33,645 --> 00:15:34,845
Lower your voice, Chris.

371
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:36,647
It's Hat Boy, bitch!

372
00:15:36,681 --> 00:15:37,948
Wow, look at you, Vinny.

373
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,550
It's like you're already
part of the family.

374
00:15:39,584 --> 00:15:41,952
I don't know, fat man,
I think you're jumping the gun.

375
00:15:41,987 --> 00:15:44,455
I mean, crucifixion seemed great
at first, too.

376
00:15:44,489 --> 00:15:46,190
Why are you
doing that?

377
00:15:46,224 --> 00:15:47,891
'Cause I'm mad at this guy.

378
00:15:47,926 --> 00:15:50,027
I'm mad at this jar of
pickles I can't open.

379
00:15:50,061 --> 00:15:51,195
Nail it up.

380
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:57,267
Hey, guys, I want you to
meet our new dog, Vinny.

381
00:15:57,302 --> 00:15:59,036
Vinny, this is Joe
and Quagmire.

382
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,337
Hey, Vinny.
How you doing?

383
00:16:00,372 --> 00:16:01,372
Real good.

384
00:16:01,406 --> 00:16:02,840
Hey, so I hear
you're a cop.

385
00:16:02,874 --> 00:16:03,974
That's right.

386
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:05,009
Hey, that's great.

387
00:16:05,043 --> 00:16:06,343
Maybe sometime
you could take me

388
00:16:06,378 --> 00:16:08,479
on a ride-along with you,
show me the neighborhood.

389
00:16:08,513 --> 00:16:10,914
Yeah, I don't take people out
on ride-alongs anymore.

390
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:13,951
I had a bad experience
with Grimace.

391
00:16:16,488 --> 00:16:20,324
I got to be honest, I can't
get a bead on you, man.

392
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:31,769
Oh, boy, Vinny, hanging out
with you has been the best.

393
00:16:31,803 --> 00:16:32,836
You want another beer?

394
00:16:32,871 --> 00:16:34,104
No.

395
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:35,305
I'd love one!

396
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,607
(both laugh)

397
00:16:36,641 --> 00:16:38,409
What? What? The first
thing you said was...

398
00:16:38,443 --> 00:16:40,210
(laughing hysterically):
Oh, my God!

399
00:16:40,245 --> 00:16:42,513
You're on... you're, like,
on another level, Vinny!

400
00:16:43,848 --> 00:16:44,915
Congratulations.

401
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:46,650
You've won over
a complete imbecile.

402
00:16:46,685 --> 00:16:47,785
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

403
00:16:47,819 --> 00:16:49,486
Did you just speak
ill of the man

404
00:16:49,521 --> 00:16:51,155
who busts his tail
providing for you?

405
00:16:51,189 --> 00:16:53,290
He spent my college fund
on puppet clothes.

406
00:16:53,324 --> 00:16:55,659
Hey, don't get fresh
with me, Estudio.

407
00:16:55,694 --> 00:16:56,894
That's not my name.

408
00:16:56,928 --> 00:16:58,996
That's not even
an Italian version of my name.

409
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,264
Oh, whatever.

410
00:17:00,298 --> 00:17:02,132
PETER: Hey, Vinny, you
want to see a puppet show?

411
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:04,435
They all got
leather jackets!

412
00:17:04,469 --> 00:17:05,703
God, what a jerk.

413
00:17:05,737 --> 00:17:07,237
If this guy thinks
he's sticking around,

414
00:17:07,272 --> 00:17:08,505
he's sorely mistaken.

415
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,940
I'm going to ruin him.

416
00:17:09,974 --> 00:17:12,409
Just like I ruined
that magician's act.

417
00:17:14,112 --> 00:17:15,245
(applause)

418
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,281
People, people, people.

419
00:17:17,315 --> 00:17:19,650
This man drives a Saturn.

420
00:17:22,921 --> 00:17:24,788
All right, Rupert,
I've been left with no choice.

421
00:17:24,823 --> 00:17:27,157
I'm going to tell Vinny
so much bad news

422
00:17:27,192 --> 00:17:28,425
about Italian-Americans

423
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,427
that he goes
into cardiac arrest.

424
00:17:30,462 --> 00:17:31,895
Vinny, there you are.

425
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,263
I have some
terrible news.

426
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:36,100
Sal Annuncio's kid was
killed by a falling piano!

427
00:17:36,134 --> 00:17:38,235
Oh! How could this happen?!

428
00:17:38,269 --> 00:17:39,870
That kid was
an honors student!

429
00:17:39,904 --> 00:17:41,872
He'd just applied
to SUNY Albany.

430
00:17:41,906 --> 00:17:43,574
He just <i>got in</i>
to SUNY Albany.

431
00:17:43,608 --> 00:17:45,008
(groans):
Oh!

432
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:46,276
This is too much, Stewie.

433
00:17:46,311 --> 00:17:47,444
I can't take it.

434
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:49,012
Oh, my God, it's working.

435
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:50,814
Hey, Vinny, Bobby
Lammaduro's kid

436
00:17:50,849 --> 00:17:52,349
just got out of
the hospital.

437
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,118
He beat the cancer!

438
00:17:54,152 --> 00:17:55,819
Oh, thank heavens.

439
00:17:55,854 --> 00:17:59,089
Big man in the sky
knows what he's doing.

440
00:17:59,124 --> 00:18:00,457
Chris, what are you doing?

441
00:18:00,492 --> 00:18:02,760
Call me a creep,
you piece of crap!

442
00:18:06,264 --> 00:18:07,898
Hey, Doonesbury,

443
00:18:07,932 --> 00:18:10,734
how about a joke that ain't
for fancy millionaires?

444
00:18:10,769 --> 00:18:12,770
(Stewie sniffling)

445
00:18:14,939 --> 00:18:17,975
(sobbing)

446
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:20,010
(sobbing continues)

447
00:18:21,412 --> 00:18:23,714
Stewie, what's with
the waterworks?

448
00:18:23,748 --> 00:18:25,949
Oh, um, um...
I-I just...

449
00:18:25,984 --> 00:18:28,051
I realized I paid too much
for my muffler.

450
00:18:28,086 --> 00:18:29,753
Come on, kid,
quit crying.

451
00:18:29,788 --> 00:18:31,522
You're gonna get
your pants wrinkled.

452
00:18:31,556 --> 00:18:32,890
What's the matter?

453
00:18:32,924 --> 00:18:34,091
(sighs)
Fine.

454
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,726
Do you want to know
what's the matter?

455
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,027
You're the matter.

456
00:18:37,061 --> 00:18:39,263
Everyone in this family
is so damn thrilled with you,

457
00:18:39,297 --> 00:18:40,964
they've forgotten
all about Brian.

458
00:18:40,999 --> 00:18:42,366
Well, I'm not thrilled.

459
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,101
I'll never forget Brian.

460
00:18:44,135 --> 00:18:45,803
He was my best friend.

461
00:18:45,837 --> 00:18:49,072
You're not supposed to lose
your best friend at my age.

462
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:51,542
You're not supposed
to lose him ever!

463
00:18:51,576 --> 00:18:54,645
Look, Stewie, I know it
doesn't seem like it now,

464
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:56,113
but you're gonna be okay.

465
00:18:56,147 --> 00:18:57,981
Yeah, right.
How do you know?

466
00:18:58,016 --> 00:19:02,152
Because, I once had a thing
happen to me with some stuff.

467
00:19:02,187 --> 00:19:03,720
Really?
That's what's happening to me.

468
00:19:03,755 --> 00:19:04,988
Stuff.

469
00:19:05,023 --> 00:19:06,957
You know, before you guys
found me at the shop,

470
00:19:06,991 --> 00:19:08,692
I lived with an old man
named Leo.

471
00:19:08,726 --> 00:19:11,128
It was just him and me
in a tiny apartment,

472
00:19:11,162 --> 00:19:12,496
and we got pretty tight.

473
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,398
He kind of became
my whole world.

474
00:19:14,432 --> 00:19:18,068
By the time he passed away,
it was real tough.

475
00:19:18,102 --> 00:19:20,070
So, how did he die?

476
00:19:20,104 --> 00:19:21,738
He tried to go
to a yoga class,

477
00:19:21,773 --> 00:19:24,374
and on the first pose, his
ball sack split in half.

478
00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:25,442
Really?

479
00:19:25,476 --> 00:19:26,743
Yeah, it was
on <i>Dateline.</i>

480
00:19:26,778 --> 00:19:28,045
It was a whole thing.

481
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,281
Anyway, I guess Leo was
kind of like my Brian.

482
00:19:31,316 --> 00:19:33,951
Well, so,
how'd you get over him?

483
00:19:33,985 --> 00:19:35,919
Well, I met your family
in the pet store.

484
00:19:35,954 --> 00:19:37,788
When I saw you guys
looking for a dog,

485
00:19:37,822 --> 00:19:39,690
I kind of sensed
you were all going through

486
00:19:39,724 --> 00:19:41,525
the same feelings of loss
that I was.

487
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:42,926
And it made me think,

488
00:19:42,961 --> 00:19:44,928
hey, maybe I was meant
to find these guys.

489
00:19:44,963 --> 00:19:47,564
Maybe we were meant
to be together.

490
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:49,199
You know what, Vinny?

491
00:19:49,234 --> 00:19:51,902
I'm starting to think
that may be true.

492
00:19:51,936 --> 00:19:54,471
(chuckles)
Bring it in, Stewie.

493
00:19:58,977 --> 00:20:00,978
Hey, Stewie,
now that we're pals,

494
00:20:01,012 --> 00:20:02,779
maybe you can
answer me something.

495
00:20:02,814 --> 00:20:05,115
Why does your living room
smell so much like puke?

496
00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:07,184
Somebody throw up a
lot in there once?

497
00:20:07,218 --> 00:20:10,254
Vinny, my friend, you got a lot
of stories to catch up on.

498
00:20:10,288 --> 00:20:11,788
I got most of them on DVD.

499
00:20:11,823 --> 00:20:12,890
Oh, cool.

500
00:20:12,924 --> 00:20:14,691
Like, by season
and stuff?

501
00:20:14,726 --> 00:20:17,461
(chuckles)
No, not by season.

502
00:20:21,966 --> 00:20:24,134
Boy, I can't remember
the last time

503
00:20:24,168 --> 00:20:25,936
Stewie fell asleep
this early.

504
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,505
Well, I think the little guy
had a long day.

505
00:20:28,539 --> 00:20:30,908
All right, come on,
time for bed, Vinny.

506
00:20:30,942 --> 00:20:33,210
I'll tell Peter to turn off
the nightlight this time.

507
00:20:33,244 --> 00:20:35,879
PETER: No! I need it
for in case there's witches!

508
00:20:35,914 --> 00:20:37,147
You know, actually, Lois,

509
00:20:37,181 --> 00:20:39,583
I think I'm gonna sleep
in here with Stewie tonight.

510
00:20:39,617 --> 00:20:41,618
Oh, well,
isn't that nice.

511
00:20:41,653 --> 00:20:43,320
Sleep tight, you two.

512
00:20:46,424 --> 00:20:47,524
(yawns)

513
00:20:47,558 --> 00:20:48,592
Good night, Vinny.

514
00:20:48,626 --> 00:20:50,127
Good night, Stewie.

515
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,372
Hey, you guys know
which room is Peter's?

516
00:20:52,373 --> 00:20:53,621
Across the hall.

517
00:20:53,646 --> 00:20:56,537
Ah, it's too bright in there.
Never mind.
