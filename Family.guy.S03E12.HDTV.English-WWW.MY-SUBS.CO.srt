- Hi, Chris.
- Hi, Barbara.

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,290
I'm having a birthday party.
I was hoping you could come.

12
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,630
Oh, no! Someone peed in my pants!

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You're funny. Well, I hope you can make it.

14
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,710
Your friend's party sounds like fun, Chris.

15
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,250
But I hope the cake's better
than the last party I went to.

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,460
Oh, God. Coconut.

17
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:09,460
I wanna get Barbara a really nice gift. What
kind of gifts have boys gotten for you, Meg?

18
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,010
Oh... well...

19
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,550
My boyfriend Prince William
got me this beautiful watch.

20
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,880
And this diamond tiara.
And this wonderful sceptre.

21
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,050
She needs to get laid, big-time.

22
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,920
I read a book saying women are from Venus,
so here's what you get her.

23
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,720
Layers of sulphuric acid,
viscous surface rock,

24
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,300
and coronae, which seem to be domes over
large magma chambers. Here's five dollars.

25
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,930
That's OK, Dad. I was thinking about getting
a paper route so I could buy her gift myself.

26
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,430
I think that's very sweet, honey.

27
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:50,090
Oh, boy. I remember my first job.
I was in a folk music trio.

28
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,090
Hey, how about
"Here's To You, Mrs Fleckenstein"?

29
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,550
You've been pitching that for an hour.
It's not an attractive name.

30
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,890
Oh, fine.

31
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,970
I suppose we're also not going with

32
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,430
"Parsley, Sage,
Rosemary and Lawry's Seasoning Salt".

33
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,100
That's it. I'm going to Nam.

34
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:13,850
Hey, there, young fella.
Bringin' me good news today?

35
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,220
- What?
- Come on over here, son.

36
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,140
Hand me the paper,
so I don't need to use my grabber.

37
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,720
Mm.

38
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,470
- That's a nice muscly throwin' arm you got.
- Uh, thanks.

39
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,730
Got a nice tip for you right here
in my pocket, but my arthritis...

40
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,640
Why don't you reach in
and fish it out for yourself?

41
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,310
That's OK, mister.
I don't collect till the end of the month.

42
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,890
I'll see you tomorrow. Weird.

43
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,140
- I hope you like it.
- Wow, perfume. That is so sweet.

44
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:51,560
It'll make you smell like Elizabeth Taylor. So
I guess you'll smell of bourbon and Vicodin.

45
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,350
- That's very thoughtful.
- Can I spray some on you?

46
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,060
- Ow! My eyes!
- They're beautiful.

47
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,770
Just get away from me, Chris!

48
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,900
I'm so awkward!

49
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,860
Hey, muscly-arm. Why the long face?

50
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:14,570
It's this girl. I can't talk to her. It's like
girls are a different species or somethin'.

51
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:18,860
- Aw, who needs 'em? You like Popsicles?
- Well, sure.

52
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:25,190
Then you need to come on down to the cellar.
I got a whole freezer full of Popsicles. Mm.

53
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,610
No, thanks. I gotta get goin'.

54
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,110
Don't make me beg, now.

55
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,320
You're funny. Bye.

56
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,530
Get your fat ass back here.

57
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,690
- This is a hold-up. Open the register.
- It only opens when you make a sale.

58
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:49,150
All right, then give me one of them
horoscope scrolls and some Skittles.

59
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,030
"Financial transaction
benefits you today. " Oooh!

60
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,320
Weird!

61
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,490
All right! A bike! I'm outta here.

62
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:15,320
Your parents are on their way, but since time
is a factor here we'd like to get an ID quickly.

63
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:20,950
- Are you sure he can't see me?
- Absolutely, Chris. You're 100% safe.

64
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,660
OK. That's him. Number six.

65
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,910
Hi. Excuse me, you guys.
I'm here to pick up my son, Chris Griffin.

66
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:33,540
He's here to finger the guy who held up that
store. Maybe you've seen him. Chris Griffin.

67
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,990
Wait a second, I got a picture of him
somewhere. Here you go.

68
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,370
Hang on to that, I got a ton of 'em at home.
I was gonna throw that one out anyway.

69
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:46,450
Chris messed it up by writing his school
schedule and a list of his fears on the back.

70
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:53,540
We're so proud of you, Chris,
for helping to put that horrible man in jail.

71
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,160
You couldn't have said
it was Céline Dion, huh?

72
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,410
Our chance to put that showboating
Canadian wench behind bars and you blow it.

73
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,500
We now return
to the "E! True Hollywood Story: ALF".

74
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,870
By the third season
I was completely wasted all the time.

75
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,460
I'd lost all control of my bodily functions.

76
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,000
They had to cut the crap out of my fur
before each taping.

77
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,290
But, uh, would I do it all again?

78
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,130
We interrupt this programme
for a news story.

79
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:26,380
Now over to Rhode Island State Penitentiary
and Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa. Tricia?

80
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:33,250
I'm at this maximum-security facility, where a
ruthless thug has engineered a daring escape.

81
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,670
Sir, do you have any plans
now that you're out of jail?

82
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:41,040
Yeah. I'm gonna go bang my girlfriend,
and then I'm gonna kill Chris Griffin!

83
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,050
Good Lord!

84
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,590
Can they really say
"bang my girlfriend" on TV?

85
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,500
You wanna remove us from the area?

86
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:58,050
This man will stop at nothing. We're placing
you all in the Witness Protection Program.

87
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,630
Is Europe an option? I've always wanted
to spend a year in Prague teaching English.

88
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,340
Slacking off,
but really getting to know myself.

89
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,880
Until we catch this guy,
you'll be relocated to the Deep South.

90
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,590
The Deep South?

91
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,760
Where the black guys are really lazy,

92
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,930
and the white guys are just as lazy but
they're mad at the black guys for being lazy?

93
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,680
Jenkins and I have been assigned
to live here and watch your house.

94
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,800
He's a slovenly liberal
and I'm a fastidious conservative.

95
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,180
- I smell a sitcom!
- I suggest you start packing immediately.

96
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,800
I can't believe I have to change schools
because of you. This is all your fault, Lardo.

97
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,600
- Me? I had nothing to do with it.
- I meant Chris.

98
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,890
Oh. Yeah, Lardo.

99
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:45,760
Look, everybody. Here we are.
The town of Bumblescum.

100
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,600
- This is our house?
- Come on, Meg.

101
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,010
I bet if we fixed it up a little bit,
it could be a piece of crap.

102
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,560
- What's that smell?
- It's either bad meat or good cheese.

103
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,730
There's a penny underneath that couch.

104
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,350
Somebody's in the closet!

105
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:19,310
You know you're a redneck
when your gun rack has a gun rack on it.

106
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,600
You suck!

107
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,940
Oh, my. Well, it's too hot to cook anyway.
Peter, what's the upstairs like?

108
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,020
There's a Crunch Berry under the fridge.

109
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,650
Mom, Chris found a jar in the basement
and it has a hand in it.

110
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:38,900
I'm gonna plant it and see if a human grows.

111
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,270
Well, at least the TV gets decent reception.

112
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,350
Must be some kind of nature show.

113
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,060
Help! Help! Get it off! Aaargh!

114
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,810
Great. We're here five minutes
and Dad gets mauled by a rodent.

115
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,940
- This place is horrible.
- OK, everybody calm down.

116
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,650
We don't know anything
about this community.

117
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:01,610
I bet if we explore the town
we'll each find something about it we like.

118
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,400
That's a great idea.
I just gotta hit the can.

119
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,400
I think there's just an outhouse.

120
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:12,320
Hey, Lois? I don't get how this works.
It's just a hole.

121
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,730
I don't think it goes anywhere.

122
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,110
No, it definitely doesn't go anywhere.

123
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,980
Aaaargh!

124
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,440
Oh, God!

125
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,900
Oh, it's everywhere! Aaaaargh!

126
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:28,280
It's in my raccoon wounds! Oh, God!

127
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,900
- Excuse me, do you have an ATM?
- Over there, ma'am.

128
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,400
- How much you wanna take out?
- 40 dollars.

129
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:39,740
There's a service charge of a buck 50.
Do y'all accept?

130
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,400
Yes.

131
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,530
Mm. You smell like
the inside of my momma's purse.

132
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,820
Thank you.

133
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:53,570
What are those dulcet tones?
Why, this is the music of the angels!

134
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,450
- What is that magical device?
- Banjo.

135
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,620
Pluck that string.

136
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:06,200
Oh, I feel so deliciously white-trash.
Mommy, I want a mullet!

137
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,950
All right, that about does it.

138
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:13,370
- Isn't she beautiful, Brian?
- The Duke boys would be proud.

139
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,620
Yeah, and you gotta get in
through the window, like this.

140
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,330
OK, now you.

141
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:22,660
Oh, sorry. I forgot to roll yours down.

142
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,370
You all right?

143
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,120
Hello?

144
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,410
Wake up, sleepyhead.

145
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,160
- Hi.
- Hi.

146
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,290
- Are you mad at that pond?
- Shoot, no.

147
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,000
'Course, this pond did kill my grandpappy.

148
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,580
He saw his reflection, thought it was him
and drowned trying to save himself.

149
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,160
That's why Mom
doesn't let me look in the toilet.

150
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,370
- I'm Sam.
- I'm Chris.

151
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,250
Sam, come on in, now.

152
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:58,500
Well, I gotta go help my daddy bring in the
mud harvest. Nice making your acquaintance.

153
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,120
Oh, my God, I'm drowning!

154
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:08,080
That was Merle Haggard with
"I Kissed My Sweetie With My Fist". Next...

155
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,460
There's one. Let's jump that.

156
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,040
Yeee-haaa!

157
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:23,590
That was great! Next time, let's get Meg
to be Boss Hogg and Chris can be Anus.

158
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,040
- Enos.
- What'd I say?

159
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,840
Anus.

160
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,130
Class, we have a new student joinin' us.

161
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:36,210
Everyone, please welcome
Megan Griffin, from the North.

162
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:41,010
What's it like there?
Y'all got them talkin' pictures?

163
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:44,130
- And flyin' machines?
- And perfume for your armpits?

164
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,920
- We sure do.
- Wow.

165
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:51,840
All right, that's enough questions for Megan.
Time to hand back last week's spelling tests.

166
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,170
- And it looks like Oinky's set the curve again.
- Dang.

167
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:58,170
- That is some smart pig.
- Good thing I copied off Oinky.

168
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,880
Ta-da! Possum surprise.

169
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,470
Actually, I made it with Shake 'n Bake.

170
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:08,300
- And I helped.
- Kids, where's your father?

171
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,090
Yeee-haaa!

172
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:17,050
- What the hell are you doing?!
- Blendin' in. Relax, Lois. It's not our house.

173
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:21,720
I'm glad you're having fun, but we need
money. Have you thought about a job?

174
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,010
Yes, Lois, I have. But I've also thought
about getting fired from that job.

175
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,220
Is that something you wanna put our family
through? Think about that while I get a drink.

176
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,800
Aaagh! Aaargh! Oh, God! Aaagh!

177
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,060
It's right up here past this clearing.

178
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,970
- He's been here about three months now.
- Wow.

179
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,140
Where do you think you go when you die?

180
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,260
I learned at church that
if you're good you go to heaven.

181
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:49,350
If you're bad, you go to a place
where the dead believe they're still livin'

182
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:52,770
and they pray for death,
but death won't come.

183
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,180
UPN?

184
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:59,350
- You're funny. I like you, Chris.
- I like you too, Sam.

185
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,930
- Wanna poke him?
- Do I?!

186
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:08,390
You know, it's true.
The best things in life really are free.

187
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,190
I don't know. Maybe Lois is right.
Maybe it is time for me to get a job.

188
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,390
You always blow it in the interview.

189
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,390
So, Peter, where do you see yourself
in five years?

190
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,230
Don't say "Doing your wife. "

191
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,310
Doing your...

192
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,690
son?

193
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,190
Hey, Brian. Look at that.

194
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:34,360
Y'all interested? We take turns being sheriff.
You just hang out here, eat pie and get drunk.

195
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,730
Hold on a second. "Pie"? "Drunk"? "The"?

196
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,810
You got yourself a sheriff!

197
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,820
- Boy, it's so quiet around here.
- I know.

198
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,610
The phone hasn't rung all day.

199
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:52,570
I kn... I know. There's nothin'...
nothin' to, um...

200
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,820
to, uh...

201
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,940
um...

202
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,780
uh... Oh, boy,
what's the word I'm looking for? Do.

203
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,490
Brian, you're drunk. You're drunk.

204
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,690
Give me your keys.

205
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:12,280
- What is this, Dad?
- A Southern tradition, son.

206
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,780
It's a re-enactment of the Civil War.

207
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,990
Robert E Lee. I knew I'd find you here,
where they seat the sorry-ass losers.

208
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:28,820
Ulysses S Grant, you invite me to lunch
then show up an hour late, drunk?

209
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:33,740
I was busy lookin' for your wife,
to give her the old...

210
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,660
Sir, this means war.

211
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,110
I am vanquished.

212
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,700
I hereby declare victory
in the name of the Confederacy.

213
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,820
Excuse me. I don't think
that's how it happened.

214
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,950
- I'm pretty sure the North won.
- What are you sayin'?

215
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,450
That drunken idiot kicked your sorry asses
south of the Donna Dixon Line.

216
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:59,160
We don't take kindly
to that sort of talk, mister.

217
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,990
And I sure as shoot don't want
your kid hangin' round with my kid.

218
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,830
And if you think I'm mad now, you gotta
answer to them Civil War survivors.

219
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:15,200
Wait! Look over there! It's an interracial
gay couple burning the American flag!

220
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,750
Get 'em!

221
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,870
- I guess we can't hang out any more.
- I guess not.

222
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,210
That sucks,
cos I really like spending time with you.

223
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,410
Me too.

224
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,790
What are you doing?

225
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:44,580
Them Griffin boys better
grow some wings, or start flappin' their arms.

226
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,290
- Lost 'em!
- Blasted Lincoln-lovers.

227
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,750
Anyone seen my foot?

228
00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:02,920
Man, was last night weird. I kissed a boy! But
I really like him as a friend. His name is Sam.

229
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,420
- You kissed Sam last night?
- How did you know?

230
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,000
You said it out loud.
I heard you in the other room.

231
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:11,550
The weird thing is,
kissing Sam kind of felt right.

232
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:15,210
But I don't know if I can face him again.
Brian, what should I do?

233
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,420
I haven't been this confused
since the end of No Way Out.

234
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,550
How does Kevin Costner keep getting work?

235
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,210
- Argh! How do I shoot? How do I shoot?
- Press B button.

236
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,800
- Telegram for Chris Griffin.
- He's not here.

237
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,380
- Where is he?
- I can't release that information.

238
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:40,840
Oh, did I say Chris? I meant Chris's sister.

239
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,630
Oh, well, if it's for Meg,
that's a whole other story. Here's her address.

240
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,430
- What are you doing?
- You were busy. I played your guy.

241
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,130
- I didn't wanna play.
- So it's good for everybody.

242
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,470
- I'm gonna draw boobs on the Etch A Sketch.
- They'll end up square.

243
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:58,550
- Oh, hi, Chris.
- Hey.

244
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,090
Um, listen, Sam.
I like hangin' out with you and all,

245
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,640
it's just that I don't want
a romantic relationship.

246
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,510
- But I'd like it if we could still be friends.
- I'd like that too. Wanna go for a swim?

247
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,510
Sure.

248
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,010
- You're a girl?!
- Of course I am.

249
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,890
Oh, my God!

250
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,890
Warm out today.

251
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,470
Warm yesterday.

252
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,680
Even warmer today.

253
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:36,470
"Met her on my CB, said her name was Mimi

254
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,890
- " Sounded like an angel come to earth
- " Come to earth

255
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,140
"When I went to meet her,
man, you should have seen her

256
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:46,140
- " Twice as tall as me, three times the girth
- " Girth

257
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,890
- " Oh, my fat baby loves to eat
- " Loves to eat

258
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,350
"A big old Buddha belly
and her breasts swing past her feet

259
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:56,480
"My fat baby loves to eat

260
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,890
"My big ole fat-ass baby loves to eat

261
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,640
I got blisters on my fingers!

262
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:08,980
- A drop more of the shine, my dear?
- Yes, please.

263
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,400
You know, the kids are gonna be
at that town social for a while.

264
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,440
I think I know where you're going.

265
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,690
Aaagh! Aaagh! Oh, God! Aaagh! Aaagh!

266
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,770
Hello?

267
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,440
Hello, Mrs Griffin? Yeah.
Shh! Shut up! You guys, shut up!

268
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,230
Yeah, this is the FBI, calling from your house.

269
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,730
Oh, hi. How is everything?

270
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,730
Good, good. Real good.

271
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:37,520
Listen, promise you won't be mad,
and it's probably nothing,

272
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:43,570
but you know that criminal who's after your
son? He might know where you guys are.

273
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:48,360
What?! Peter, that criminal is on his way here
to kill Chris. We gotta call the sheriff.

274
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,690
Holy crap. I'm on it, Lois.

275
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:57,400
Sheriff's office. Yes, this is Peter Griffin. I'd
like to report a criminal coming into town.

276
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:02,400
I'm sorry, could you repeat your name?
Yes, it's Peter Griffin. G-r-i-f-f-i-n.

277
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:05,530
- You're the sheriff?
- One sec, honey. I'm on the phone.

278
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,780
- Who's that? My wife.
- Peter, Chris is in danger!

279
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,950
Do something! Round up a posse.

280
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:16,070
Yeah, well, see, I kinda pissed off the whole
town at that Civil War re-enactment.

281
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,780
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know, Lois.

282
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,780
But I feel lower than a bow-legged caterpillar.

283
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,410
Now here's Roy.

284
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:32,530
- Sure is a ding-dang of a hoedown.
- Uh-uh. This here's a hootenanny.

285
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,410
- Hoedown!
- Hootenanny!

286
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,580
- Hoedown!
- Hootenanny!

287
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,950
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.

288
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:47,200
Oh, and to the owner of a John Deere tractor,
you're parked on top of a pig.

289
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,910
John Deere tractor on top of a pig.

290
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,990
- Sam, can I talk to you?
- Sure. But why aren't you lookin' at me?

291
00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:00,040
Well, that's the thing. I'm no good at talking
to girls. That's why I ran away from you.

292
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,790
You didn't have trouble talkin' to me
when you thought I was a boy.

293
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,870
Yeah, that's true.

294
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,250
- Just pretend I'm a boy.
- OK.

295
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:11,290
You wanna go down
to the old town bridge and make out?

296
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,960
Yes, sir!

297
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,370
And in the city,
glasses are considered really sexy.

298
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,040
Ooooh.

299
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,370
Dang, I hope her brother
don't already have dibs on her.

300
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:27,620
- Where's Chris? That criminal's here.
- He's down by the old town bridge.

301
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,960
You know, my brother
is the one he's here to kill.

302
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,500
My daughter would absolutely love you.

303
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,880
You're so cute.
You're like a skinny Garth Brooks.

304
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,000
- Aha! I got you now, Griffin!
- Aaagh!

305
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,590
- Not so fast, buddy!
- Who are you?

306
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,840
You can call me Officer TJ Hooker.

307
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,540
Sheriff Officer TJ Hooker.

308
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,920
And this is my deputy, McMillan and Wife.

309
00:19:55,050 --> 00:20:00,550
I hated TJ Hooker. And I never actually saw
McMillan and Wife, although I was aware of it.

310
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,050
Anyway, you're dead!

311
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,550
Ha! You're mine now, fella!

312
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,210
Aagh! Aagh!

313
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:13,170
Aargh! Dad! Help! Dad!

314
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:18,670
- You folks all right?
- Wow, you guys saved our lives.

315
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,720
And after I said
all Southerners have bad teeth

316
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,670
and the gum disease known as gingivitis.

317
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,550
We take care of our own. And as long as
y'all live here, y'all are Southerners too.

318
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:35,260
- Wow. Thanks.
- It's our pleasure. Sam, I'll see you at home.

319
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:39,010
I think the lesson here is
it doesn't matter where you're from,

320
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:42,140
as long as we're all the same religion.

321
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,970
- It was great having you in class, Meg.
- Thanks. I'm really gonna miss everybody.

322
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:52,430
We didn't have no money for a present,
so we all just spit in a jar.

323
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,550
- I can't believe you're leavin'.
- Me either.

324
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,010
- I'll be sure to write.
- And I'll be sure to learn to read.

325
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:05,260
Next time I see a dead guy, I'm gonna
poke him twice as hard for both of us.

326
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:13,680
Ah, it's so nice to be home.

327
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:17,020
You have 113 new messages.

328
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,810
Oh, my.

329
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:23,600
Uh, yeah,
I was just wondering... uh... mm-hm...

330
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,890
where the newspaper boy was.

331
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:31,600
Haven't seen a newspaper in a couple of days.
Wonderin' if you're ever gonna come back.

332
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,020
Guess who.
Sorry to leave you so many messages.

333
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:41,940
Just lonely here, thinkin' 'bout
the muscly-armed paper boy.

334
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:46,100
Wishin' he'd bring me some good news.

335
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:48,270
Where are you?

336
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:52,980
You're startin' to piss me off,
you little piggly son of a bitch. Call me.
