<i>La team Aeon vous présente :</i>

00:00:03,413 --> 00:00:07,066
<i>Family Guy Saison 7 Episode 1 : Love Blactually (V.O)</i>

3
00:00:07,186 --> 00:00:10,357
<i>Ont participés à l'épisode : SRV74, Weasel Busters, Arthuruss.</i>

4
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:12,606
<i>Merci à Raton et Sib.</i>

5
00:00:33,446 --> 00:00:36,970
Come on kids, people are gonna start showing up for the costume party any minute.

6
00:00:37,683 --> 00:00:39,936
- Hey, nice snoopy costume Brian.
- Thanks.

7
00:00:40,633 --> 00:00:42,617
Well I guess it's not true what they say,

8
00:00:42,578 --> 00:00:45,409
You can punch snoopy in the stomach as hard as you can and he
won't feel it.

9
00:00:45,529 --> 00:00:47,531
- That's Houdini.
- No, Brian.

10
00:00:47,515 --> 00:00:48,717
Now, get up and do the dance.

11
00:00:48,701 --> 00:00:50,165
Oh no, I'm not gonna do the dance.

12
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:51,058
Do the dance!

13
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,344
Hey quagmire,

14
00:01:01,356 --> 00:01:03,713
Oh cool you're dressed like Napolean Dynamite.

15
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,003
Hey do you say anything funny?

16
00:01:05,027 --> 00:01:07,877
No, i just do quirky things for the sake of being quirky.

17
00:01:07,997 --> 00:01:10,681
You strike me as someone i wouldn't enjoy but others might.

18
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:13,142
- Who are you dressed as, Peter?
- I'm Laura Bush.

19
00:01:13,262 --> 00:01:14,652
And I'm the guy she killed.

20
00:01:14,772 --> 00:01:17,696
That's right, I forgot, Laura Bush killed a guy.

21
00:01:17,715 --> 00:01:18,902
Yes, she did.

22
00:01:19,022 --> 00:01:20,658
Laura Bush killed a guy.

23
00:01:20,642 --> 00:01:22,630
Laura Bush killed a guy.

24
00:01:24,234 --> 00:01:24,973
Well, come on in.

25
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,154
Oh, you know this is why you, Brian, remember?

26
00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:31,131
the last couple of weeks i kept saying:

27
00:01:31,155 --> 00:01:33,863
Can I have a couple minutes of your time to talk to you about something?

28
00:01:33,882 --> 00:01:35,300
This is what it was about.

29
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,905
This evening is ruined.

30
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:38,029
Look I... well what?

31
00:01:38,012 --> 00:01:40,415
This evening is ruined. My all evening is ruined.

32
00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:42,202
- Why you saying it like that?
- Saying what?

33
00:01:42,322 --> 00:01:43,998
I'm just pointing out the party is ru-ined.

34
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,946
You know, I'm not gonna get sucked into this.

35
00:01:48,745 --> 00:01:50,193
Okay, just so I'm sure, really?

36
00:01:50,493 --> 00:01:53,142
Are-are you just trying to piss me off, or is that really how you say that?

37
00:01:53,138 --> 00:01:55,259
What are you talking about? I'm talking about this ru-ined evening.

38
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,550
That's not how you say ruined.

39
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:57,483
What, ru-ined?

40
00:01:57,603 --> 00:01:59,810
What do you call the remains of ancient greek structures.

41
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,663
- Ruins?
- And how would you describe this evening?

42
00:02:01,684 --> 00:02:03,586
Oh, ru-ined, of course. This evening is ru-ined.

43
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,074
- Say ruined.
- Ru-ined.

44
00:02:05,043 --> 00:02:06,337
- Ruined.
- Ru-ined.

45
00:02:06,306 --> 00:02:07,542
- Ruined.
- Ru-ined.

46
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,665
- Dumbass.
- Oh Brian, don't be cru-el.

47
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:11,830
That's a great costume Joe.

48
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,558
- Are you FDR?
- No, I'm olympic swimmer Mark Spitz.

49
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:19,425
- Oh, you mean like if he dove into the shallow end?
- No, regular Mark Spitz.

50
00:02:19,545 --> 00:02:21,265
Wait, are you Stephen Hawking at the beach?

51
00:02:21,283 --> 00:02:22,739
No, I'm Mark Spitz!

52
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:24,451
He won seven gold medals!

53
00:02:24,465 --> 00:02:27,100
Oh, I get it, you're crippled Magnum PI.

54
00:02:27,087 --> 00:02:29,821
I'm... Fine, I'm crippled Magnum PI.

55
00:02:32,347 --> 00:02:35,115
Brian, there's that girl from our yoga class I wanted you to meet.

56
00:02:35,235 --> 00:02:38,227
Now, look Lois, I appreciate it, but I..I'm not into fix-ups.

57
00:02:38,347 --> 00:02:41,424
Oh come on, you gotta get yourself back out there.

58
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:43,751
Jane, this is Brian.

59
00:02:44,194 --> 00:02:47,428
Oh Brian, Lois has told me so much about you.

60
00:02:47,548 --> 00:02:49,637
Wow, you're even more handsome than she said.

61
00:02:49,757 --> 00:02:53,239
Hey, thanks. So uh... that's a great costume.

62
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:57,424
- What are you, one of Freddy Krueger's victims?
- I'm a victim of the liberal agenda.

63
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:58,708
I'm a murdered fetus.

64
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:01,784
Did you know that Democrats murder thousands of babies every year?

65
00:03:01,821 --> 00:03:05,591
And sometimes babies are put back into the womb just so that they can be aborted again?

66
00:03:06,226 --> 00:03:09,071
- Have you ever had any sex that was voluntary?
- No, I have not.

67
00:03:09,058 --> 00:03:11,226
Yeah, have a good evening. Come on, buddy, lets go.

68
00:03:12,523 --> 00:03:14,594
Yep, with a capital C.

69
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,273
Oh, stop looking so depressed, Brian.

70
00:03:20,304 --> 00:03:23,695
I'm sure one day you'll meet a girl who loves abortion as much as you do.

71
00:03:23,717 --> 00:03:25,392
That's not the point, Stewie. I'm just...

72
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:27,802
tired of every girl I meet beeing crazy.

73
00:03:27,922 --> 00:03:29,390
Ah, things'll work out for you.

74
00:03:29,353 --> 00:03:33,289
Now, come on, let's forget our problems and get lost in the world of books.

75
00:03:33,696 --> 00:03:38,749
Ooh! "Horton Hears Domestic Violence in the Next Apartment and Doesn't Call 911"

76
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,377
<i>- You think it's easy working all day?!
- No.
- You think I like it?!</i>

77
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:43,652
<i>I don't think it's easy, but, yes, I do think you like it!</i>

78
00:03:43,638 --> 00:03:46,676
<i>No, I, yeah, I like being away from you, 'cause I can't stand looking at you!</i>

79
00:03:46,706 --> 00:03:48,058
<i>You...</i>

80
00:03:49,057 --> 00:03:51,598
<i>Hey, you think I wanna do that?! You think I wanna hurt you?!</i>

81
00:03:51,617 --> 00:03:54,950
<i>- Not in front of the baby.
- I don't wanna hurt you! You make me hurt you!</i>

82
00:03:54,978 --> 00:03:57,673
I'm sure there's two sides to this.

83
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,103
- Oops.
- I'm sorry.

84
00:04:01,104 --> 00:04:04,543
- I-I don't think you want this book, It's all about atheism.
- Oh, I know.

85
00:04:04,501 --> 00:04:05,965
- I'm an atheist.
- Really?

86
00:04:06,085 --> 00:04:07,919
- So am I.
- It's all yours.

87
00:04:07,891 --> 00:04:09,797
I feel bad, taking the last copy.

88
00:04:09,804 --> 00:04:11,820
Well, there's..one way to settle this.

89
00:04:11,792 --> 00:04:13,891
If there is a God, send another copy.

90
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,237
Oh, I guess that's our answer.

91
00:04:17,664 --> 00:04:20,462
Tell you what, how about I take it and then send it after i read it.

92
00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:21,373
Swear to god?

93
00:04:22,594 --> 00:04:23,899
Stop it!

94
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:27,458
'Cause... missing will... Hey, listen... here's-here's my address.

95
00:04:28,162 --> 00:04:29,880
Thanks. See you later.

96
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,045
God, still no mail for me, huh?

97
00:04:38,165 --> 00:04:41,397
Geez, Brian, you've been going to the mail every day for a week, what are you looking for?

98
00:04:41,517 --> 00:04:43,416
I'm expecting a very important package.

99
00:04:43,435 --> 00:04:44,251
Another one?

100
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:46,693
You haven't even open the one that came for you a week ago.

101
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,434
You idiot! What didn't you tell me this was here?

102
00:04:50,463 --> 00:04:52,745
Because, i have been using it as a hat-weight.

103
00:04:52,763 --> 00:04:54,660
- A what?
- A hat-weight Brian.

104
00:04:54,923 --> 00:04:58,153
My hat kept blowing away so i put the package on it so i wouldn't loose it.

105
00:04:58,273 --> 00:05:01,656
That's the dumbest think I've ever heard, you don't wear a hat and there's no wind in here.

106
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:09,271
You, Sir, owe me one new hat.

107
00:05:12,778 --> 00:05:15,294
You know huh... I was really glad you sent me the book.

108
00:05:15,336 --> 00:05:18,230
I won't lie to you, I came this close to praying that I'd see you again.

109
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,806
Good thing you didn't, because...

110
00:05:19,926 --> 00:05:21,327
Who would hear it, right?

111
00:05:22,726 --> 00:05:25,205
Can I interest you folks in some of our heavenly cheesecake?

112
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:28,571
No, but I'll have some of your "There is no after-life Soufflé".

113
00:05:31,295 --> 00:05:32,619
Now we got the waiter involved.

114
00:05:33,426 --> 00:05:36,187
I love being a part of things. I'll bring your dessert now.

115
00:05:37,145 --> 00:05:39,746
You know Carolyn, I rarely find myself

116
00:05:39,765 --> 00:05:43,370
connected with another person like I have with you. I'm really enjoying your compagny.

117
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,709
Me too, Brian.

118
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,402
<i>The boat rides we would take</i>

119
00:05:52,522 --> 00:05:55,999
<i>The moonlight on the lake</i>

120
00:05:56,119 --> 00:06:02,466
<i>The way we danced and hummed our favorite song</i>

121
00:06:03,848 --> 00:06:10,635
<i>The things we did last summer</i>

122
00:06:11,128 --> 00:06:17,889
<i>I'll remember all winter long</i>

123
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:22,598
<i>The Midway and the fun</i>

124
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:26,846
<i>The Cupie dolls we won</i>

125
00:06:26,966 --> 00:06:32,976
<i>The bell I rang to prove that I was strong</i>

126
00:06:34,492 --> 00:06:41,142
<i>The things we did last summer</i>

127
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:48,888
<i>I'll remember all winter long</i>

128
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:52,227
I had a really great time tonight, Brian.

129
00:06:52,347 --> 00:06:55,081
Well, is there... any reason it has to end?

130
00:06:57,341 --> 00:06:59,067
Don't do it Brian.

131
00:07:01,877 --> 00:07:03,978
What the hell? Ex-excuse me for a second.

132
00:07:04,853 --> 00:07:07,107
Stewie, have you been hiding in the back all evening?

133
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,379
Yes, I'm saving you from yourself Brian.

134
00:07:09,499 --> 00:07:12,199
You almost went in there and tried to have sex with that girl.

135
00:07:12,396 --> 00:07:15,711
- So, what's wrong with that?
- That's why you can't maintain a relationship.

136
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:18,424
You always try too soon and end up blowing it.

137
00:07:18,544 --> 00:07:19,289
Think about it.

138
00:07:19,655 --> 00:07:21,054
God, you know maybe you're right.

139
00:07:21,298 --> 00:07:24,199
I-I do, I-I always try and jump into the sex right away.

140
00:07:24,758 --> 00:07:26,176
Maybe that's what screws things up.

141
00:07:26,711 --> 00:07:28,936
You know... I'm gonna take it slow this time.

142
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:33,829
- Listen, huh... I-I gotta go.
- Really?

143
00:07:34,101 --> 00:07:35,688
Don't worry, you'll see me again.

144
00:07:38,364 --> 00:07:40,965
Good job Brian, don't worry I'll help you through this.

145
00:07:42,448 --> 00:07:44,012
So, you want to get something to eat?

146
00:07:44,435 --> 00:07:46,510
Can we go some place where the menus have pictures of the food?

147
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:48,397
OH LET'S GO SOME PLACE WHERE THE MENUS HAVE PICTURES OF FOOD!

148
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:54,397
Gosh... I really enjoyed the movie tonight.

149
00:07:54,435 --> 00:07:56,576
Yeah... You knew it was gonna be a touching comedy

150
00:07:56,604 --> 00:07:58,172
because Robin Williams had a beard.

151
00:07:58,998 --> 00:08:01,928
My back is so stiff from sitting in that theater chair.

152
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,857
I could probably use a backrub.

153
00:08:04,435 --> 00:08:06,463
- Do you mind?
- Nope, not at all.

154
00:08:06,951 --> 00:08:09,590
You know I huh... took a Thaï massage class at the Learning Annex.

155
00:08:11,838 --> 00:08:13,557
Boy, that's an awfully loud owl.

156
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:16,017
Don't do it Brian!

157
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,618
Take it slow.

158
00:08:19,778 --> 00:08:22,041
'Course I'll tell you what would really set you right is uh...

159
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:23,750
couple of Aleves and a good night's sleep.

160
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:29,591
- Alright, if you say so.
- Well, I... guess I should say good night.

161
00:08:31,948 --> 00:08:32,906
Good job Brian!

162
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:36,215
- Hi there.
- Not interested.
- Ok.

163
00:08:39,793 --> 00:08:41,286
Ooh, tandem bike.

164
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:45,239
You gonna take a ride out in the country and let the AIDS blow through your hair?

165
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,760
Get lost Stewie, I am getting laid tonight.

166
00:08:48,605 --> 00:08:51,516
-  What happened to "taking it slow"?
- I have been taking it slow.

167
00:08:51,544 --> 00:08:53,929
We've been going out for three weeks and I haven't tried anything.

168
00:08:54,143 --> 00:08:56,296
Even though she's been giving me some pretty strong signals.

169
00:08:56,868 --> 00:08:59,131
So, do you have any thoughts on what you might wanna do tonight?

170
00:09:00,944 --> 00:09:02,596
I don't know...

171
00:09:04,301 --> 00:09:06,817
I don't know Brian, you don't want to mess things up.

172
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,686
Well, we'll find out tonight, won't we?

173
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:11,418
Alright, but just one last piece of advice: Remember,

174
00:09:11,695 --> 00:09:16,117
listen to her body, and respond the way you'd want her to respond to you.

175
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:19,357
Okay, thanks. That's very helpful.

176
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,653
You'll be a wonderful lover, Brian.

177
00:09:25,001 --> 00:09:27,949
- What are you doing?
- Oh, sorry, you just had a little... something.

178
00:09:46,311 --> 00:09:49,541
Oh my God! Carolyn?! Cleveland?!

179
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:53,138
Oh hey Brian, close that window you're letting all the stink out.

180
00:09:54,612 --> 00:09:57,776
I don't believe this. Cleveland you're sleeping with my girlfriend.

181
00:09:57,804 --> 00:10:00,471
Nobody told me Carolyn was your girlfriend.

182
00:10:00,591 --> 00:10:04,138
- I'm not his girlfriend.
- Carolyn what are you talking about? We've been dating for three weeks.

183
00:10:04,176 --> 00:10:07,853
Well, you never made a move on me so I thought you just wanted to be friends.

184
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,960
And I met Cleveland, and, things just kinda took off.

185
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,735
But...H-how did you even meet each other?

186
00:10:13,742 --> 00:10:15,371
We met at the Starbucks.

187
00:10:15,357 --> 00:10:18,449
She started going on about her new brazilian wax

188
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,908
and not wearing any underpants and whatnot.

189
00:10:21,028 --> 00:10:24,754
I'd have to be a homosexual to ignore a signal like that.

190
00:10:24,753 --> 00:10:28,882
But, Carolyn, you completely misunderstood me... I wanted you like crazy, but...

191
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:32,762
- I just figured if I showed a little restraint you'd respect me.
- I do.

192
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:33,758
As do I.

193
00:10:33,979 --> 00:10:36,165
Now why don't you go hop on that gay bike of yours

194
00:10:36,176 --> 00:10:39,363
and go get yourself a lollipop or a cupcake or something.

195
00:10:41,369 --> 00:10:43,656
We're good, Brian, we're good.

196
00:10:49,731 --> 00:10:51,678
So, Carolyn...

197
00:10:52,612 --> 00:10:57,242
- Guess she should have hit that when you had the chance Brian.
- What? you are the one who told me to wait !

198
00:10:57,277 --> 00:10:59,223
Oh, you're crazy bitch, I didn't say that, bitch.

199
00:10:59,224 --> 00:11:02,552
- Yeah, well thanks to you, I lost her to Cleveland.
- You know what you need?

200
00:11:02,523 --> 00:11:06,459
You need to stop pointing fingers, and get out of the house, have some fun!

201
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:10,752
Real fun, not like thirty-seven year-old woman on a Blind Date fun.

202
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,984
This is fun, right. We're having fun.

203
00:11:14,012 --> 00:11:18,041
I mean, so what if you forgot your wallet, I'll pay. I'm gonna pay for us.

204
00:11:18,064 --> 00:11:22,834
You'll get it next time, yeah. So you're impressive right? killed a man.

205
00:11:22,862 --> 00:11:26,542
- I'm sure it was on self-defence.
- No. I just felt like killing.

206
00:11:28,844 --> 00:11:33,952
You tell the best stories. Me and my three eggs are having the best time.

207
00:11:37,407 --> 00:11:39,520
We're gonna get you back on your feet Brian.

208
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,835
I know what always make me feel better. Delicious sweets.

209
00:11:43,032 --> 00:11:45,548
Halloo! Welcome to Fjurg's Backery.

210
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,577
Would you like a hot piss of pee?

211
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,220
- It's on the hoose!
- What?

212
00:11:50,154 --> 00:11:53,037
Oh noo! You're covered in my hot pee!

213
00:11:53,286 --> 00:11:56,027
You can wash yourself off in the WC.

214
00:12:02,343 --> 00:12:05,704
- Oh, you know, I can just wash if off when I get home.
- Why, what's in here?

215
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,334
Wait... wait... wait...

216
00:12:13,765 --> 00:12:16,826
Oooh, and boom goes the dynamite.

217
00:12:20,455 --> 00:12:23,037
Ok look, next time we'll go to another store, how about that?

218
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,159
Just... forget her alright? I just want to sit here

219
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,076
watch the ball game and have a few beers.

220
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:29,930
<i>It's ball three, low and outside to Ramirez.</i>

221
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:31,320
<i>Wait a minute, what's this?</i>

222
00:12:31,358 --> 00:12:35,006
<i>There appears to be a interracial couple making love on second base.</i>

223
00:12:35,048 --> 00:12:38,879
<i>The crowd's enjoying it and it looks like the Empire's gonna let them finish.</i>

224
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,968
<i>Ooh, and boom goes the dynamite.</i>

225
00:12:42,001 --> 00:12:44,883
<i>- There it is.
- I'll tell you what this would be painful</i>

226
00:12:44,884 --> 00:12:46,489
<i>to watch if you love that girl.</i>

227
00:12:49,593 --> 00:12:53,584
Boy what are the odds of running into Cleveland and Carolyn everywhere we went, huh?

228
00:12:53,612 --> 00:12:56,260
Well, as long as we just stay here in the house we're safe, right?

229
00:12:56,668 --> 00:13:00,903
- Oh that was a great game.
- Carolyn it's been so nice getting to know you.

230
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,870
Yeah Cleveland, she's way more fun than that wife you used to have.

231
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,044
Wha-what was her name? Lizzy or Florida or something.

232
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,053
- Jennifer Hudson.
- Loretta.

233
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:11,912
You know it's amazing Cleveland, you went from a black

234
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,931
woman to a white woman without having to take a hispanic woman step in between.

235
00:13:18,687 --> 00:13:21,729
- Loretta! That's our answer.
- What do you mean?

236
00:13:21,757 --> 00:13:23,203
We've just got to go talk to Loretta.

237
00:13:23,323 --> 00:13:26,682
If we can get her back with Cleveland, Carolyn's all yours.

238
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,682
That's a long shot. But so was the shouting Arab Gram business.

239
00:13:35,143 --> 00:13:36,476
From John and Keith.

240
00:13:40,913 --> 00:13:43,288
You know what, this is never gonna work, Stewie. Loretta cheated on

241
00:13:43,326 --> 00:13:45,129
Cleveland. She's not gonna want to go back to him.

242
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,936
Oh, she can be convinced, Brian. Just let me do the talking.

243
00:13:47,955 --> 00:13:49,683
No, I think I can communicate with her better.

244
00:13:49,711 --> 00:13:51,458
She's only gonna get the gist of what you're saying.

245
00:13:51,578 --> 00:13:54,636
Really? Isn't she one of those people outside the family who can understand me?

246
00:13:54,756 --> 00:13:57,650
No, I think because of Cleveland, she's close enough to the main cast

247
00:13:57,674 --> 00:13:59,345
- that it might be a little weird.
- Really?

248
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:02,312
- We're filming.
- Ok, ok, alright, sorry, sorry. Ring the doorbell.

249
00:14:06,932 --> 00:14:09,176
- Hi Loretta.
- Brian, Stewie.

250
00:14:09,444 --> 00:14:13,191
- What are you doing here?
- Huh... well, to be honest Loretta...

251
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,304
- Cleveland sent us, he... really want you back.
- What?

252
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:18,782
Yes, he says he misses that

253
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,383
perfect figure.

254
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,210
Well, I get the gist of what you're saying, Stewie.

255
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:30,435
But I can never go back to Cleveland. Not after all the pain I cause him.

256
00:14:30,858 --> 00:14:31,797
I'm sorry.

257
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:36,041
- Hey Brian, d'you see that treadmill in the living room?
- Yeah.

258
00:14:42,225 --> 00:14:45,314
- Brian, may I speak with you?
- Oh, Cleveland.

259
00:14:45,642 --> 00:14:46,863
I didn't reconize you without my

260
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,515
girlfriend wrapped around your waist.

261
00:14:48,751 --> 00:14:51,671
She and I are both to a point of great soreness.

262
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:52,911
So we took a break.

263
00:14:53,412 --> 00:14:55,914
Listen, I just wanna clear any bad feelings

264
00:14:55,945 --> 00:14:57,835
you may have about me and Carolyn.

265
00:14:59,237 --> 00:15:00,984
I guess it's okay. These are

266
00:15:01,685 --> 00:15:03,648
passing flings, nothing to get upset about.

267
00:15:03,854 --> 00:15:04,230
Good.

268
00:15:04,451 --> 00:15:07,286
Because we're gonna elope in Hawaii tomorrow night!

269
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,493
- What?
- You got a problem with that, you can go fuck yourself.

270
00:15:15,577 --> 00:15:17,680
- Loretta.
- Hello, Cleveland.

271
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,070
What are you doing here?

272
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:23,042
Cleveland, I've been doing some thinking lately about how much I miss you.

273
00:15:23,568 --> 00:15:25,418
I'm sorry if I hurted you.

274
00:15:25,723 --> 00:15:28,367
I want us to be together again as a family, and

275
00:15:28,751 --> 00:15:31,127
I promess I'll never betray you again.

276
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:33,287
I love you Cleveland.

277
00:15:34,883 --> 00:15:38,770
I'm no meteorologist, but I'm pretty sure it's rainin' bitches.

278
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:47,334
I-I don't know what to do. Carolyn and I are supposed to elope tomorrow.

279
00:15:47,353 --> 00:15:49,611
But here comes Loretta all apologetic

280
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:52,353
and wanting to get our family back together and whatnot.

281
00:15:52,473 --> 00:15:55,861
I wouldn't forgive her so fast Cleveland. Remember she slept with Quagmire.

282
00:15:55,981 --> 00:15:58,001
Yeah, she really acted crazy.

283
00:15:58,245 --> 00:16:00,376
Well, just-just wait a minute you guys, let's not be

284
00:16:00,395 --> 00:16:02,555
so quick to demonize Loretta, I mean...

285
00:16:02,675 --> 00:16:04,513
Whatever happened to "Forgive and Forget"?

286
00:16:04,633 --> 00:16:06,339
Oh, you just want Cleveland out of the picture,

287
00:16:06,345 --> 00:16:07,771
so you can get back with Carolyn.

288
00:16:08,484 --> 00:16:09,235
You know Brian...

289
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:11,485
Sometimes...

290
00:16:12,818 --> 00:16:15,532
I don't believe I know you.

291
00:16:15,771 --> 00:16:18,954
That-that's not it at all. I-I happen to think Loretta is very beautiful

292
00:16:19,668 --> 00:16:21,734
with her sassy wisdom and

293
00:16:22,241 --> 00:16:23,621
speedbag arm fat.

294
00:16:24,852 --> 00:16:28,861
I guess at the very least i could go talk to her tomorrow and see how I feel.

295
00:16:29,335 --> 00:16:30,922
Thanks for your help, Griffins.

296
00:16:32,016 --> 00:16:34,307
Brian, do you really think Loretta is beautiful?

297
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:36,349
Absolutely, that's really how I feel.

298
00:16:36,903 --> 00:16:39,476
Now it is true her personality is abrasive.

299
00:16:39,701 --> 00:16:41,297
Slightly abrasive.

300
00:16:41,787 --> 00:16:44,190
But overall, Loretta is a delightful person,

301
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:46,294
very pleasant to be around, and free to

302
00:16:46,322 --> 00:16:48,153
pursue a life of religious fulfillment

303
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:54,378
I'm really concerned about Cleveland.

304
00:16:54,688 --> 00:16:56,707
What Loretta did was inforgivable.

305
00:16:56,745 --> 00:16:58,998
- I hope he doesn't go back to her.
- I hear you Lois.

306
00:16:59,642 --> 00:17:01,219
You know there might be a way to

307
00:17:01,238 --> 00:17:03,595
drive the point home that she hasn't changed.

308
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:05,933
- How would you do that?
- Hang on.

309
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,097
Hey, Quagmire!

310
00:17:08,126 --> 00:17:09,672
<i>- Quagmire?
- What?</i>

311
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,386
<i>- You busy right now?
- No, I've got a hand free, what's up?</i>

312
00:17:12,506 --> 00:17:14,778
Would you mind getting Loretta to sleep with you again?

313
00:17:15,956 --> 00:17:18,134
<i>Possibly, huh... in what context?</i>

314
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:20,660
Well we're trying to make Cleveland see that she's no good

315
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:23,590
and that he can't trust her and if he catches you guys in the act

316
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:27,606
<i>Oh, Oh Ok, Ok I'm with you now... I can probably work that in.</i>

317
00:17:27,726 --> 00:17:29,013
Terrific. Thank you.

318
00:17:29,595 --> 00:17:32,600
This is perfect Lois. We'll expose Loretta for who she is.

319
00:17:32,976 --> 00:17:35,642
Just like Cyrano was exposed for being an antisemitic.

320
00:17:36,149 --> 00:17:38,257
I love you for all that you are.

321
00:17:39,924 --> 00:17:42,337
In spite of the fact that your people control

322
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,985
a disproportion in amount of the world's wealth.

323
00:17:46,478 --> 00:17:49,980
And in all likelihood are probably responsible for starting

324
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:52,309
every major war since the dawn of t...

325
00:17:52,347 --> 00:17:54,554
Dude, again with this? What's your problem?!

326
00:17:54,591 --> 00:17:57,464
- Who is in the bush?
- Mind your own business you stupid jew.

327
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,328
- Room service.
- I didn't order no room service.

328
00:18:05,356 --> 00:18:06,286
It's complementary.

329
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:09,763
We have a club sandwich, a fruit plate and a

330
00:18:09,782 --> 00:18:12,268
sight of HOT BEEF STEAK!

331
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:16,873
- Glenn Quagmire. You get outta here.
- Come on Baby, time for round two.

332
00:18:18,859 --> 00:18:21,187
You're the devil! You ruined my marriage!

333
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:24,549
Oh, you can't resist the Q man and my superpower Genitalia.

334
00:18:24,756 --> 00:18:26,690
Apache penis Ee-nay-chuck!

335
00:18:29,414 --> 00:18:30,962
You go on and beat a little neck.

336
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:34,475
I'm a changed woman. I don't mess with your kind anymore.

337
00:18:34,503 --> 00:18:35,977
You're a meanie!

338
00:18:37,564 --> 00:18:38,658
Hey Quagmire.

339
00:18:40,057 --> 00:18:42,508
- Hey Cleveland.
- Why are you staying in a hotel?

340
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,898
My... house burned down.

341
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,330
- Why are you naked?
- Naked?

342
00:18:50,222 --> 00:18:53,813
But everybody's been telling me i'm wearing magnificent robes
made from the finest silk.

343
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:01,836
- Cleveland.
- Hello Lorreta.

344
00:19:01,956 --> 00:19:04,691
Oh come here baby. Have you thought about what I said?

345
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:05,823
Yes I have.

346
00:19:06,171 --> 00:19:07,786
And I still love you Loretta.

347
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,405
- Oh, Cleveland.
- But...

348
00:19:11,597 --> 00:19:13,100
I can't take you back.

349
00:19:13,438 --> 00:19:15,203
- Why not?
- Loretta...

350
00:19:15,217 --> 00:19:19,461
I came over here wanting to believe that there was still a chance for us.

351
00:19:20,236 --> 00:19:24,011
But, on the way, i passed a lake, skipped a few rocks

352
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:26,340
and had some black-guy thinking time.

353
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:32,678
Loretta, we lived certain parts of our lives in the past for a reason.

354
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,636
What you and I, you can go ahead and put you clothes back on.

355
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:38,782
What you and I have was a wonderful thing.

356
00:19:39,115 --> 00:19:42,364
and as much as I still have a great deal of love for you,

357
00:19:42,805 --> 00:19:44,185
our time is over.

358
00:19:44,874 --> 00:19:48,023
- I love somebody else.
- Oh, Cleveland...

359
00:19:48,009 --> 00:19:52,123
- Isn't there anything I can do to make you happy.
- Yes, there is.

360
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,353
You can live your life, Loretta.

361
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:57,678
Live it as full and as wonderful as you can.

362
00:19:57,798 --> 00:19:59,565
I love you.

363
00:20:17,094 --> 00:20:19,193
Oh my God, Carolyn?!

364
00:20:19,931 --> 00:20:21,201
Quagmire?!

365
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:23,853
Cleveland, close the window, you're letting the stink out.

366
00:20:27,608 --> 00:20:31,170
- Well, we both got screwed by the same girl.
- Yep.

367
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,979
I guess it's alright though.

368
00:20:33,213 --> 00:20:37,591
- You and I will found true love someday.
- Yeah, I suppose.

369
00:20:38,045 --> 00:20:42,658
- So, how was it having sex with Carolyn?
- I think I'm gonna remember it forever.

370
00:20:42,778 --> 00:20:47,035
- Oh yeah, how so ?
- Brian, do you think you could identify a genital wart?

371
00:20:49,192 --> 00:20:52,591
I... I-I-I... I-I would think that would be something you'd check with your doctor about.

372
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:53,878
- Okay.
- Okay?

373
00:20:54,243 --> 00:20:56,610
- Yeah.
- Alright, 'cause I'm, I'm-I'm not a doctor, I can't...

374
00:20:56,614 --> 00:20:59,304
- No, I understand.
- Okay, so, we're-we're still friends?
- Yeah, yeah.

375
00:20:59,424 --> 00:20:59,966
Okay.

376
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:03,445
Well, summer's coming on.

377
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:05,682
It hurts.
