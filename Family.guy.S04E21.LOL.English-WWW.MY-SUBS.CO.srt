3
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:36,548
All right, Peter, you made it to
the Bonus Round. Congratulations.

4
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:37,931
- Thanks, Regis.
- Okay.

5
00:00:37,964 --> 00:00:40,494
The category is "Actor & Show. " So...

6
00:00:40,544 --> 00:00:42,641
we need five consonants and a vowel.

7
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:44,371
Uh, okay. Um.

8
00:00:44,987 --> 00:00:46,102
"Z,"

9
00:00:46,984 --> 00:00:48,099
four,

10
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,043
"Q,"

11
00:00:51,192 --> 00:00:52,771
another "Q,"

12
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:54,933
uh...

13
00:00:55,857 --> 00:00:57,714
a third "Q"

14
00:00:58,098 --> 00:00:59,560
and a Batman symbol.

15
00:00:59,596 --> 00:01:01,502
Okay, no help there. Um...

16
00:01:01,546 --> 00:01:04,212
15 seconds if you want to
take a shot at it. Talk it out.

17
00:01:04,318 --> 00:01:06,991
Is it "Alex Karras in Webster"?

18
00:01:07,928 --> 00:01:09,900
I don't believe it.

19
00:01:09,938 --> 00:01:12,842
Oh, my God! I just took a
shot in the dark! Holy crap!

20
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:16,091
Okay, you have $1,300.

21
00:01:16,126 --> 00:01:18,673
Why don't you go ahead and pick
out some prizes from our showcase?

22
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:20,531
Okay, let's see.
Uh...

23
00:01:20,617 --> 00:01:22,831
Oh, boy, everything looks nice.

24
00:01:23,185 --> 00:01:26,571
All right, I'll take the ceramic
Dalmatian for $600

25
00:01:26,615 --> 00:01:28,043
and, uh...

26
00:01:28,076 --> 00:01:29,780
Boy, that TV looks nice.

27
00:01:30,218 --> 00:01:32,720
Give me the one free
week of maid service

28
00:01:32,765 --> 00:01:35,140
and, uh, I'll take the hat rack.

29
00:01:36,205 --> 00:01:39,502
Hey, how much for that fat guy in the
circle? I don't see a price tag on that.

30
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,583
- That's you.
- Oh, oh, embarrassing.

31
00:01:41,617 --> 00:01:44,571
Okay, well, in that case, I'll take
the rest on a gift certificate.

32
00:01:44,865 --> 00:01:47,751
Oh, sweetie, you look so handsome on TV.

33
00:01:47,785 --> 00:01:49,431
I can't believe you actually won.

34
00:01:49,487 --> 00:01:52,433
But I suppose it's not the strangest
thing I've seen on a game show.

35
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:54,242
Like when Adam West was on Jeopardy.

36
00:01:54,295 --> 00:01:56,300
All right, players, the
answer once again is:

37
00:01:56,348 --> 00:02:00,333
"It was the first spacecraft
to land on the surface of Mars. "

38
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:02,182
Adam, what was your response?

39
00:02:04,036 --> 00:02:05,563
"Kebert Xela. "

40
00:02:08,865 --> 00:02:13,561
Only saying his name backwards can send him
back to the fifth dimension where he belongs.

41
00:02:19,148 --> 00:02:22,202
All right, whip'em out, woman.
It's time for the afternoon meal.

42
00:02:22,235 --> 00:02:24,883
My goodness, Stewie.
I guess you're hungry.

43
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:29,590
Honey, not so rough this time.
Mommy's very sore.

44
00:02:29,626 --> 00:02:32,220
And by the way, let's be clear.
I only like you as a friend.

45
00:02:35,037 --> 00:02:38,110
Hi, I'm Joan. I'm, uh,
your maid for the week.

46
00:02:38,146 --> 00:02:39,840
Me Peter.

47
00:02:39,897 --> 00:02:41,542
You maid.

48
00:02:41,596 --> 00:02:43,852
Um, I do speak English.

49
00:02:43,906 --> 00:02:45,550
You maid,

50
00:02:45,606 --> 00:02:47,912
clean for me, Peter.

51
00:02:48,016 --> 00:02:50,370
You clean Peter mess.

52
00:02:50,418 --> 00:02:52,892
Peter, stop it.
Welcome to our home, Joan.

53
00:02:52,927 --> 00:02:54,451
I'm Lois.
Won't you come in?

54
00:02:54,485 --> 00:02:56,302
Oh, boy, my own maid.

55
00:02:56,338 --> 00:02:59,072
This is going to kick more ass
than that magical ride I took.

56
00:02:59,168 --> 00:03:02,002
<i>It's the great space coaster</i>

57
00:03:02,047 --> 00:03:05,122
<i>get on board on the
great space coaster</i>

58
00:03:05,176 --> 00:03:08,410
<i>We'll explore.
Come and ride a fantasy</i>

59
00:03:08,466 --> 00:03:12,173
<i>to a place where dreams
fly fast and free</i>

60
00:03:12,277 --> 00:03:15,233
<i>With new friends
and new things to see</i>

61
00:03:15,285 --> 00:03:18,540
<i>We'll spin you through the galaxy.</i>

62
00:03:23,308 --> 00:03:25,622
Well, we are officially lost.

63
00:03:25,655 --> 00:03:29,432
- On the great space coa...
- Shut up, Ricky, just shut up right now!

64
00:03:29,465 --> 00:03:31,732
Unless the next words out
of your mouth are directions

65
00:03:31,768 --> 00:03:34,732
how to get back to the fish skeleton, I'm
going to punch you right in the stomach.

66
00:03:36,798 --> 00:03:38,722
Joan, it's great to have you here.

67
00:03:38,756 --> 00:03:41,020
No one's cleaned my belly
button in a long time.

68
00:03:41,078 --> 00:03:43,730
Lois is afraid to go near there
and my fingers are too thick.

69
00:03:43,888 --> 00:03:45,480
What is this?

70
00:03:45,915 --> 00:03:47,721
A carton of Parliaments?

71
00:03:47,758 --> 00:03:50,052
I haven't smoked in ten years.
Hey, keep diggin.

72
00:03:51,228 --> 00:03:53,411
Oh, Coleco Vision.

73
00:03:53,488 --> 00:03:55,582
Yeah. This could be a fun afternoon.

74
00:03:58,206 --> 00:04:01,803
Mr. Griffin, this is
unbelievably humiliating.

75
00:04:01,848 --> 00:04:05,290
Hey, hey, Lois, wants me to go to
the store, and the car's low on gas.

76
00:04:10,577 --> 00:04:11,753
Oh, crap.

77
00:04:11,838 --> 00:04:14,532
This is truly a sight to behold.

78
00:04:14,586 --> 00:04:16,270
An awesome spectacle.

79
00:04:16,316 --> 00:04:19,853
Peter Griffin, a once-great champion
of the motor speedway

80
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,232
now a study in moppishness.

81
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:23,562
The hell I am!

82
00:04:28,188 --> 00:04:30,400
We now return to
Malcolm In The Middle.

83
00:04:30,455 --> 00:04:33,830
And I told you boys to pick up your clothes
and who left the wet towel on the bed?!

84
00:04:33,888 --> 00:04:36,112
I swear to God, sometimes I
feel like just going on strike!

85
00:04:36,148 --> 00:04:37,852
What would you all do
if went on strike, huh?!

86
00:04:37,886 --> 00:04:40,080
What would you do?!
I'm talking to you!

87
00:04:40,115 --> 00:04:42,762
You know what?! That's what I'm going
to do! I'm going to go on strike,

88
00:04:42,796 --> 00:04:45,373
and you can all try living without me!
What do you think about that, huh?!

89
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:48,350
That's what I'm going to do! I'm going
to do that! I'm going to go on strike!

90
00:04:50,127 --> 00:04:51,203
Kids,

91
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:52,933
we're free.

92
00:04:53,196 --> 00:04:55,020
We're finally free.

93
00:05:05,086 --> 00:05:07,253
Ow, damn, that hurts.

94
00:05:07,616 --> 00:05:08,610
What happened?

95
00:05:08,657 --> 00:05:13,070
I was breast-feeding Stewie and he bit me again.
I think he might have even broken the skin.

96
00:05:13,106 --> 00:05:14,592
I see. Um...

97
00:05:15,075 --> 00:05:17,603
maybe I should, uh, you know, uh,

98
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:19,582
look at it. Uh...

99
00:05:19,848 --> 00:05:23,990
I- I have seen a lot of medical shows.

100
00:05:25,206 --> 00:05:27,412
You see, the areola is very tender here,

101
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,662
and I think one of his new teeth may
have bitten down right on the duct.

102
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:34,592
I'm sorry. What?

103
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,233
I don't know what to do, Brian.

104
00:05:36,275 --> 00:05:39,663
Breast'feeding's just so painful
since Stewie's teeth are coming in.

105
00:05:39,705 --> 00:05:42,821
Now I know how Alec Baldwin feels
when he feeds his brothers.

106
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,003
There you go. There you go.

107
00:05:45,156 --> 00:05:47,173
Eat up, Steven. You're the weakest.

108
00:05:47,237 --> 00:05:49,233
Well, maybe it's time to wean Stewie.

109
00:05:49,285 --> 00:05:51,811
Huh, I suppose it would
make my life easier.

110
00:05:52,036 --> 00:05:54,643
You know what? I'll give it a try.
Thanks, Brian.

111
00:05:54,675 --> 00:05:55,751
No problem.

112
00:05:56,478 --> 00:05:57,400
Uh...

113
00:05:57,436 --> 00:06:00,301
any, any other problems
you have, too, like,

114
00:06:00,438 --> 00:06:02,663
for example, around your underpants...

115
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,593
that you want me to take a look at,
I could, I could take a look at that, too.

116
00:06:05,647 --> 00:06:06,593
Huh?

117
00:06:07,396 --> 00:06:09,142
Please pull down your underpants.

118
00:06:11,395 --> 00:06:14,620
All right, boys, it's my maid's last night,
so we got to make the most of it.

119
00:06:14,657 --> 00:06:18,643
I filled this watermelon with chocolate
pudding and M-80 firecrackers.

120
00:06:19,018 --> 00:06:21,422
Hey, Meg, will you hold this for Daddy?

121
00:06:21,467 --> 00:06:23,153
Okay, why?

122
00:06:23,206 --> 00:06:24,850
Uh, it's a present.

123
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:28,313
It's a "Thanks for being
such a sweetie" watermelon.

124
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:30,692
- So you'll hang on to that?
- Yeah, sure.

125
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:34,151
This is weird.
Am I supposed to eat this?

126
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:38,432
AHHH! I hate you! 
I hate you!

127
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:40,480
Oh, maid?

128
00:06:41,558 --> 00:06:43,040
Oh, my God...

129
00:06:43,216 --> 00:06:44,840
Everybody, this is Joan.

130
00:06:44,896 --> 00:06:46,172
- Hi.
- Hello.

131
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:11,683
Uh, uh, hey, there. I mean, it's
nice to pleasure your acquaintance.

132
00:07:11,715 --> 00:07:12,980
I mean, uh,

133
00:07:13,188 --> 00:07:15,162
would you like to go out
to dinner tomorrow night?

134
00:07:15,215 --> 00:07:17,501
- I'd love to.
- God, he works fast.

135
00:07:17,548 --> 00:07:20,632
Hey, Quagmire, is that a
banana in your pocket?

136
00:07:20,676 --> 00:07:22,880
Or an erection in your pocket?

137
00:07:22,937 --> 00:07:25,490
- Do you want to say 9:00?
- Sure.

138
00:07:25,595 --> 00:07:26,761
See you then.

139
00:07:29,748 --> 00:07:31,200
Oh, my God.

140
00:07:31,276 --> 00:07:32,903
I'm in love.

141
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:04,982
Time for dinner, sweetie.

142
00:08:05,016 --> 00:08:06,672
Very well, then, take off your shirt.

143
00:08:06,716 --> 00:08:10,330
No, honey, no, no. Tonight we're
going to have formula instead.

144
00:08:13,152 --> 00:08:16,671
That's more disgusting than when Peter
went through that Daisy Duke's phase.

145
00:08:16,718 --> 00:08:19,393
So who's up for some
hoops at the park, huh?

146
00:08:19,447 --> 00:08:22,664
Oh, there you are.
Come here, you basketball.

147
00:08:24,988 --> 00:08:26,770
-AHHH! 
-It's like a walrus flossing.

148
00:08:26,947 --> 00:08:31,031
Now I know it's different than you're
used to, but you'll see. It's just as good.

149
00:08:31,085 --> 00:08:36,281
Yes, that's what we were promised about
Jim Belushi some 25 laugh-free years ago.

150
00:08:39,238 --> 00:08:41,850
Wow, it's so lovely here, Glenn.

151
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:45,632
Well, this is our three-week anniversary,
Joan. I wanted this date to be special.

152
00:08:45,685 --> 00:08:49,451
You know this place is unique because if
you're lucky, some nights around sunset,

153
00:08:49,498 --> 00:08:51,472
the screaming black dolphins come out.

154
00:08:51,505 --> 00:08:54,891
Oh, wow, really?
I've heard they're just beautiful.

155
00:08:55,448 --> 00:08:58,770
- What's going on, man?
- Oh, what's going on yo'self?

156
00:08:59,535 --> 00:09:03,453
- I almost drowned yesterday.
- Oh, man, it's wet out here!

157
00:09:03,568 --> 00:09:06,631
- Oh, look at them.
- They're magical, aren't they?

158
00:09:06,698 --> 00:09:07,931
Listen, Joan...

159
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:10,123
I have something very
important to ask you.

160
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:11,450
<i>- Hey, Jay.
- Mm-hmm?</i>

161
00:09:11,496 --> 00:09:13,730
<i>I'm going to see how
long I can hold my breath.</i>

162
00:09:13,808 --> 00:09:16,260
<i>- I see you breathing out yo hole.
- What is it, Glenn?</i>

163
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:19,371
Joan... I've decided I want
to spend my life with you.

164
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,060
Will you marry me?

165
00:09:22,048 --> 00:09:23,772
Of course, I will!

166
00:09:23,826 --> 00:09:27,991
Nothing would make me happier
than to be Mrs. Quagmire.

167
00:09:28,718 --> 00:09:32,542
Hey, man, I see you got
some seaweed on your tail.

168
00:09:32,575 --> 00:09:35,501
Where? Wha..?
You know I'm just playing with ya.

169
00:09:35,538 --> 00:09:38,983
Man, you all... Oh! I thought you were
talking about the other seaweed.

170
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:40,740
You know I got jokes!

171
00:09:42,307 --> 00:09:44,200
I'm going to slap you with my fin.

172
00:09:47,866 --> 00:09:51,320
Man, I never would have
thought Quagmire'd get married.

173
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:55,600
No, no, I know Quagmire and I'm telling
you, this has got to be some kind of prank.

174
00:09:55,658 --> 00:09:57,963
You know, like that prank
I pulled on Ashton Kutcher.

175
00:09:58,338 --> 00:09:59,613
Ashton, come here.

176
00:10:02,048 --> 00:10:03,940
You've just been tomahawked.

177
00:10:03,977 --> 00:10:05,151
That's my show.

178
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,371
Tomahawked.

179
00:10:10,085 --> 00:10:12,872
- So, how's the weaning going?
- Oh, it's horrible.

180
00:10:12,926 --> 00:10:15,791
Giving up breast milk is the
hardest thing I've ever had to do.

181
00:10:15,856 --> 00:10:19,363
I'll bet the Founding Fathers had an
easier time writing the Bill of Rights.

182
00:10:19,415 --> 00:10:20,481
All right, we're done.

183
00:10:20,516 --> 00:10:22,920
You think the language in the
Second Amendment is clear enough?

184
00:10:22,986 --> 00:10:24,421
You know, about the right to bear arms?

185
00:10:24,465 --> 00:10:28,033
Of course it's clear. Every American
has the right to hang a pair of bear arms

186
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:30,281
on their wall. How could
that possibly be misconstrued?

187
00:10:30,337 --> 00:10:32,170
All right. Fantastic, then.

188
00:10:32,228 --> 00:10:34,602
Wait. You know what?
Before we send this to the printer,

189
00:10:34,636 --> 00:10:36,310
let's take that abortion thing out.

190
00:10:38,316 --> 00:10:42,312
Boy, I never thought we'd be going to
Quagmire's for an engagement party.

191
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:45,680
I'm telling you guys, he's putting
us on. He's the same old Quagmire.

192
00:10:45,727 --> 00:10:47,662
Hey, there, neighbors-are you lost?

193
00:10:48,425 --> 00:10:51,463
I'm just joshing. Of course we're
expecting you. Come on in, friends.

194
00:10:55,698 --> 00:10:59,602
You all just take your shoes off, there.
Joan and I kind of do the Japanese thing.

195
00:11:01,437 --> 00:11:02,461
Uh-oh.

196
00:11:02,565 --> 00:11:03,793
Foot odor.

197
00:11:03,836 --> 00:11:06,422
I have to go. I have, uh...

198
00:11:07,006 --> 00:11:09,271
terrible foot odor.

199
00:11:09,576 --> 00:11:11,963
Glenn, your place looks wonderful.

200
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,213
I feel like I can touch
things in here now.

201
00:11:14,248 --> 00:11:16,301
We brought you guys a bottle of wine.

202
00:11:16,396 --> 00:11:19,801
- Ooh! Montrachet!
- I like our friends.

203
00:11:21,018 --> 00:11:24,323
So, Joan and I just love
Without a Trace, don't we, honey?

204
00:11:24,366 --> 00:11:25,820
- Yeah, it's all right.
- We think it's all right.

205
00:11:25,866 --> 00:11:27,940
What are you talking about?
You hate CBS.

206
00:11:28,176 --> 00:11:30,682
Ooh, hate is a word
we don't use in this house.

207
00:11:30,716 --> 00:11:33,783
Joan and I always say, if you don't have
anything nice to say about someone

208
00:11:33,835 --> 00:11:36,293
don't say anything at all.
We say that, right, honey?

209
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:37,872
- Sometimes.
- Sometimes we say that.

210
00:11:39,515 --> 00:11:42,492
Hey, Quagmire. Check out this
month's Hustler, huh?

211
00:11:42,545 --> 00:11:43,492
Quagmire?

212
00:11:43,507 --> 00:11:44,693
Now, this is neat.

213
00:11:44,715 --> 00:11:49,221
These people have put an old-fashioned Colonial
spinning wheel in the center of their living room.

214
00:11:49,287 --> 00:11:51,132
As furniture.

215
00:11:51,276 --> 00:11:53,482
Oh, that's what I want in my house.

216
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,802
All right, Quagmire,
time for your lap dance.

217
00:11:59,848 --> 00:12:02,570
No, guys, I can't do that.
It's degrading to women.

218
00:12:02,636 --> 00:12:04,580
Come on, Quagmire, it's got to be you.

219
00:12:04,636 --> 00:12:07,933
I'm married, Cleveland's got foot odor,
and Joe's dead from the waist down.

220
00:12:10,248 --> 00:12:12,342
AHHH!! Why do you bring me here?!

221
00:12:14,516 --> 00:12:17,132
Oh, Brian, my breasts are so sore.

222
00:12:17,177 --> 00:12:21,372
And they've gotten so engorged from
the weaning, I've gone up two bra sizes.

223
00:12:21,498 --> 00:12:23,890
Well... what did you
do with the old bras?

224
00:12:24,126 --> 00:12:26,450
Okay, got to time this just right.

225
00:12:29,735 --> 00:12:32,020
One, two, three.

226
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,940
Help! Somebody get this baby off me!

227
00:12:36,008 --> 00:12:38,470
Stewie!
I'm so sorry.

228
00:12:38,548 --> 00:12:41,222
By the way, you call those
cheap implants boobs?

229
00:12:41,255 --> 00:12:43,610
Those aren't boobs, they're lies!

230
00:12:45,675 --> 00:12:46,773
I can't believe it.

231
00:12:46,796 --> 00:12:49,603
Quagmire's gone all
sissy-man Alan Alda on us.

232
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:52,620
Well, what can we do about it?
The wedding's tomorrow.

233
00:12:52,655 --> 00:12:54,411
There's only one thing to do.

234
00:12:54,477 --> 00:12:56,032
We gotta break it up.

235
00:12:58,718 --> 00:13:01,483
Gosh, Peter, thanks so
much for being my best man.

236
00:13:01,528 --> 00:13:02,750
No, it's my pleasure.

237
00:13:02,797 --> 00:13:05,153
In fact, I got a wedding
surprise for you.

238
00:13:05,205 --> 00:13:06,992
All right, back it up, guys.

239
00:13:07,256 --> 00:13:11,133
I know you've got a foot fetish so I
got you this Statue of Liberty's foot.

240
00:13:11,195 --> 00:13:14,373
Oh, thanks, Peter, but Joan's
all the foot I need now.

241
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:15,213
What?

242
00:13:15,266 --> 00:13:18,181
But, Quagmire, that's the real
foot from the Statue of...

243
00:13:18,218 --> 00:13:19,661
- No, no, I'm okay.
- Hey.

244
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:22,401
Hey. Do you have any idea
what I went through to get this?

245
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:23,330
A lot.

246
00:13:23,406 --> 00:13:24,450
A real lot.

247
00:13:24,497 --> 00:13:27,542
You think this is just: "Oh, here comes
Peter with the Statue of Liberty's foot?"

248
00:13:27,587 --> 00:13:30,152
"Oh, isn't that a gas?"
No, no. The reality,

249
00:13:30,187 --> 00:13:33,322
the real reality of getting
this together was staggering.

250
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:34,232
You know?

251
00:13:34,257 --> 00:13:38,900
This cost me $437,000.
Don't ask me how I got it.

252
00:13:38,977 --> 00:13:42,171
I had to call in a whole bunch of favors
from people I've never even met.

253
00:13:42,276 --> 00:13:45,493
So the very least you can do is just
rub up against... I don't know.

254
00:13:45,527 --> 00:13:48,063
- Well, if you want I can...
- No, no, no. No. No. It's fine. No.

255
00:13:48,086 --> 00:13:49,901
Whatever. Just go to
your wedding, man.

256
00:13:51,326 --> 00:13:53,580
No. No, no, no.
Take... just get it out of here.

257
00:13:57,867 --> 00:14:00,730
Peter, what's the matter?
This is a happy occasion.

258
00:14:00,767 --> 00:14:02,541
No, it's not, Lois. It's horrible.

259
00:14:02,595 --> 00:14:04,891
You don't know what happens
to a man when he gets married.

260
00:14:04,967 --> 00:14:07,822
It's like a disease that rots
you from the inside out.

261
00:14:07,855 --> 00:14:09,373
I know, Peter, but...

262
00:14:09,406 --> 00:14:10,560
Oh, damn it.

263
00:14:10,596 --> 00:14:13,570
I can't believe how much
my breasts have swollen.

264
00:14:19,805 --> 00:14:21,892
Look out.
Champagne.

265
00:14:21,937 --> 00:14:22,962
Peter, stop.

266
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:27,052
Oh, Lois, you're all wet.

267
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:28,571
Here, let me jiggle you dry.

268
00:14:32,325 --> 00:14:33,863
Giggety-giggety. God!

269
00:14:33,886 --> 00:14:35,532
I've made a terrible mistake!

270
00:14:40,617 --> 00:14:43,580
Oh, my God! You blew it up!

271
00:14:43,905 --> 00:14:46,230
You really did it.

272
00:14:46,316 --> 00:14:49,240
Damn you all to hell!

273
00:14:55,597 --> 00:14:57,472
Oh, God, I gotta get
out of this marriage.

274
00:14:57,505 --> 00:15:00,641
- Cleveland, how did you get out of yours?
- You slept with my wife.

275
00:15:00,688 --> 00:15:03,821
It's easy, Quagmire.
Just tell her to hit the bricks.

276
00:15:03,868 --> 00:15:05,802
Yeah, you've gotten out
of commitments before.

277
00:15:05,886 --> 00:15:07,653
Wow, that was great.

278
00:15:07,715 --> 00:15:09,263
Sure was. See ya.

279
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,091
But you said we were
gonna get married.

280
00:15:11,136 --> 00:15:13,622
No, I only said that so you'd
giggoogety my gashmoigin.

281
00:15:20,646 --> 00:15:21,803
So, anyway,

282
00:15:21,845 --> 00:15:23,520
what I'm trying to tell you is, uh...

283
00:15:23,738 --> 00:15:26,080
some of the guys thought
we should get a divorce.

284
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:27,400
What?!

285
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:31,061
B- b-b-b-but I, I told them they didn't
know what they were talking about.

286
00:15:31,136 --> 00:15:32,381
Good. Good.

287
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:35,303
'Cause if you ever left me,
I'd have to cut myself.

288
00:15:35,357 --> 00:15:37,853
and then... I'd cut you.

289
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:40,200
I love you, Glenn.

290
00:15:40,245 --> 00:15:43,281
I love you, too, insane woman
I'm having second thoughts about.

291
00:15:43,326 --> 00:15:44,693
- What?!
- All right.

292
00:15:51,515 --> 00:15:53,293
Yeah, sleep away, woman.

293
00:15:53,336 --> 00:15:55,932
But I'm here to claim
what's rightfully mine.

294
00:15:56,315 --> 00:15:57,941
Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah.

295
00:15:57,977 --> 00:15:59,912
Oh, that's the stuff.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

296
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:05,642
Dear God, I've got to
get a hold of myself.

297
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:08,642
Look at me, sucking pilfered
milk off a dirty carpet.

298
00:16:08,777 --> 00:16:11,603
I'm as pathetic as the fat
man when he tries to read.

299
00:16:12,286 --> 00:16:14,592
- Hey, Lois, what's this word?
- Evel.

300
00:16:14,627 --> 00:16:15,952
- And this one?
- Knievel.

301
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,100
- And this one.
- Was.

302
00:16:17,127 --> 00:16:18,302
- And this one.
- Born.

303
00:16:18,325 --> 00:16:19,420
- And this one.
- In.

304
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,000
- And this one.
- Montana.

305
00:16:21,996 --> 00:16:25,243
Oh, hey, Lois. Did you know that
Evel Knievel was born in Montana?

306
00:16:28,865 --> 00:16:30,170
You didn't tell her?

307
00:16:30,196 --> 00:16:32,030
Look, I told you,
she was gonna kill herself.

308
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,921
- What was I supposed to do?
- Let her.

309
00:16:35,196 --> 00:16:36,590
No, that's not funny.

310
00:16:36,626 --> 00:16:39,752
Wait a second. We know she's
gonna be upset if you dump her,

311
00:16:39,778 --> 00:16:42,152
but if something happened
that was out of your control...

312
00:16:42,188 --> 00:16:45,260
- What do you mean?
- I mean, we're gonna fake your death.

313
00:16:49,096 --> 00:16:50,733
All right, fellas, I think we did it.

314
00:16:50,766 --> 00:16:55,860
This may be the most absolutely perfect
fake death in the history of fake deaths.

315
00:16:57,777 --> 00:17:00,033
- What do you guys want?
- Joan. Um...

316
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:02,682
You mind if we come in?
There's, um...

317
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:04,433
there's been an accident.

318
00:17:04,887 --> 00:17:07,493
This is, uh, not going to be easy,

319
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,790
but, um, it's something you should see.

320
00:17:11,676 --> 00:17:14,280
So, anyway, here's Quagmire
walking through the park

321
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:18,073
minding his own business. I just happened
to be there with my video camera,

322
00:17:18,107 --> 00:17:20,071
when a ninja shows up!

323
00:17:21,045 --> 00:17:23,300
And then a Nazi came!

324
00:17:24,267 --> 00:17:27,122
And then an evil pots-and-pans robot.

325
00:17:27,196 --> 00:17:28,500
Destroy.

326
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,170
Destroy.

327
00:17:30,688 --> 00:17:33,382
I imagine you're probably wondering
what happened to the body.

328
00:17:33,437 --> 00:17:34,820
Well, we thought of that.

329
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:37,870
Oh, no, Quagmire's dead.

330
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:40,012
Wait. We might still be able to save...

331
00:17:40,047 --> 00:17:41,393
Oh, no...

332
00:17:52,888 --> 00:17:56,160
We are so, so sorry for your loss.

333
00:17:56,197 --> 00:17:57,392
Is this a joke?

334
00:17:57,427 --> 00:18:00,130
I wish it were, Joan.
I wish it were a joke.

335
00:18:00,306 --> 00:18:02,451
But these things happen, you know?

336
00:18:02,506 --> 00:18:06,190
You go for a walk in the park one
day and wheel chair ninjas and Nazis

337
00:18:06,228 --> 00:18:09,803
and pots-and-pans robots show up to kill
you and dinosaurs show up to eat the remains.

338
00:18:09,828 --> 00:18:12,531
- You've seen the news.
- You're not fooling anyone.

339
00:18:12,585 --> 00:18:14,152
All right, fellows, Plan B.

340
00:18:14,185 --> 00:18:15,340
Plan B, Quagmire.

341
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:16,751
Hi, honey, I'm home!

342
00:18:17,637 --> 00:18:18,830
Heart attack.

343
00:18:20,855 --> 00:18:22,942
Glenn! Sweetheart!

344
00:18:22,987 --> 00:18:25,433
- Is he all right?
- No, he's dead.

345
00:18:25,498 --> 00:18:27,742
- I can tell. I'm a cop.
- Oh, my God.

346
00:18:27,788 --> 00:18:29,082
Are you sure?

347
00:18:29,118 --> 00:18:32,341
You know what'll prove it? When
people die, they void their bowels.

348
00:18:33,277 --> 00:18:36,812
I said, when people die,
they void their bowels.

349
00:18:40,225 --> 00:18:42,023
What a jackass.

350
00:18:45,418 --> 00:18:47,740
- Well, you look a lot better.
- I did it, Brian.

351
00:18:47,777 --> 00:18:50,931
Through sheer force of will,
I kicked my addiction to breast milk.

352
00:18:50,965 --> 00:18:53,760
I just had to find a way to
make breasts seem repulsive.

353
00:18:53,797 --> 00:18:56,370
- Yeah? How'd you do that?
- I watched In the Cut.

354
00:18:56,476 --> 00:18:58,243
Meg Ryan, topless.

355
00:18:58,316 --> 00:18:59,992
No thanks. No thanks.

356
00:19:00,247 --> 00:19:03,303
Stewie, Mommy has a surprise for you.

357
00:19:03,328 --> 00:19:04,292
What are you doing?

358
00:19:04,338 --> 00:19:06,702
Well, Brian, I thought
I was ready to wean him,

359
00:19:06,726 --> 00:19:08,811
but I just miss the bonding.

360
00:19:09,468 --> 00:19:12,531
No. No! No, put me down!
I beg of you!

361
00:19:12,555 --> 00:19:15,123
I just kicked the stuff.
Damn you!

362
00:19:15,598 --> 00:19:17,123
You sick, twisted...

363
00:19:17,705 --> 00:19:18,843
I hate you.

364
00:19:19,296 --> 00:19:20,470
I love it.

365
00:19:20,928 --> 00:19:22,392
I will kill you!

366
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:31,451
You sure Quagmire's okay in there?

367
00:19:31,497 --> 00:19:33,831
No problem. He's got
half an hour of oxygen.

368
00:19:33,887 --> 00:19:35,603
We'll sneak back
later and dig him up.

369
00:19:38,007 --> 00:19:41,453
Sorry I'm late. I had a meeting
over at NBC about Joey.

370
00:19:41,496 --> 00:19:44,380
Death? What are you doing here?
Nobody's dying today.

371
00:19:44,415 --> 00:19:46,111
Not according to my paperwork.

372
00:19:46,158 --> 00:19:48,840
Says here your buddy Quagmire
died of a heart attack.

373
00:19:48,886 --> 00:19:51,963
I gotta tell you, I always thought
it'd be rectal trauma.

374
00:19:54,968 --> 00:19:56,722
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the hell are you doing?

375
00:19:56,745 --> 00:19:58,643
Well, Mayor West is afraid of zombies,

376
00:19:58,688 --> 00:20:01,700
so the city says all caskets
must been cased in concrete.

377
00:20:01,746 --> 00:20:04,471
You'll thank me when
no one eats our brains.

378
00:20:04,818 --> 00:20:06,073
You'll thank me.

379
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:08,793
Hold it! Stop the funeral!
Quagmire's not really dead.

380
00:20:11,685 --> 00:20:12,993
Zombie!

381
00:20:16,438 --> 00:20:18,972
Glenn! I thought I'd lost you!

382
00:20:19,016 --> 00:20:23,240
Sorry, Mr. Quagmire, but I still need
a body to take back with me, so...

383
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:25,591
No! You can't take him!

384
00:20:28,876 --> 00:20:30,660
Uh... You know, um...

385
00:20:30,705 --> 00:20:33,260
This is probably not cool.
Just throwing it out there.

386
00:20:33,597 --> 00:20:35,760
- She was suicidal.
- She was?

387
00:20:35,807 --> 00:20:37,800
- Yeah, absolutely.
- I have heard that, too.

388
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:40,723
- And her last name was Quagmire.
- Well, good enough for me.

389
00:20:40,755 --> 00:20:43,162
I gotta go. I got tickets
to Celine Dion.

390
00:20:43,215 --> 00:20:46,722
I'm not gonna kill her. I'm just
gonna watch her die on her own.

391
00:20:46,748 --> 00:20:48,531
Anyone? Anyone?

392
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,770
It's good to have you back, Quagmire.

393
00:20:51,797 --> 00:20:53,463
It's good to be back, Peter.

394
00:20:54,256 --> 00:20:55,243
Hey, Death?

395
00:20:55,325 --> 00:20:57,620
Can you leave that body here
for another five minutes?

396
00:20:59,226 --> 00:21:00,741
That's Quagmire.

397
00:21:05,355 --> 00:21:07,511
