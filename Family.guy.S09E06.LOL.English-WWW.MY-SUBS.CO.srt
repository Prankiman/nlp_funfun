00:00:34,918 --> 00:00:36,953
(doorbell ringing)

13
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:39,830
Hi.
Package for Brian Griffin.

14
00:00:39,898 --> 00:00:41,165
Oh, I can sign for that.

15
00:00:41,232 --> 00:00:43,100
Package, Bri.

16
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,468
Huh.
Wonder what this is.

17
00:00:44,536 --> 00:00:46,937
It's my book.

18
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,006
And there's a note
from my publisher.

19
00:00:49,074 --> 00:00:51,275
"We are returning
all of the unsold copies

20
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:53,010
of <i>Faster Than</i>
<i>the Speed of Love."</i>

21
00:00:53,078 --> 00:00:54,578
You guys got a garage
or something?

22
00:00:54,646 --> 00:00:56,246
We got like 300 boxes
of these things.

23
00:00:56,314 --> 00:01:00,551
Wow, that's a lot of boxes!

24
00:01:03,655 --> 00:01:05,422
Oh, this is so weird.

25
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:07,357
Look what they used
to pack your book in.

26
00:01:07,425 --> 00:01:09,059
Shredded-up pieces of your book.

27
00:01:09,127 --> 00:01:10,527
Okay, that's it, I'm finished.

28
00:01:10,595 --> 00:01:11,795
What are you
talking about?

29
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,464
I'm... I'm finished.
I'm done. It's over.

30
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:15,532
Clearly, I am not
meant to be a writer.

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,168
I have tried and I have tried,
and nothing has worked out.

32
00:01:18,236 --> 00:01:21,004
I... put my heart out there,
and it keeps getting stomped on.

33
00:01:21,072 --> 00:01:22,973
Well, that's it, no more.

34
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,608
I... I... I'm done writing.

35
00:01:24,676 --> 00:01:26,276
What?
Writing's the only thing

36
00:01:26,344 --> 00:01:27,678
that's giving your alcoholism
any credibility.

37
00:01:27,745 --> 00:01:29,346
Ooh, hey, you know,
I just thought of something,

38
00:01:29,414 --> 00:01:30,914
hold on a sec.

39
00:01:30,982 --> 00:01:33,484
I bought a vase last week
and it's still in the box,

40
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:36,320
and I just want to check to see
what they used to pack it...

41
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,821
Ah, it's your book!

42
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:45,062
Oh, my God,
this gets me so angry!

43
00:01:45,113 --> 00:01:46,130
What?
What is it?

44
00:01:46,197 --> 00:01:47,764
Look at this.

45
00:01:47,832 --> 00:01:50,300
The number-one book on <i>The New</i>
<i>York Times</i> Bestseller list

46
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:52,870
is <i>Dream Your Way to</i>
<i>Spiritual Joy</i> by Pauly Shore.

47
00:01:52,937 --> 00:01:54,738
This is why nobody
bought my damn book.

48
00:01:54,806 --> 00:01:56,406
You know,
this is what they want.

49
00:01:56,474 --> 00:01:57,841
<i>The Secret.</i>

50
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,610
<i>Chicken Soup for the Soul.</i>
<i>The Purpose Driven Life.</i>

51
00:01:59,677 --> 00:02:02,646
I... I tell ya, I could crap one
of those things out in a night.

52
00:02:02,714 --> 00:02:04,548
I'm gonna tell Mom
you said "crap."

53
00:02:04,616 --> 00:02:07,718
No, I mean it. I could do it in three
hours and idiots everywhere would buy it.

54
00:02:07,785 --> 00:02:09,656
- Well, why don't you?
- Believe me, I would love to,

55
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,156
just to make a point, but I...
I've given up writing.

56
00:02:12,223 --> 00:02:14,091
Yes, but you cared about
what you wrote before.

57
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,460
You don't care about this,
so what does it matter?

58
00:02:16,528 --> 00:02:18,028
Well, you do have a point.

59
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,263
All right. Maybe I will.

60
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,131
Oh, how fun.
Can I watch you write it?

61
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:23,634
I don't know, Stewie,
I kind of like to write in solitude.

62
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:26,470
No, no, I promise,
I'll be as quiet as a guy in a coma.

63
00:02:26,538 --> 00:02:27,804
MAN:
<i>Ah, this is great.</i>

64
00:02:27,872 --> 00:02:29,640
<i>I can finally be alone</i>
<i>with my thoughts.</i>

65
00:02:29,707 --> 00:02:32,843
<i>Wait, I've got it.</i>
Predator versus Batman.

66
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:35,712
<i>Why has no one done this?</i>
<i>I need a pen, where's a pen?</i>

67
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,315
<i>Oh, right, I can't move.</i>
<i>That's okay, I'll remember it.</i>

68
00:02:38,383 --> 00:02:40,150
<i>I mean, I can't forget a</i>
<i>million-dollar idea like that.</i>

69
00:02:40,218 --> 00:02:42,553
<i>It's even better than the one</i>
<i>yesterday about the guys who...</i>

70
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,354
<i>Wait, I mean</i>
<i>the woman with the...</i>

71
00:02:44,422 --> 00:02:46,290
<i>What was it?</i>
<i>Was she a shapeshifter?</i>

72
00:02:46,357 --> 00:02:48,992
<i>Damn it, I just had it.</i>
<i>All right, calm down.</i>

73
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,527
<i>At least you've still</i>
<i>got</i> Batman and the...

74
00:02:50,595 --> 00:02:52,262
<i>It was</i> Batman Meets...

75
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,131
<i>Oh, you got to be kidding me,</i>
<i>I just had it.</i>

76
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:56,300
<i>What was it,</i> Batman Has a Son?

77
00:02:56,367 --> 00:02:59,102
<i>No, no, you</i> (bleep) <i>idiot.</i>
<i>No wonder your wife shot you.</i>

78
00:03:04,075 --> 00:03:05,676
And... done.

79
00:03:05,743 --> 00:03:07,177
There it is, Stewie.

80
00:03:07,245 --> 00:03:08,912
Three hours, 27 minutes
and I've got myself

81
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,447
one big steamin' pile of book.

82
00:03:10,515 --> 00:03:12,416
- You want to hear it?
- Oh, definitely.

83
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,584
What are you calling it?

84
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:14,785
<i>Wish It, Want It, Do It.</i>

85
00:03:14,852 --> 00:03:15,986
Love it.

86
00:03:16,054 --> 00:03:17,955
Thanks. Okay.
"Chapter One: Wish it.

87
00:03:18,022 --> 00:03:20,691
"What are all the things
you want most in the world?

88
00:03:20,758 --> 00:03:22,292
"Use the following
blank pages

89
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,661
to write down all of your
dreams and desires."

90
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:27,097
- Ah. Brilliant. Make them do the work.
- Yeah, why not?

91
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,166
You know, i... i...
If people want crap, I'll give 'em crap.

92
00:03:29,234 --> 00:03:30,567
And, you know, I have a friend

93
00:03:30,635 --> 00:03:32,302
who might be able to help
get this published.

94
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,570
Wait, you have a friend
in publishing

95
00:03:33,638 --> 00:03:35,105
and you never told me before?

96
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,074
- He's kind of a new friend.
- Who is he?

97
00:03:37,141 --> 00:03:40,010
Yeah, I don't know if you want to
start digging around in this area.

98
00:03:40,078 --> 00:03:42,212
Let's just leave it at
he's a friend in publishing

99
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,747
and he calls on Thursdays.

100
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:52,122
Um, hey, Brian, when you're done,
can I make a pirate hat?

101
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,357
(sighs)
Here, just take it.

102
00:03:55,293 --> 00:03:57,294
I look awesome.

103
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,629
All right,
I got to go to a wedding.

104
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,697
I'll see you later.

105
00:04:00,748 --> 00:04:02,432
Oh, my God,
that is fantastic news!

106
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,635
I can't wait to tell him!

107
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,270
I know,
I told you the book was good.

108
00:04:06,337 --> 00:04:09,072
Yeah,
thank you so much, Don.

109
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,908
Um... Red overalls,
a yellow shirt underneath...

110
00:04:11,976 --> 00:04:14,611
Um, I... I... I don't really have
time to do this right now.

111
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:15,879
Brian,
they're publishing your book.

112
00:04:15,947 --> 00:04:17,981
You're kidding.
I... I can't believe it.

113
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,883
That's the worst thing
I've ever written.

114
00:04:19,951 --> 00:04:21,852
Not according
to Penguin Publishing.

115
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:23,754
In fact, you're supposed
to call the chief editor.

116
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:25,055
(phone ringing)

117
00:04:25,123 --> 00:04:26,456
Penguin Publishing.

118
00:04:26,524 --> 00:04:27,791
One moment, please.

119
00:04:27,859 --> 00:04:30,260
Sir, I have a Brian Griffin
on the line...

120
00:04:30,328 --> 00:04:32,195
Out. Get out!
Get out now!

121
00:04:39,158 --> 00:04:42,227
All right, everyone,
I made a very special breakfast

122
00:04:42,295 --> 00:04:44,162
to celebrate Brian's
book coming out.

123
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,958
And... And...

124
00:04:46,025 --> 00:04:47,759
It's a special breakfast
for me, too, right?

125
00:04:47,827 --> 00:04:49,061
Why?

126
00:04:49,128 --> 00:04:51,496
Because...
Because it is the anniversary

127
00:04:51,564 --> 00:04:54,499
of when I started
to eat vegetables.

128
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:56,768
Author! Author!

129
00:04:56,836 --> 00:04:58,303
And Peter for eating healthy.

130
00:04:58,371 --> 00:05:00,339
Oh, Lois, you didn't have
to go through all this fuss.

131
00:05:00,406 --> 00:05:01,840
What you got there?

132
00:05:01,908 --> 00:05:03,809
Oh, this?
It's just a copy of <i>Us</i> magazine.

133
00:05:03,876 --> 00:05:05,310
Can you believe it?

134
00:05:05,378 --> 00:05:07,546
<i>Wish it, Want it, Do it</i>
got three stars.

135
00:05:07,614 --> 00:05:08,981
How...
How hilarious is that?

136
00:05:09,048 --> 00:05:10,983
It's not hilarious.
It's great, Brian.

137
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,751
That's a huge accomplishment.

138
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:14,953
Well, I helped get the review in.

139
00:05:15,021 --> 00:05:16,655
I called a friend
over at <i>Us Weekly</i>

140
00:05:16,723 --> 00:05:19,124
who usually just covers people
with gross amounts of children,

141
00:05:19,192 --> 00:05:20,392
but now he's the book reviewer.

142
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,194
So hats off to both of us.

143
00:05:22,261 --> 00:05:25,130
Well, n... Nice going, Stewie.
You ought to be my publicist.

144
00:05:25,198 --> 00:05:27,299
You know, I... I don't want you
to be offering me this

145
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:28,634
just because we're related.

146
00:05:28,701 --> 00:05:30,469
I do have references
you can call.

147
00:05:30,536 --> 00:05:32,137
You know, I...
I spent a month

148
00:05:32,205 --> 00:05:34,039
as Melanie Griffith's
loose skin holder.

149
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:34,923
Melanie! Melanie!
Over here.

150
00:05:35,008 --> 00:05:36,508
You look beautiful.

151
00:05:36,575 --> 00:05:40,812
Can't... hold... on...
much... longer... Whoa.

152
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,280
(photographers gasping)

153
00:05:42,348 --> 00:05:44,449
(à la Droopy Dog):
I should have stayed in bed.

154
00:05:47,387 --> 00:05:49,054
Yeah, we're walking in now.

155
00:05:49,122 --> 00:05:51,356
Make sure Tom Tucker knows
he has twenty minutes

156
00:05:51,424 --> 00:05:54,526
and he is to only talk about the book.
No personal questions, all right?

157
00:05:54,594 --> 00:05:57,029
Are you okay? You good? You...
You need anything? All right.

158
00:05:57,096 --> 00:05:59,431
All right, we're inside and there
is nobody here to greet us.

159
00:05:59,499 --> 00:06:02,167
We have no idea where we are or
where we're supposed to go.

160
00:06:02,235 --> 00:06:04,236
Oh wait, is that you
on the phone over there?

161
00:06:04,303 --> 00:06:06,238
Is this...? This is us.
Look over here.

162
00:06:06,305 --> 00:06:07,906
There we go.
He sees us. All right.

163
00:06:07,974 --> 00:06:09,041
Hi, thanks for coming.

164
00:06:09,108 --> 00:06:10,475
Yeah, hello,
we've been here awhile.

165
00:06:10,543 --> 00:06:12,210
Come on,
I'll show you the green room.

166
00:06:12,278 --> 00:06:15,013
And Mr. Griffin, I just have to say,
I loved your book.

167
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:16,248
Oh, well, thanks.

168
00:06:16,299 --> 00:06:17,249
- What's your name?
- Sharhooz.

169
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,417
Oh, my God.

170
00:06:18,484 --> 00:06:21,620
It'll just be a few minutes.

171
00:06:21,688 --> 00:06:24,089
Oh, uh, excuse me,
there's something on the wall.

172
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,493
Now you have exactly twenty
seconds to find us a room

173
00:06:28,561 --> 00:06:31,163
with a white sofa,
a white table, white hydrangeas

174
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,447
and Fiji water!

175
00:06:33,766 --> 00:06:35,267
Geez, Stewie,
there's no need to...

176
00:06:35,334 --> 00:06:38,103
Ooh, I said no gray M & M's.
These are all gray.

177
00:06:38,171 --> 00:06:40,172
Don't worry, Brian.
I've got it all under control.

178
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:41,807
You're a big canine star.

179
00:06:41,874 --> 00:06:43,508
They should be treating
you like Spuds MacKenzie.

180
00:06:43,576 --> 00:06:45,310
Man, I wonder
what he's doing now.

181
00:06:45,378 --> 00:06:47,512
(wheezing)

182
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,448
Now, ladies,
approach him slowly.

183
00:06:49,515 --> 00:06:51,183
He can't really see anymore.

184
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,385
I've injected him with the Viagra.

185
00:06:53,453 --> 00:06:55,087
Now, I'm gonna roll
him on his back,

186
00:06:55,154 --> 00:06:57,923
but you're pretty much gonna
have to do 100% of the work.

187
00:07:01,461 --> 00:07:04,162
We're here with Brian Griffin,
local author

188
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,531
of the new bestseller
<i>Wish it, Want it, Do it.</i>

189
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:08,366
Am I pronouncing
that correctly?

190
00:07:08,434 --> 00:07:09,801
Uh, yeah.

191
00:07:09,869 --> 00:07:12,504
N... Now, what does that mean:
<i>Wish It, Want It, Do It</i>?

192
00:07:12,572 --> 00:07:16,108
Uh, well, it... It basically just
refers to the steps necessary

193
00:07:16,175 --> 00:07:19,544
for identifying and achieving
your dreams and doing so

194
00:07:19,612 --> 00:07:22,380
in as effective and expeditious
a manner as possible.

195
00:07:22,448 --> 00:07:25,117
Wow.
And it's nonfiction, right?

196
00:07:25,184 --> 00:07:26,351
Y... Uh... Yes, it is.

197
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:28,019
Now, w... Which one is that?
I always forget.

198
00:07:28,087 --> 00:07:30,021
Is that the one that
really happened or not?

199
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:31,990
- Uh... yeah.
- Okay, oh, so this...

200
00:07:32,058 --> 00:07:34,025
So now... So this is...
This is a true story.

201
00:07:34,093 --> 00:07:35,527
Well, it's not really
a narrative...

202
00:07:35,595 --> 00:07:37,596
Doesn't matter.
I'm hooked.

203
00:07:37,663 --> 00:07:39,264
And we'll be right
back with sports.

204
00:07:39,332 --> 00:07:41,266
Okay, you're doing
great so far.

205
00:07:41,334 --> 00:07:42,934
Now I was just texting
with New York.

206
00:07:43,002 --> 00:07:44,336
We're doing a
whole thing there.

207
00:07:44,403 --> 00:07:46,338
I booked your plane ticket,
and I specifically asked

208
00:07:46,405 --> 00:07:48,039
that you not sit next
to an Asian.

209
00:07:48,107 --> 00:07:49,541
Stewie, that's racist.
That's terrible.

210
00:07:49,609 --> 00:07:52,210
I'm sorry, do you want me
to call back and change it?

211
00:07:52,278 --> 00:07:54,746
Well, it's done now.
Seems like a lot of extra work.

212
00:08:00,753 --> 00:08:01,987
Okay, there's a book signing

213
00:08:02,054 --> 00:08:04,239
at the Barnes and Noble
on Union Square at 5:00.

214
00:08:04,323 --> 00:08:06,558
And then at 7:00 you're
meeting with a reporter

215
00:08:06,609 --> 00:08:07,793
from <i>In Style</i> magazine
at Pastis.

216
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,494
I just wanna warn you,
she's very heavy.

217
00:08:09,562 --> 00:08:11,163
So be prepared for that.

218
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,198
- Geez, how heavy?
- I don't know, but apparently heavy enough

219
00:08:13,249 --> 00:08:15,033
that they felt they
needed to warn me.

220
00:08:15,084 --> 00:08:17,435
Oh, look at this,
your book is number three on Amazon.

221
00:08:17,503 --> 00:08:18,537
Number three?

222
00:08:18,604 --> 00:08:19,805
Well, who's number one?

223
00:08:19,872 --> 00:08:22,007
Oh, it's that new biography
on Michael Jackson.

224
00:08:22,074 --> 00:08:23,775
Oh, come on, another one?

225
00:08:23,843 --> 00:08:25,243
Unless it was written

226
00:08:25,311 --> 00:08:26,745
by a ten-year-old's bottom,
who cares?

227
00:08:26,813 --> 00:08:29,414
I... It doesn't say who
the author is, Brian,

228
00:08:29,482 --> 00:08:31,917
but I... I would guess that
it's probably not that.

229
00:08:31,984 --> 00:08:33,552
Well, Stewie,
I can't tell you

230
00:08:33,619 --> 00:08:34,953
how much I appreciate
all you're doing.

231
00:08:35,021 --> 00:08:36,888
I mean, I... I have been so
happy with most everything.

232
00:08:36,956 --> 00:08:38,590
Oh... y... Most?

233
00:08:38,658 --> 00:08:40,826
Oh, yeah... Oh, don't even,
it's so tiny, those other things,

234
00:08:40,893 --> 00:08:42,794
it's not even worth...
Oh, my God, you're amazing.

235
00:08:42,862 --> 00:08:44,396
I've been so thrilled
with how you're doing.

236
00:08:44,463 --> 00:08:45,463
Oh, great.

237
00:08:45,531 --> 00:08:46,798
Hi, can I help you?

238
00:08:46,866 --> 00:08:48,633
Yeah, uh... Checking in.
Brian Griffin.

239
00:08:48,701 --> 00:08:50,468
You...
You should usually do that.

240
00:08:50,536 --> 00:08:51,870
That...
You should check me in.

241
00:08:51,938 --> 00:08:54,039
That's like one of the
things I was talking about.

242
00:08:54,106 --> 00:08:57,242
I just have to tell you,
I loved your book, Mr. Griffin.

243
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,312
Oh, thank you so much.
You made my day.

244
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:01,546
So, you still in school?

245
00:09:01,614 --> 00:09:03,114
Graduating this year.

246
00:09:03,182 --> 00:09:05,317
Well, we'll have to
celebrate while I'm here.

247
00:09:05,384 --> 00:09:09,521
(giggles) Okay, well,
I'll be right back with your key.

248
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:11,656
She's so pretty, isn't she?

249
00:09:11,724 --> 00:09:13,024
Yeah...
You know.

250
00:09:13,092 --> 00:09:14,459
Do you think she liked me?

251
00:09:14,527 --> 00:09:15,827
I don't know.

252
00:09:15,895 --> 00:09:17,329
How... How weird would it be

253
00:09:17,396 --> 00:09:19,264
if she just showed up
at my room later?

254
00:09:19,332 --> 00:09:20,832
I...
Pretty weird, I guess.

255
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,101
Oh, my God, were you...
Were you thinking of doing that?

256
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:24,636
Sending her to my room?

257
00:09:24,704 --> 00:09:26,538
No...
Why?

258
00:09:26,606 --> 00:09:28,673
Why? Were you thinking
of me doing that?

259
00:09:28,741 --> 00:09:31,109
I don't even know what
you're saying anymore, man.

260
00:09:31,177 --> 00:09:33,178
Just... Do...
Do whatever you're thinking.

261
00:09:33,246 --> 00:09:35,013
Oh, man, crazy.

262
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:43,588
Hi, um, I just want to say
that I can't tell you

263
00:09:43,656 --> 00:09:45,090
how much your book
has helped me.

264
00:09:45,157 --> 00:09:46,124
Uh-huh.
What's your name?

265
00:09:46,192 --> 00:09:47,592
It's Jan.

266
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,827
Okay, here you go, Dan.

267
00:09:48,895 --> 00:09:50,028
Y... Yeah, it's Jan.

268
00:09:50,096 --> 00:09:51,496
Back of the line.
Go on.

269
00:09:51,547 --> 00:09:52,898
Come back around,
he'll try it again.

270
00:09:52,965 --> 00:09:55,100
Hi. Can you make
it out to Kelly?

271
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:57,602
Well, hi there.
I sure can.

272
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,304
You know, I have to tell you,

273
00:09:59,372 --> 00:10:01,439
<i>Wish It, Want It, Do It</i>
totally changed my life.

274
00:10:01,507 --> 00:10:03,775
Well, you know, that's what I
set out to do with this book,

275
00:10:03,843 --> 00:10:07,779
so, you know, I gotta tell you,
that makes me feel pretty great.

276
00:10:07,847 --> 00:10:09,981
This is just a phone number.

277
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:12,951
I know, I know,
my phone number.

278
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:15,353
- Oh.
- Yeah.

279
00:10:15,421 --> 00:10:16,988
What do you think of that?

280
00:10:17,056 --> 00:10:19,624
Um, I'm not sure.

281
00:10:19,692 --> 00:10:20,926
Well, you know,
I'm sure for you.

282
00:10:20,993 --> 00:10:22,928
- Oh.
- Yeah.

283
00:10:22,995 --> 00:10:25,430
- I see.
- Yeah.

284
00:10:25,498 --> 00:10:27,065
I'm a little creeped out.

285
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:30,251
Hey, congratulations,
somebody famous now hates you.

286
00:10:30,336 --> 00:10:33,138
Okay, so,
that's enough autographs, I think.

287
00:10:33,205 --> 00:10:35,473
Listen, I want to thank
you all for coming down.

288
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:38,877
And remember,
<i>Wish It, Want It, Buy It.</i> All right.

289
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:40,345
Brian, settle down.

290
00:10:40,413 --> 00:10:42,180
You're worse than that guy
from Penguin Publishing.

291
00:10:42,248 --> 00:10:44,349
You want to get a book published,
don't you?

292
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:46,151
Well...
Yes.

293
00:10:46,218 --> 00:10:48,386
Well, if you want to be
in black and white,

294
00:10:48,454 --> 00:10:50,689
black and white's
gotta be in you.

295
00:10:59,432 --> 00:11:01,266
God, you know,
Stewie, I... I used

296
00:11:01,334 --> 00:11:03,768
to think that John Lennon
was kind of a jerk

297
00:11:03,836 --> 00:11:05,770
for saying The Beatles
were bigger than Jesus,

298
00:11:05,838 --> 00:11:07,772
but now, I mean, it's like,

299
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,241
I'm not saying I am,
but I get it.

300
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:12,277
You know, now that we have
two minutes

301
00:11:12,345 --> 00:11:13,645
to kinda let
the dust settle,

302
00:11:13,713 --> 00:11:16,247
I just wanna say
that I'm really proud of you.

303
00:11:16,315 --> 00:11:18,183
Hey, I'm proud of myself, man.

304
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,784
I mean, I think it's like...
You know,

305
00:11:19,852 --> 00:11:22,220
I... I think everybody has
greatness in them,

306
00:11:22,288 --> 00:11:24,689
but it's... It's really about
having the courage

307
00:11:24,757 --> 00:11:26,691
to just kinda get inside
your own head

308
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:29,361
and just kinda poke around in there,
you know, be, like,

309
00:11:29,428 --> 00:11:31,162
"Hey, oh, my gosh,
what's under here?

310
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,797
"Hey, what do you call <i>yourself?</i>

311
00:11:32,865 --> 00:11:34,032
"Oh, Wisdom.

312
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,066
"Oh, Profundity.

313
00:11:35,134 --> 00:11:37,535
"Oh, Truth.

314
00:11:37,603 --> 00:11:39,604
"Hey, let's, let's all just go
hang out together

315
00:11:39,672 --> 00:11:41,172
between the covers of a book."

316
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,174
I love hearing
about your process.

317
00:11:43,242 --> 00:11:45,443
Hey, enough about me.
This was a great meal.

318
00:11:45,511 --> 00:11:47,379
Oh, good, good,
I'm glad you like it.

319
00:11:47,446 --> 00:11:48,880
They told me
everybody comes here.

320
00:11:50,182 --> 00:11:51,349
Hey, there's
Renee Zellweger.

321
00:11:51,417 --> 00:11:52,751
Hey, Renee,
how you doin'?

322
00:11:52,818 --> 00:11:54,519
Oh, hi, Brian!

323
00:12:00,993 --> 00:12:02,427
She seemed really nice.

324
00:12:02,495 --> 00:12:03,595
Get over here!

325
00:12:03,646 --> 00:12:04,796
Is... Is everything okay?

326
00:12:04,864 --> 00:12:05,997
No, everything is not okay.

327
00:12:06,065 --> 00:12:07,665
Can you figure out
what the problem is?

328
00:12:07,733 --> 00:12:09,734
I... I don't...
I... I honestly have no...

329
00:12:09,802 --> 00:12:11,136
Oh, God!

330
00:12:11,203 --> 00:12:14,039
How do you think I feel walking
out of the back room

331
00:12:14,106 --> 00:12:16,808
of a restaurant and seeing
Renee Zellweger eating

332
00:12:16,876 --> 00:12:18,543
in the front room
of that restaurant?

333
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:19,611
I am mortified.

334
00:12:19,678 --> 00:12:20,945
Absolutely mortified!

335
00:12:21,013 --> 00:12:22,714
You should know better
than this!

336
00:12:22,782 --> 00:12:25,550
I... I told them who you were
when I made the reservation!

337
00:12:25,618 --> 00:12:28,286
Look, I have written
a best-selling phenomenon!

338
00:12:28,354 --> 00:12:30,755
I should be sitting in
the front damn room!!

339
00:12:30,823 --> 00:12:32,524
Okay, okay, I hear you,
I hear you.

340
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:35,560
And I just want you
to know that my only goal is

341
00:12:35,628 --> 00:12:37,829
to be able to help you better.

342
00:12:37,897 --> 00:12:39,597
And you being
honest with me,

343
00:12:39,665 --> 00:12:41,066
well, that's helping
me do that.

344
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:42,033
So thank you.

345
00:12:42,101 --> 00:12:43,234
Good.

346
00:12:45,704 --> 00:12:47,639
Oh, Brian, are you going
straight back to the hotel?

347
00:12:47,706 --> 00:12:49,641
'Cause I was gonna go back...

348
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,709
You know what, I'll just...
I'll take a cab.

349
00:12:55,247 --> 00:12:56,514
Oh.

350
00:12:56,582 --> 00:12:58,450
Well, at least it's not raining.

351
00:13:07,805 --> 00:13:09,740
Hey, Brian,
welcome home!

352
00:13:09,821 --> 00:13:11,054
How was your book signing?

353
00:13:11,122 --> 00:13:12,422
Geez, Lois, could I have,

354
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,990
like, five minutes
to decompress, please?

355
00:13:14,058 --> 00:13:15,892
It was a really horrible flight,

356
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,897
and I was sitting next to a
<i>Japanese</i> guy who had a cold.

357
00:13:20,965 --> 00:13:23,633
Dear God,
he's become a monster!

358
00:13:23,701 --> 00:13:25,936
BRIAN: Stewie,
I got a flea thing goin' on in here!

359
00:13:26,003 --> 00:13:27,003
Where the hell's my Frontline?!

360
00:13:27,071 --> 00:13:29,673
(sighs)
(pager beeps)

361
00:13:29,741 --> 00:13:32,576
Oh, my God!
Brian! Brian!

362
00:13:32,643 --> 00:13:33,777
Brian, look at this!

363
00:13:33,845 --> 00:13:36,146
I got you on
<i>Real Time with Bill Maher!</i>

364
00:13:36,214 --> 00:13:37,881
You're kidding?
That's awesome, Stewie!

365
00:13:37,949 --> 00:13:39,015
Great job!

366
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,951
Oh, "Great job,"
so you know that phrase.

367
00:13:41,018 --> 00:13:42,285
- What's that?
- What?

368
00:13:42,353 --> 00:13:44,054
What phrase do I know?

369
00:13:44,122 --> 00:13:45,589
Bill Maher, whoo!

370
00:13:50,328 --> 00:13:52,329
Okay, so the topic is going to be:

371
00:13:52,396 --> 00:13:54,131
"Should God play a role in politics?"

372
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:56,800
Oh, and here's your heartworm
pill wrapped in bologna.

373
00:13:56,868 --> 00:13:58,502
Stewie, the point
of the bologna is

374
00:13:58,569 --> 00:14:00,437
that I don't know
the pill is there.

375
00:14:00,505 --> 00:14:02,672
Why am I standing
under an air vent?!

376
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,040
Um... Because...

377
00:14:04,108 --> 00:14:06,409
- Because that's where...
- Because that's where...

378
00:14:06,477 --> 00:14:08,078
- I...
- I...

379
00:14:08,146 --> 00:14:09,780
- Because...
- Because...

380
00:14:09,847 --> 00:14:10,947
- Well...
- Well...

381
00:14:11,015 --> 00:14:12,415
- I can...
- I can...

382
00:14:12,483 --> 00:14:13,550
- Uh...
- Uh...

383
00:14:13,618 --> 00:14:15,051
- You...
- Yeah...

384
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:16,787
- Uh...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh.

385
00:14:16,854 --> 00:14:18,789
Okay, Mr. Griffin,
we'll be ready in five minutes.

386
00:14:18,856 --> 00:14:21,391
You'll be on the panel with Arianna
Huffington and Dana Gould.

387
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:22,859
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

388
00:14:22,927 --> 00:14:24,194
My... My publicist told me
Christopher Hitchens

389
00:14:24,262 --> 00:14:25,562
would be on the panel.

390
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,899
No, we told him Dana
and Arianna two hours ago.

391
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:31,535
I did my prep research on
Christopher Hitchens.

392
00:14:31,602 --> 00:14:34,237
I am so sorry.

393
00:14:34,305 --> 00:14:35,705
I am done with you.

394
00:14:35,773 --> 00:14:37,073
Do you hear me?!
Done!

395
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:38,375
Get out of here now!

396
00:14:38,442 --> 00:14:40,710
- Brian, please.
- You're fired!

397
00:14:47,752 --> 00:14:50,086
Yes, but I think the more
important question

398
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:51,888
that sometimes gets
ignored is

399
00:14:51,956 --> 00:14:54,057
what about the separation
of church and state?

400
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,425
Well, Bill, see, I think...

401
00:14:55,493 --> 00:14:57,127
Uh-uh-uh, actually, Dana,
if I may... If I may,

402
00:14:57,195 --> 00:14:59,062
I have some insight on this.
Bill, do you mind?

403
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,430
Go, dog.

404
00:15:00,498 --> 00:15:01,431
(audience laughs)

405
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:03,266
Well, it just so happens

406
00:15:03,334 --> 00:15:05,702
that separation of church and
state is something

407
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,637
I'm actually gonna cover in
my next book,

408
00:15:07,705 --> 00:15:10,106
<i>God. Period. Dammit.</i>

409
00:15:10,174 --> 00:15:13,009
(audience laughs)

410
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:14,377
What does that mean?

411
00:15:14,445 --> 00:15:16,780
Uh, well,
if I can expand on this.

412
00:15:16,848 --> 00:15:20,550
Um, for one thing,
"In God we trust" is on money.

413
00:15:20,618 --> 00:15:22,886
Now, what does that tell ya?

414
00:15:22,954 --> 00:15:26,156
Tells me Americans will get
all Christ-y

415
00:15:26,224 --> 00:15:28,358
about any sort
of stupid (bleep).

416
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:30,126
So what?

417
00:15:30,194 --> 00:15:33,196
I think what's
actually alarming is the fact

418
00:15:33,264 --> 00:15:36,266
that all this kind
of pseudo spirituality is

419
00:15:36,334 --> 00:15:39,603
being peddled to the American
people in books that have,

420
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:43,440
really, less substance
than an issue of <i>TV Guide.</i>

421
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:44,941
That's a good argument.
It's a very good argument.

422
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:46,343
I agree. I agree.

423
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:50,714
Really? Because I read
<i>Wish It, Want It, Do It.</i>

424
00:15:50,765 --> 00:15:52,382
Oh, my God,
I'm so embarrassed!

425
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,917
Uh, gosh,
next thing you know,

426
00:15:53,985 --> 00:15:55,619
both of you guys are
gonna tell me

427
00:15:55,686 --> 00:15:57,187
that it changed your lives.

428
00:15:57,255 --> 00:16:00,523
Uh, yeah, I...
I didn't read it.

429
00:16:00,591 --> 00:16:02,192
(audience laughs)

430
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,228
Oh, hey, oh, so you're the guy.
(chuckles)

431
00:16:05,296 --> 00:16:06,863
It's... It's actually...
It's actually very popular.

432
00:16:06,931 --> 00:16:08,498
Well, it may be popular,

433
00:16:08,566 --> 00:16:11,434
but I... I have to say
I agree with Arianna.

434
00:16:11,502 --> 00:16:13,069
Uh, I think
it's actually quite harmful.

435
00:16:13,137 --> 00:16:15,338
Oh. Did you...? When...
When did you say that?

436
00:16:15,406 --> 00:16:17,040
I just did.

437
00:16:17,108 --> 00:16:18,575
(audience laughs)

438
00:16:18,643 --> 00:16:20,810
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry, maybe...
Maybe 'cause it sounds

439
00:16:20,878 --> 00:16:22,545
like you're talking
with a mouthful of syrup,

440
00:16:22,613 --> 00:16:24,314
I just didn't get it.

441
00:16:24,382 --> 00:16:26,216
(audience laughs)

442
00:16:26,284 --> 00:16:27,918
Hey, (bleep) you, man.

443
00:16:27,985 --> 00:16:30,820
(audience laughs, applauds)

444
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:36,626
Actually, it... It...
I mean, it seems

445
00:16:36,694 --> 00:16:40,597
that these sorts of books tend
to pander to the laziest kind

446
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:43,300
of self-help within the
narrowest socioeconomic range.

447
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:46,736
I mean, yeah, you can wish it,
and you can do it,

448
00:16:46,804 --> 00:16:49,339
but only if you have
the educational advantages,

449
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,741
the societal advantages
that, like, what,

450
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:53,777
five percent of the country has.

451
00:16:53,844 --> 00:16:55,946
Well, yeah, you forgot
"Want it," which is such a big part

452
00:16:56,013 --> 00:16:57,781
of the book. I mean, but...
But you know, then again,

453
00:16:57,848 --> 00:16:59,582
you just said you haven't read
it, so, you know...

454
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:02,452
Actually, since I said that,
I did read it.

455
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,087
(audience laughs)

456
00:17:04,155 --> 00:17:06,189
And that's another thing,
I have to say

457
00:17:06,257 --> 00:17:09,960
aren't "Wish it" and "Want it"
really the same thing?

458
00:17:10,027 --> 00:17:12,729
(audience laughs)
I mean, your book...

459
00:17:12,797 --> 00:17:14,731
basically makes three points,

460
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,033
and two of them
are the same point.

461
00:17:17,101 --> 00:17:18,401
(audience laughs)

462
00:17:18,469 --> 00:17:20,870
Well, you know, I mean,
it does seem to be helping

463
00:17:20,938 --> 00:17:22,005
a lot of people, Bill...

464
00:17:22,073 --> 00:17:25,375
Well, "help" is a strong word.

465
00:17:25,443 --> 00:17:30,747
Um, how does this help people,
like, with cancer or in Darfur?

466
00:17:30,815 --> 00:17:33,183
Well, I mean,
it's not really for them.

467
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,118
It's for, like,
if you want a car.

468
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:36,386
(audience laughs)

469
00:17:40,658 --> 00:17:42,859
How... How does this
help you get a car?

470
00:17:42,927 --> 00:17:44,894
Well, I mean,
it doesn't with <i>that</i> attitude.

471
00:17:44,962 --> 00:17:48,031
I mean, you have...
(audience laughs)

472
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:50,000
You have to do some
of the work yourself.

473
00:17:50,067 --> 00:17:51,501
That's why there are
fifty blank pages.

474
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:52,869
(audience laughs, applauds)

475
00:17:54,905 --> 00:17:57,607
That's why I keep it
by the phone.

476
00:17:57,675 --> 00:18:00,910
I think what this is
is simple exploitation

477
00:18:00,978 --> 00:18:03,580
of the American people who could
be using the money

478
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:07,417
that they spend to buy this book
to actually buy something useful

479
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:10,320
like legitimate healthcare
that they actually need.

480
00:18:10,388 --> 00:18:11,621
(applause)

481
00:18:13,924 --> 00:18:15,425
(clears throat)

482
00:18:15,493 --> 00:18:18,094
You know, what...
What the hell's your problem, Zsa Zsa?

483
00:18:18,162 --> 00:18:19,229
(audience laughs)

484
00:18:19,296 --> 00:18:21,531
What is your problem, Snoopy?

485
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:24,701
(audience laughs)

486
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:28,438
Look, what it comes down to is that these
false promises of, like, a quick fix

487
00:18:28,506 --> 00:18:31,041
to any and every problem
that you would ever have,

488
00:18:31,108 --> 00:18:33,676
what books like these suggest is
actually damaging

489
00:18:33,744 --> 00:18:36,513
to a large, gullible segment
of the population.

490
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,481
Oh, yeah,
aren't you a sitcom writer?

491
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:41,151
I'm an author.
I have contributed to the zeitgeist.

492
00:18:41,218 --> 00:18:42,819
Do you even know
what "zeitgeist" means?

493
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:45,922
If I didn't know what it meant,
I wouldn't use it, Dana...

494
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:49,659
Which... Which is a girl's name...
And I'm...

495
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,394
(audience laughs)
And you know,

496
00:18:51,462 --> 00:18:53,563
I... I'm not gonna give you...
I'm not gonna give you

497
00:18:53,631 --> 00:18:55,732
the definition right now just
for your satisfaction.

498
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,435
You know, Brian,
I don't think you're in a position, really,

499
00:18:58,502 --> 00:19:00,070
here to pull rank on anybody.

500
00:19:00,137 --> 00:19:02,639
I mean, yes,
Dana has made a career in comedy.

501
00:19:02,706 --> 00:19:04,407
I don't think
he's ever done anything

502
00:19:04,475 --> 00:19:05,809
as laughable as this book.

503
00:19:05,876 --> 00:19:07,110
Look, all right, well...

504
00:19:07,178 --> 00:19:10,213
What do you want?
I wrote it in a day.

505
00:19:10,281 --> 00:19:14,751
(audience groans)
Listen, Bill, I am such a big fan of yours.

506
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:16,753
I think you're totally getting
the wrong impression of me.

507
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:18,588
I... I was just trying to write
something that would sell.

508
00:19:18,656 --> 00:19:19,989
I... I think it's crap, too.

509
00:19:20,057 --> 00:19:23,860
Wow.
If I had even one shred

510
00:19:23,928 --> 00:19:28,231
of respect for you before this,
it's gone now.

511
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:30,800
I mean,
if you're gonna dump on people,

512
00:19:30,868 --> 00:19:35,705
the kind of steaming,
stinking, smelly dump

513
00:19:35,773 --> 00:19:37,607
that your kind traffics in...

514
00:19:37,675 --> 00:19:39,843
(audience laughs)

515
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:42,512
...at least stand by your dump.

516
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,848
(audience laughs)

517
00:19:47,051 --> 00:19:49,152
O... Okay, look,
I'm happy to do that.

518
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,820
I... I... I'm just...
I'm just try...

519
00:19:50,888 --> 00:19:52,489
Look, what I was saying...

520
00:19:52,556 --> 00:19:54,791
Look, just tell me
what you want me to say!

521
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:56,893
Bill, he's urinating!

522
00:19:56,961 --> 00:19:57,927
(bleep)

523
00:19:57,995 --> 00:19:59,028
That's it!

524
00:19:59,096 --> 00:20:00,163
- Look, Bill, can I just...?
- Outside.

525
00:20:00,231 --> 00:20:02,031
No, no, no, outside!
Outside now!

526
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:03,800
(barking)
Outside!

527
00:20:03,868 --> 00:20:06,002
You get outside!

528
00:20:11,942 --> 00:20:13,843
Uh, knock-knock.

529
00:20:13,911 --> 00:20:15,145
Hey, Stewie.

530
00:20:15,212 --> 00:20:16,613
What do <i>you</i> want?

531
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,948
I just wanna talk to you about
everything that happened.

532
00:20:19,016 --> 00:20:22,519
Um, you know,
you were the only person

533
00:20:22,586 --> 00:20:24,954
who believed in me
when I was down.

534
00:20:25,022 --> 00:20:27,657
This all happened so fast,
and I lost sight of who I was.

535
00:20:27,725 --> 00:20:29,159
I mean, you know, sure,

536
00:20:29,226 --> 00:20:31,361
you were in
a little over your head, but...

537
00:20:31,428 --> 00:20:32,595
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

538
00:20:32,663 --> 00:20:34,264
<i>I</i> was in over my head?

539
00:20:34,331 --> 00:20:36,466
Yeah, but, Stewie, this isn't about
all the things you did wrong.

540
00:20:36,534 --> 00:20:38,468
It's about me apologizing.

541
00:20:38,536 --> 00:20:39,636
Okay, then apologize.

542
00:20:39,703 --> 00:20:41,704
- I just did.
- No, you didn't.

543
00:20:41,772 --> 00:20:43,106
You just said it's
about me apologizing.

544
00:20:43,174 --> 00:20:44,207
That's not actually apologizing.

545
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:45,742
All right, Stewie, I'm sorry

546
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:48,044
that I made you uncomfortable
and put you in a situation

547
00:20:48,112 --> 00:20:49,479
that you clearly couldn't handle.

548
00:20:49,547 --> 00:20:50,980
Okay, okay, there it is again.

549
00:20:51,048 --> 00:20:52,282
What the hell?
Stop with that!

550
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:53,283
Y... You're right.
You're right.

551
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,684
This is,
this is about healing.

552
00:20:54,752 --> 00:20:56,519
This... This is not about
how many things

553
00:20:56,587 --> 00:20:57,954
you messed up
along the way.

554
00:20:58,022 --> 00:20:59,989
It's about how badly
I reacted to them.

555
00:21:00,057 --> 00:21:04,561
So, I'm sorry about how badly
I reacted to your many errors.

556
00:21:04,628 --> 00:21:06,996
That's as good as it's
gonna get, isn't it?

557
00:21:07,064 --> 00:21:09,032
- Pretty much.
- You can't write.
