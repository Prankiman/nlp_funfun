"It seems today that all you see

00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,000
"Is violence in movies and sex on TV

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,480

Look, I'm that pretty dark-haired
figure skater with the horse teeth,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,200
the one who got what she had coming.

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,600
Nice figure eight, Mom.

13
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,200
Ha! All right!

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,000
OK, Bonnie. One, two, three, push!

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,800
Oh! Ah! Whoa!

16
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,800
My God! I can walk! It's a mira...!

17
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,000
- Sorry, Dad.
- Just get the chair.

18
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,480
Good shot.
Made my brown eye blue with that one.

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,000
- Yeah. Next one's coming for your head!
- Oh, no! No, help! Oh, help!

20
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,000
- What the hell?
- Now is the winter of your discontent!

21
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,200
You wanna race? On your mark, get set, go!

22
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,000
First to where
that Pakistani girl fell through the ice

23
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,800
after coming to the States
for her severely burned face

24
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,080
she got when the man she refused to marry
dumped sulphuric acid on her, wins. I win!

25
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,600
Yes! Yes! In your face! In your face!

26
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,200
In my face! In my face!

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,680
Ahh! No! Acid girl! It's acid girl! Ahh!

28
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,080
- James Woods High! Whoo!
- Hey, guys.

29
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,000
- What do you want?
- I'm trying out for cheerleading.

30
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,680
Peter Rabbit would be wise
to stay out of Mr McGregor's garden.

31
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,800
Why don't you try the flag girls squad?

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,880
Are you trying out for flag girl?

33
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,280
Yes! I win again, Andy.

34
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,200
One more before
the missus notices I'm not on the couch.

35
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,400
Too late!

36
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,000
Hey, careful, Quagmire.
Don't get too close to that thing.

37
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,280
Did I just get laid?

38
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,600
- Nice game, Peter.
- I'm on a roll.

39
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,080
- I whipped Chris on the ice today.
- Enjoy it while it lasts.

40
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,680
It's only a matter of time
before he beats you.

41
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,800
What? I'm better than him at everything:
Sports, video games, even magic tricks.

42
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,600
- Ha-ha. Got your nose.
- Oh, yeah? Well, I got your face.

43
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,080
Calm down, Chris. It's only a trick.

44
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,200
Face it, sooner or later
you'll have to pass the torch.

45
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,600
I remember the first time
Kevin beat me. I was so proud,

46
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,480
I gave him a little congratulatory
punch in the arm. Then another.

47
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,800
Then everything got hazy. Kevin went
to live with a foster family for a while...

48
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,000
- It's inevitable.
- Don't feel bad.

49
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,200
I think I know why your son beat you.

50
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,000
Apparently, you're
a 12-year-old prepubescent girl.

51
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,480
Which is good, cos I finally have someone
to give this training bra to. Here, Josephina.

52
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,880
Does it feel good
on your new budding bosoms?

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
- It sure does...
- Get the hell off me!

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,080
Rudolph, we figured out
what makes your nose red.

55
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,800
- Is it pixie dust or leprechaun tails?
- No, it's a tumour.

56
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,280
You mean like
a magical Christmas tumour?

57
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,480
No, a malignant tumour, the base of which
is lodged deep within your brain.

58
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,480
- Oh. Like a happy special...
- You're going to die.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,200
Hey, everybody, guess what I am.

60
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,400
The end result of a drunken backseat
gropefest and a broken prophylactic?

61
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,800
- I'm on the flag girl squad!
- Oh, honey, congratulations.

62
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,800
- Hey, Chris. I bet you can't do this.
- I bet I can!

63
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,480
We perform at all the football games.
I'm practically a cheerleader!

64
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,480
That's wonderful. Isn't that wonderful?

65
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,080
Way to go, Stewie. Chris, I'll see
your fork and raise you a gravy ladle.

66
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,200
You're on!

67
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,000
So, you're a flag girl. That's great, Meg.

68
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,400
Yes, yes.

69
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,280
Now you can be somewhere else
when the boys don't call.

70
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,600
- All right. Salt shaker up the nose.
- I got pepper.

71
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,800
Ha-ha! Yes! I win!

72
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,880
- That was fun, Dad!
- I'm the man!

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,600
Yeah! Ahh!

74
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,680
Lois, go get the medical dictionary
and look up "fork" and "lung. "

75
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,880
- Why?
- Time's a factor, Lois.

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Say, Meg, looking sharp.
You want to go out after the game tonight?

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,480
Neil, I'm a flag girl now.
I'm way too cool to be seen with you.

78
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,080
Really? Not even
if I smoke this corncob pipe?

79
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,480
Are we all ready to cheer
at the game tonight?

80
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,800
"We?" Oh, you made flag girl, huh?

81
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,000
Yeah. This morning my mom
was, like, "Don't forget your lunch",

82
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,200
and I'm all "I'm a flag girl now,
I won't forget my lunch",

83
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,200
and she's all
"Don't forget your halftime routine. "

84
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,680
Moms! Hey, maybe we could all,
like, hang out after the game.

85
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,800
Go, team!

86
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,200
Uncool people are like animals.

87
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,080
You want to go feed
the science club after school?

88
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,080
Look at me.

89
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,880
Look at me, I'm smoking.
Dog, dog, look, look...

90
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Alcohol doesn't really make you warmer.
It constricts the blood vessels...

91
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,800
- Shut up.
- The dog just told me to shut up.

92
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,800
I demand to know
what you plan to do about this. Hey!

93
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,200
- Hey! The dog just told me...
- Be quiet, Stewie.

94
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,200
- Freezing my nips off out here.
- Oh, look, there's Meg.

95
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,200
Meg! Meg! Meg!

96
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,280
- Hi, Meg.
- Hi, Meg.

97
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
Here we go.

98
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,480
- Isn't she beautiful?
- Yeah, but I think she's with that guy.

99
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,280
- They've held hands all night.
- I mean Meg.

100
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,000
Oh. Oh, yeah. Yeah, she's hot.

101
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:04,080
- Oh! This meat stinks something fierce!
- This'll knock her down a couple notches.

102
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,280
Yea, Meg! Oh, man, I love how
these kids celebrate these days!

103
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,200
What do you got? What do you got?
Huh? Huh? Come on.

104
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,800
- Come on, ref. That's charging.
- Your feet were moving. No foul.

105
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,080
No foul?! Oh, that's a stupid call!
And I know something about stupid calls.

106
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,080
Hello?

107
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,080
I can't take out the garbage. I'm at
the office and they're making me stay late.

108
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,680
Caller ID says you're
calling from the kitchen.

109
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,200
- In fact, I can see you.
- Can you see me now?

110
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,000
- No.
- Now I'm at the office.

111
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,000
Score's tied, next basket wins.
You might finally beat your old man.

112
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,680
"Old man"? I'm the white Larry Bird.

113
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,800
What do you got?
What do you got? Huh? Come on!

114
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,400
- Your mother and I are getting a divorce!
- You are?

115
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,280
Yes! Yes! Oh, no, we worked it out.

116
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,680
Yes!

117
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,400
Son, you played good,
but your dad is still number one.

118
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:17,080
- Yeah, I don't think I'll ever beat you.
- Hey, Chris, what's with your leg?

119
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,600
Oh, my God! That's not your leg!

120
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,800
- What's wrong, honey?
- I'll tell you:

121
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,280
I try to make love to you
and you think about Chris.

122
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,800
- Is there something you need to tell me?
- Thanks to you, our son has a huge wang.

123
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,400
- Thanks to me?
- He didn't get it from me.

124
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,200
- What are you talking about?
- I'll show you.

125
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,680
All right, stand back, Lois.

126
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,680
Oh, my. No wonder he's always slouching.

127
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,880
How did this happen?
I'm supposed to be the man of the house.

128
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,200
- You must be ashamed of me.
- Oh, Peter.

129
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,400
I care as much about the size of your penis
as you care about the size of my breasts.

130
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,480
Oh, my God!

131
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,080
You can't let those awful kids get to you.

132
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,400
They won't. I'm never
going back to that school again.

133
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,600
- Dad, could you help me with my algebra?
- You're a big man. You figure it out.

134
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,400
I bet there's a part of you
that wants to be friends with them.

135
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,600
- Maybe.
- So be nice to them.

136
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,400
Win your enemies over
with unflappable kindness.

137
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,600
- Chris, drink your milk. It'll make you big.
- No! No more milk for him.

138
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,000
He's had enough. Give me that.

139
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,600
Megan, you must try the brisket. I'll serve it
in the manner to which you're accustomed.

140
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,880
Oh!

141
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,800
Come talk to me sometime, sweetheart.
I know what it takes to be cool.

142
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,600
Oh, yeah. That's the good stuff.

143
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,680
- Hi, you guys.
- God, it's her.

144
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,800
- Look, about the other night...
- Oh, that was hilarious.

145
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,000
I just wish I'd known ahead of time.
I would've brought potato salad!

146
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,680
You guys want tomorrow's biology test?

147
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,080
- Whoa! How'd you get that?
- I spent the night with Mr Burler.

148
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,680
Ah, the sun's up.
I'm safe for another night. Thanks, Meg.

149
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,480
- Wow, thanks!
- See ya.

150
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,200
- That was kinda cool.
- Yeah.

151
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,200
I'm bored.

152
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,400
Wanna go push the janitor,
knowing he can't legally push us back?

153
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,200
- Sure!
- OK, cool. Let's go do it.

154
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,800
Hey, Dad. Look at these little bananas.

155
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,880
Why, you smug little bastard!

156
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Peter! Chris, these are plantains.
And there's nothing wrong with them.

157
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,080
In fact, a lot of women prefer them
to normal-size bananas,

158
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,200
because they're exotic and flavourful
and very, very special.

159
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:25,880
Sure, all the sorority girls are clamouring
for the plantain section. Stop with this!

160
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,400
You're overreacting to this Chris stuff.

161
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,200
I mean, mine goes inside me
when I stand up. How do you think I feel?

162
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,200
- Is Dad mad at me?
- Oh, of course not, honey.

163
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,680
Go pick out a box of cereal and meet me
at the ten-inches-or-less line. Items!

164
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,800
Nice, huh? Huh? Yeah. You like this?

165
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,600
Stop it, Peter. You're embarrassing me.
Look, I know you're upset, but...

166
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,200
- Oh, my God. Where's Stewie?
- He's around.

167
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,800
Let me out of this
stink-filled corduroy dungeon!

168
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,280
- Peter, that's sick!
- It's OK. He's outside the underwear.

169
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,000
- Enjoy your new car, Mr Griffin.
- Thanks, Jim.

170
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:20,480
When you pull that thing into your garage,
does the garage say "Is it in yet?"

171
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,400
Don't worry, baby. I'll be gentle.

172
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,680
Ow. My pride.

173
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,800
You were right. I was nice to the cool kids
and they didn't spit on me.

174
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,480
Connie Demico even
invited me to her sweet 16.

175
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,000
Wonderful! What time do we nail
those snot-nosed punks?!

176
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,280
Nail them? You told me
to win them over with kindness.

177
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:05,280
Yes. Now that they think you're their friend,
it's the perfect time to exact your revenge.

178
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,400
Revenge?

179
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,280
I'm like one of those bald eagles
you see on the Discovery Channel:

180
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,200
Beautiful to look at,
but mess with one of my chicks

181
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,600
and I'll use my razor-sharp talons to rip
your eyes out! Cookies are done.

182
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,000
- Who wants chocolate-chip?
- I do!

183
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,480
But keep talking. All this stuff about
eye-gouging has gotten me all frisky.

184
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,800
Really. I've got about half a pack
of Rolaids in my diaper.

185
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,600
I'm glad you want to join
the National Gun Association.

186
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,000
Let me show you around.
This is our shooting range.

187
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,200
Here we have our locker room
with full shower facilities.

188
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,680
Holy crap! They're all so... small!

189
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,200
You see, Peter, the way we look at it,
a man's only as big as the gun he carries.

190
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,600
Sign me up, and get me
the biggest freakin' gun you got!

191
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,600
- Stewie, you can come out now.
- Turn off the light. I'm reading a ghost story.

192
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,400
Pull!

193
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,080
Oh, yeah.
Who's the big man now, huh?

194
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,600
- Madonna or Janet Jackson?
- Which Janet?

195
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,800
- Velvet Rope.
- Yeah, that one. Pull!

196
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,800
- What the hell are you doing with that?
- You want to touch it? Go on.

197
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,280
Careful. We don't want it to get
too excited and go off in your hand.

198
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,800
This is pathetic. All because
you feel inadequate next to Chris.

199
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,080
Don't be stupid. I don't need to compete
with my son or his freakishly large penis.

200
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,000
- I'm a freak.
- Don't despair.

201
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,080
Let's hang a tyre on the end of it
and head on down to the ol' swimming hole.

202
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:54,280
Connie Demico's house is two storeys.
If we set up booby traps here, here...

203
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,080
- How'd you get these blueprints?
- Oh, your mother has her ways.

204
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,400
She has her ways.

205
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,280
- Can I have those blueprints?
- Sure, here you go.

206
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,400
Now I've put together
a little flash bomb to create a diversion.

207
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,000
I used to date
the pyro guy from Whitesnake.

208
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,200
What's Whitesnake?

209
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:16,000
That's the music mommies and daddies
listen to. Fire in the hole!

210
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,200
Some guys from the club
are going hunting tomorrow.

211
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,000
- Count me in.
- Hunting?

212
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,400
- You were gonna play hockey with Chris.
- Bring him along.

213
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,600
- Oh, no. It's too dangerous.
- Lois, Lois.

214
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,280
The National Gun Association is all about
safety, especially when it comes to kids.

215
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,480
Take a look at our new video.

216
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,880
Let's face it, your kids will get
into your guns. That's a fact.

217
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Gun accidents can be avoided by
introducing your children to guns early.

218
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,400
Hi! I'm Petey the pistol.
Say, do you ever get lonely?

219
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,800
- Yes.
- Me, too. Hold me.

220
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,880
If you squeeze me,
I make bad people go away.

221
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,080
But wait a minute.
I thought guns were bad.

222
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,000
False! Guns are good.

223
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:08,600
In fact, did you know that Jesus and Moses
used guns to conquer the Romans?

224
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,280
So remember: Guns don't kill people,
dangerous minorities do.

225
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,080
See, Lois? They're responsible.

226
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,880
Hey. Hey, check it out, Chris.
I can write my name in the snow.

227
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,200
- This is fun, Dad.
- Son, son, I told you.

228
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,600
Out here in the wilderness,
call me Rooster Cogburn.

229
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,880
I was starting to think
you didn't like me any more.

230
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,200
Shh. Chris, look! Tracks.
There must be a deer around here.

231
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,280
- Those are snowmobile tracks.
- Shh! There he is.

232
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,200
Such grace. That's the thing
about hunting - you gotta be patient.

233
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
What the hell was that?!

234
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,680
Put this in the heating grate
and set it off in five minutes.

235
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,800
I changed my mind. I won't do it.

236
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,880
- They're my friends now.
- They pelted you with meat.

237
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,680
Did you forget the neighbour kids
chased you and sprinkled you with fixings?

238
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,280
Yes, I did!

239
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,480
OK. Now we're gonna play
Seven Minutes in Heaven,

240
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,880
and it's my party, so I want Doug
to go in the closet with... Meg.

241
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,080
Have fun.

242
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,880
OK. Everyone get ready.
Say hello to the lovers.

243
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,800
I don't know who should be
more humiliated, Meg or the pig.

244
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,800
- She's such a dork.
- I think I feel worse for the pig.

245
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,200
Mom, you were right!
I should have just stuck to the plan!

246
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,600
I figured you might get soft on me,
so I hired an old friend to scar them for life.

247
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,200
- Hey there, sweetie. How old are you?
- 16.

248
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,800
- 18?! You're first.
- Mom!

249
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,680
I like where this is going.
Giggidy-giggidy-good-goody.

250
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,080
Don't worry, Chris, I'll handle the bear.
Say hello to Satan for me!

251
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,680
It's a boy, Mrs Griffin.

252
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,200
I'm afraid the fever
has affected his motor skills.

253
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,880
He's gonna have to repeat the fourth grade.

254
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,600
Looks like he'll have to repeat
the fourth grade, Mrs Griffin.

255
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,800
The only way to get rid of them
is with this shampoo and a tiny comb.

256
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,800
Congratulations.
You've passed the fourth grade.

257
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,200
Great. I gotta leave though.
I'm going hunting with my son.

258
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,800
Dad, I know what to do!
I saw it on Fox's When Bears Attack!

259
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:59,800
Go away! Go on, get!
Stay tuned for an all-new Ally McBeal!

260
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,000
Holy crap! Chris, that was amazing.
I mean, I just froze up.

261
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,680
But you handled that bear like a real man.
I'm proud of you, son.

262
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:12,280
You are? Because I heard
what you said about my huge... you know.

263
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,600
Oh. Oh, you heard that, huh?

264
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,400
I was just being stupid. Take it from me,
that thing you got there is a blessing.

265
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,880
I mean, every guy you see with a big house
or a fancy car or a shiny gold tooth

266
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,800
is really just saying
"Don't look at my penis. "

267
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:32,480
- But you'll never have to worry about that.
- Thanks, Dad! You're the best.

268
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,200
You know, Dad, I just realised something.
Your name's Peter.

269
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,800
You're right, it is.

270
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,880
Peter.

271
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,000
