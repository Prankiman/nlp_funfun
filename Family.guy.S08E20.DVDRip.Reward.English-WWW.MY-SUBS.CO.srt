I'm not really a hug person.

155
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:24,343
Knock it off. Come here. Come on, bring it.

156
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,749
Yeah, yeah. Hug it out, bitch.

157
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,787
Hug it out, yeah.
Spray that hug all over me.

158
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,048
What's wrong with you?

159
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:33,023
What? I just wanna share
my throbbing emotions

160
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:34,457
and shoot hot hug all over you.

161
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,085
I don't get why that's a problem.

162
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,630
Hey, Luke. Take care of yourself, okay?

163
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,756
You, too.

164
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:41,959
Hey, what'd you end up doing
with that dog we kidnapped?

165
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,661
I killed it and ate it!

Lord Vader,
we've entered the Hoth system,

171
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:09,661
but the Rebels have put up
an energy shield blocking our entry.

172
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,026
What are we gonna do now, buddy?

173
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,497
Admiral Ozzel came out
of Iight speed too quickly.

174
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:17,229
(CHUCKLING) Yeah. I had that problem
with a chick the other night.

175
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:20,864
Okay, gross. I'm gonna
turn around and take care of this other guy.

176
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:24,370
Lord Vader; we're out oflight speed and...

177

(CHOKlNG)

178
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:28,307
You have failed me
for the Iast time, Admiral.

179
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,981
Didn't know I could choke you
through the TV, did you?

180
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,542
Well, I can.
Captain Piett, you're in charge now.

181
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,555
Don't fail me, Admiral Piett.

182
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,984
A promotion? Really?

183
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,425
Can I get business cards
that say "Admiral""?

184
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:45,191
That's not in the budget. You know,
we're trying to catch Rebels here.

185
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,562
I don't even have business cards.
None of us do.

186
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,157
-Do you have business cards?
-Yeah.

187
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,465
You have business cards?
You're a stormtrooper.

188
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:54,131
There's Iike a million of you.
What do you need business cards for?

189
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:55,503
Well, they're for my cookie business.

190
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:57,769
I don't want... Oh, my God.

However, we have decided
that our transports

196
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,860
will travel directly toward
the fleet of Star Destroyers.

197
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,090
-Any questions?
-Yeah.

198
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:23,067
Is there someone from the military
we can talk to? A man, perhaps?

199
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,869
Sir, Rebel ships are coming into our sector.

200

205
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,003
Just Iike new. How about you, Dack?

206
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:05,976
I feel Iike I could take on
the whole Empire myself.

207
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,741
Really? 'Cause that would be awesome.

-Nah.

No. No; you buy.

Sorry. Does that.

460
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:21,028
AII right.
Now, Iet's go over what we've Iearned.

461
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:24,097
-Naked chicks. Best?
-Rebecca De Mornay in Risky Business.

462
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:26,336
-Good. Worst?
-Kathy Bates in About Schmidt.

463
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:30,142
Correct. I also would've accepted
the rotting old woman in The Shining;

464
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:33,149
but Kathy Bates is probably worse.
Best scene in Teen Wolf?

465
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:34,707
When Michael J. Fox is in the bathroom,

466
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,310
turning into a werewolf for the first time

467
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:38,548
and his dad's
knocking on the door and he is freaking out

468
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,217
and he opens the door
and his dad's a werewolf, too.

469
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,281
Gold star.

470
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,851
I would've also accepted the scene
at the end, at the basketball game,

471
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:47,056
where the guy
in the crowd has his dick out.

472
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,758
-What?
-Yeah, there's a guy at the end.

473
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:51,563
Go online. Look it up.
He's in the stands, way in the background,

474
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:54,070
and he's totally got his dick out.

475
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:57,799
What's in there? It feels cold.

476
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:00,944
That place is strong with the dark side.

477
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:04,645
But it's very confusing
and it stops the movie dead.

478
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:06,809
I'm going in there anyway.

They may come around for another attack.

You're not done with all your Force stuff.

could fight Vader.
