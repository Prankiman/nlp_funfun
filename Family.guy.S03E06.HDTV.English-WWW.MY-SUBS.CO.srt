"It seems today that all you see

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,330
"Is violence in movies and sex on TV

00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,000
"But where are those
good old-fashioned values

"On which we used to rely?

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,100
A tragic accident in the Providence area.

11
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,650
A family lost their lives
when they swerved off the road

12
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,770
and into a ravine, exploding on impact.

13
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,280
- Do you find this funny, Tom?
- Oh, no.

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,360
I was remembering I accidentally
put my shirt on inside out this morning.

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,450
It's fine now, though. So what were
you saying? A fashion show?

16
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,200
Turn the TV off. We gotta find
an anniversary gift for Mom and Dad.

17
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,450
Don't look! We're shopping!
We're shopping!

18
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:08,250
Kids, you don't need to do anything special
for our anniversary. Just your father.

19
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,460
I hope he doesn't get you a gift
at the last minute again.

20
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,040
My goodness. A human thumb.
Where did you ever find this?

21
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,840
It was on e-bay.
Oh, God! Call an ambulance!

22
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,260
This year, instead of exchanging gifts,

23
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,010
I told him it'd be nice if we could
spend a romantic day together.

24
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,100
Oh, dear. I think we all know what
that means. Boi-oi-oi-oiing. Gross.

25
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:38,140
Hey, fellas. I got us a tee time tomorrow
at Barrington Country Club.

26
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,850
- Barrington? Wow.
- I'm in.

27
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,100
- Peter, tomorrow's your anniversary.
- Oh, crap!

28
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:48,150
If Lois finds out I'm ditching her,
she'll hit me with a frying pan.

29
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,780
Which is why I'm gonna drink
this frying pan antidote.

30
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,900
All right, hit me with this. Didn't work.

31
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:19,120
What the hell?
"Lois, it's an anniversary scavenger hunt. "

32
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:24,630
"Your first clue is at the Quahog Mini-Mart.
Love, Peter. " Oh, how fun!

33
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,180
Before you tee off, here are your
complimentary monogrammed bag towels,

34
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,510
a sleeve of balls,
and this mobile ball cleaner.

35
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:46,020
- Clean as a whistle, sir.
- I won't get short by touching your spit?

36
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,140
You'd be the first, champ.

37
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:54,230
- It's about time.
- Sorry, fellas. I'm not gonna be able to play.

38
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,440
Loretta's mother is in town and we have
to go buy new sheets for the dog bed.

39
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:02,690
- Cleveland!
- I mean the pull-out sofa bed.

40
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:07,570
You could be the first black guy to play
this course. People are gonna be impressed.

41
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,780
- Hey, a black guy.
- Ooh, fun.

42
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,780
- Come on.
- Maybe we should play another time.

43
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:17,790
Screw that. I busted my ass keeping Lois
busy so I could be here. Grip it and rip it.

44
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,290
The fed will be lowering rates, so get
your money out of T-bills and put it all into...

45
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,790
Waffles! Tasty waffles with lots of syrup!

46
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,170
Waffles! Buy waffles!

47
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,670
Waffles! Waffles! Waffles!

48
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,760
Waffle! Waffle! Waffle! Waffle!

49
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,220
OK, kids, keep your eyes peeled for a clue.

50
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,590
What Jughead has done here -
and it's quite ingenious actually -

51
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,220
is paint pupils on his eyelids

52
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:50,020
so he can sleep through class
without Miss Grundy being any the wiser.

53
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,600
He's sleeping.

54
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:57,400
- Mom, I found Dad's first clue.
- I can't believe your father organised this.

55
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,900
Usually he can't even handle simple tasks.

56
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,650
Peter, why is there a diaper
in the lamp socket?

57
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,940
Lois, he's done it again!
Wait a minute.

58
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,320
Ha!

59
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:18,160
- Let's pack it in. There's too much water.
- Let's hit the bar.

60
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,040
Oh, come on. There's worse things
in life than rain. Like... like spiders.

61
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,460
He's behind the door!

62
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,250
Peter, he's bothering
everyone. Say something.

63
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,250
I'll kick his ass.
Someone ought to kick his ass.

64
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,130
Don't go in there!

65
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,050
- Peter!
- All right, all right. Give me a Kleenex.

66
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:41,090
I knew he was bad. I knew it... Aah!

67
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:44,090
Out of me way!
They're after me Lucky Charms!

68
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,260
I paid him ten bucks to say it. Classic.

69
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:54,100
- We'll be in the clubhouse.
- Go on, run away. More golf course for me.

70
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,730
That was close. That looks dangerous.
Somebody's gonna get hurt.

71
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,190
Ah, it'll be fine.

72
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,150
You again?!

73
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,330
- Death, please don't take me now.
- Relax. You're not dying.

74
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,790
- You're having a near-death experience.
- Thank God!

75
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:32,580
Oh, yeah. Thank God I get to hang out
with a fascinating gent like yourself.

76
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:37,250
- So, when am I gonna die?
- Two years after your wife divorces you.

77
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,170
What are you talking about?
Lois would never leave me.

78
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:43,210
She's been crazy about me
since the night we met.

79
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,090
Oh, my God, that's me! Look how thin I was!

80
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,890
My, this is certainly a beautiful night.
I love looking at stars.

81
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,390
- Say no more.
- Peter, wait. I...

82
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,220
Very interesting... but stupid.

83
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:05,190
Oh, my God! I love Arte Johnson!

84
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,770
- Then why don't you give him a kiss, huh?
- No. Peter, get away from me with that.

85
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,770
- Come on. Give Arte Johnson a kiss.
- Peter, stop it. I mean it!

86
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,360
Oh!

87
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,070
Oh, my God!

88
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,080
Oh, Peter, I hear music.

89
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,540
Yeah, me too.
From now on, this'll be our song.

90
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,170
Ow!

91
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:49,090
I've never met a guy like you.
You're so full of life.

92
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:57,300
It's like I can really be myself
with you. I'm so happy.

93
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:01,470
- Oh, man, she was beautiful.
- This looks awfully familiar.

94
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,890
Wait a second. I remember this.

95
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:07,520
That's me! Look at all that hair.

96
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,480
I can't believe I thought that looked good.
I must've been high.

97
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,190
- I love you, Lois Pewterschmidt.
- I love you, Peter Griffin.

98
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:20,570
Look at that. Huh? Huh?
There's no way she's gonna leave me.

99
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,480
Now put me back in my freakin' body.

100
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:28,570
I can't until you have a revelation.
One of those things that changes your life.

101
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,860
The hell with this. I'm going home.

102
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:35,370
- You can't get in that way.
- I'm sure as hell not going in the back door.

103
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:40,040
Oh, crap. I don't have time for this.
Listen, I'm late for an appointment.

104
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,500
If you don't want to follow
procedure, fine. Stay in limbo.

105
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,040
No, no, wait, wait.
I don't want to be in limbo.

106
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,340
OK. It says the next note
will be right under my nose.

107
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,760
They're off!

108
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,390
And quick out in front, Silver Dasher,
followed by My Nose!

109
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,300
Aha! Hold my purse!

110
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:15,060
- What's Mom doing?
- She's screwing up my six-two quinella.

111
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,560
My Nose out in front,
followed by Sea Biscuit,

112
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,810
followed by Some Crazy Lady
and Middle-Aged Housewife,

113
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,230
followed by Wait a Minute, Who's That
and Silver Dasher.

114
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,780
And now it appears there's
a woman chasing the dogs.

115
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:34,150
- Let's go, kids!
- Tell the boys in Kansas City the bet's off.

116
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,870
Too late, Stewie. The fix is in
and the noodles are boiling in the pot.

117
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,700
Wait, I got it. I figured out my revelation.

118
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,620
- God loves a working man.
- No!

119
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,250
The Shadow is in reality Lamont Cranston,
wealthy young man.

120
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:54,040
No! Oh, crap! I'm late. I'm in big, big trouble!

121
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:58,630
You're shook up about that appointment.
You're Death. What are you afraid of?

122
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:03,210
Where the hell have you been?
When I said lunch, I said noon, not noonish.

123
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,720
- Sorry, Ma.
- Is sorry gonna reheat the casserole?

124
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,890
- So, who's your friend?
- It's a work thing. Near-death experience.

125
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,180
- Where are you going?
- To take a leak.

126
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:19,890
Don't forget to zip up your fly. If you don't
zip up your fly, a seagull will get ya!

127
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,770
God, she's a pain in the ass!
I wish Dad was still dead.

128
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:28,230
Oh, yeah. I'll tell you, Lois's dad
was a pain in the ass when I met him.

129
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,610
- Hi. Can I take my tie off yet?
- Oh, Peter, you look so wonderful.

130
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,160
- You aren't nervous, are you?
- You'll know when I'm nervous.

131
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,990
- Lois?
- Now.

132
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:48,370
Take the rap for this. I only get one chance
to make a first impression.

133
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,580
Hi, Daddy. That was me. And this is Peter.

134
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,000
Hey, Mr Pewterschmidt.
What are you feeding this gal?

135
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,210
Peter Griffin. Can I take this tie off?

136
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:02,130
It's a pleasure.
My daughter is taken with you.

137
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:07,960
And I'm taken with her. I mean, look at her.
Huh? Show us front and back there, Lois.

138
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:11,170
Don't think I don't know
where that comes from.

139
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,930
That's world-class juice
you got brewing in the old flesh balloon.

140
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,180
- Eh? Eh? Oh, yeah.
- I'm gonna go get my purse.

141
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:22,850
Based on what you've seen with your wife,
what can we expect in terms of droopage?

142
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,600
Are we talking a slope or full-blown
fried eggs hanging on a nail?

143
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,020
- What do you think of this?
- It's nice.

144
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,190
- It's Etruscan.
- Get out of here.

145
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,110
- No, seriously.
- Oh, that's great.

146
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,280
- Hey, look. A manatee!
- We can use it for soup.

147
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:59,330
Ensign Glen Quagmire. Welcome aboard.
You picked a great day to get rescued.

148
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,790
We were just about to sing
a song about mopping.

149
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,130
"We're mopping the deck
Which is Navy for "floor"

150
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:09,340
"And when we're done mopping
We'll mop it some more

151
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,800
- Oh!
- " Swab means mop, deck means floor...

152
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,590
Could you tell me when
you're going back in time?

153
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,800
I was talking to a robe for 20 minutes
before I realised you weren't in it.

154
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,350
Ma, for God's sake,
leave me alone! I'm working!

155
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:29,970
Don't yell at your mother! If you yell at your
mother, a hen will lay eggs in your tummy.

156
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,520
- Brilliantly choreographed.
- That's your tax dollars at work.

157
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,730
Why not join us and see the world?

158
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:40,190
Sorry, pal. I've seen the world,
and its name is Lois.

159
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,860
How romantic.
Why can't you find a nice girl?

160
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,280
- Ma, she's gonna dump him.
- At least he got that far.

161
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,400
You know who he took
to the prom? His cousin!

162
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,610
- That's weak.
- Yeah.

163
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,990
All right. All right, that's it!
I'm sick of both of you. Come on, Peter.

164
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,410
Death, put your jacket on
or you'll get frostbite!

165
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,950
- I don't have skin!
- That's cos you didn't eat your beans!

166
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,540
Come on, come on.
Get back in your big, fat body.

167
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:12,210
Why should I help you save your marriage
when I can't get a girl?

168
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,500
Whoa, wait! What are you saying?

169
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:18,880
The revelation, jackass! It could have
helped you save your marriage.

170
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:25,130
But too late. Oh, and by the way, when the
lightning hit you, you soiled yourself. Enjoy.

171
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,550
Wait, wait. I can't lose Lois!
Please, I'll do anything.

172
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:34,600
- What if... what if I helped you get a girl?
- Really? You think you could do that?

173
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,980
All we gotta do is get you fixed up.
Get your hair cut, give you a good, clean...

174
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,020
...shave, cologne... Chicks'll be all over you.

175
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:48,360
- Gee! You really think so?
- Absolutely.

176
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,570
You got any SPF-50?
I bleach like a gym sock.

177
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,870
Death, will you relax? The beach
is a perfect place to pick up chicks.

178
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:06,830
Now, I want you to go over there
and ask those girls if you can play.

179
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:11,290
- Hey, can I join you?
- I guess. What's your name?

180
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,460
- Josh.
- Do you, like, live around here?

181
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,080
No. I... I live with my mom.

182
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,210
- Let's get out of here
- See ya, Josh. Tell your mom we said hi.

183
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,420
Heads up!

184
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,430
How do we get up there?
Dad put grease on the pole.

185
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:34,640
Don't worry. We've been
studying fulcrums in school.

186
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:40,600
You have to counterbalance the weight
at the point where the lever pivots. Like so.

187
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,890
Stewie, you wanna play rocket ship?

188
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,350
- What the deuce?
- Blast off! Go on. Get the note for Mommy.

189
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,020
How dare you use me
for your own personal selfish... Hmm.

190
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:56,030
Oh. Pull slower. I must remember
to do this game when no one's around.

191
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:59,860
What was I thinking? You don't know
anything about picking up chicks.

192
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:02,570
Are you kidding? I learned from the best.

193
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,700
Come on, buddy.
We're dropping anchor in Jamaica!

194
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,540
- Great! We're closer to Rhode Island.
- Rhode Island? Forget that.

195
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,620
I'm taking you out for shore leave.

196
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,910
- Does this look like a "Q" to you?
- No.

197
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,420
- How about now?
- Your crotch just looks like Lois to me.

198
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,590
Let's ask her then. Lois, should Peter
sit around and mope all night?

199
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:29,880
Or should Peter go out with his buddy
and have some fun?

200
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:32,170
All right!

201
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,180
That one's a feminist type,
she's into he-men,

202
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,510
and that one's mad for jazz. Watch this.

203
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,680
The plight of women is deplorable.
I can bench-press 800 pounds.

204
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,520
You, me and Coltrane till dawn.

205
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,310
There you go, Peter.
One for you, two for me.

206
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,520
You guys go on without me.

207
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,400
- So why didn't you go with them?
- You don't know what it's like in love.

208
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:07,820
Oh, yeah? Her name's Amy.
She works at a pet store.

209
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:11,990
I met her last summer when her dad
hung himself. I was too shy to ask her out.

210
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,910
- What's with that moustache?
- Let me see that.

211
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:18,660
Sorry. That's Edward James Olmos.
Here, this is her.

212
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:23,460
- Nice ass.
- Sorry. That's Edward James Olmos's ass.

213
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,580
I guess I don't have a photo.
Trust me, she's cute.

214
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,670
Let's go get her.

215
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:32,130
- I'll need that picture of Olmos's ass back.
- Oh, yeah.

216
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:37,010
Mom, hurry! I can't stand the smell!

217
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:41,590
I found the note!
"Go back to the mini-mart"?

218
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,930
This isn't very creative. Let's go, kids.

219
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:49,310
Mom, you remember that goldfish
we flushed down the toilet?

220
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,520
He wasn't dead.

221
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:56,940
- There she is. That's her.
- All right, go on. Just like we practised.

222
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,860
- Hey, you.
- Hi. I was just, uh... uh...

223
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,730
in... in... I was just
in the neighbourhood and...

224
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:12,150
So I thought that, uh... So... You...

225
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,990
I'll, uh... This is a bad time.

226
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:19,530
Maybe I'll just come back.

227
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,910
- Who am I kidding? I'll never get her.
- Not with that attitude. Come on!

228
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,870
Robert Reed got Florence Henderson
and he was a burgermeister.

229
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,170
You gotta find a way to make it happen.

230
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,880
So long. I hope you find your girl.

231
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,750
Thanks, Quagmire.
Hope you live next door to me someday.

232
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,050
Hey, does this look like a "Q" to you?

233
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,420
How about now?

234
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:50,090
So, where is it that you need to go,
my new honky friend?

235
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,260
Rhode Island. That's not too far, is it?

236
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:58,020
Nothing's too far away from Maxine,
the cheatin' queen. Women.

237
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,770
That's not fair. I'm just speaking out of hurt.

238
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,860
That truck's coming up on us awful fast.

239
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,900
Holy crap! Do you see what I see?

240
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:17,490
- I'm afraid I do.
- We're being chased by ghosts!

241
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:21,030
You went through all this to see your girl?

242
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,780
I sure did, and I'm a fat idiot.
What's your excuse, you big chicken?

243
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,620
- Chicken? You take that back!
- Yeah? Make me!

244
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,830
I don't make monkeys, I train 'em.

245
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,580
- Oh! Holy crap! I'm sorry. Did that hurt?
- No. But this will!

246
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:39,580
Aah! Aah! You bastard!

247
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:45,550
- What the hell is going on out here?
- Actually, I, uh... I, uh...

248
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:48,340
Actually, he wanted to ask you something.

249
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,760
Wanna go somewhere and grab a coffee?

250
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,340
- Sure. I get off at two.
- Great! Great! I'll meet you here.

251
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:02,430
You did it! All right! Hey, who knows?
You might even, you know...

252
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,940
- I'm not following you.
- Intercourse.

253
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:13,690
- What are you doing here?
- Loretta's mom was hankering for a snack,

254
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,690
so we had to pick her up
some Kibbles 'n Bits.

255
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,190
- Cleveland!
- I mean Cheez-its.

256
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,690
- Did Peter give you a clue for me?
- Peter?

257
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,200
He's at Barrington
with Brian and Quagmire.

258
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,450
He's golfing? On our anniversary?!

259
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:32,740
Oh, boy. You just put Peter in the
doghouse, which is where your mother...

260
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,950
Don't say it!

261
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,750
Your mother smells.

262
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:46,000
See, this is why I hate clothes shopping.
I have no ass. I'm minus an ass.

263
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,000
You're trying too hard.
She won't care what you wear.

264
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:52,880
She's just gonna be glad to see you.
That's how it was with Lois.

265
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,300
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

266
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:10,480
- Hi, Mr Pewterschmidt.
- What are you doing here?

267
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:15,060
It's a long story - with terrific performances
and a wonderful scene in a carnival.

268
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,690
I'll cut to the ending. I want to marry Lois!

269
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,820
Out of the question! Now, listen, Griffin.

270
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,360
I want you to take this
and stay away from my daughter for ever.

271
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,780
- A million dollars?
- A million dollars.

272
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,990
No deal. Lois may be worth a million to you,
but to me, she's worthless.

273
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:36,740
- I love her, Mr Pewterschmidt.
- Oh, Peter!

274
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,540
Holy crap! Back then I gave up
a million bucks just to be with Lois.

275
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,580
Now I won't even miss a golf game
to spend our anniversary together.

276
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:50,630
- No wonder she's gonna dump me.
- Or is she?

277
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:55,090
Wait a minute. That's my revelation.
I gotta pay more attention to my wife!

278
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:58,630
Eureka. Now, come on back
to the golf course. I've got a date.

279
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:04,180
Death, wait, wait, wait. Before we go,
I need you to do me one more favour.

280
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,680
Peter. Peter Frampton.

281
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:14,180
Oh, no! God, please no!
I'm too young to die!

282
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,980
Sure you're not supposed
to get Keith Richards?

283
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:22,810
All right. If you want to live, come with me.
And bring your guitar.

284
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,520
And bring that thing you use to make it go
wah... wah-wah-wah-wah-wah.

285
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,150
Hey! Get out of the way!

286
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,110
Damn. How could he lie to me
on our anniversary?

287
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:04,510
- Oh, Peter. Our song.
- Happy anniversary, Lois.

288
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:10,550
This is the most romantic gift you've ever
given me. How did you put this together?

289
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:15,970
I had a little help...
from a very special friend.

290
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,930
- I like animals.
- Uh-huh.

291
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,850
Cos they're like people, little furry people.

292
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,520
Yeah... Hey, you ever go on the Internet?

293
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,650
They got some cool stuff
there on that Internet.

294
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:34,440
I bought these shoes from a company on
the Internet, cos they don't test on animals.

295
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,440
Wow.

296
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:41,820
You know, animals never have war.
War is an invention of mankind.

297
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:45,570
What the hell are you talking about?
Animals fight all the time!

298
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:51,200
Not with nuclear arms. You can't hug
your children with nuclear arms.

299
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,120
Check, please.
