"It seems today that all you see

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,230
"Is violence in movies and sex on TV

- Here you go, boys.
- Thanks, Horace.

11
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,720
So I told my boss I'm not staying in that
stupid toy factory. I'm gonna go places.

12
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,530
That's cool.

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,530
- Here you go, boys.
- Thanks, Horace.

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,330
So I told my boss I'm not staying in that
stupid toy factory. I'm gonna go places.

15
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,130
That's fly.

16
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,250
- Here you go, boys.
- Thanks, Horace.

17
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,850
So I told my boss I'm not staying in that
stupid toy factory. I'm gonna go places.

18
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,740
You are livin' la vida loca.

19
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:07,460
- I better head home.
- What do you mean, "home"? You live here.

20
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:14,260
Here's to The Drunken Clam, where they
don't ask for proof of age and neither do I.

21
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,340
Quagmire, you forgot to say "Oh".

22
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,860
Are you sure? I-I think I did.
All right, well, just to be safe... Oh!

23
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:26,060
We interrupt this programme for a bulletin
on the approach of Hurricane Norman.

24
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,070
Here with an update
is Greg the Weather Mime.

25
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,070
OK, it's gonna be cold. Very cold.

26
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,860
And there's gonna be wind.

27
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:39,070
And people's parents will throw faecal matter
down on them from the rooftops. How awful!

28
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,150
Oh. No. I'm sorry. That's rain.

29
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,670
Yes. It'll rain.

30
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:50,270
The number one cause of injury
during a hurricane is broken glass.

31
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,750
So stay away from the windows.
And, Peter, put those away.

32
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,070
Aw, come on, Lois. Just one more song.

33
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,480
Mom, I'm afraid if I fall asleep the hurricane's
gonna sneak up and give me a vasectomy.

34
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,680
Chris, nothing bad ever happens when you're
asleep. Sometimes good things can happen.

35
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,890
Oh, Jenny... Jenny...

36
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,690
Oh, yeah. Jenny, don't stop.

37
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:25,290
Oh, Richard Jeni, your HBO comedy specials
have brought pleasure to millions.

38
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,370
And what a sweet ass.

39
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,290
- This way, everyone.
- Bless you for helping us, Father.

40
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,970
It's God's wish, my dear.

41
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,370
All right.

42
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:42,970
Hurricane Norman is about to pound Quahog.
We go live to Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa

43
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,490
to see how locals are dealing
with the imminent disaster. Tricia?

44
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,100
Diane, I'm here in...

45
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,300
- Thank you, Tricia. Stay tuned for further...
- Aaargh!

46
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,780
- What a mess.
- Look at that!

47
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,500
Wow.

48
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,980
- Aaargh! Aaargh! For the love of God...
- Oh, my God! Daddy!

49
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,300
Aaargh! Oh, God! Oh, God!

50
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:16,590
Gotcha! See, kids? Disasters have their
lighter sides too. You just have to be creative.

51
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,500
Yeah, like my dead-rat marionette theatre.

52
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,910
"I'm so stressed. Life sure is a human race. "

53
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,990
That's brilliant.

54
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,190
Oh, my. Look at all the damage.

55
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,510
Thank God
the Open Air Debris Garden is still intact.

56
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,200
Peter, look. The Clam.

57
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,320
Aaagh!

58
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,600
- This is horrible.
- You think this is horrible?

59
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,600
Try losin' a testicle
in a knife fight with your mother.

60
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,120
- What about your bar?
- It's not mine any more.

61
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,200
I sold the place. Let someone else
worry about hurricanes.

62
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,920
- Who'd buy a wrecked bar?
- The bar's not wrecked.

63
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,800
Thank you, God.

64
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,120
Don't mention it.

65
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,800
Wait. Something's different.

66
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,530
Evening, gents.
How about a nice warm lager?

67
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,130
- Help yourself to a packet of crisps.
- Or a ruddy nice plum pudding.

68
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,130
Holy crap! It's a gay bar!

69
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,530
They turned The Drunken Clam
into a British pub?

70
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,020
Well, at least they still got sports on TV.

71
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:40,740
The new bowler has a cover point, long-on,
square leg, extra cover and two short legs.

72
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,940
What the hell is he talkin' about?

73
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,420
It's cricket. Marvellous game, really.

74
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:50,140
You see, the bowler hurls the ball towards the
batsman, who tries to play away to fine leg.

75
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,740
He scores by dashing between the creases,

76
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:56,350
provided the wicketkeeper
hasn't whipped his bails off.

77
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,150
- Anybody get that?
- The only British idiom I know

78
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,750
is that "fag" means "cigarette".

79
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:06,750
- Well, someone tell this cigarette to shut up.
- Guys, there's no girlie magazines in the can!

80
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,230
All they got is this David Copperfield.

81
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,150
Wait. Any pictures of his girlfriend?

82
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,150
No pictures at all!

83
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:19,040
- I think we should go.
- Yes. This is a dark and evil place.

84
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,030
I say, Carruthers,
you know what's very, very funny?

85
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,240
A man dressed in women's clothing.

86
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,750
- Yes, quite. Ripping good laugh.
- Yes.

87
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:36,760
Lois, The Drunken Clam's been taken over
by lousy limey tea-suckin' British bastards!

88
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,840
- Peter!
- Hello. Nigel Pinchley here.

89
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:46,560
I was introducing myself to your wife, who
I must say is a gorgeous bit of crumpet.

90
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,160
- Holy crap. You're one of them!
- Peter.

91
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,050
Nigel and his daughter
are our new neighbours.

92
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,760
I'm afraid I'm the limey bastard
who's purchased your bar.

93
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,560
- Bit of an awkward moment, really.
- Awkward moment?

94
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,770
I'll give you an awkward moment.
One time during sex, I called Lois "Frank".

95
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:07,370
- Your move, Sherlock.
- Peter! Excuse us.

96
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,850
Why are you acting like this?
Nigel's charming. All British men are.

97
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,650
That's what they said
about Benjamin Disraeli.

98
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,860
You don't even know who I am.

99
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,780
The British are a lovely people.
Not physically, of course, but inside.

100
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,380
And Nigel has a very sweet little daughter.

101
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,380
Aw! Look at the little baby!

102
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:35,180
- What the devil is that ghastly noise?
- It's me. Eliza Pinchley.

103
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,380
You wanna flower, little baby?

104
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,660
Excuse me, what I think
you mean to say is, would I like a flower?

105
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,870
You don't so much speak the language
as chew it and spit it out.

106
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,060
Go on. What's wrong with the way I talk?

107
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:53,190
Everything. Here's a shiny sixpence
if you keep your mouth shut and go away.

108
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,270
Oh...

109
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,390
I know The Drunken Clam was your bar,

110
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,880
but you and your friends can find
somewhere else to act like idiots.

111
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,790
I guess you're right.
You know why I married you, Lois?

112
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,400
It's not just the rack or the caboose.
It's that big sexy brain of yours.

113
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,880
- All right. This place isn't bad.
- Yeah. Good music, real sports on the tube.

114
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,600
I've never seen so many chicks in one place.

115
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,400
Hey, check out those two hotties. They're so
lonely, they're practisin' kissin' each other.

116
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,890
I don't think they're practisin'.

117
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,690
Oh.

118
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,680
Oh!

119
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,810
Ohhh.

120
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,610
So, you ladies ever been penetrated?

121
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,810
- Yep.
- Yep.

122
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,890
- Yup.
- Mm-hm.

123
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,610
Hope the loo is working.

124
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,500
Nice choice for a hang-out, Peter.
There's not even anywhere to sit down.

125
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,810
- Is that some kind of crack?
- Crack? You sayin' I got a fat ass?

126
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:09,300
Fellas, fellas. What's become of us?
We never squabbled before we lost The Clam.

127
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,420
- Right. It's those lousy fog-breathers.
- Damn British.

128
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:17,700
They took our bar, then our friendship. What's
next? Apple pie, fast cars and action films?

129
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:30,230
It vas a glorious summer
in Oxford ven I met Freddy Cavendish.

130
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,510
A most remarkable young man whose
friendship vould change my life forever.

131
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:38,630
You are the anchor
that gives my spirit licence to soar.

132
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,510
Our forefathers wouldn't
take it on the chin like this.

133
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:47,110
Right. I say we fight the British and drive 'em
back to whatever country they came from.

134
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,840
- Yeah! Yeah!
- We gonna get 'em.

135
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,240
Stewie, look. It's an invitation
to little Eliza's birthday party.

136
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,230
You mean that horrid girl
who talks like a scullery maid?

137
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,520
I didn't realise she'd been born. I assumed
she'd congealed in a gutter somewhere.

138
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,920
Ooh, I'm gonna RSVP right now.

139
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,930
Splendid. An entire afternoon of her "er"s
and "ah"s and "'alf a pound of ha'penny rice".

140
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,120
Why can't the English
teach their children how to speak?

141
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,050
You teach her. If you're up to it.

142
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:20,640
Oh, yes. This is the part where I'm
supposed to say "I am so up to it. Ha ha ha. "

143
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,930
Well, I am. I accept your challenge.

144
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,250
At her party I shall pass that guttersnipe off
as a lady. What are the stakes of this wager?

145
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,050
- Why don't you shut up for about a week?
- And if I win?

146
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:34,450
I wasn't betting. Why don't you
just shut up for about a week?

147
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,450
You're on!

148
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:41,530
Minutemen, present arms.

149
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,340
- Load weapons.
- Boom chaka-laka-laka boom chaka-laka.

150
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,450
Fire!

151
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,740
- Oh, I say!
- Throw the blackguards out.

152
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:53,060
- I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to leave.
- Don't tread on me.

153
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,740
Yeah, back off. We kicked your ass
in World War II and we can do it again.

154
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,460
Very well, then. If you refuse to go peaceably,

155
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,740
we'll have to use our superior
linguistic skills to convince you to leave.

156
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,060
Just try it.

157
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,460
- Bye.
- Sorry to bother you.

158
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,460
I never saw it that way before...
Wait a minute. How the hell did they do that?

159
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:16,270
We're not gonna let this stop us.
I've never been defeated. Except once.

160
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,670
- Eric?
- Peter?

161
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:38,760
Oh, my God. I haven't seen you since
high school. What are you doin' these days?

162
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,480
- I'm the red guy.
- Oh, my God.

163
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,480
- What about you?
- I'm the green guy.

164
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,880
- No kiddin'?
- Yeah.

165
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,160
- Hey, is that Stacy Beacham?
- Where?

166
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,880
Now, don't worry, these guys are trained
to stay perfectly still. Check it out.

167
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,890
Hey, Margaret Tha... What the hell...?
I thought you English guys never move.

168
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,280
No, that's just our women.

169
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:10,490
Bloody hell! My lunch was in that hat!
Egg and chips with jam butties.

170
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:16,290
- Welcome to the Quahog beer party.
- I do feel a little guilty about pollutin'.

171
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:20,570
- I felt Guilty once, but she woke up.
- Peter, what are you doin'?

172
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:24,770
It may taste like a warm cup of
tobacco-chewer's spit, but it's still beer.

173
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,700
Good point. Bottoms up!

174
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,170
Ha! Take that, you lousy Brits!

175
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:39,980
Peter! We waited up all night.
Where were you?

176
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,580
Wh-where was I? Where were you?

177
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,100
- Out drinkin'. But I was back by two.
- Oh, no.

178
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,300
Our top story: The Clam's Head Pub
has burned to the ground.

179
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,500
Our own Tricia Takanawa is on the scene.

180
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:57,990
Is Quahog in the grip of a serial arsonist?
Police say no, but our producer says yes.

181
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,910
Here's an artist's depiction
of what the arsonist might look like.

182
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:07,310
Anyone with information regarding this
suspect should contact police immediately.

183
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,190
One thing is certain: The pain here is palpable.

184
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,510
For many, this charred portrait of Elizabeth II

185
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:20,000
gives poignant new meaning to the phrase
"Hey, check out that flaming queen. "

186
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,800
In a late development
the police have a new suspect.

187
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:27,200
We now go live to Hispanic
reporter Maria J... Ji... Jim...

188
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,000
- Jimenez.
- I know what it is.

189
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,120
At this moment we're
approaching the suspect's house.

190
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,600
This is better than COPS. You know
there's a fat drunk guy in there.

191
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,920
- Hold it!
- Freeze!

192
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,400
- There he is.
- Griffin, you're comin' with us.

193
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,800
I wanna see what they do with this jackass.

194
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,320
- Hands up!
- Oh, Peter, you didn't!

195
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,200
- Hey, fatty's wife is a babe.
- That's it.

196
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:53,730
It appears the real arsonist is in custody,
thanks to an anonymous tip to the authorities.

197
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,810
Good. Good.

198
00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:00,330
Ah, the fat guy's struggling. Hit him,
you stupid pigs! Hit him. Use the billy...

199
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,730
This Minutemen flag was found
in the wreckage of The Clam's Head.

200
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,530
You are clearly guilty of arson,
so you are free to go.

201
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:16,220
Straight to jail. Ha!
Now you got burned! No bail.

202
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:21,340
- Peter, tell me you didn't do this.
- Lois, I didn't do it.

203
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,740
You can trust me, right?
Let's sit down and talk about this.

204
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,540
- I wanna believe you but... agh!
- Gotcha!

205
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,940
But seriously, you can trust me.

206
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:35,020
Oh, Lois, I'm so sorry
this terrible tragedy has befallen you.

207
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,420
Thank you, Nigel. You're very kind.

208
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,430
- Can I touch your bum once?
- What?

209
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,220
I expect to see you at Eliza's birthday bash.
I won't take no for an answer.

210
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:47,150
Unless the question is "Do you not like me?"

211
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,350
Get it? Double negative, you know.
Yes, very good.

212
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,630
Hey hey hey, check out the new meat.

213
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,830
- I like the fat one. More cushion for pushin'.
- Thank you.

214
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,960
- Hey, we gonna have a good time together.
- Gosh, everybody's so nice here.

215
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:08,240
I mean, they're gonna be disappointed
when they find out I'm not gay, but wow.

216
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:14,640
Oh, my God. See that guy? That's the most
vicious killer I ever put away, Steve Bellows.

217
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,560
- He's so mean, he shot a man for snoring.
- Where have I heard that before?

218
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,640
It's in this simulated-leather edition
of Time-Life's Killers of Quahog.

219
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:27,760
They're all here. John the Biter, the Berserk
Hobo, the Golden Autumn Day Strangler...

220
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,560
Maybe Steve won't remember you.

221
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:42,050
Well, well. Officer Swanson. You and
your friends are dead. You're all dead!

222
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,970
Oh, good.

223
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,770
He thinks we're zombies. He'll leave us alone.

224
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:51,850
No, no, no! If you're ever going to
be a lady, you must speak like one.

225
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,570
Now try it again. "The life
of the wife is ended by the knife. "

226
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,980
The loif of the woif...

227
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,450
No, no, no. Not "loif". Life! Life!

228
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,060
- That's what I said. Loif.
- Listen, you tin-eared piece of baggage.

229
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:09,250
We've got five days left, and I'll not
lose my wager. Now repeat after me.

230
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:13,180
"Hello, Mother,
have you hidden my hatchet?"

231
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,790
'Ello, Mother, 'ave you 'idden my 'atchet?

232
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:21,470
Oh, God, no. It's an H sound,
you moron. H! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

233
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,070
- Ew. Your breath smells like kitty litter.
- I was curious!

234
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:31,990
- Our husbands couldn't have done this.
- Cleveland can't even light the damn hibachi.

235
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,470
Excuse me. Where can I find Nigel Pinchley?

236
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:37,190
I'm from Quahog Insurance.
I have a cheque for him.

237
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:41,990
- Five million dollars?!
- He took out a policy just before the fire.

238
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,590
Doesn't that strike you as a little suspicious?

239
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,680
No, not really. In fact,
it seems to happen all the time.

240
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,800
- Oh, no. Here comes Steve!
- I haven't forgot about you boys.

241
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,880
Saturday night at midnight.
You're dead. All of you are dead.

242
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,800
Midnight on Saturday? Thank God!
We can still be in the talent show.

243
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,680
From the top, boys. A-five, six, seven, eight.

244
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,680
Once again, here is how it should sound.
"How do you do?" Here's how you sound.

245
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,610
Now try it again.

246
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,610
- How do you do?
- What did you say?

247
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:30,610
"The life of the wife is ended by the knife. "

248
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:34,210
I think she's got it. I think she's got it!

249
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,690
"The life of the wife is ended by the knife

250
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,490
By George, she's got it!
By George, she's got it!

251
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,700
Now, what ends her wretched life?

252
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:48,420
"The knife, the knife

253
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,820
And where's that bloody knife?

254
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:54,420
"In the wife, in the wife

255
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:59,100
" The life of the wife
is ended by the knife

256
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,620
Bravo, Eliza!

257
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:06,020
"The life of the wife is ended by the knife

258
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,230
Hello. So nice to see you.

259
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:18,630
There he is. We need to search the house for
evidence, but one of us has to distract Nigel.

260
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,230
Oh, no, no, no. I couldn't.

261
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:26,230
What about Loretta? Nigel looks
like he's down with the swirl.

262
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:32,510
There you are, Lois. Shall I give you the grand
tour and show you my... private quarters?

263
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,240
- I'd love to.
- I must say, you look absolutely...

264
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,910
mmm... mmm... mm-mm-mm.

265
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,230
Don't be shy, lambie lamb.

266
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:46,240
This is my study, where I... study
things that arouse my interest.

267
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,040
Oh, good. The girls are in place.

268
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,320
Oh, Nigel. Since Peter's been gone,
I've been searching for someone new.

269
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:59,330
You know? Someone with
a sense of danger and adventure.

270
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,850
- I once played cricket without shin guards.
- Oh, I love a reckless man.

271
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:09,330
One time I went up to this bloke's flat,
rang the bell and ran like Sebastian Coe.

272
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,730
More! Tell me more!

273
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,250
I burned down my pub for the insurance
money and framed your husband.

274
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:19,850
I knew it! And what's more,
I have witnesses. Bonnie.

275
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,650
Loretta?

276
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:26,060
Demond Wilson from Sanford
and Son? What are you doing here?

277
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,660
I know. I'm surprised I'm alive too.

278
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,940
Sorry, love. Better luck next time.

279
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,250
Mr Pinchley, I heard everything.

280
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:37,740
And what you've done is a textbook
example of insurance... fra-ud?

281
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,460
Bloody hell.

282
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,670
- Why the devil were you in the closet?
- I came with Demond.

283
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,870
Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Eliza Pinchley.

284
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:51,940
Psst. You. Dogbert. Down here.
Get a front-row seat for this one.

285
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,070
How kind of you all to come.

286
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,550
Magnificent!

287
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:09,550
Old sport, why don't you pull your face from
your loins and bury it into some humble pie?

288
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,150
Bloody 'ell!
I've gone and wet meself.

289
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:19,280
Don't give me that smug look. Fine!
You have extra-sensitive hearing: Hear this.

290
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,560
- I'm telling.
- I... No! I said "vacuum"!

291
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:33,080
- Hurry, Peter. Steve'll be here in five minutes.
- Oh, crap. We're dead.

292
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,480
This is the end, boys.

293
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,560
Looks like our next stop
is a corner booth in a bar in heaven.

294
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,690
Peter, Nigel confessed. You're free!

295
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:46,490
You hear that, guys? We're free!

296
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,370
Get ready to die! Oh.

297
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,770
I wonder what this feels like.

298
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:59,170
Ow! That hurts!

299
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:03,370
My God, is that what I've been
doin' to people? I belong here.

300
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:09,690
Horace, I never thought
I'd see you or The Clam again.

301
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,300
Florida stunk.

302
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:15,500
Alligator mounted me when I wasn't lookin'.
Laid eggs in my lower intestine.

303
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:18,780
But you're all thirsty.
I'll bore you another time.

304
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:23,580
Here's to our wives. They may not be
as hot as the women you see on TV.

305
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,100
Or as entertaining.

306
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,580
But, um...

307
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,500
I don't know where I'm goin'
with this. But thanks.

308
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:36,590
I guess that lousy Nigel learned his lesson.
Whatever he gets is too good for him.

309
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,990
Dear Stewie, I want you to know
that I blame my father's death

310
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:51,110
and my incarceration in this hellhole
entirely on your awful mother.

311
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:56,510
If it takes the rest of my life, I shall see that
she suffers a slow and painful death. Eliza.

312
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,920
Excellent. Here, have a look.

313
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,710
Good. Good.
