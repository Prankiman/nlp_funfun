2
00:00:33,606 --> 00:00:37,804
<i>We now return
to The Adventures of Aquaman.</i>

3
00:00:43,286 --> 00:00:46,084
- Yeah?
- Hey, can you grab me another beer?

4
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:50,717
Yeah. Anything else? Maybe a TV guide
and another pillow for your feet?

5
00:00:50,806 --> 00:00:53,843
No, actually, get me, like, a Dewar's and soda.

6
00:00:53,926 --> 00:00:57,282
And try to keep the saltwater out of it
if you could.

7
00:00:57,366 --> 00:00:59,516
Try... Try to keep the salt...

8
00:00:59,606 --> 00:01:04,521
- We're surrounded by saltwater. It's difficult.
- I know. I'm just saying... I'm just saying try.

9
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:07,359
- Want me to wipe your ass too?
- That's a helpful tone.

10
00:01:07,446 --> 00:01:10,518
I'm just saying.
You're abusing your powers a little bit.

11
00:01:10,606 --> 00:01:13,439
This is time that could be spent
getting me my beverage.

12
00:01:13,526 --> 00:01:16,996
What are you doing? We gotta get ready
for your grandpa's 80th birthday.

13
00:01:17,086 --> 00:01:19,646
- Calm down. He's just your father.
- But I love him.

14
00:01:19,726 --> 00:01:23,116
His folksy racism,
his "I don't care where I am" flatulence.

15
00:01:23,206 --> 00:01:26,562
And the way it seems like he's chewing
even when there's no food.

16
00:01:28,486 --> 00:01:31,956
- Hiya, Dad.
- Francis, it's so good to see you.

17
00:01:32,046 --> 00:01:35,834
Lois, you haven't changed a bit,
you lying bitch.

18
00:01:35,926 --> 00:01:40,522
Why don't you come into the dining room?
The table's all set for your birthday dinner.

19
00:01:40,606 --> 00:01:45,316
Lois, actually, Dad said he would prefer it
if you did notjoin us.

20
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:47,556
You know, you being a Protestant and all.

21
00:01:47,646 --> 00:01:51,434
- He said it's OK if you sit at the kids' table.
- I cooked the damn dinner.

22
00:01:51,526 --> 00:01:53,517
I knew you were gonna react like this.

23
00:01:53,606 --> 00:01:56,200
That's why I brought Bill Lumbergh
to explain it.

24
00:01:56,286 --> 00:02:00,837
Yeah, I'm gonna need you to go ahead
and not complain about this.

25
00:02:00,926 --> 00:02:06,444
And if you could go ahead
and sit at the kids' table, that'd be great.

26
00:02:08,046 --> 00:02:11,402
I'm just saying, '70s boobs were different.
I don't know.

27
00:02:11,486 --> 00:02:14,159
It won't kill you
to contribute to the conversation.

28
00:02:14,246 --> 00:02:18,444
Dad, tell us about World War I and how
America defeated Kaiser Permanente.

29
00:02:18,526 --> 00:02:21,165
Lois, when are you
gonna get that baby baptised?

30
00:02:21,246 --> 00:02:25,398
Oh, God. Not this again. Francis,
why the hell is this always an issue with you?

31
00:02:25,486 --> 00:02:29,923
Because I love this family
and I don't want my grandson to burn in hell.

32
00:02:30,006 --> 00:02:34,716
I love you, Grandpa. Your toenails
are the same colour as my school bus.

33
00:02:34,806 --> 00:02:38,719
You really think splashing magic water
on Stewie will keep him out of hell?

34
00:02:38,806 --> 00:02:41,798
Watch that talk
or you'll get your heathen head smacked!

35
00:02:41,886 --> 00:02:44,446
Very Christian.
"Believe what I say or I'll hurt you. "

36
00:02:44,526 --> 00:02:46,164
Now you're getting it!

37
00:02:48,446 --> 00:02:51,597
- Peter, we have a problem.
- Hang on, Lois. I'm watching a movie.

38
00:02:51,686 --> 00:02:54,598
<i>And now back to Jaws 5- Fire Island.</i>

39
00:02:54,686 --> 00:02:59,077
- You think we should be this far out?
- Stop worrying, Mark. We'll be fine.

40
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:03,762
Hey, I'm gonna eat y'all.
I'm gonna eat that hairy leg.

41
00:03:03,846 --> 00:03:08,283
I'm gonna eat that one too.
I can see right up them shorts.

42
00:03:08,366 --> 00:03:11,722
I got a whole bunch of rows of teeth
to chew you with.

43
00:03:13,686 --> 00:03:17,804
Now, wait a minute.
I did have a chubby kid on a raft earlier today.

44
00:03:17,886 --> 00:03:20,878
It's OK, though.
I've been swimming a lot lately.

45
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:22,479
Yummy.

46
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:25,638
Your father won't let up
about Stewie getting baptised.

47
00:03:25,726 --> 00:03:28,923
I am sick of him always trying to force
his religious views on us.

48
00:03:29,006 --> 00:03:33,875
I'll talk to him, Lois, but when my dad wants
something, it's like sex with Kobe Bryant.

49
00:03:33,966 --> 00:03:38,164
You can kick and scream all you want,
but it's gonna happen.

50
00:03:40,926 --> 00:03:45,442
- Dad, what are you doing?
- There's no cross! Every kitchen needs one.

51
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:49,599
Nothing says "eat up" like a bleeding
half-naked Jew nailed to a piece of wood.

52
00:03:49,686 --> 00:03:51,756
Listen, Dad, I gotta talk to you.

53
00:03:51,846 --> 00:03:54,314
Lois was wondering if maybe you could...

54
00:03:54,406 --> 00:04:00,003
I don't know, ease up on the whole
Jesus-ay Christ-ay, if you catch my drift?

55
00:04:00,086 --> 00:04:01,883
You're a lapsed Catholic, Peter.

56
00:04:01,966 --> 00:04:05,322
Your wife's a Protestant whore
and your baby isn't even baptised!

57
00:04:05,406 --> 00:04:09,081
All right, Dad. I don't want you to hate me,
so I'll make a deal with you.

58
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:12,203
If we get Stewie baptised,
you and all other old people

59
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:16,040
have to acknowledge and be aware
there's crap in the corners of your mouth.

60
00:04:16,126 --> 00:04:18,276
I'll think about it. Now let's go!

61
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:22,644
<i>Old people are gross, no matter how cute
they try to be on Desperate Housewives.</i>

62
00:04:22,726 --> 00:04:27,675
Go ahead, switch over to ABC
for five seconds. I'll wait five seconds.

63
00:04:30,366 --> 00:04:33,722
Oh, my God. Did you see?
Did you see how old and ugly they are?

64
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:38,084
Oh, my God, that redhead looks like
somebody poured Silly Putty over their knee.

65
00:04:40,486 --> 00:04:44,035
I'm sorry, Mr Griffin,
but I can't baptise little Stewie today.

66
00:04:44,126 --> 00:04:46,594
Our last shipment of holy water is tainted.

67
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,678
Tainted? Holy water? How did that happen?

68
00:04:57,806 --> 00:05:00,479
We'll call you when we get a new shipment in.

69
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:04,605
There's no such thing as tainted holy water.
Come on! We'll do it ourselves.

70
00:05:04,686 --> 00:05:09,362
Stewie Griffin, I baptise you in the name
of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.

71
00:05:09,446 --> 00:05:11,357
<i>- And Space Ghost.
- What are you doing?</i>

72
00:05:11,446 --> 00:05:14,882
Oh, my God. This is almost as bad
as my bath with Kathy Bates.

73
00:05:18,006 --> 00:05:20,201
Yeah, I think I'm going to get out.

74
00:05:24,206 --> 00:05:28,438
Stewie, you don't look so good.
Baby, you're burning up.

75
00:05:28,526 --> 00:05:31,518
Oh, my God. Stewie! Stewie! Speak to me.

76
00:05:31,606 --> 00:05:35,440
Don't... don't take me to a black doctor.

77
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:41,364
Mr and Mrs Griffin, I've examined your son
and he is suffering from toxic anaemia,

78
00:05:41,446 --> 00:05:43,482
which has weakened his immune system.

79
00:05:43,566 --> 00:05:46,638
- Is he gonna die?
- No, but he's vulnerable to infection.

80
00:05:46,726 --> 00:05:49,194
He must be
in a germ-free plastic environment.

81
00:05:49,286 --> 00:05:52,039
My God, you mean
like John Travolta in that movie?

82
00:05:52,126 --> 00:05:55,277
<i>Oh, no. You're gonna take his face off,
like in Face/Off?</i>

83
00:05:55,366 --> 00:05:57,721
It looks like the operation was a success.

84
00:05:57,806 --> 00:06:02,118
Do you know what the best part of this is?
Try licking yourself.

85
00:06:02,206 --> 00:06:03,559
You bastard.

86
00:06:03,646 --> 00:06:07,161
<i>He meant The Boy in the Plastic Bubble.
How could this have happened?</i>

87
00:06:07,246 --> 00:06:10,158
Stewie's been exposed to tainted holy water.

88
00:06:10,246 --> 00:06:13,079
Peter, you had Stewie baptised
behind my back?

89
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:17,603
This is no worse than when I rented out
your uterus to those inner-city immigrants.

90
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:25,678
Peter, you're a complete slave
to your father's religion.

91
00:06:25,766 --> 00:06:27,961
What about your religious beliefs?

92
00:06:28,046 --> 00:06:30,116
- You have a choice, you know.
- I do?

93
00:06:30,206 --> 00:06:33,994
Of course. You're a grown man.
You can pick any religion you want.

94
00:06:34,086 --> 00:06:37,362
Really? You know, Lois, maybe you're right.

95
00:06:37,446 --> 00:06:40,722
Maybe I should pick my own religion.
The question is, which one?

96
00:06:40,806 --> 00:06:43,639
I tell you what you can pick -
a tune on the piano.

97
00:06:47,446 --> 00:06:51,519
How the whiz-bang does the rest of it go?
Quick, make something up.

98
00:07:00,446 --> 00:07:03,040
What are all these women
doing in our living room?

99
00:07:03,126 --> 00:07:05,481
I took your advice and picked a new religion.

100
00:07:05,566 --> 00:07:08,399
- I'm gonna be a Mormon.
- A Mormon? Are you sure?

101
00:07:08,486 --> 00:07:11,398
Nailing a different wife every night?
It's a no-brainer.

102
00:07:11,486 --> 00:07:14,637
Lois, this is Kimmy,
the checkout girl from the Korean market.

103
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,682
Nancy, our postal carrier.

104
00:07:16,766 --> 00:07:20,281
And Tiffany, the woman
who stands downtown and screams at traffic.

105
00:07:20,366 --> 00:07:22,721
I ate a tube of Crest for dinner!

106
00:07:22,806 --> 00:07:26,560
Isn't she funny? She's definitely
the Kramer of my Mormon wives.

107
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:30,559
- Nancy, get me a beer.
- Mormons aren't allowed to drink alcohol.

108
00:07:34,606 --> 00:07:38,281
- Did you just throw those women away?
- No. Maybe.

109
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,555
Also in the news,
trouble at St Phillips Church.

110
00:07:44,646 --> 00:07:48,844
A shipment of tainted holy water
could put some local babies in jeopardy.

111
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,838
Sounds dangerous.
Be careful next time you're at confession

112
00:07:51,926 --> 00:07:54,645
talking about cheating on your wife
with that drag queen.

113
00:07:54,726 --> 00:07:57,524
At least you're in no danger,
since you only visit church

114
00:07:57,606 --> 00:08:00,678
to leave your self-delivered,
half-dead newborns on the step.

115
00:08:00,766 --> 00:08:04,554
Coming up, how to turn
your unwanted change into folding money.

116
00:08:04,646 --> 00:08:07,080
It's sad seeing Stewie in that plastic bubble.

117
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,236
I think he looks like a bunny.

118
00:08:09,326 --> 00:08:12,955
That's it. Keep laughing.
When I get out of here, you're going to get it!

119
00:08:13,046 --> 00:08:17,358
I'll lull you into a false sense of security
like those network television announcers.

120
00:08:17,446 --> 00:08:21,325
<i>Tonight on Mama's Family, Mama's got
more than she can handle with the in-laws.</i>

121
00:08:21,406 --> 00:08:26,355
<i>A deadly fire could spell death
for a honeymoon couple on all new Hotel.</i>

122
00:08:26,446 --> 00:08:30,200
<i>On Newhart, the stockings
are stuffed with comedy as Bob plays Santa.</i>

123
00:08:30,286 --> 00:08:34,199
<i>Then a sniper's bullet threatens
a partnership on all-new Cagney & Lacey.</i>

124
00:08:34,286 --> 00:08:36,959
<i>Tonight on Night Court,
love is in the air</i>

125
00:08:37,046 --> 00:08:39,480
when Judge Harry's
old school flame comes to town.

126
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:43,718
<i>Then a child's death could mean
the case of Arnie Becker's life on LA Law.</i>

127
00:08:43,806 --> 00:08:46,366
<i>- Night Court at eight.
- LA Law at nine.</i>

128
00:08:47,366 --> 00:08:51,120
Remember, don't touch Stewie.
He's not allowed to have any human contact.

129
00:08:53,646 --> 00:08:58,720
Finish the job, idiot! There's no ventilation!
It smells like Brian Dennehy in here!

130
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:02,799
I see London, I see France,
I see Stewie's unsightly chapped ass.

131
00:09:02,886 --> 00:09:05,639
Hey, gay bo, I'm up here. Up here.

132
00:09:07,646 --> 00:09:10,001
Hi. My name's Peter. I'm a Jehovah's Witness,

133
00:09:10,086 --> 00:09:12,680
here to spread the good news
of the story of Jesus.

134
00:09:12,766 --> 00:09:14,597
OK. Go ahead.

135
00:09:14,686 --> 00:09:17,598
Really? Wow! Boy!

136
00:09:17,686 --> 00:09:20,758
You're the first person
who didn't slam the door on me.

137
00:09:20,846 --> 00:09:27,160
OK, well, Jesus was
a miracle worker of sorts.

138
00:09:27,246 --> 00:09:31,603
He would travel from place to place
putting things right that once went wrong

139
00:09:31,686 --> 00:09:35,884
and hoping each time that his next leap
would be the leap home.

140
00:09:41,326 --> 00:09:44,443
- What are you doing with my wife?
- Oh, boy!

141
00:09:49,926 --> 00:09:53,805
The pathway to enlightenment
starts with an unfettered, focused mind.

142
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:56,002
- Look out!
- What are you doing?

143
00:09:56,086 --> 00:09:59,158
I thought that dot on your head
was from a sniper rifle.

144
00:09:59,246 --> 00:10:03,762
Peter, this spot is a sacred adornment.
It's a portal, an opening,

145
00:10:03,846 --> 00:10:10,160
through which all light, rejuvenation,
joy and ecstasy may enter the human form.

146
00:10:10,246 --> 00:10:11,565
- A vagina?
- Get out!

147
00:10:16,446 --> 00:10:19,006
<i>Hey, Stewie, three o'clock.
Time for The View.</i>

148
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:20,565
No, no! Not again!

149
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:34,404
Let me out of here!
I can't watch another second!

150
00:10:35,206 --> 00:10:39,119
Relax, Stewie. The doctor gave me this
so you can get some exercise.

151
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:43,324
Boy! Stewie's more wound up
than Dad was that time he took steroids.

152
00:10:43,406 --> 00:10:46,557
Peter, could you please pass the potatoes?

153
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,443
Dammit, Meg!

154
00:10:50,406 --> 00:10:53,443
<i>- And now back to Happy Days.
- That Fonzie is magic.</i>

155
00:10:53,526 --> 00:10:55,801
I love how he hits the jukebox
to make it work.

156
00:10:55,886 --> 00:10:58,195
- What is it, Mr C?
- Fonz, I...

157
00:10:58,286 --> 00:11:00,800
I wanted to pleasure Marion
for our anniversary.

158
00:11:00,886 --> 00:11:05,004
But, as you know, I have erectile dysfunction.

159
00:11:05,086 --> 00:11:07,646
- There we go.
- Thank you, Arthur.

160
00:11:07,726 --> 00:11:08,875
Hey!

161
00:11:09,966 --> 00:11:13,356
Brian, will you carry me upstairs?
I want to look at my toys.

162
00:11:13,446 --> 00:11:16,358
- No. I'm watching television.
- Come on! I'm sick!

163
00:11:16,446 --> 00:11:18,437
All right. Come here.

164
00:11:24,326 --> 00:11:27,796
Todd, I feel like we'll never
have a baby of our own.

165
00:11:27,886 --> 00:11:30,480
We will, Kelly.
You just have to visualise it.

166
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:34,639
Come on, close your eyes.
Picture a happy, healthy baby boy at play.

167
00:11:34,726 --> 00:11:38,275
Put him in a magic bubble
and release him to the universe.

168
00:11:39,606 --> 00:11:45,636
Honey, now I want you to visualise Lindsay
Lohan naked, doing a backwards crab walk.

169
00:11:45,726 --> 00:11:47,284
- What?
- Just do this for me!

170
00:11:49,046 --> 00:11:51,162
Peter, where have you been, lad?

171
00:11:51,246 --> 00:11:54,636
Dad, I was trying to find my own religion,
but it didn't work out.

172
00:11:54,726 --> 00:11:58,844
I haven't been this disappointed
since I lost my virginity.

173
00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:04,277
Wanna get some breakfast or something?

174
00:12:04,366 --> 00:12:08,325
You want to find religion,
all you got to do is look in your heart.

175
00:12:08,406 --> 00:12:11,842
Who's always been there for you
offering wisdom and truth?

176
00:12:11,926 --> 00:12:15,123
You've known him all along, son.
Now worship him!

177
00:12:15,206 --> 00:12:18,915
Oh, my God! Dad's right!
There is only one person!

178
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:21,679
And it's time for him
to be properly worshipped.

179
00:12:21,766 --> 00:12:26,886
I, Peter Griffin, hereby establish
the First United Church of the Fonz!

180
00:12:26,966 --> 00:12:30,675
Fonzie, if this be your will, give me a sign.

181
00:12:33,326 --> 00:12:36,398
Hi, I'm Lindsay Lohan.
This is how a crab walks.

182
00:12:36,486 --> 00:12:39,125
It sure is! Fonzie be praised!

183
00:12:43,886 --> 00:12:47,561
All right, Dad!
Two days ago this was an old barn.

184
00:12:47,646 --> 00:12:51,002
And now, thanks to you,
it's an old barn with a sign on it.

185
00:12:51,086 --> 00:12:54,396
All things are possible
through the Lord God Arthur Fonzarelli.

186
00:12:54,486 --> 00:12:57,159
- You're going through with this?
- Absolutely.

187
00:12:57,246 --> 00:12:59,362
You know this place only cost me 100 bucks?

188
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:02,358
That's a better deal
than that Aaron Neville megaphone.

189
00:13:02,446 --> 00:13:05,961
I want to thank you guys
for making me activity director for the day.

190
00:13:06,046 --> 00:13:09,834
OK, first of all, can everybody...

191
00:13:09,926 --> 00:13:12,565
What the hell?
What the hell's wrong with this thing?

192
00:13:12,646 --> 00:13:18,004
OK. We're about to start the sack race.

193
00:13:19,526 --> 00:13:22,882
Peter, it's not a good idea
to be putting these flyers all over town.

194
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:26,322
- People will think you're crazy.
- You like to lose a bunch of teeth?

195
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,795
I'm sorry.
That was more than what was called for.

196
00:13:28,886 --> 00:13:31,400
But it happens
when you challenge someone's faith.

197
00:13:31,486 --> 00:13:35,923
Peter, I know this is important to you.
But I don't want to see you humiliated.

198
00:13:36,006 --> 00:13:38,804
I don't think anyone's
gonna want to worship the Fonz.

199
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:41,081
- Is this the church of the Fonz?
- Yes, it is.

200
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,839
I read your flyer!
Finally a religion that makes sense!

201
00:13:43,926 --> 00:13:47,123
Hey, everyone! I found him. Over here!

202
00:13:49,046 --> 00:13:54,245
There you are.
You would not believe the morning I've had.

203
00:14:27,126 --> 00:14:30,323
What is this?
I thought you said we were going to church!

204
00:14:30,406 --> 00:14:36,003
This is church. A new church, created by
a man brave enough to follow his own vision.

205
00:14:37,606 --> 00:14:39,722
Please rise.

206
00:14:39,806 --> 00:14:41,398
Now sit on it.

207
00:14:41,486 --> 00:14:43,522
- The Fonz be with you.
- And also with you.

208
00:14:43,606 --> 00:14:46,916
- Let us "hey".
- Hey.

209
00:14:47,006 --> 00:14:49,042
I can't believe people are buying this.

210
00:14:49,126 --> 00:14:54,280
Fonzie's cool, Brian. Deep down, I think
we all secretly yearn to be Italian and stupid.

211
00:14:54,366 --> 00:14:57,324
A reading from the letters of Potsie
to the Tuscaderos.

212
00:14:57,406 --> 00:15:02,400
"Yea, and did Fonzie downstairs cometh
from his apartment above the garage

213
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:07,082
and sayeth he, 'Reassembleth will I
the pieces of my motorcycle

214
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,919
though I suffereth
from temporary blindness. "'

215
00:15:10,006 --> 00:15:16,639
"'And, yea, for I am holy, befriendeth I will
Sticks Downy, the only Negro in Wisconsin. "'

216
00:15:16,726 --> 00:15:18,239
- Amen.
- Amen.

217
00:15:22,766 --> 00:15:24,961
- What's that smell?
- Black spray paint.

218
00:15:25,046 --> 00:15:29,039
- What were you painting?
- You think you're so funny.

219
00:15:29,126 --> 00:15:32,084
Well, as soon as I figure out where I am,
you're dead, Brian!

220
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:37,286
Dammit. I haven't been this dizzy since I did
those helium whippets at that birthday party.

221
00:15:37,366 --> 00:15:39,675
OK, OK, ready? Here goes.

222
00:15:39,766 --> 00:15:42,075
I am a female. I have a high voice.

223
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:45,920
I have reproductive organs inside of me
and I buy groceries.

224
00:15:46,006 --> 00:15:49,123
Peter, your religion is an abomination!

225
00:15:49,206 --> 00:15:53,882
I never thought you could ever embarrass me
more than you did at Cousin Mary's wedding.

226
00:15:53,966 --> 00:16:00,201
If anyone knows of any reason why these two
should not be married, let him speak now.

227
00:16:00,286 --> 00:16:03,676
Really? Nobody's gonna speak up?

228
00:16:03,766 --> 00:16:06,724
I'm the one who's gonna have to say it?

229
00:16:06,806 --> 00:16:08,285
All right.

230
00:16:08,366 --> 00:16:10,163
Genital warts!

231
00:16:10,246 --> 00:16:13,682
But you said I should look into my heart
to find my religion.

232
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:17,281
Yes! Real religion!
What I saw today wasn't religion.

233
00:16:17,366 --> 00:16:21,439
It was just a bunch of sheep singing songs
and listening to ridiculous tall tales!

234
00:16:21,526 --> 00:16:23,835
- Actually, that is religion.
- Shut your trap!

235
00:16:23,926 --> 00:16:26,235
- Ha! You tell him!
- Why? I agree with you.

236
00:16:26,326 --> 00:16:30,239
Peter's found another way to exploit
people's ignorance and that's wrong.

237
00:16:30,326 --> 00:16:33,921
You think I'm wr...?

238
00:16:34,006 --> 00:16:36,361
See, Brian? That's a word the Fonz can't say.

239
00:16:36,446 --> 00:16:40,405
Because all is right when you welcome
Fonzie into your life. Fonzie be with you.

240
00:16:40,486 --> 00:16:43,523
I ought to take off my belt
and slap the crap out of him!

241
00:16:43,606 --> 00:16:46,074
Look, I don't like you and you don't like me.

242
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,839
I suggest we set aside our differences
and work together.

243
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:53,204
- I have an idea to snap Peter out of this.
- Work together? You and me?

244
00:16:53,286 --> 00:16:56,722
Sure. Sometimes opposites
work well together. Peter taught me that.

245
00:17:14,926 --> 00:17:19,158
Reverend, I gotta talk to you. Last night
I had sex with a teenage blonde and her mom.

246
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:24,445
That's quite a story, but there's no confession
so there's really no reason for you to tell me.

247
00:17:24,526 --> 00:17:27,882
Are you kidding? I'm telling everybody!

248
00:17:29,726 --> 00:17:34,516
Let us pause to reflect on the sacred mystery
of Richie's elder brother Chuck,

249
00:17:34,606 --> 00:17:39,919
who ascended the stairs with his basketball
in season one and never came down again.

250
00:17:40,006 --> 00:17:44,443
There's one problem. When a religion gets
too powerful, it's bound to have imitators.

251
00:17:44,526 --> 00:17:47,518
- What are you talking about?
- Hi. I'm Sherman Hemsley.

252
00:17:47,606 --> 00:17:52,316
I've just established the Church of George
Jefferson. Who wants to move on up?

253
00:17:54,886 --> 00:17:58,401
Hi, I'm Gavin MacLeod and I established
the Church of Captain Stubing.

254
00:17:58,486 --> 00:18:01,000
Who wants to come on board?

255
00:18:02,566 --> 00:18:03,999
Hi, I'm Kirk Cameron!

256
00:18:04,086 --> 00:18:06,919
You here to convert people
to the Church of Mike Seaver?

257
00:18:07,006 --> 00:18:10,316
No. I'm here to convert people to Christianity.

258
00:18:11,366 --> 00:18:13,482
<i>Well, he was on Growing Pains.</i>

259
00:18:13,566 --> 00:18:15,682
I can't believe it. Everybody's gone!

260
00:18:15,766 --> 00:18:19,076
People are always looking for the next voice
to tell them what to do.

261
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,680
And here I was thinking
I was making a difference.

262
00:18:21,766 --> 00:18:24,041
I thought I was connecting with people.

263
00:18:24,126 --> 00:18:27,755
Could there be anyone stupider than me?

264
00:18:27,846 --> 00:18:30,360
- Madonna?
- Yeah. She's pretty stupid.

265
00:18:30,446 --> 00:18:33,438
- That's something we can agree on.
- Absolutely. Francis?

266
00:18:33,526 --> 00:18:35,596
Oh, major idiot. Major idiot.

267
00:18:35,686 --> 00:18:39,201
Yeah. Gosh! I guess we do have
some common ground here after all, huh?

268
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:43,962
Yeah. And "La Isla Bonita" - not a real place.
I looked it up, bought a globe, couldn't find it.

269
00:18:44,046 --> 00:18:46,162
- That makes her a liar too.
- She's awful!

270
00:18:46,246 --> 00:18:48,123
- Awful, awful woman.
- I agree, yeah.

271
00:18:48,206 --> 00:18:50,117
- And she's a whore.
- Yeah, big time.

272
00:18:50,206 --> 00:18:52,197
Oh, everybody. Canseco? Eww.

273
00:18:52,286 --> 00:18:54,436
- Dennis Rodman.
- Dennis Rodman. Yeah.

274
00:18:54,526 --> 00:18:57,484
- Rodman? My God!
- I think he lost all his money, didn't he?

275
00:18:57,566 --> 00:19:00,080
Rodman? Are you sure
you're not thinking MC Hammer?

276
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:04,921
<i>No, no... Well, him too. I read somewhere.
I think it was in, like, Stuff or so...</i>

277
00:19:05,006 --> 00:19:08,362
<i>No, you know what it was?
It was on Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel.</i>

278
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:10,676
And they said
that he's in the poorhouse now.

279
00:19:10,766 --> 00:19:14,441
- You think she'd do him now?
- Would Madonna do Rodman now?

280
00:19:14,526 --> 00:19:17,438
Yeah. Cos it's not the money,
it's about pissing off Daddy.

281
00:19:17,526 --> 00:19:19,756
- She's got a lot of problems.
- Lot of problems.

282
00:19:19,846 --> 00:19:23,361
Yeah, we are smarter.
We are smarter than Madonna.

283
00:19:23,446 --> 00:19:25,801
No question.

284
00:19:25,886 --> 00:19:28,195
Well, I should probably
get out of these robes.

285
00:19:32,566 --> 00:19:36,354
- Look at you. You're all better.
- That's right, Brian. And you are toast!

I'm gonna get in the gym, get my lats back,

287
00:19:38,606 --> 00:19:42,155
and then me and my friends from Cobra Kai
are gonna take you down, man!

288
00:19:42,246 --> 00:19:45,124
Listen. Sorry I had to
rain on your parade, Peter.

289
00:19:45,206 --> 00:19:49,518
It's all right, Brian. I guess
the Church of the Fonz was just a bad idea.

290
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:54,043
Not really, Peter. You were preaching
honesty, friendship, courage.

291
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:59,678
If you managed to inspire even one person
to embrace those values, you were a success.

292
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:03,805
Thanks, Lois.
But I doubt there's any chance of that.
