Yeah, it's me and Lois'

Well, I want to masturbate,
but I'm just so darn cold.

Too bad there's no answer

But first, the public library
suffered damage this evening

145
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,889
when an area fat man

146
00:05:44,925 --> 00:05:46,224
smashed through
the front of the building

while attempting
a drunken stunt.

148
00:05:47,828 --> 00:05:50,495
The bus station is expected
to absorb the overflow

armpit-washing ladies.

150

Oh, God.

00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:56,568
Peter, is there something
you want to tell me?

152
00:05:56,603 --> 00:05:58,970
Uh, yeah, every light
in the house is on.

153
00:05:59,005 --> 00:06:00,672
Did you destroy
the library?

154
00:06:00,707 --> 00:06:02,707
Did I destroy the library?

155
00:06:02,743 --> 00:06:03,875
Ha, no, Lois.

156
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,009
That was television.

157
00:06:05,045 --> 00:06:06,644
In light of events
at the library,

158
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,480

160
00:06:09,816 --> 00:06:11,049
Good evening, Quahog.

161
00:06:11,084 --> 00:06:13,318
I'm here tonight
with the deputy mayor.

162
00:06:13,353 --> 00:06:14,686
Hi, everybody!

163
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:16,588
Shut. Up.

164
00:06:16,623 --> 00:06:19,991
Anyway, these types
of immature, drunken high jinks

165
00:06:20,026 --> 00:06:21,993
are destroying our town.

166
00:06:22,028 --> 00:06:23,328
And if we can't trust

167
00:06:23,363 --> 00:06:26,364
a 42-year-old man
to drink responsibly,

168
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,967
then I have no choice
but to take action.

169
00:06:29,002 --> 00:06:30,602
So, as mayor of Quahog,

170
00:06:30,637 --> 00:06:34,172
I hereby raise the town's
legal drinking age to 50.

171
00:06:34,207 --> 00:06:35,173
What?

172
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,474
I can't drink anymore?

173
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,809
What am I gonna do?

174
00:06:37,844 --> 00:06:39,644
What do people do
who don't drink?

175
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:41,312
I don't know.
Knit?

176
00:06:41,348 --> 00:06:42,614
Knit? Knit?!

177
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:43,715
Are you kidding me?!

178
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,716
Maybe.

179
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:46,451
Um, okay, so it turns out

180
00:06:46,486 --> 00:06:48,086
I am, like,
crazy good at knitting.

181
00:06:53,158 --> 00:06:54,691
Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker.

182
00:06:54,726 --> 00:06:57,861
It's day three of Quahog's
new ban on alcohol

183
00:06:57,896 --> 00:06:59,195
for anybody under 50.

184
00:06:59,231 --> 00:07:00,497
And if there's one thing

185
00:07:00,532 --> 00:07:01,965
the new drinking
age law has done,

186
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,768
it's let us know that women
tell terrible stories.

187
00:07:04,803 --> 00:07:06,469
Good to see your
eyes open, Tom.

188
00:07:06,505 --> 00:07:08,705
For more on this story,
we now go to Tricia Takanawa.

189
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,706
Tricia?

190
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:11,574
Joyce, I'm standing here

191
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,143
on the streets of Quahog,

192
00:07:13,178 --> 00:07:15,111
where citizens are
feeling the effects

193
00:07:15,147 --> 00:07:16,880
of the city's new drinking law.

194
00:07:16,915 --> 00:07:19,382
I was going to bone
my girlfriend,

195
00:07:19,418 --> 00:07:21,051
but she told me that if

196
00:07:21,086 --> 00:07:23,286
there wasn't
vanilla vodka involved,

197
00:07:23,322 --> 00:07:25,488
there was no way.

198
00:07:25,524 --> 00:07:28,558
I think we just have to trust
our elected officials...

199
00:07:28,593 --> 00:07:31,328
and Goldman's Pharmacy
is fully stocked on cough syrup,

200
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:33,396
which goes great
with ginger ale.

201
00:07:33,432 --> 00:07:35,231
Well, I do miss drinking,

202
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:37,734
but I have used the time
to reconnect with my children

203
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:41,037
and I'm actually thinking about
resuming my actuarial practice.

204
00:07:41,073 --> 00:07:43,807
Oh, my God, he's just
been drunk this whole time?

205
00:07:43,842 --> 00:07:45,208
This new law sucks.

206
00:07:45,243 --> 00:07:47,177
And I got to say,
it was kind of uncool

207
00:07:47,212 --> 00:07:49,145
of Mayor West to call it
"Peter's Law."

208
00:07:49,181 --> 00:07:50,313
No kidding.

209
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:52,449
Now I know how Megan
from "Megan's Law" felt.

210
00:07:52,484 --> 00:07:55,518
I... I don't... I don't think
you know how she felt.

211
00:07:58,957 --> 00:08:01,124
I don't know why I didn't
think of this before, guys.

212
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:02,459
We'll just go
into the brewery

213
00:08:02,494 --> 00:08:04,060
after hours and
take some beer.

214
00:08:04,096 --> 00:08:06,129
Hey, buddy.
It's okay, I work here.

215
00:08:06,164 --> 00:08:08,665
Aren't you the guy who
cried in that meeting?

216
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,400
Oh, you know...
you know, I just remembered,

217
00:08:10,435 --> 00:08:13,236
there's no beer here, l-let's-
let's just, let's just go.

218
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,108
Peter, why'd you want me
to get us into this prison?

219
00:08:18,143 --> 00:08:20,643
Because, Joe, everyone
knows that all prisoners

220
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:22,779
make bootleg wine
in their toilet.

221
00:08:22,814 --> 00:08:24,647
We are gonna
get so wasted!

222
00:08:24,683 --> 00:08:25,915
Oh! Look, right here.

223
00:08:25,951 --> 00:08:27,183
This one's full of Chardonnay.

224
00:08:28,387 --> 00:08:29,352
Peter, I don't think that's...

225
00:08:29,388 --> 00:08:31,087
PETER:
<i>But it was Chardonnay.</i>

226
00:08:31,123 --> 00:08:33,823
<i>The best Chardonnay</i>
<i>I'd ever had in my life.</i>

227
00:08:33,859 --> 00:08:36,893
<i>The man who made it,</i>
<i>Curtis "Murder Dog" Williams,</i>

228
00:08:36,928 --> 00:08:38,294
<i>went on to become</i>

229
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,163
<i>one of America's</i>
<i>most celebrated vintners.</i>

230
00:08:40,198 --> 00:08:41,464
JOE:
<i>Hey, Joe here.</i>

231
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,465
<i>Peter's lying.</i>

232
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:44,067
<i>He drank pee-pee.</i>

233
00:08:46,905 --> 00:08:48,004
Don't worry, guys.

234
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,472
If we can't buy
alcohol in Quahog,

235
00:08:49,508 --> 00:08:51,141
we'll just go
to the next town over.

236
00:08:52,978 --> 00:08:54,911
Sorry, in this town,
you can only buy alcohol

237
00:08:54,946 --> 00:08:56,813
if you're dressed
head-to-toe in jeans.

238
00:08:56,848 --> 00:08:58,214
What? Who made that law?

239
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,716
Our mayor, Jay Leno.

240
00:08:59,751 --> 00:09:01,117
Have you seen
some of these laws

241
00:09:01,153 --> 00:09:02,252
they've got now
about denim?

242
00:09:02,287 --> 00:09:03,620
You know, I say,

243
00:09:03,655 --> 00:09:05,922
if you don't like it,
you may as well Levi's.

244
00:09:05,957 --> 00:09:07,757
Who's voting
for these mayors?

245
00:09:07,793 --> 00:09:10,593
Rhode Island's a mess
from top to bottom.

246
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:15,765
I tell you, guys,

247
00:09:15,801 --> 00:09:17,167
getting alcohol
when you're underage

248
00:09:17,202 --> 00:09:19,269
isn't as easy as Obama's
daughters make it look.

249
00:09:19,304 --> 00:09:20,804
What? Is that true?

250
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:21,871
I don't know.

251
00:09:21,907 --> 00:09:23,907
Hey, isn't that
your dog at the bar?

252
00:09:23,942 --> 00:09:25,942
Hey, Jerome, one more, neat.

253
00:09:27,612 --> 00:09:28,678
What the hell?

254
00:09:28,713 --> 00:09:30,613
Why's Jerome serving
booze to Brian?

255
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:32,048
I don't know,
but I'm gonna find out.

256
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,049
(whistles)

257
00:09:33,084 --> 00:09:34,250
Come here, boy!
Come on!

258
00:09:34,286 --> 00:09:36,152
Hey, what's up?
We going for a ride in the car?!

259
00:09:36,188 --> 00:09:37,887
No, no, I had
a question for you.

260
00:09:37,923 --> 00:09:39,789
Don't ever (bleep) do that

261
00:09:39,825 --> 00:09:41,458
unless you have
a car ride to offer.

262
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:42,959
Hey, how come you're
allowed to drink?

263
00:09:42,994 --> 00:09:44,093
Yeah, you're not 50.

264
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:45,295
Uh, actually, I am.

265
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,130
I'm 56 in dog years.

266
00:09:47,165 --> 00:09:49,632
Oh, is that why you got
white pubic hair?

267
00:09:49,668 --> 00:09:51,968
I'll thank you not
to check out my pubic hair.

268
00:09:52,003 --> 00:09:53,670
Well, then don't go
flashing it around.

269
00:09:53,705 --> 00:09:55,939
Put on some underpants,
you crazy old man.

270
00:09:55,974 --> 00:09:58,007
Peter, I think
you're missing the point.

271
00:09:58,043 --> 00:09:59,843
Brian can buy us booze.

272
00:09:59,878 --> 00:10:01,478
Oh, my God,
you're right!

273
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:03,079
W-Would you do that
for us, Brian?

274
00:10:03,114 --> 00:10:04,080
Sure, why not?

275
00:10:04,115 --> 00:10:05,215
Aw, thank God.

276
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,749
'Cause just sitting here
all sober

277
00:10:06,785 --> 00:10:08,818
is more boring
than watching a pot boil.

278
00:10:08,854 --> 00:10:09,986
Hey, you.

279
00:10:10,021 --> 00:10:10,987
What are you doing?

280
00:10:11,022 --> 00:10:12,022
I like to watch.

281
00:10:12,057 --> 00:10:13,623
I want to watch you boil.

282
00:10:13,658 --> 00:10:15,058
I can't do it
with you watching.

283
00:10:15,093 --> 00:10:16,893
Oh, not even if I do this?

284
00:10:16,928 --> 00:10:17,894
Don't do that...

285
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:19,362
Oh, God, that's so hot.

286
00:10:19,397 --> 00:10:20,630
Oh, yeah?

287
00:10:20,665 --> 00:10:22,232
Then why don't
I take your top off?

288
00:10:22,267 --> 00:10:23,267
Oh! Oh...

289
00:10:23,301 --> 00:10:24,501
I'm boiling!
I'm boiling!

290
00:10:24,536 --> 00:10:25,702
Yeah.

291
00:10:25,737 --> 00:10:28,037
Now I'm gonna stick
my raw pasta in you.

292
00:10:28,073 --> 00:10:29,506
LOIS: Peter, what's
going on in there?

293
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,074

How would you
like to build,

313
00:11:12,937 --> 00:11:16,072
build a deck right
now with your buddy?

314
00:11:16,107 --> 00:11:18,174
'Cause we got hammers...

315
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:19,442
the whole deal.

316
00:11:19,477 --> 00:11:20,910
I don't know, man.
It's pretty dark out.

317
00:11:20,945 --> 00:11:22,178
That's okay.

318
00:11:22,213 --> 00:11:23,613
I'll just pull
my car around

319
00:11:23,648 --> 00:11:25,481
and point the
headlights at it.

320
00:11:25,517 --> 00:11:29,118
Did you know that my dad
once called me a mistake?

321
00:11:29,154 --> 00:11:30,720
That's messed up, man.

322
00:11:30,755 --> 00:11:32,021
Wow.

323
00:11:32,057 --> 00:11:33,990
You know, Brian,
hanging out with you

324
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:36,225
this past week has been awesome.

325
00:11:36,261 --> 00:11:38,394
Yeah, why don't we,
why don't we do this anymore?

326
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,297
We-we-we used to do fun stuff
all the time, you know?

327
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,232
It used to be you and me.

328
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:45,668
And it always
will be, pal.

329
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:46,936
Hey, listen, listen.

330
00:11:46,971 --> 00:11:49,539
I want you to be
Meg's godfather.

331
00:11:49,574 --> 00:11:51,074
No, thanks, Peter.

332
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:53,776
But this here,
we got to keep this going.

333
00:11:53,812 --> 00:11:55,578
I agree, buddy, I agree.

334
00:11:55,613 --> 00:11:58,781
All right, I'm gonna go barf
down the garbage disposal.

335
00:12:00,118 --> 00:12:01,518
Brian, I think
we can get John Mayer

336
00:12:01,553 --> 00:12:03,486
to stop tweeting again,
but we all got to work together.

337
00:12:03,521 --> 00:12:05,555
Oh, my God!
Are you drunk again?

338
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,324
Yeah, I was, I was just hanging
out with my main man, Peter.

339
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,926
"Main man"?

340
00:12:09,961 --> 00:12:11,227
"Hanging out"?

341
00:12:11,262 --> 00:12:13,496
Brian, he's only using
you to buy alcohol!

342
00:12:13,531 --> 00:12:14,797
What?
What are, wha...?

343
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,165
What are you,
what are you talking about?

344
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:18,134
It hasn't dawned on you
that he only started

345
00:12:18,169 --> 00:12:20,370
spending time with you when
the drinking age was raised?

346
00:12:20,405 --> 00:12:22,338
Come on, that's,
that's not true.

347
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:23,773
(Peter retching)

348
00:12:23,808 --> 00:12:26,876
PETER: Aw, shoot, I puked
in the clean dishes side.

349
00:12:26,911 --> 00:12:29,078
Trust me, as soon as you're
no longer of use to him,

350
00:12:29,114 --> 00:12:30,246
he'll be done with you.

351
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:31,781
Oh, I get it, I get it.

352
00:12:31,816 --> 00:12:33,216
Okay, you're, you're jealous

353
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:35,218
'cause I'm spending
all my time with Peter.

354
00:12:35,253 --> 00:12:36,753
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, right.

355
00:12:36,788 --> 00:12:39,522
Yeah, where's my dumb,
morbidly obese friend?

356
00:12:39,557 --> 00:12:40,957
CHRIS: Hey, Stewie,
get in here!

357
00:12:40,992 --> 00:12:43,459
I'm being an '80s
computer hacker!

358
00:12:43,495 --> 00:12:46,429
Come on, baby, show
me what you got.

359
00:12:46,464 --> 00:12:48,731
And we... are in!

360
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,066
All right, I'd better go.

361
00:12:50,101 --> 00:12:53,035
I got to go tell him
"This isn't a game, man."

362
00:12:53,071 --> 00:12:54,937
Brian, do you have
any idea why Peter

363
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:56,406
was trying to climb
in the dishwasher?

364
00:12:56,441 --> 00:12:58,775
I thought it was
a Tokyo apartment.

365
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,576
Sorry, Lois,
we, uh, we got--

366
00:13:00,612 --> 00:13:02,145
I guess we had
a little too much to drink.

367
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,413
"To drink"?!

368
00:13:03,448 --> 00:13:05,148
It's against the law
for him to do that!

369
00:13:05,183 --> 00:13:06,682
Was Stewie in here?

370
00:13:06,718 --> 00:13:09,585
Was, was he in here?
I... I smell his cologne.

371
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:10,720
Listen to me, Brian.

372
00:13:10,755 --> 00:13:12,288
No more booze in this house.

373
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:14,424
You're gonna get us
all in trouble.

374
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:16,225
Peter, we--
maybe we should find

375
00:13:16,261 --> 00:13:17,927
some place else to get--
to drink.

376
00:13:17,962 --> 00:13:20,263
Yeah, I think you're right.

377
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:23,566
Hi, we're here
from the '80s FBI.

378
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:25,668
Somebody here
with a 2,400-baud modem

379
00:13:25,703 --> 00:13:27,303
almost started
World War III.

380
00:13:27,338 --> 00:13:28,638
(Glenn Frey's "The Heat Is On"
starts playing)

381
00:13:28,673 --> 00:13:30,940
Oop, sounds like
they're making an escape.

382
00:13:35,046 --> 00:13:36,879
Hey, you want to see me
run up that slide?

383
00:13:36,915 --> 00:13:39,115
Sure.

384
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,817
(grunts)

385
00:13:40,852 --> 00:13:42,084
Ow, damn it!

386
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,587
I think my belt buckle
cut my gut!

387
00:13:44,622 --> 00:13:46,856
Hey, Peter,
can I ask you something?

388
00:13:46,891 --> 00:13:48,925
You're not just hanging out
with me because I,

389
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,027
I can buy you alcohol, right?

390
00:13:51,062 --> 00:13:53,329
What?! Course not.
We're friends.

391
00:13:53,364 --> 00:13:55,531
Yeah, no, I-I know. That's,
that's, that's what I thought.

392
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:57,200
And also you bring
me dead birds.

393
00:13:57,235 --> 00:13:58,734
I know Lois gets
mad about it,

394
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,870
but I like using them
to point at things.

395
00:14:00,905 --> 00:14:02,438
Hey, did they
move the bagels?

396
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:03,940
Yeah, they're right there.
Oh, my God!

397
00:14:03,975 --> 00:14:05,308
What the hell is that?!

398
00:14:05,343 --> 00:14:07,944
This?
This is a pointing bird.

399
00:14:07,979 --> 00:14:09,545
All right, I just saw
a sprinkler come on,

400
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:11,581
so I'm gonna go bite
at the water a little bit.

401
00:14:13,051 --> 00:14:15,117
Hey, what's
going on here?

402
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:17,887
Uh, some butthorn's
shining a flashlight on me.

403
00:14:17,922 --> 00:14:20,022
I meant prior to me coming
up and investigating this.

404
00:14:20,058 --> 00:14:21,624
Oh, well, you got
to be clearer, man.

405
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:22,859
I'm wasted.

406
00:14:22,894 --> 00:14:24,193
Sir, I'm gonna
need to see some I.D.

407
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:25,795
You look underage.

408
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:26,963
Just as I suspected.

409
00:14:26,998 --> 00:14:28,030
You're a minor.

410
00:14:28,066 --> 00:14:29,298
It ain't my fault!

411
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:31,200
Somebody's been buying it
for me and all my friends!

412
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:32,301
Oh, is that right?

413
00:14:32,337 --> 00:14:33,536
Well, you better
tell me who that is

414
00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:34,804
or you're in a
lot of trouble.

415
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:36,339
Hey, is this the park
where Boner died?

416
00:14:36,374 --> 00:14:37,773
Wait, wha-what's going on?

417
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:39,008
That's him, Officer!

418
00:14:39,043 --> 00:14:40,543
That's who's been
buying us the booze!

419
00:14:40,578 --> 00:14:41,477
What?!

420
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:42,845
You get home, son.

421
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:44,280
You're lucky I'm letting
you off with a warning.

422
00:14:44,315 --> 00:14:45,781
But you, you're coming with me.

423
00:14:45,817 --> 00:14:46,849
You got to be kidding!

424
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:48,217
Do you need a ride?

425
00:14:48,253 --> 00:14:50,052
Nah, I'm just gonna stay
here until the sun comes up

426
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:52,421
and then be the
best at tetherball.

427
00:14:52,457 --> 00:14:54,090
(grunting)

428
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,324
Next!

429
00:15:01,046 --> 00:15:02,545
What are you in for?

430
00:15:02,581 --> 00:15:05,181
I bought some alcohol for
someone I thought was my friend.

431
00:15:05,217 --> 00:15:06,549
How about you?

432
00:15:06,585 --> 00:15:09,219
I threw a bottle of rum through
the window of the Apple Store.

433
00:15:09,254 --> 00:15:11,454
I couldn't remember
me password.

434
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,156
(sighs)
Well, this sucks.

435
00:15:13,191 --> 00:15:14,424
Oh, it's not so bad.

436
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:16,326
Sometimes they let you
take the good trash home

437
00:15:16,361 --> 00:15:17,560
if you ask nice.

438
00:15:17,596 --> 00:15:19,596
Last week, I got
an old greeting card.

439
00:15:19,631 --> 00:15:21,030
It obviously wasn't for me,

440
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:23,099
but the imagination's
a hell of a thing.

441
00:15:23,134 --> 00:15:24,868
(tires screech)

442
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:26,302
Hey, Brian, what
time you get off?

443
00:15:26,338 --> 00:15:28,571
Me and the guys were hoping you
could buy us some more beer.

444
00:15:28,607 --> 00:15:29,739
You can't be serious.

445
00:15:29,774 --> 00:15:31,074
Eh, it's a little
bit serious.

446
00:15:31,109 --> 00:15:32,308
Yeah, I haven't
been drunk in a day.

447
00:15:32,344 --> 00:15:34,544
And I'm not feeling
particularly handsome.

448
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:36,045
Peter, you're
the reason I'm here!

449
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:37,947
You totally
sold me out to that cop!

450
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,916
Oh, are we just gonna
play the blame game?

451
00:15:39,951 --> 00:15:41,751
'Cause I got another game
I'd rather play.

452
00:15:41,786 --> 00:15:43,219
Boggle.

453
00:15:43,255 --> 00:15:44,654
Go to hell!
You used me.

454
00:15:44,689 --> 00:15:46,055
That's not
what friends do.

455
00:15:46,091 --> 00:15:47,690
It's what Adam Sandler's
friends do.

456
00:15:47,726 --> 00:15:50,193
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've
got a half a can of hot beer

457
00:15:50,228 --> 00:15:53,029
left in this open container
I've been driving around with.

458
00:15:53,064 --> 00:15:56,232
(glugging)

459
00:15:56,268 --> 00:15:58,434
(belches)

460
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,537
You, too, pig.

461
00:16:00,572 --> 00:16:02,505
Well, I'm not the
smartest man in the world,

462
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:05,975
but I can always look back on
my life and say I went for it.

463
00:16:06,011 --> 00:16:08,878
Ugh, this seems like a weird
place to even use a condom.

464
00:16:08,914 --> 00:16:11,180
Just shut up, Peter.
I'm done with you, all right?

465
00:16:11,216 --> 00:16:13,182
You completely lied about why
you were hanging out with me.

466
00:16:13,218 --> 00:16:14,417
What?
I never lie.

467
00:16:14,452 --> 00:16:16,352
Well, except for
that one time.

468
00:16:16,388 --> 00:16:17,687
Oh, my God!

469
00:16:17,722 --> 00:16:19,756
My husband's having
a heart attack!

470
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,758
Is anyone here a doctor?!

471
00:16:21,793 --> 00:16:24,060
I have a 13-inch penis!

472
00:16:24,095 --> 00:16:26,162
(applause)

473
00:16:26,197 --> 00:16:27,397
And besides,
I'm sick of you

474
00:16:27,432 --> 00:16:28,665
acting like you're
such a victim.

475
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,832
You agreed to buy us booze,

476
00:16:29,868 --> 00:16:30,967
'cause we weren't old enough.

477
00:16:31,002 --> 00:16:32,368
You're not old enough?!

478
00:16:32,404 --> 00:16:33,970
You're a man
in his 40s!

479
00:16:34,005 --> 00:16:35,905
This whole law
is ridiculous!

480
00:16:35,941 --> 00:16:37,607
Hey, can one of you guys
with elbows

481
00:16:37,642 --> 00:16:39,909
try to get
this truck to honk?

482
00:16:39,945 --> 00:16:41,878
(truck horn honks twice)

483
00:16:41,913 --> 00:16:43,713
Ah, that and giving noogies

484
00:16:43,748 --> 00:16:46,749
is what I miss most
about having elbows.

485
00:16:46,785 --> 00:16:49,118
You know, Brian,
what you said is right.

486
00:16:49,154 --> 00:16:50,753
This law is stupid.

487
00:16:50,789 --> 00:16:51,955
I mean, if it
weren't for that,

488
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,323
we never would've
been in this fight.

489
00:16:53,358 --> 00:16:55,058
Yeah, but what difference
does it make?

490
00:16:55,093 --> 00:16:57,160
It's the law.
Nothing we can do about it.

491
00:16:57,195 --> 00:16:58,461
The hell there's not.

492
00:16:58,496 --> 00:16:59,662
I bet if we worked together

493
00:16:59,698 --> 00:17:01,230
we could find a way
to change it back.

494
00:17:01,266 --> 00:17:02,932
I... I don't know, Peter.

495
00:17:02,968 --> 00:17:05,635
Come on, I know it seems hard,
but we can't just give up.

496
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,870
I mean, what if Thomas
Edison had given up?

497
00:17:07,906 --> 00:17:09,072
Uh, what's that?

498
00:17:09,107 --> 00:17:10,206
What's that thing
you're working on?

499
00:17:10,241 --> 00:17:11,474
Well, it's
a lightbulb and...

500
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:12,842
A lightbulb!
Lightbulb!

501
00:17:12,877 --> 00:17:14,077
Yeah, I invented that.

502
00:17:14,112 --> 00:17:15,612
Me-- I'm Thomas Edison.

503
00:17:15,647 --> 00:17:16,879
I invented the lightbulb.

504
00:17:16,915 --> 00:17:18,281
Uh, what's it do?

505
00:17:18,316 --> 00:17:20,049
It lights up a room
using electrical...

506
00:17:20,085 --> 00:17:22,318
Lights up a room using
electrical stuff!

507
00:17:22,354 --> 00:17:25,855
I was about to say that,
because<i> I</i> invented it!

508
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,256
Uh, what are
you working on?

509
00:17:27,292 --> 00:17:29,058
It's a phonograph...
Phonograph!

510
00:17:29,094 --> 00:17:31,060
I knew that,
'cause<i> I</i> invented it.

511
00:17:31,096 --> 00:17:32,595
I'm Thomas Edison.

512
00:17:32,631 --> 00:17:33,896
I rule!

513
00:17:33,932 --> 00:17:35,365
♪ Look it up ♪

514
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,967
♪ Edison was a dick. ♪

515
00:17:40,805 --> 00:17:42,772
Okay, Peter, I know how
we can get the law changed.

516
00:17:42,807 --> 00:17:44,674
I've been doing some research,
and it says here

517
00:17:44,709 --> 00:17:47,477
that in eight months, we can
get a non-binding proposition

518
00:17:47,512 --> 00:17:50,313
on the ballot as long
as we get 4,000 signatures.

519
00:17:50,348 --> 00:17:52,015
Ah, screw that,
we're going with plan B--

520
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,883
threaten to kill
the mayor's nephew.

521
00:17:53,918 --> 00:17:55,618
I love you, Dad!

522
00:17:55,654 --> 00:17:56,753
Peter, that's your son.

523
00:17:56,788 --> 00:17:57,920
Shut up, Brian!

524
00:17:57,956 --> 00:17:59,756
He's hugging me!

525
00:18:03,461 --> 00:18:05,028
So, what exactly
is your plan, here?

526
00:18:05,063 --> 00:18:06,295
You'll see.

527
00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:08,698
Just follow my lead.

528
00:18:08,733 --> 00:18:10,733
Ooh, trick-or-treaters!

529
00:18:10,769 --> 00:18:12,402
Well, what do we have here?

530
00:18:12,437 --> 00:18:14,904
A cowboy and a princess?

531
00:18:14,939 --> 00:18:17,974
Uh, yippee-ki-yay, Mr. Mayor.

532
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:21,144
Oh, a Western princess!

533
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:23,246
All right, listen, we want
that drinking law gone.

534
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:26,049
And everybody knows the best way
to get any law struck down

535
00:18:26,084 --> 00:18:27,950
is to get the gays
angry about it.

536
00:18:27,986 --> 00:18:29,719
Bruce?
Jeffrey?

537
00:18:29,754 --> 00:18:30,953
That's right,
Mr. Mayor!

538
00:18:30,989 --> 00:18:32,789
I needs
my Proseccos!

539
00:18:32,824 --> 00:18:33,790
What are you
talking about?

540
00:18:33,825 --> 00:18:34,957
You're 52.

541
00:18:34,993 --> 00:18:37,293
(gasps)
You said you was 39!

542
00:18:37,328 --> 00:18:38,928
I was just trying
to get you in bed.

543
00:18:38,963 --> 00:18:41,631
I thought we'd both
be dead by now.

544
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,033
Crap. But come on, you got
to change that law!

545
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:45,768
I mean, it's already
ruined a friendship

546
00:18:45,804 --> 00:18:47,804
with one of the best guys
I know!

547
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:49,639
CAROL:
Adam, who's at the door?

548
00:18:49,674 --> 00:18:50,840
Oh, hi, Brian.

549
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,308
Hi, Peter.

550
00:18:52,343 --> 00:18:53,609
Wait a minute.

551
00:18:53,645 --> 00:18:56,012
Is that, is that wine?

552
00:18:56,047 --> 00:18:59,015
Yeah, Adam just poured me
a little before dinner.

553
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,316
Wow, you guys eat late.

554
00:19:00,351 --> 00:19:01,384
No, Peter,
don't you see?

555
00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:02,952
Carol's underage, too!

556
00:19:02,987 --> 00:19:05,121
The mayor just broke
his own law!

557
00:19:05,156 --> 00:19:07,457
Hmm, that's a good point.

558
00:19:07,492 --> 00:19:09,659
I guess I'll just have
to resign in scandal

559
00:19:09,694 --> 00:19:11,661
while leaving the law intact.

560
00:19:11,696 --> 00:19:14,697
Or you could
just change the law.

561
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:16,199
But it's a good law.

562
00:19:16,234 --> 00:19:17,400
No, it ain't!

563
00:19:17,435 --> 00:19:18,668
Look, don't you understand
what drinking

564
00:19:18,703 --> 00:19:20,570
means to us working stiffs?

565
00:19:20,605 --> 00:19:22,138
It helps us forget about our day

566
00:19:22,173 --> 00:19:24,474
and tell our children we love
'em with a straight face.

567
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:28,177
It allows gross uggos to boof
each other's gross uggo parts.

568
00:19:28,213 --> 00:19:30,680
And it gives people the courage
to sneak onto their mayor's

569
00:19:30,715 --> 00:19:34,083
property and blackmail him
and eat all his ripe tomatoes.

570
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:36,052
That was a croquet ball.

571
00:19:36,087 --> 00:19:39,489
Ah, then could you point me to
the closest nighttime dentist?

572
00:19:39,524 --> 00:19:42,425
So listen, Mr. Mayor,
what do you say about that law?

573
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,694
(sighs)
All right, I'll repeal it.

574
00:19:44,729 --> 00:19:47,463
But only if you send me and
Carol a copy of that picture.

575
00:19:47,499 --> 00:19:50,333
We don't have a lot
of the two of us together.

576
00:19:50,368 --> 00:19:52,835
Brian, we did it!
We got him to change the law!

577
00:19:52,871 --> 00:19:55,338
Just goes to show, if anybody
wants a law changed,

578
00:19:55,373 --> 00:19:57,840
they should just go
to their mayor's house.

579
00:19:57,876 --> 00:20:00,109
Hey, I, uh, I-I appreciate

580
00:20:00,145 --> 00:20:01,944
what you said there
about our friendship.

581
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,513
Well, to be honest, Brian,

582
00:20:03,548 --> 00:20:05,348
at first I did just want you
to buy us beer.

583
00:20:05,383 --> 00:20:07,850
But then the-the more
we were hanging out,

584
00:20:07,886 --> 00:20:10,253
I-I remembered how much fun
we used to have together.

585
00:20:10,288 --> 00:20:11,921
I guess after all these years,

586
00:20:11,956 --> 00:20:14,056
I started taking you
for granted.

587
00:20:14,092 --> 00:20:16,626
But you're still my best friend.

588
00:20:16,661 --> 00:20:18,728
Even if I don't
always act like it.

589
00:20:18,763 --> 00:20:20,496
I enjoyed hanging out
with you, too.

590
00:20:20,532 --> 00:20:22,298
Thanks, Peter.

591
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,200
Hey, on your way out,

592
00:20:24,235 --> 00:20:26,102
could you put this in my
mailbox for the mailman?

593
00:20:26,137 --> 00:20:27,770
Uh, sure.

594
00:20:27,806 --> 00:20:29,205
Put the flag up?

595
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,973
Of course put
the flag up!

596
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:33,376
Geez, mail much?

597
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,600
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==
<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

598
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,750
Well, Peter, I'm just happy
that you and Brian

599
00:20:40,785 --> 00:20:42,418
managed to get
that law repealed,

600
00:20:42,453 --> 00:20:43,920
and that you're
finally friends again.

601
00:20:43,955 --> 00:20:45,354
Me, too, Lois.

602
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,156
Good to have
my drinking buddy back.

603
00:20:47,192 --> 00:20:49,292
Yay, everybody's happy!

604
00:20:49,327 --> 00:20:52,195
I love this family!

605
00:20:53,363 --> 00:20:54,444
I draped that over him.

606
00:20:54,445 --> 00:20:56,145
He was just doing it
out in the open.
