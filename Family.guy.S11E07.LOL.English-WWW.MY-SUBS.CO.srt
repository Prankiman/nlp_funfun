12
00:00:37,898 --> 00:00:41,849
There he is. The reason
my bedpost is so shiny.

13
00:00:42,097 --> 00:00:44,623
Oh my God. Are you still
obsessed with Kent?

14
00:00:44,727 --> 00:00:46,055
Just ask him out already.

15
00:00:46,155 --> 00:00:47,810
The worse that can
happen is he says no.

16
00:00:47,889 --> 00:00:50,063
Are you kidding?
Of course he'll say no.

17
00:00:50,139 --> 00:00:52,100
There's no way he'd
ever go out with me.

18
00:00:52,158 --> 00:00:55,024
He's just so...
dreamy.

19
00:00:56,364 --> 00:00:58,608
Oh Kent, what are we gonna do?

20
00:00:58,639 --> 00:01:01,347
With the Earth destroyed,
we're the only two humans left.

21
00:01:01,601 --> 00:01:04,135
Well then, it looks like
we need to start repopulating.

25
00:01:23,948 --> 00:01:25,115
I think she's choking.

26
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,350
Should we wake her up?

27
00:01:26,384 --> 00:01:28,719
No, she's got to learn
to breathe out of her nose.

28
00:01:30,155 --> 00:01:32,189
She's getting it.

29
00:01:35,794 --> 00:01:37,594
Peter, you want
another waffle?

30
00:01:37,629 --> 00:01:38,696
I can't Lois.

31
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,464
I promised Janice
I'd take her shift.

32
00:01:40,498 --> 00:01:42,333
Can I get two eggs,
scrambled, on toast?

33
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:44,435
Sure thing, honey. Adam and
Eve on a raft, wreck them!

34
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:47,071
I'd like a hotdog with ketchup
and some Jell-O, please.

35
00:01:47,105 --> 00:01:49,456
Paint a bow-wow red and a
side of nervous pudding!

36
00:01:49,491 --> 00:01:51,458
Can I have a well-done burger
with lettuce and tomato?

37
00:01:51,493 --> 00:01:53,827
Burn one, drag it through
the garden, pin a rose on it!

38
00:01:53,862 --> 00:01:55,062
Can I use your bathroom?

39
00:01:55,096 --> 00:01:56,630
Got a telephone pole heading
to the swimming hole.

40
00:01:56,664 --> 00:01:57,865
Spray it with sunshine!

41
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:00,901
Psst.

42
00:02:00,935 --> 00:02:02,753
Hey, dog.
What?

43
00:02:02,787 --> 00:02:04,488
You want in?

44
00:02:04,522 --> 00:02:07,107
Yeah.

45
00:02:07,158 --> 00:02:08,442
Ah, look at this.

46
00:02:08,493 --> 00:02:11,428
She's taped photographs of
Virginia Woolf and Katy Perry

47
00:02:11,463 --> 00:02:13,864
on the inside cover,
as if she's some sort

48
00:02:13,898 --> 00:02:15,466
of hip hybrid
of those two things.

49
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,934
Ugh. Yeah, like
she could ever write

50
00:02:16,968 --> 00:02:18,235
<i>Who's Afraid of</i>
<i>Virginia Woolf?</i>

51
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:19,937
Brian,
<i>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</i>

52
00:02:19,971 --> 00:02:21,939
was not written
by Virginia Woolf.

53
00:02:21,973 --> 00:02:23,273
Yeah, obviously.

54
00:02:23,308 --> 00:02:25,242
But, you know, it's-it's
pretty much about her.

55
00:02:25,276 --> 00:02:27,044
It really isn't, Brian.

56
00:02:27,078 --> 00:02:30,064
Let's, uh, let's just
get into this, huh?

57
00:02:31,366 --> 00:02:34,001
"Dear Diary, got
down to 152 today.

58
00:02:34,035 --> 00:02:35,536
Think that's a
nice weight for me."

59
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:36,854
Oh, here's another one.

60
00:02:36,888 --> 00:02:39,890
"Dear Diary, just discovered
the music of John Denver.

61
00:02:39,924 --> 00:02:42,493
Wow-wee, where's this been?"

62
00:02:42,527 --> 00:02:43,911
Hey, look at this.

63
00:02:43,945 --> 00:02:46,280
"Kent is so incredibly sexy.

64
00:02:46,314 --> 00:02:48,782
"He said 'hi' to me
today, and I almost died.

65
00:02:48,817 --> 00:02:53,187
"Also, I learned a funny lesson
today in my pursuit of Kent:

66
00:02:53,221 --> 00:02:56,490
anal bleaching is better
left to professionals. LOL."

67
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:59,126
Oh, oh!
No, no, no, come on, now, come on.

68
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,112
Jeez, it's just pages and pages
of stuff about this Kent guy.

69
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,430
She's really obsessed with him.

70
00:03:03,465 --> 00:03:05,182
Well, obsession's not such
a bad thing.

71
00:03:05,216 --> 00:03:07,184
It got us
the first printing press.

72
00:03:07,218 --> 00:03:08,585
You're a whore, Sheila,

73
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,621
and I'm gonna make sure
everybody knows it!

74
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,800
Here!

75
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:25,752
I can't read.

76
00:03:25,787 --> 00:03:27,221
No one can read.

77
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,827
Bye, Patty. Bye, Esther.

78
00:03:33,862 --> 00:03:35,279
Bye, overzealous Asian kids

79
00:03:35,313 --> 00:03:37,564
lining up to be the first ones
in school tomorrow.

80
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,867
Go away. No time
to say "bye."

81
00:03:39,918 --> 00:03:43,053
I pass you
'cause you lose focus!

82
00:03:43,087 --> 00:03:44,705
Damn! Lost focus!

83
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:46,740
Life over!

84
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:59,503
Oh, Kent,
this is all I ever wanted.

85
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:00,971
I feel the same way, Meg.

86
00:04:01,005 --> 00:04:04,475
From today onward,
this is our life.

87
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:06,176
We should get
off the horse soon.

88
00:04:06,194 --> 00:04:08,779
I want to save one for you.

89
00:04:12,467 --> 00:04:13,600
Oh, my God!

90
00:04:13,635 --> 00:04:14,952
Are you all right?

91
00:04:14,986 --> 00:04:16,036
I'm fine.

92
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,172
Lucky for you,
this tree was my destination.

93
00:04:20,909 --> 00:04:23,744
And the job exchange begins.

94
00:04:23,778 --> 00:04:25,512
Sir, do you want to move ahead

95
00:04:25,547 --> 00:04:28,248
on the agreement
with the sanitation union?

96
00:04:28,283 --> 00:04:30,284
Sir, we need leadership.

97
00:04:30,318 --> 00:04:31,468
Oh, my God, Meg!

98
00:04:31,503 --> 00:04:32,703
Are you okay?

99
00:04:32,737 --> 00:04:33,854
Yeah, I-I'm fine.

100
00:04:33,888 --> 00:04:36,123
I guess I got distracted again
thinking about Kent.

101
00:04:36,157 --> 00:04:38,075
Oh, I can't do this anymore.

102
00:04:38,109 --> 00:04:40,344
I've just got to ask him out.

103
00:04:40,378 --> 00:04:41,929
Sorry!

104
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:49,803
Honey, give me
any laundry you have.

105
00:04:49,837 --> 00:04:51,738
I'm doing a diapers
and Meg load.

106
00:04:51,773 --> 00:04:53,807
Hey, Mom, can I ask you
about something?

107
00:04:53,841 --> 00:04:55,976
Of course, Meg.
What's on your mind?

108
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,911
Well, there's this guy
I like at school,

109
00:04:57,946 --> 00:04:59,580
and I was thinking about,

110
00:04:59,614 --> 00:05:02,733
I-I don't know, maybe
calling him and...

111
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:05,402
Meg, are you asking,
in this day and age,

112
00:05:05,436 --> 00:05:07,838
when the CEO of Xerox
is a woman,

113
00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:10,140
when the president
of Brazil is a woman,

114
00:05:10,174 --> 00:05:12,075
even Rosie O'Donnell
is a woman,

115
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,077
whether it's appropriate
for a girl

116
00:05:14,112 --> 00:05:16,013
to ask a boy out on a date?

117
00:05:16,047 --> 00:05:18,015
Of course it's appropriate.

118
00:05:18,049 --> 00:05:21,585
It's also sad and desperate
and I would never do it,

119
00:05:21,619 --> 00:05:23,487
but you're not me,
are you, sweetie?

120
00:05:23,521 --> 00:05:24,721
No, I'm not.

121
00:05:24,756 --> 00:05:26,757
No, you're not.

122
00:05:33,398 --> 00:05:34,965
Hello?
Hey, Kent?

123
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:36,667
It's Meg, from
English class.

124
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:38,035
Uh...

125
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:39,269
And math class?

126
00:05:39,304 --> 00:05:40,671
And bio?

127
00:05:40,705 --> 00:05:42,839
And the Facebook campaign
to get me to kill myself?

128
00:05:42,874 --> 00:05:43,974
Oh, Meg!

129
00:05:44,008 --> 00:05:45,642
Hey, what's up?
Hey!

130
00:05:45,677 --> 00:05:47,110
Um, nothing much.

131
00:05:47,145 --> 00:05:49,279
I was just wondering

132
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:51,615
if you maybe wanted
to hang out some time?

133
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:52,816
Sure.

134
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,085
Oh, wow, cool!

135
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:57,788
Okay, um,
I'll-I'll text you?

136
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,675
Yes! I can't believe it!

137
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:05,212
Oh, my God, I'm going out
on a date with Kent Lastname.

138
00:06:05,246 --> 00:06:06,863
Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

139
00:06:07,982 --> 00:06:09,216
Oh, my gosh!

140
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,152
I'm gonna go ahead
and shut this for you.

141
00:06:21,511 --> 00:06:22,561
Oh, hello.

142
00:06:22,596 --> 00:06:23,996
Hi, you must be
Mrs. Griffin.

143
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,948
I'm Kent.
I'm here to pick up Meg.

144
00:06:25,982 --> 00:06:27,883
Oh, Kent, it's so
nice to meet you.

145
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:29,351
She's just getting ready.

146
00:06:29,386 --> 00:06:31,086
Meg, Kent's here!

147
00:06:31,121 --> 00:06:33,022
Just putting on my lipstick.

148
00:06:33,056 --> 00:06:34,456
Damn it.

149
00:06:34,491 --> 00:06:36,458
And this is Meg's brother,
Chris.

150
00:06:36,493 --> 00:06:37,993
Oh, yeah,
I've seen you around school.

151
00:06:38,028 --> 00:06:39,461
You eat
with the deaf kids, right?

152
00:06:39,496 --> 00:06:41,530
One of them isn't
all the way deaf.

153
00:06:41,565 --> 00:06:43,165
What grade are you in again?

154
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,501
That's still being worked
out by a team of counselors.

155
00:06:45,535 --> 00:06:47,436
Cool.
Hope to see you around school.

156
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,104
He seems nice.

157
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:50,256
Sorry, I missed all that.

158
00:06:50,307 --> 00:06:51,373
I was tweeting.

159
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:03,085
Coming this fall,
the prequel to <i>Philadelphia.</i>

160
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:04,787
Are you sure
we don't need a condom?

161
00:07:04,821 --> 00:07:06,322
No, it's okay,
I'm a lawyer.

162
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:14,613
How you girls doing on popcorn?

163
00:07:14,664 --> 00:07:15,981
I'll take some.

164
00:07:16,016 --> 00:07:17,449
Here you go.

165
00:07:20,287 --> 00:07:23,305
Oh, sorry, am I taking
up the whole armrest?

166
00:07:24,608 --> 00:07:27,126
Boy, it's kind
of chilly in here.

167
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,695
Really? You got big sweat
marks under your boobs.

168
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:32,565
That must mean
they must like you then.

169
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,251
Hey, I'll be
right back.

170
00:07:35,285 --> 00:07:37,336
I got to go to
the bathroom.

171
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,388
Oh, thank God.

172
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:44,994
And now,
our feature presentation:

173
00:07:45,028 --> 00:07:48,530
<i>Adrien Brody Doing Sit-Ups</i>
<i>in 3-D.</i>

174
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,166
One.

175
00:07:52,285 --> 00:07:54,270
Two.

176
00:07:57,007 --> 00:07:59,141
That was fun.

177
00:07:59,175 --> 00:08:00,676
We should hang out
again some time.

178
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:01,911
Yeah, definitely.

179
00:08:01,945 --> 00:08:03,445
Well, good night.

180
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,713
Night.

181
00:08:04,748 --> 00:08:07,182
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
Oh, my God, I thought you...

182
00:08:07,217 --> 00:08:10,052
I didn't think this was a date.
Oh, my God. I'm so embarrassed!

183
00:08:10,086 --> 00:08:12,054
Hey, it's 10:30!

184
00:08:12,088 --> 00:08:15,140
I suggest you take your dope
and go elsewhere!

185
00:08:15,175 --> 00:08:16,842
I'm sorry, Meg. I
think you're great,

186
00:08:16,876 --> 00:08:18,377
and I love hanging
out with you,

187
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:20,479
but there's something
you should know.

188
00:08:20,513 --> 00:08:22,047
I'm gay.

189
00:08:22,082 --> 00:08:23,482
You are?

190
00:08:23,516 --> 00:08:26,585
Look, I really like you as a
friend, but to be honest...

191
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,354
I like Chris.

192
00:08:28,388 --> 00:08:29,555
What?

193
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:30,706
Oh, for God's sake.

194
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,408
I have a shoe appointment
in the morning,

195
00:08:32,442 --> 00:08:33,826
and I want to be fresh!

196
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,928
Yeah, the person
I'm attracted to

197
00:08:35,962 --> 00:08:37,229
is your brother.

198
00:08:37,263 --> 00:08:39,131
Brother?

199
00:08:39,165 --> 00:08:40,582
Rupert, did you hear that?

200
00:08:40,617 --> 00:08:42,584
Meg's boyfriend
is in love with me.

201
00:08:42,619 --> 00:08:43,919
Not that I care.

202
00:08:43,954 --> 00:08:46,005
I mean, it won't matter
once I explain to him

203
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,773
what's going on with us.

204
00:08:47,807 --> 00:08:51,644
But what would I tell him
is going on with us?

205
00:09:21,074 --> 00:09:22,858
Thanks, Brian!

206
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:24,293
Brian?

207
00:09:24,327 --> 00:09:26,528
Hey... princess.

208
00:09:26,563 --> 00:09:28,263
I'll get out of your hair.

209
00:09:28,298 --> 00:09:29,865
I can see you want
to be left alone.

210
00:09:29,883 --> 00:09:32,267
Why does everything bad
always happen to me?

211
00:09:32,302 --> 00:09:33,635
Huh, you and me both.

212
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,521
I got this cold.

213
00:09:35,555 --> 00:09:38,157
And it's-it's
just in that

214
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:40,659
"I don't want to give it to
a friend" stage, you know?

215
00:09:40,694 --> 00:09:42,294
Oh, God, you hear that?

216
00:09:42,328 --> 00:09:44,229
I sound like a
Jewish See 'n Say.

217
00:09:44,264 --> 00:09:46,565
The uncle says...

218
00:09:49,319 --> 00:09:50,903
The grandpa says...

219
00:09:50,937 --> 00:09:52,688
What?!

220
00:09:52,722 --> 00:09:53,739
The aunt says...

221
00:09:53,773 --> 00:09:55,424
Oh-h.

222
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,092
Kent told me he's gay,

223
00:09:57,127 --> 00:09:59,428
and even worse,
he likes Chris!

224
00:09:59,462 --> 00:10:01,597
Oh, wow, I'm really
sorry to hear that, Meg.

225
00:10:01,631 --> 00:10:02,931
I don't get it.

226
00:10:02,966 --> 00:10:05,200
I've been going to high school
with him for three years,

227
00:10:05,235 --> 00:10:07,369
and I always assumed
he was straight.

228
00:10:07,404 --> 00:10:09,204
Well, high school's
a tough time, Meg.

229
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:10,539
Maybe he thought
he was straight,

230
00:10:10,573 --> 00:10:12,207
but then realized
he's gay.

231
00:10:12,242 --> 00:10:13,759
He's probably still
figuring things out.

232
00:10:13,793 --> 00:10:15,544
Hang in there.

233
00:10:15,578 --> 00:10:17,813
Well, I'll help him
figure things out.

234
00:10:17,847 --> 00:10:20,833
I'll help him figure out
that he's straight.

235
00:10:24,687 --> 00:10:26,688
That was really close.

236
00:10:31,528 --> 00:10:33,295
Hey, Chris, you
mind if I sit here?

237
00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:34,430
No, of course not.

238
00:10:34,464 --> 00:10:37,332
We were just having
a political discussion.

239
00:10:46,626 --> 00:10:49,211
Bill's, uh...
kind of conservative.

240
00:10:49,245 --> 00:10:50,712
Hey, you know,
it was really cool

241
00:10:50,747 --> 00:10:52,014
meeting you the
other night.

242
00:10:52,048 --> 00:10:53,866
I was thinking maybe we
should hang out sometime.

243
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,902
Sure. I sleep for, like, six
hours every day after school,

244
00:10:56,936 --> 00:10:58,854
but other than that,
I'm pretty open.

245
00:10:58,888 --> 00:11:00,122
Well, great, then
we should definitely...

246
00:11:00,156 --> 00:11:01,557
Oh, hey, Meg.

247
00:11:01,591 --> 00:11:04,143
Listen, I hope you're okay
after the other night.

248
00:11:04,177 --> 00:11:05,410
Yeah, no,
that's-that's what

249
00:11:05,445 --> 00:11:07,045
I wanted to talk to
you about, Kent.

250
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,648
Look, I-I know you're going
through a confusing time.

251
00:11:09,682 --> 00:11:11,216
The thing is, though,

252
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:13,952
I feel like you're
not actually gay.

253
00:11:13,987 --> 00:11:15,237
What?

254
00:11:15,271 --> 00:11:16,939
No, I-I told you, I am.

255
00:11:16,973 --> 00:11:18,490
You don't talk
or act gay.

256
00:11:18,525 --> 00:11:19,992
I mean, you
play football.

257
00:11:20,026 --> 00:11:21,827
Those jeans cost
20 bucks, tops.

258
00:11:21,861 --> 00:11:24,029
And you only use
"hello" as a greeting,

259
00:11:24,063 --> 00:11:26,031
not as a way to outdo
some imaginary antagonist

260
00:11:26,065 --> 00:11:27,299
in conversation.

261
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,500
Meg, please stop.

262
00:11:28,535 --> 00:11:30,269
I know your heart's
in the right place, but...

263
00:11:30,303 --> 00:11:31,370
Actually, it's not.

264
00:11:31,404 --> 00:11:33,205
It's a serious
medical condition.

265
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:36,692
Yeah, that's...
that's not supposed to be there,

266
00:11:36,726 --> 00:11:39,661
so she should probably
always wear a hat.

267
00:11:42,765 --> 00:11:44,216
Hey.
Hey.

268
00:11:44,267 --> 00:11:46,268
So I guess you heard
about Meg's boyfriend, huh?

269
00:11:46,302 --> 00:11:47,736
I did.
I did hear, yes.

270
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:48,871
Weird, right?

271
00:11:48,905 --> 00:11:50,522
Guy has a crush
on her own brother.

272
00:11:50,557 --> 00:11:51,740
I know, so weird.

273
00:11:51,774 --> 00:11:54,009
But, you know, the heart wants
what the heart wants.

274
00:11:54,043 --> 00:11:55,477
I just hope it doesn't
cause awkwardness,

275
00:11:55,512 --> 00:11:56,578
you know, in the house.

276
00:11:56,613 --> 00:11:58,147
Oh, no, it doesn't have
to be awkward,

277
00:11:58,181 --> 00:11:59,498
not if we don't make it awkward.

278
00:11:59,532 --> 00:12:00,999
I just don't see
the attraction.

279
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:02,901
I mean, is it all
about that big package?

280
00:12:02,936 --> 00:12:04,503
Big? You really think so?

281
00:12:04,537 --> 00:12:06,505
Are you kidding?
Biggest in the family.

282
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:08,807
That thing should be hanging
from the ceiling of a deli.

283
00:12:08,842 --> 00:12:10,008
Thanks, Brian.

284
00:12:10,043 --> 00:12:11,743
God, I have
so much energy now.

285
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:15,514
Am I the only one
who feels like grabbing a drink?

286
00:12:19,886 --> 00:12:22,371
Hey, do you think
this picture is hot?

287
00:12:24,274 --> 00:12:25,574
Kind of, yeah.

288
00:12:25,608 --> 00:12:27,809
Well guess what:
that's <i>my</i> back.

289
00:12:27,844 --> 00:12:29,344
Hook up with me!
Come on!

290
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:30,679
We can make this work.

291
00:12:30,713 --> 00:12:32,948
Just stick your head in here
and pretend it's a butt.

292
00:12:32,982 --> 00:12:34,233
No, Meg, stop it.

293
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:35,767
God, this is
getting too weird.

294
00:12:35,802 --> 00:12:38,003
I can't be
your boyfriend.

295
00:12:38,037 --> 00:12:41,607
In fact, I don't even
think I can be your friend.

296
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:42,674
Kent, wait!

297
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:44,126
We can totally be friends.

298
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,594
We can go shopping together.

299
00:12:45,628 --> 00:12:47,679
And I like musicals.
I've even seen

300
00:12:47,714 --> 00:12:50,048
the latest Tony Award-winning
piece of crap.

313
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,364
Hey, Meg, what's wrong?

314
00:13:22,398 --> 00:13:24,533
What's wrong
is that Kent doesn't like me.

315
00:13:24,567 --> 00:13:26,201
He likes my brother, Chris.

316
00:13:26,236 --> 00:13:27,236
Oh, my God.

317
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,337
No way!

318
00:13:28,371 --> 00:13:29,605
Well, I mean,

319
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:30,956
you've done
everything you can do.

320
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,624
I guess you just
have to move on.

321
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:35,694
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of
sweet guy-trim at this school.

322
00:13:35,728 --> 00:13:37,162
You-you don't understand.

323
00:13:37,196 --> 00:13:38,497
He's all I think about.

324
00:13:38,531 --> 00:13:40,299
I-I can't eat, I can't sleep.

325
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:43,435
Just thinking about him now
gives me heart palpitations.

326
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:48,440
I feel like if I could just know
what it's like to be with him,

327
00:13:48,474 --> 00:13:50,175
just-just once,

328
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:52,144
I could at least have
some sort of closure.

329
00:13:52,178 --> 00:13:53,946
Well, if Kent hooks up
with your brother,

330
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,080
you could just have Chris

331
00:13:55,114 --> 00:13:56,748
describe every last detail
to you.

332
00:13:56,783 --> 00:13:58,900
Oh, my God, that's it.

333
00:13:58,935 --> 00:14:00,035
What do you mean?

334
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:01,720
I mean,
if I can't have Kent,

335
00:14:01,754 --> 00:14:03,422
then that's
the next best thing.

336
00:14:03,456 --> 00:14:05,824
I've just got to get Chris
to sleep with him.

337
00:14:05,858 --> 00:14:07,192
Oh, no.

338
00:14:07,226 --> 00:14:08,493
Here comes
Mr. Davis with one

339
00:14:08,528 --> 00:14:11,163
of his technically-not-
illegal invitations.

340
00:14:11,197 --> 00:14:14,099
Girls, I'm gonna be
at the park later.

341
00:14:20,263 --> 00:14:22,497
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about it, Bonnie.

342
00:14:22,532 --> 00:14:24,566
I've put Stewie in the oven
a bunch of times.

343
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,268
As long as you come
to your senses

344
00:14:26,302 --> 00:14:28,603
within 15 minutes,
everything's fine.

345
00:14:28,638 --> 00:14:30,656
Lois, can I go Slip 'N
Slide in the yard?

346
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,524
Has it been half an hour
since you've eaten?

347
00:14:32,558 --> 00:14:33,892
Yes. Almost.

348
00:14:33,926 --> 00:14:36,278
Okay, I just want to be sure
you don't get a cramp.

349
00:14:36,312 --> 00:14:38,847
Yay! Poor people
water fun!

350
00:14:40,249 --> 00:14:41,817
Hey, Chris.

351
00:14:41,851 --> 00:14:43,919
Uh, can I ask you a question?

352
00:14:43,953 --> 00:14:45,187
Sure, what's up?

353
00:14:45,221 --> 00:14:47,889
Um, remember that "free hug"
coupon you gave me

354
00:14:47,924 --> 00:14:49,825
for my ninth birthday
that I never used?

355
00:14:49,859 --> 00:14:51,026
Yeah.

356
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,211
Well, I'd like to use it.

357
00:14:53,246 --> 00:14:55,364
Oh, okay. Sure.

358
00:14:55,398 --> 00:14:58,700
But... I'd like
to sort of upgrade it.

359
00:14:58,735 --> 00:15:01,703
I'd like it
to be a butt-hug with Kent.

360
00:15:01,738 --> 00:15:03,572
What? Are you out
of your mind?!

361
00:15:03,606 --> 00:15:05,240
Chris, please,
just sleep with Kent

362
00:15:05,274 --> 00:15:06,708
and then tell me
all about it.

363
00:15:06,743 --> 00:15:07,909
Forget it, Meg.

364
00:15:07,944 --> 00:15:09,978
I can't just do stuff
with another guy.

365
00:15:10,013 --> 00:15:11,780
I'm not Derek Jeter.

366
00:15:11,814 --> 00:15:13,015
I like girls.

367
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:14,182
Ugh, come on, Chris.

368
00:15:14,217 --> 00:15:15,283
Girls are terrible.

369
00:15:15,318 --> 00:15:16,485
They're always backstabbing

370
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:18,620
and giving each other
phony compliments.

371
00:15:18,654 --> 00:15:21,990
Oh, wow, you are definitely
not afraid of dessert.

372
00:15:22,025 --> 00:15:23,658
You know, I wish I
were secure enough

373
00:15:23,693 --> 00:15:25,994
to throw on any old thing
and call it an outfit.

374
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:28,930
Come on, you have
so much body confidence.

375
00:15:28,965 --> 00:15:31,633
I mean, who wouldn't
with those strong legs?

376
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:33,235
So muscular.

377
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:36,471
I'm jealous of how thick
with strength they are.

378
00:15:36,506 --> 00:15:37,773
Hey, I like your tie.

379
00:15:37,807 --> 00:15:38,807
Thanks.

380
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:42,744
♪

381
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,713
Come on, Chris,
he'll do all the work.

382
00:15:44,747 --> 00:15:46,148
I said no, Meg.

383
00:15:46,182 --> 00:15:47,582
I'll pay you
a hundred bucks.

384
00:15:47,617 --> 00:15:49,384
Oh, fine, I'll
keep it in my bum.

385
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:50,952
There'll be
plenty of room.

386
00:15:50,987 --> 00:15:53,655
That's my sarcastic way of
saying it's not gonna happen.

387
00:15:53,689 --> 00:15:54,823
Good day, Meg.

388
00:15:54,857 --> 00:15:57,426
Oh, it's gonna happen.

389
00:16:04,634 --> 00:16:06,068
Oh, hi, Meg.

390
00:16:06,102 --> 00:16:07,269
Hi, Mr. Quagmire.

391
00:16:07,303 --> 00:16:08,487
What can I do for you?

392
00:16:08,521 --> 00:16:10,555
I-I was wondering
if I could borrow some roofies?

393
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,958
Oh, sure, sure,
just a sec.

394
00:16:12,992 --> 00:16:14,359
Roofies, huh?

395
00:16:14,393 --> 00:16:16,228
Pretty big pill for
such a little girl.

396
00:16:16,262 --> 00:16:18,797
Yeah, I know, but I asked
someone to do me a favor,

397
00:16:18,831 --> 00:16:20,432
and they're not too keen
on doing it.

398
00:16:20,466 --> 00:16:21,933
Oh, I know what
they're for, honey.

399
00:16:21,968 --> 00:16:23,535
So, how's school?

400
00:16:23,569 --> 00:16:24,770
Oh, good, thanks.

401
00:16:24,804 --> 00:16:26,171
Studies going well?

402
00:16:26,205 --> 00:16:28,707
Yeah, yeah, mostly A's and B's
so far this semester.

403
00:16:28,741 --> 00:16:30,375
Oh, that's so great.

404
00:16:30,409 --> 00:16:32,394
Seeing anyone
special these days?

405
00:16:32,428 --> 00:16:34,229
Hey, obviously, right?

406
00:16:34,263 --> 00:16:36,014
Of course, yeah.

407
00:16:36,048 --> 00:16:37,749
Okay, well, listen, good
luck with everything.

408
00:16:37,784 --> 00:16:39,618
And, uh, call me
if you get arrested.

409
00:16:39,652 --> 00:16:42,020
I will. Thanks.

410
00:16:42,054 --> 00:16:43,789
That's what
it's all about, Glenn.

411
00:16:43,823 --> 00:16:46,057
Don't rape it back,
rape it forward.

412
00:16:50,763 --> 00:16:52,097
All right,
I talked to Chris,

413
00:16:52,131 --> 00:16:54,633
and he totally wants
to hook up with you, too.

414
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:55,734
No way! Really?

415
00:16:55,768 --> 00:16:57,569
I didn't even
know he was gay.

416
00:16:57,603 --> 00:16:59,437
It's just that
he's not as comfortable

417
00:16:59,472 --> 00:17:01,206
with his sexuality
as you are yet,

418
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,909
so he's gonna need
to pretend to be asleep

419
00:17:03,943 --> 00:17:05,110
while it's happening.

420
00:17:05,144 --> 00:17:06,845
Oh, he's a snooze-juicer.

421
00:17:06,879 --> 00:17:08,146
Okay.

422
00:17:08,181 --> 00:17:10,949
Wow, I didn't know Chris
had this dark side to him.

423
00:17:10,983 --> 00:17:13,785
Oh, yeah,
Chris has a major dark side.

424
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:17,289
My dad is actually
really scared of him.

425
00:17:18,057 --> 00:17:20,659
Wha...

426
00:17:20,693 --> 00:17:22,294
Who's there?

427
00:17:22,328 --> 00:17:26,198
Go back to sleep, Dad.

428
00:17:26,232 --> 00:17:28,233
Okay.

429
00:17:35,641 --> 00:17:38,977
You're very
precious to me.

430
00:17:42,348 --> 00:17:44,149
Chris, I made
some Kool-Aid!

431
00:17:44,183 --> 00:17:45,417
You want some?

432
00:17:45,451 --> 00:17:46,918
Sure!

433
00:17:57,864 --> 00:17:59,614
Chris, what are you doing
in my room?

434
00:17:59,649 --> 00:18:01,249
Nothing.
Yes, you were.

435
00:18:01,283 --> 00:18:03,251
You were putting something
in my drawer.

436
00:18:03,285 --> 00:18:05,353
What's this?

437
00:18:05,388 --> 00:18:06,688
Look, Meg,

438
00:18:06,722 --> 00:18:08,757
I know you've been having
a hard time lately,

439
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,076
so I wanted
to give you something

440
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,979
that means a lot to me.

441
00:18:14,013 --> 00:18:16,047
Oh, I remember this.

442
00:18:16,082 --> 00:18:18,316
This was the trip
our family took to the Cape.

443
00:18:18,351 --> 00:18:19,718
Ugh, it was miserable.

444
00:18:19,752 --> 00:18:22,187
It was raining, and Mom and
Dad fought the whole time.

445
00:18:22,221 --> 00:18:23,622
You taught me how
to hunt squirrels

446
00:18:23,656 --> 00:18:24,623
with poisoned cheese,

447
00:18:24,657 --> 00:18:26,258
and then you took me
to the hospital

448
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:28,860
when the squirrels tricked me
into eating the cheese.

449
00:18:28,895 --> 00:18:32,180
Chris, you kept this photo
all these years?

450
00:18:32,215 --> 00:18:34,766
Yeah, it's gotten me
through a lot of tough times.

451
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,002
Like when Felicity
cut her hair.

452
00:18:37,036 --> 00:18:38,670
What?!

453
00:18:38,704 --> 00:18:41,239
Aw, thanks, Chris.

454
00:18:41,274 --> 00:18:42,941
That was really
thoughtful of you.

455
00:18:42,975 --> 00:18:45,610
Hey, so can I have
some of that Kool-Aid now?

456
00:18:45,645 --> 00:18:46,978
No.

457
00:18:47,013 --> 00:18:49,014
No, actually you can't.

458
00:19:05,598 --> 00:19:07,299
Oh, Chris, hi.

459
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,900
I didn't realize
you'd be awake.

460
00:19:08,935 --> 00:19:10,168
What?

461
00:19:10,202 --> 00:19:12,604
Well, Meg said you'd be asleep,
but it's fine.

462
00:19:12,638 --> 00:19:13,772
I can work with this.

463
00:19:13,806 --> 00:19:15,340
Oh, hell no!

464
00:19:15,374 --> 00:19:16,508
Meg!

465
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:18,576
Oh, my God.

466
00:19:18,611 --> 00:19:20,845
Kent, I just texted you
that the plan was off.

467
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,748
Meg, what the hell
were you planning on doing?!

468
00:19:23,783 --> 00:19:25,517
Oh, Chris,
I'm so sorry.

469
00:19:25,551 --> 00:19:27,185
I was so obsessed
with Kent

470
00:19:27,219 --> 00:19:28,954
that I-I guess I wasn't
thinking straight.

471
00:19:28,988 --> 00:19:32,090
I'm just glad I stopped before
I did a really terrible thing.

472
00:19:32,124 --> 00:19:34,492
Terrible thing?
What terrible thing?

473
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:37,829
Well, like I said,
I-I changed my mind.

474
00:19:37,863 --> 00:19:39,130
I-I didn't do it.

475
00:19:39,165 --> 00:19:40,398
But, um...

476
00:19:40,433 --> 00:19:41,633
I was...

477
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:43,568
kind of gonna...

478
00:19:43,602 --> 00:19:44,753
roofie you.

479
00:19:44,787 --> 00:19:46,838
What?!
What is wrong with you?!

480
00:19:46,872 --> 00:19:49,291
And, Kent, I owe you
an apology, too.

481
00:19:49,325 --> 00:19:51,943
I lied when I told you that
Chris wanted to sleep with you.

482
00:19:51,978 --> 00:19:53,078
Save it, Meg!

483
00:19:53,112 --> 00:19:54,412
I don't need your apologies!

484
00:19:54,447 --> 00:19:56,948
I can see now
that you're a complete psycho!

485
00:20:00,086 --> 00:20:02,871
Boy, clothes sure are a prison,
aren't they?

486
00:20:05,141 --> 00:20:07,375
Lot of drumroll for nothing.

487
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,643
What's this?

488
00:20:08,678 --> 00:20:10,679
Ooh, candy!

489
00:20:21,741 --> 00:20:22,824
Hey, Meg.

490
00:20:22,858 --> 00:20:24,125
I heard what happened.

491
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,177
Yeah, Kent hates me now.

492
00:20:26,212 --> 00:20:27,645
You made a mistake.

493
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,980
I know you feel terrible,

494
00:20:29,015 --> 00:20:30,582
but you're not
a bad person, Meg.

495
00:20:30,616 --> 00:20:32,283
You just need
to get back out there,

496
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:34,386
and someday,
maybe you'll find the right guy.

497
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,054
You really
think so, Brian?

498
00:20:36,088 --> 00:20:37,455
I know so.

499
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:39,624
All it takes is one guy
making one mistake,

500
00:20:39,658 --> 00:20:41,092
one drunken night.

501
00:20:41,127 --> 00:20:42,260
Sperm finding a fertile egg.

502
00:20:42,966 --> 00:20:44,734
You refusing to do
what a sane woman would do.

503
00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:46,903
You got him, Meg.
You got him for life.

504
00:20:47,882 --> 00:20:49,132
Thanks, Brian.
No problem.

505
00:20:50,234 --> 00:20:52,479
Hey, do either of you know
what poison ivy looks like?

506
00:20:52,579 --> 00:20:57,579
