00:00:33,577 --> 00:00:35,301
You guys are gonna love this spa.

5
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:36,945
They give the best massages.

6
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,737
Your all body'll feel like Joe's legs.

7
00:00:38,884 --> 00:00:41,730
That would be nice for a short period.

8
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,157
Uh, I tell you, i need this.

9
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:44,787
I've had a really stressful morning.

10
00:00:45,007 --> 00:00:46,131
Wait a minute, doc !

11
00:00:46,253 --> 00:00:47,498
Are you telling me...

12
00:00:47,783 --> 00:00:50,331
that it's height twenty-five ?
- Precisely !

13
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:51,290
Damn !

14
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:52,743
I'm late for school !

15
00:00:53,777 --> 00:00:55,076
<i>Don't need money,</i>

16
00:00:55,618 --> 00:00:57,444
<i>don't take fame</i>

17
00:00:57,564 --> 00:01:00,941
<i>Don't need no credit card to
ride this train</i>

18
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,152
<i>It's strong and it's sudden</i>

19
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:05,167
<i>and it's cruel sometimes</i>

20
00:01:05,422 --> 00:01:09,757
<i>But it might just save your life</i>

21
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,169
That's the power of love

22
00:01:13,088 --> 00:01:15,965
Okay, well, just get yourself sit
upon the table.

23
00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:16,871
I give you minute.

24
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:18,431
Uh, what am I supposed...

25
00:01:26,304 --> 00:01:27,900
- You ready in there ?
- Yap.

26
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,300
Oh, ahah, you put some fake
poo on the floor.

27
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:33,673
Oh no !

28
00:01:33,921 --> 00:01:36,226
Get out, get out ! skank !

29
00:01:37,216 --> 00:01:39,035
Ah, this is more like it.

30
00:01:39,339 --> 00:01:46,181
Oh, my love

31
00:01:46,931 --> 00:01:47,978
Is the music ok ?

32
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,757
Actually, would you mind tune it

33
00:01:49,804 --> 00:01:51,338
to 97.1 ?

34
00:01:51,714 --> 00:01:53,907
You're listening to the quiet storm.

35
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,777
Up next, the music of the isleys

36
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,631
Teddy Pendergrass, and right now,

37
00:01:58,687 --> 00:02:01,177
here's some Marvin Gaye.

38
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:03,989
Oh, that's what I'm talking about.

39
00:02:05,468 --> 00:02:07,361
This is long overdue.

40
00:02:07,722 --> 00:02:08,835
There's nothing like a good

41
00:02:08,847 --> 00:02:10,002
suit massage.

42
00:02:10,606 --> 00:02:12,400
Focus on, little pal.

43
00:02:12,413 --> 00:02:14,050
It's where I carry most of my stress.

44
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:16,155
Okay, here's one.

45
00:02:16,346 --> 00:02:17,368
If you would gay

46
00:02:17,518 --> 00:02:19,025
and you had to have sex with

47
00:02:19,046 --> 00:02:21,243
John Forsythe or Sean Connery.

48
00:02:21,398 --> 00:02:21,969
Who would it be ?

49
00:02:22,123 --> 00:02:24,250
Oh, that's easy, John Forsythe.

50
00:02:24,292 --> 00:02:26,607
- Yeah, John Forsythe
- John Forsythe, absolutely.

51
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,982
It's so funny, I would also say

52
00:02:28,004 --> 00:02:29,560
John Forsythe, I was just curious.

53
00:02:29,586 --> 00:02:31,102
Yeah, I mean Sean Connery is

54
00:02:31,128 --> 00:02:32,069
just so...

55
00:02:32,908 --> 00:02:33,423
Uh-ho.

56
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:35,961
Oh God, I am so sorry.

57
00:02:36,148 --> 00:02:38,470
It's too late, the damage's done.

58
00:02:42,685 --> 00:02:44,062
Hey Chris, you know what I just got ?

59
00:02:44,377 --> 00:02:46,420
The box set of Lords of the Rings.

60
00:02:46,456 --> 00:02:47,196
It's awesome.

61
00:02:47,252 --> 00:02:49,645
Yeah, but, you remember the
giant eagle they

62
00:02:49,654 --> 00:02:51,943
rode in the first one and
then rescue them

63
00:02:51,973 --> 00:02:53,573
at the end of the first one ?
- Yeah, yeah.

64
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:55,590
Yeah, why they didn't just
fly the eagle to

65
00:02:55,615 --> 00:02:57,090
Mordor instead of spending

66
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,184
three movies walking here.

67
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,928
That's not what it's about Chris.

68
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:02,120
It's about the quest.

69
00:03:02,153 --> 00:03:03,761
Oh, I'm not arguing that with
you, I'm just

70
00:03:03,775 --> 00:03:05,338
saying there's a hole in the story.

71
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,013
- Have you ever seen Crawl ?
- No.

72
00:03:09,528 --> 00:03:10,837
Yeah, you don't need to see Crawl.

73
00:03:11,432 --> 00:03:13,268
Alright guys, the best thing
you can do for your

74
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:14,873
body after a massage is hot

75
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:16,914
coffee, alcohol and slim gyms.

76
00:03:17,034 --> 00:03:19,279
Oh, dad, I'm glad you're here.

77
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,893
There's something I need to ask you.

78
00:03:21,048 --> 00:03:22,919
- What is it Chris ?
- Well, uh...

79
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,442
Today in gym class,

80
00:03:24,685 --> 00:03:26,531
I noticed one of my testicles

81
00:03:26,564 --> 00:03:28,244
went up inside my body and

82
00:03:28,261 --> 00:03:29,814
hasn't come back out yet.

83
00:03:30,273 --> 00:03:31,745
And, I'm a little scared.

84
00:03:31,865 --> 00:03:33,618
Ah, Sir, this employee just made a

85
00:03:33,632 --> 00:03:34,858
sexual remark to me.

86
00:03:34,899 --> 00:03:35,751
No dad, I'm...

87
00:03:35,871 --> 00:03:37,078
I'm really worried.

88
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:39,114
See ? Look, is that normal ?

89
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,668
Sir, Sir ! Your employee is

90
00:03:41,676 --> 00:03:42,864
exposing himself to me.

91
00:03:42,885 --> 00:03:43,656
But dad...

92
00:03:43,664 --> 00:03:45,012
You've got a lawsuit on your hands,
mister.

93
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:46,689
Oh, okay, look look,

94
00:03:47,106 --> 00:03:48,337
If you'd be well enough to forget this

95
00:03:48,344 --> 00:03:49,465
whole thing happened. I'll...

96
00:03:49,585 --> 00:03:50,897
give you this gas card.

97
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:53,631
Unlimited free gas for a year ?

98
00:03:54,012 --> 00:03:55,349
Just cause I threaten to sue you?

99
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:56,730
Well, that, and...

100
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,034
You're not the worst looking guy.

101
00:03:58,066 --> 00:03:59,046
who's ever come in here.

102
00:03:59,132 --> 00:04:00,539
That's what I wanted to hear.

103
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:08,033
Wow, Peter, a free gas card.

104
00:04:08,127 --> 00:04:09,751
This could save us a lot of money.

105
00:04:09,776 --> 00:04:11,687
Yeah, everyone except of
Brian 'cause he brought a

106
00:04:11,724 --> 00:04:13,180
Prius, what a dumbass.

107
00:04:15,584 --> 00:04:17,137
What I miss ? Are we laughing at Brian ?

108
00:04:17,184 --> 00:04:19,004
Oh, Brian, you suck.

109
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:21,420
What the devil is in here ?

110
00:04:21,593 --> 00:04:23,391
Oh, I threw up all your
apple-juice Stewie.

111
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,959
We're a gas family now.

112
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:27,242
You put gazoline in Stewie's bottle ?

113
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:28,275
You damn fool !

114
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,182
You're more useless than Aquaman !

115
00:04:32,444 --> 00:04:34,890
Help ! Somebody help, rape !

116
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:35,955
Scream all you want,

117
00:04:36,008 --> 00:04:37,378
nobody can hear you out here.

118
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:38,607
I can !

119
00:04:38,838 --> 00:04:39,980
Aquaman, help !

120
00:04:41,944 --> 00:04:43,927
- Hey, let her go !
- Or what ?

121
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,401
Or...

122
00:04:44,987 --> 00:04:45,450
Or...

123
00:04:45,693 --> 00:04:46,861
I don't know man, but you're...

124
00:04:47,305 --> 00:04:48,995
you're lucky you're not
doing that over here.

125
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:50,129
In the ocean.

126
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,007
Or else.

127
00:04:51,338 --> 00:04:52,677
Or I would stop you.

128
00:04:52,881 --> 00:04:54,337
For God sake, help !

129
00:04:54,715 --> 00:04:55,813
Do something !

130
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:59,233
Oh, if you don't like starfish,
you're gonna be

131
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:00,641
mad about what I just did.

132
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:02,402
Oh God, help !

133
00:05:02,806 --> 00:05:04,651
Are you in for now, budy ?
Now, I got like

134
00:05:04,796 --> 00:05:06,139
five fish coming to help.

135
00:05:06,938 --> 00:05:08,322
Oh, Oh ! Here they are !

136
00:05:08,549 --> 00:05:10,519
Help, he's hurting me !

137
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,927
Well, maybe you shouldn't let him on.

138
00:05:17,128 --> 00:05:18,574
Peter, what the hell is that ?

139
00:05:18,982 --> 00:05:20,553
It's a space shuttle Lois.

140
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:21,870
I thinking while I'm unlimited free

141
00:05:21,884 --> 00:05:24,055
gas I can finally afford to
go into space.

142
00:05:24,301 --> 00:05:25,935
Why is it everytime I open this

143
00:05:25,956 --> 00:05:27,757
door you seem to be in some ridiculous

144
00:05:27,777 --> 00:05:29,775
vehicule you inexplicably acquired.

145
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,185
I got this in a NASA auction for
next to nothing.

146
00:05:32,247 --> 00:05:33,515
They were gonna scrap it 'cause of some

147
00:05:33,529 --> 00:05:35,131
minor mechanical problems or some

148
00:05:35,146 --> 00:05:37,090
instead they sold it to me, very
simple explication.

149
00:05:37,263 --> 00:05:39,330
I do not want you trying to
fly that thing.

150
00:05:39,386 --> 00:05:40,989
You're not even a trained astronaute.

151
00:05:41,156 --> 00:05:42,868
Relax Lois, nothing bad ever

152
00:05:42,883 --> 00:05:44,124
happened to space shuttles.

153
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:45,452
Now stand back.

154
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm back from space everybody.

155
00:06:00,147 --> 00:06:01,470
You got lucky Peter.

156
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,708
How was it dad ?

157
00:06:02,828 --> 00:06:04,347
Oh, mind-boggling Chris.

158
00:06:04,386 --> 00:06:06,268
Barreling around the earth at five miles

159
00:06:06,304 --> 00:06:07,978
per second, watching the sunrise

160
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,280
over the sea at Japan,
it's indescribable.

161
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,550
Plus I had lot of time to rub one out

162
00:06:12,568 --> 00:06:13,784
which in space is great.

163
00:06:13,954 --> 00:06:15,121
Except after a while it's like

164
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:16,176
living in a snowglobe.

165
00:06:16,424 --> 00:06:18,407
Peter, instead of wasting your free gas

166
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:20,074
on a series of commit extense.

167
00:06:20,091 --> 00:06:22,081
What don't you use it
more constructively ?

168
00:06:22,335 --> 00:06:24,358
I mean we can take a family vacation.

169
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:25,989
You got a great idea mom.

170
00:06:26,109 --> 00:06:28,163
Hey, maybe we can go to the
island from Lost.

171
00:06:28,238 --> 00:06:29,309
No, I don't want to listen to

172
00:06:29,325 --> 00:06:31,117
Matthew Fox's heavy breathing.

173
00:06:32,785 --> 00:06:33,247
Kate...

174
00:06:34,195 --> 00:06:35,276
You don't get it...

175
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,467
We are the island.

176
00:06:40,513 --> 00:06:41,809
Hand me that paper bag.

177
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:45,867
Jack, that's got my poop in it.

178
00:06:46,858 --> 00:06:47,600
I know...

179
00:06:48,182 --> 00:06:48,933
I know...

180
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:50,829
It's got a hint of coconut in it

181
00:06:51,415 --> 00:06:52,469
and something else...

182
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:54,692
But that's a part of the mystery.

183
00:06:56,341 --> 00:06:58,031
All on board for the Grand Canyon.

184
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:05,495
Oh, I know you're tired Stewie, but you

185
00:07:05,511 --> 00:07:07,068
can sleep all you want in the car.

186
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,331
Oh, 06:00 am.

187
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:11,580
I should no stay up all
night listening to

188
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,712
persian radio.

189
00:07:13,064 --> 00:07:15,189
That's was
Roxette with "You got the look".

190
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:17,645
got the look. It's 21 o'clock and

191
00:07:17,652 --> 00:07:19,688
still 27 centigrade out there.

192
00:07:19,728 --> 00:07:21,586
That's hot !

193
00:07:21,706 --> 00:07:23,559
So, if you're cruising
along the lest side

194
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:25,406
of the road at a 120 km/h

195
00:07:25,432 --> 00:07:27,747
in the desert.

196
00:07:27,777 --> 00:07:29,158
turn up the decibels.

197
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,909
'Cause it's on 103.2

198
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,368
What with all those birds ?

199
00:07:38,415 --> 00:07:39,866
My tropical bird collection.

200
00:07:39,924 --> 00:07:41,913
- Just in case.
- Just in case what ?

201
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:44,185
We're not going to need
a dozen tropical birds.

202
00:07:44,237 --> 00:07:45,692
Oh, I was not aware that

203
00:07:45,736 --> 00:07:47,036
you could see the future Lois.

204
00:07:47,156 --> 00:07:49,031
Can I go ahead and get tomorrows
lottery number ?

205
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,230
Stupid women.

206
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:53,089
Peter, you're not puting
those bird on the car.

207
00:07:53,971 --> 00:07:55,777
Well then, I guess we're not
going on vacation.

208
00:07:56,728 --> 00:07:58,372
Good, then I'm going back to bed.

209
00:07:59,826 --> 00:08:02,421
Alright Peter, you can bring
these stupid birds.

210
00:08:02,471 --> 00:08:04,303
Yeah ! You let me be myself !

211
00:08:04,423 --> 00:08:05,519
Alright everybody, let's go.

212
00:08:07,847 --> 00:08:09,600
Alright everybody, off we go.

213
00:08:09,636 --> 00:08:11,474
We're gonna have such a great time.

214
00:08:12,146 --> 00:08:12,562
Hello ?

215
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:13,703
Hi Peter, what's up ?

216
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,308
Oh hey Quagmire. Just taking the

217
00:08:15,323 --> 00:08:16,944
family on vacation.
- Oh that's good.

218
00:08:17,103 --> 00:08:18,660
Oh hang on a second I'm
stuck behind some

219
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,173
fat ass driven too slow.

220
00:08:20,193 --> 00:08:21,345
Come on stupid, move it !

221
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,712
Oh hang on Quadmire, some jerk

222
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,175
behind me is honking his horn.

223
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,494
Oh you should totally flip him off.

224
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,869
Oh hang on a sec, some fat-ass
just flipped me off.

225
00:08:28,951 --> 00:08:30,144
Hey up yours you jerk !

226
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:32,972
Hang on Quagmire, I gotta
kick this guy's ass.

227
00:08:32,996 --> 00:08:34,437
Yeah, I'm gonna kick this guy's ass.

228
00:08:34,461 --> 00:08:35,718
Hey, I call you back after the fight.

229
00:08:35,786 --> 00:08:36,395
Yeah, me too.

230
00:08:36,442 --> 00:08:37,272
Good luck in yours.

231
00:08:37,313 --> 00:08:38,125
Good luck in yours.

232
00:08:48,303 --> 00:08:50,196
Lois ? I'm awake lois.

233
00:08:50,993 --> 00:08:51,620
Lois !

234
00:08:52,884 --> 00:08:53,429
Lois ?

235
00:08:54,237 --> 00:08:55,571
Where the devil is everyone ?

236
00:08:55,932 --> 00:08:57,048
This place is more deserted than

237
00:08:57,071 --> 00:08:58,985
James Gandolfini work out room.

238
00:09:08,462 --> 00:09:10,428
Just waiting for my breakfast.

239
00:09:11,565 --> 00:09:12,263
Lois !

240
00:09:13,128 --> 00:09:14,714
I know how to get her attention.

241
00:09:16,257 --> 00:09:17,081
Lois ?

242
00:09:17,163 --> 00:09:19,110
I'm about to drink my first soda.

243
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,455
Better come stop me.

244
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:23,186
Hm, that must be the sugar.

245
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:25,039
Oh, God that's good !

246
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:29,194
Ruppert, suddently I want
to run ! Chase me !

247
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,558
Oh, now I'm sad.

248
00:09:43,258 --> 00:09:44,544
Brian, do me a favor and check

249
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,720
on Stewie, would you ?

250
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,614
He's fine.

251
00:09:46,734 --> 00:09:48,728
Hey, what do you say we sing
a driven song ?

252
00:09:49,336 --> 00:09:57,612
Some say love it is a river

253
00:09:57,909 --> 00:10:04,299
that drowns the tender reed

254
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:12,845
Some say love it is a razor

255
00:10:12,965 --> 00:10:19,885
that leaves your soul to bleed

256
00:10:20,005 --> 00:10:28,116
When the night has been too lonely

257
00:10:28,152 --> 00:10:35,220
and the road has been too long

258
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:43,332
and you think that love is only

259
00:10:43,361 --> 00:10:50,497
for the lucky and the strong

260
00:10:50,518 --> 00:10:54,274
Just remember

261
00:10:54,309 --> 00:11:06,083
in the winterfar beneath
the bitter snows

262
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:09,423
lies the seed

263
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:13,719
that with the sun's love

264
00:11:13,755 --> 00:11:16,716
in the spring

265
00:11:16,836 --> 00:11:24,180
becomes the rose

266
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:28,631
Okay, that was good, that was good.

267
00:11:28,677 --> 00:11:30,457
Chris I think you were
a little early at the start

268
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,715
of buff four.

269
00:11:31,869 --> 00:11:33,286
I don't know how that's sound
from your end.

270
00:11:33,356 --> 00:11:34,956
Sound great out there, you
want another ?

271
00:11:35,076 --> 00:11:36,512
No, if that works for you, we're fine.

272
00:11:36,574 --> 00:11:37,574
All good on my end.

273
00:11:37,694 --> 00:11:38,614
Alright, that's a take.

274
00:11:41,963 --> 00:11:43,248
There's no sign of them anywhere.

275
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:44,280
Meg ?

276
00:11:44,742 --> 00:11:45,393
Chris ?

277
00:11:45,983 --> 00:11:46,774
Brian ?

278
00:11:47,543 --> 00:11:48,154
They're gone.

279
00:11:48,665 --> 00:11:49,921
I'm all alone.

280
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,901
I can do whatever I want !

281
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,609
I'm gonna take Brian's novel

282
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,584
and replace every use of the word "and"

283
00:11:56,602 --> 00:11:57,631
with the word "fart".

284
00:11:59,227 --> 00:12:00,754
The young soldier fart his

285
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:01,886
brother look at each other.

286
00:12:02,281 --> 00:12:03,969
Fart both knew that with love,

287
00:12:04,051 --> 00:12:05,941
fart true, fart courage,

288
00:12:05,985 --> 00:12:08,490
they will both emerge to farting
on their feet.

289
00:12:09,182 --> 00:12:10,169
Oh, that one didn't work.

290
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,780
Well, let see what fascinating

291
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:16,080
puberty treasure Chris has
got in the way.

292
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:18,692
Oh, Oslo magasine.

293
00:12:18,997 --> 00:12:21,047
I finally get to see what
a vagina looks.

294
00:12:21,447 --> 00:12:22,574
Oh God, oh my God !

295
00:12:22,615 --> 00:12:23,421
Oh my God !

296
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:28,814
You...

297
00:12:28,989 --> 00:12:30,036
can't hurt...

298
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:31,201
anyone...

299
00:12:31,488 --> 00:12:32,631
anymore...

300
00:12:38,635 --> 00:12:39,785
Why are we in New York ?

301
00:12:39,981 --> 00:12:41,764
I thought we were going to
the Grand Canyon.

302
00:12:41,924 --> 00:12:43,301
Well, i just thought we should stop and

303
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,375
pay our respects.

304
00:12:46,856 --> 00:12:48,156
Ground zero.

305
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,093
So this is where the first

306
00:12:50,124 --> 00:12:51,211
guy got AIDS.

307
00:12:51,277 --> 00:12:53,076
Peter, this is the site of the 9/11

308
00:12:53,087 --> 00:12:54,098
terrorist attacks.

309
00:12:54,252 --> 00:12:56,466
-Oh, so Saddam Hussein did this?
- No.

310
00:12:56,524 --> 00:12:57,750
- The Iraqi army ?
- No.

311
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,149
- Some guys from Irak ?
- No.

312
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,558
That one lady who visited Iraq

313
00:13:00,588 --> 00:13:02,661
that one time ?
- No, Peter, Irak had nothing to

314
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:03,746
do with this, it was a bunch of

315
00:13:03,758 --> 00:13:05,629
Saudi Arabians, Lebanese, and Egyptians

316
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,750
financed by a Saudi Arabian
guy living in

317
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,685
Afghanistan and sheltered by Pakistanis.

318
00:13:10,292 --> 00:13:12,608
So, you're saying we
need to invade Iran?

319
00:13:15,502 --> 00:13:17,173
Wake up Stewie.

320
00:13:17,248 --> 00:13:20,574
Let's get you out of that sit
into a fresh diaper

321
00:13:20,721 --> 00:13:21,405
Oh my God.

322
00:13:21,786 --> 00:13:23,738
Peter ! Stewie's not in the car.

323
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,792
Oh my God, we must let him at home !

324
00:13:25,994 --> 00:13:27,670
Oh my God, that...

325
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:28,770
is...

326
00:13:29,082 --> 00:13:30,632
hilarious... He is

327
00:13:30,647 --> 00:13:32,019
probably freaking out.

328
00:13:32,033 --> 00:13:33,836
God ! I'll give anything to see his

329
00:13:33,859 --> 00:13:35,129
face right now.

330
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,503
He's probably all like

331
00:13:36,532 --> 00:13:38,279
"Where the deuce is everyone ?"

332
00:13:38,288 --> 00:13:40,085
Well, I can't, I can't really
do a good Stewie.

333
00:13:40,293 --> 00:13:42,371
Oh my God, what kind of a mother am I ?

334
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:44,430
Peter, we gotta go home right now.

335
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,542
Oh great Lois, now we got
a bail on the all

336
00:13:46,572 --> 00:13:48,093
vacation. This sucks.

337
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,106
Now everytime I come back to this

338
00:13:50,126 --> 00:13:51,915
place it's gonna be associated with one

339
00:13:51,927 --> 00:13:53,240
particular bad memory.

340
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,362
Well, actually we could call
Quagmire and Cleveland.

341
00:13:55,576 --> 00:13:56,827
They'll go and check on Stewie.

342
00:13:57,027 --> 00:13:59,290
They'll probably willing to look after
him 'till we get home.

343
00:13:59,465 --> 00:14:00,066
Well,

344
00:14:00,437 --> 00:14:02,114
okay, I guess so.

345
00:14:02,171 --> 00:14:04,415
Yeah, Quagmire and Cleveland
are great with kids.

346
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,253
Like Robin Williams in Patch Adams.

347
00:14:07,082 --> 00:14:08,590
Everybody's lying around in here.

348
00:14:08,611 --> 00:14:10,153
Liar, liar ! Pants on fire !

349
00:14:10,176 --> 00:14:11,401
Where am I, in Congress ?

350
00:14:11,478 --> 00:14:13,202
See ? Laugh is the best medicine.

351
00:14:13,491 --> 00:14:16,561
Please Sir, I'm in so much pain.

352
00:14:16,578 --> 00:14:17,868
Shut up and listen to my material.

353
00:14:18,101 --> 00:14:18,928
Uh, what's this ?

354
00:14:19,096 --> 00:14:20,154
Bedpan, Peter pan.

355
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,347
Oh, next stop is Neverland.

356
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,405
Come Wendy, fly with me !

357
00:14:29,051 --> 00:14:30,007
I never executed a

358
00:14:30,034 --> 00:14:31,040
diaper change before.

359
00:14:31,345 --> 00:14:32,547
Of course, how hard can it be ?

360
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,310
You just unface this things,

361
00:14:34,324 --> 00:14:36,021
then lay back with
your legs on the air

362
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,230
and let nature do the rest.

363
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:40,972
It's still there.

364
00:14:41,405 --> 00:14:42,714
Usually the doody disappear

365
00:14:42,743 --> 00:14:43,710
by now but it hasn't.

366
00:14:45,303 --> 00:14:45,938
Intruders !

367
00:14:46,358 --> 00:14:47,981
Stewie, you in there ?

368
00:14:52,366 --> 00:14:52,984
You think he's here ?

369
00:14:56,734 --> 00:14:58,679
Oh God it's Cleveland and Bob Hope.

370
00:14:58,945 --> 00:15:00,097
Oh well, the damage's done.

371
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:01,157
Better get them out of here.

372
00:15:01,605 --> 00:15:03,236
Perhaps I'd shackle them in the basement

373
00:15:03,257 --> 00:15:05,275
with the twenty-four hours
broadcast of the direct

374
00:15:05,316 --> 00:15:06,561
tv help channel.

375
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:08,921
What the hell ?

376
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:09,893
Where are we ?

377
00:15:10,436 --> 00:15:11,549
Getting to know your remote is

378
00:15:11,604 --> 00:15:12,895
easier than you might think.

379
00:15:13,134 --> 00:15:15,117
These buttons at the top control volume,

380
00:15:15,396 --> 00:15:15,867
channel,

381
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,557
and the power on your receiver.

382
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,033
To see what else is playing,

383
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:20,120
just press "Guide"

384
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,996
and then scrow through the
unscreen menu by

385
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:23,103
pushing the arrow button.

386
00:15:24,378 --> 00:15:25,749
This maybe kind of messed up but

387
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:27,986
am I the only one getting a
boner right now ?

388
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,147
Is there anything that doesn't

389
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,441
give you a boner, Glenn ?

390
00:15:31,668 --> 00:15:32,916
People use the word rubbish

391
00:15:32,948 --> 00:15:33,894
When they mean garbage.

392
00:15:34,212 --> 00:15:36,165
- Really ?
- Yep, not even a wiggle down there.

393
00:15:39,307 --> 00:15:40,797
Peter, it's been eight hours and I

394
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,238
haven't heard back from
Cleveland or Quagmire.

395
00:15:43,456 --> 00:15:44,777
I even tried Joe.

396
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,324
This is my wheelchair !

397
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:48,552
There many like it but
this one is mine !

398
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:50,822
Without me my wheelchair is useless.

399
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:53,172
Without my wheelchair, I am useless.

400
00:15:53,891 --> 00:15:55,174
- Shut up !
- Okay.

401
00:15:59,008 --> 00:15:59,843
This sucks.

402
00:15:59,934 --> 00:16:01,463
I wanna see the Grand Canyon.

403
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:02,855
I'm sorry but we're not

404
00:16:02,888 --> 00:16:04,264
leaving Stewie by himself.

405
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:05,415
We're going home.

406
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:09,591
No way ! Those

407
00:16:09,605 --> 00:16:11,344
guys have a TV in their car.

408
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:14,475
They're watching Operation Dumbo 6

409
00:16:14,483 --> 00:16:15,507
with Don Knotts.

410
00:16:15,686 --> 00:16:16,947
Professor, you've got to empregnant

411
00:16:16,966 --> 00:16:18,644
this elephant to the entire

412
00:16:18,672 --> 00:16:20,033
species will become extinct.

413
00:16:20,207 --> 00:16:21,294
You mean I got to put this thing

414
00:16:21,384 --> 00:16:23,193
this thing in that thing ?

415
00:16:23,521 --> 00:16:24,944
Well, this is a job that

416
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:26,260
not worth the money.

417
00:16:26,704 --> 00:16:28,053
Peter, watch the road !

418
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,188
Lois, get off my back.

419
00:16:29,207 --> 00:16:30,639
Will you ? I'm trying to watch TV.

420
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:32,527
I swear to God, sometimes I think I

421
00:16:32,547 --> 00:16:33,844
had screw on picks one.

422
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:35,205
I mean do you have any idea...

423
00:16:45,307 --> 00:16:46,523
Hey crashie.

424
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,943
What are you doing down there ?

425
00:16:52,117 --> 00:16:53,687
Well Ruppert, we're out of food,

426
00:16:53,714 --> 00:16:55,383
diapers and just about everything else.

427
00:16:55,757 --> 00:16:57,175
wich means I've got to get a job.

428
00:16:57,687 --> 00:16:59,014
Otherwise we'll be in worst shape

429
00:16:59,076 --> 00:17:00,699
than Morbidly Obese Albert.

430
00:17:01,076 --> 00:17:02,541
Hey Morbidly Obese Albert,

431
00:17:02,661 --> 00:17:03,845
We brought you some chocolate.

432
00:17:03,994 --> 00:17:06,081
Uh, I can't eat those chocolates.

433
00:17:06,278 --> 00:17:07,982
uncounting my diabetes.

434
00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:10,163
Remember they had to take my foot.

435
00:17:10,792 --> 00:17:11,970
Look on the bright side.

436
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:13,811
Now you get your shoes half price.

437
00:17:15,684 --> 00:17:17,515
Maybe I'll have one.

438
00:17:22,377 --> 00:17:23,706
Welcome to the Mcburgertown,

439
00:17:23,721 --> 00:17:24,694
Can I take your order ?

440
00:17:25,006 --> 00:17:26,532
Stewie you've got to clean the bathroom.

441
00:17:26,687 --> 00:17:28,523
No, No ! I'm not going back in there !

442
00:17:28,601 --> 00:17:30,426
Stewie, I'm not giving you a choice.

443
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:31,923
You've gotta go clean that up.

444
00:17:31,991 --> 00:17:34,302
No, it was literally, only
on the floor !

445
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,472
Alright, there was not attempt
to get near the toilet.

446
00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:37,500
It's like they just...

447
00:17:37,878 --> 00:17:39,782
press their buttocks against the wall.

448
00:17:40,224 --> 00:17:41,641
The only part of the
floor that didn't have

449
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,534
poo on it was the part who
had a baby on it.

450
00:17:43,654 --> 00:17:44,193
Go !

451
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:49,595
Peter, did you get the train tickets ?

452
00:17:49,914 --> 00:17:52,043
Actually no Lois, there was a guy inside

453
00:17:52,056 --> 00:17:53,611
selling shower curtain rings, so I

454
00:17:53,629 --> 00:17:54,437
bought a bunch of those.

455
00:17:54,557 --> 00:17:56,671
Peter ! That's was the
last of out cash !

456
00:17:56,751 --> 00:17:58,298
These ones have helium
in them, so they're

457
00:17:58,356 --> 00:18:00,574
very light.
- You are unbelievable !

458
00:18:00,793 --> 00:18:02,676
The last four days have
been a living hell !

459
00:18:02,838 --> 00:18:04,001
Our baby is at home all

460
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:06,222
by himself yet of getting us home you've

461
00:18:06,272 --> 00:18:08,703
managed to make things
worse at every turn !

462
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,432
A monkey would be a refreshing

463
00:18:10,441 --> 00:18:11,493
step up from you.

464
00:18:11,535 --> 00:18:12,982
A monkey would talk less.

465
00:18:14,104 --> 00:18:15,971
Here's a little tip. If your instinct

466
00:18:16,002 --> 00:18:17,836
tells you to do something, don't do it !

467
00:18:17,985 --> 00:18:20,106
If your instinct tell you not to
do something, it's

468
00:18:20,278 --> 00:18:22,030
probably the right thing to do !

469
00:18:23,682 --> 00:18:24,456
You wanna hurt me ?

470
00:18:25,578 --> 00:18:27,072
Go right ahead, if it makes you
feel any better.

471
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,471
I'm an easy target.

472
00:18:29,186 --> 00:18:30,293
Yeah, you're right.

473
00:18:30,825 --> 00:18:31,704
I talk too much.

474
00:18:32,952 --> 00:18:34,370
I also listen too much.

475
00:18:35,394 --> 00:18:37,345
Oh, I could be a cold-hearted
cynic like you.

476
00:18:38,264 --> 00:18:39,773
But I don't like to hurt
people's feelings.

477
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:42,431
And you think what you want about me

478
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,535
I'm not changing.

479
00:18:44,155 --> 00:18:45,280
I like... I like me.

480
00:18:46,394 --> 00:18:47,554
My kids like me.

481
00:18:48,183 --> 00:18:49,466
My friends like me.

482
00:18:50,524 --> 00:18:51,529
'Cause I'm the real article.

483
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,413
What you see is what you get.

484
00:18:59,925 --> 00:19:01,317
Movie references.

485
00:19:01,618 --> 00:19:02,957
Guys, I found us a ride to

486
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,518
Quahog in the back of a truck, hurry !

487
00:19:04,758 --> 00:19:05,892
Oh, thank God.

488
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:07,729
Come on, let's head home
before Stewie gets hurt.

489
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:10,029
Like Fuzzy bear when he
went to South Arabia.

490
00:19:10,356 --> 00:19:12,218
Oh, it's good to worship Allah.

491
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:14,328
'Cause i used to worship Sama.

492
00:19:14,352 --> 00:19:15,333
Wakka wakka !

493
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:19,802
I once know a guy who was so arab.

494
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,264
How arab was he ?

495
00:19:22,275 --> 00:19:23,672
He was so arab that...

496
00:19:23,757 --> 00:19:25,184
everybody liked him and

497
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:26,814
there was nothing funny
about him at all.

498
00:19:32,235 --> 00:19:34,081
Stewie, can I see you in my
office for a second ?

499
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:35,997
Yeah, what's up Eric, everything ok ?

500
00:19:36,073 --> 00:19:37,336
Yeah, just come to my office.

501
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:40,938
Stewie, Joanna says she

502
00:19:40,949 --> 00:19:42,185
saw you sneaking food.

503
00:19:42,594 --> 00:19:43,991
Whhaaaat ?

504
00:19:44,111 --> 00:19:45,939
She said she saw you in
the back of the kitchen,

505
00:19:45,957 --> 00:19:47,226
sneaking a fish sandwich.

506
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:49,007
Oh come on, dude !

507
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:51,833
Yes, okay, but the thing was

508
00:19:51,855 --> 00:19:53,628
five minute past the throw up time.

509
00:19:53,748 --> 00:19:55,876
Well, beat as it may, Joanna took these

510
00:19:55,912 --> 00:19:57,119
pictures on her cellphone.

511
00:20:02,849 --> 00:20:03,566
You're fired.

512
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:08,606
We're broke Ruppert.

513
00:20:08,976 --> 00:20:10,965
I'm jobless, there's no food left.

514
00:20:11,199 --> 00:20:12,377
I'm out of diapers and I'm

515
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,844
down to Meg's last hat.

516
00:20:14,515 --> 00:20:15,602
We're doomed you know.

517
00:20:16,193 --> 00:20:18,339
Let it be writing on my tombstone
that my life

518
00:20:18,362 --> 00:20:20,034
was considerably better with my

519
00:20:20,046 --> 00:20:21,112
family around.

520
00:20:21,438 --> 00:20:23,157
And I didn't realized until it was

521
00:20:23,251 --> 00:20:23,925
too late.

522
00:20:33,463 --> 00:20:34,801
Mommy ! Daddy !

523
00:20:35,058 --> 00:20:36,395
Chris ! Dog !

524
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:38,162
Brian ! They're home !

525
00:20:42,257 --> 00:20:44,821
Oh mommy, thank God you're home !

526
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:46,981
Oh, Stewie my baby !

527
00:20:47,042 --> 00:20:48,234
I promess with all my

528
00:20:48,252 --> 00:20:49,987
heart that I'll never say or do

529
00:20:50,017 --> 00:20:51,554
anything bad to you for the rest

530
00:20:51,576 --> 00:20:52,470
of the evening.

531
00:20:53,032 --> 00:20:54,540
By the way, I disable the V-chip

532
00:20:54,573 --> 00:20:57,341
and I watched so much porn.

533
00:20:57,461 --> 00:20:59,044
Oh, sweetie I'm so

534
00:20:59,062 --> 00:21:00,296
glad you're alright.

535
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,310
Yeah, no thanks to Cleveland
and Quagmire.

536
00:21:02,567 --> 00:21:03,775

00:21:04,272 --> 00:21:06,266
