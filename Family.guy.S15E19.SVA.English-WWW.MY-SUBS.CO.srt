11
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:36,135
Ah, the water park.

12
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:37,770
Happy anniversary, Lois.

13
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,814
Everybody meet back here in six hours.

14
00:00:39,815 --> 00:00:41,533
I can't wait to get everyone else's

15
00:00:41,534 --> 00:00:43,661
body water in my mouth.

16
00:00:49,867 --> 00:00:51,552
Uh, where's the slide?

17
00:00:51,553 --> 00:00:54,320
Just eat this Starburst.

18
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:56,989
Wow, lemons, oranges, cherries.

19
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,044
So juicy!

20
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:03,296
I don't think that was a Starburst.

21
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:05,064
I think that may have just been acid.

22
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,467
Would you like to ride the
Skittles rainbow now?

23
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:08,735
Is it also acid?

24
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:11,404
My friend, I'm an adult who
works at a water park.

25
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:14,259
If I give you something, it's acid.

26
00:01:17,093 --> 00:01:18,711
No going down headfirst,

27
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,680
and wait till I say it's okay.

28
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:25,017
Go. Go. Go.

29
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,186
Hey!

30
00:01:26,187 --> 00:01:27,654
I'm gaining on you, Brian.

31
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:30,208
Meg, slow down.
You're coming way too fast.

32
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,728
Ew, Brian, what happened?

33
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,029
I don't know.

34
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,097
Hey, idiot,

35
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,951
you got to wait till the guy says go.

36
00:01:44,054 --> 00:01:46,540
Excuse me, do you think
you can help me out?

37
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:49,041
Sure, just let me do
an awkward, extremely

38
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,377
unattractive pool walk over to you.

39
00:01:57,368 --> 00:01:59,018
Hey, what's up?

40
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:01,020
My top came off on the slide.

41
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:04,624
I think I may have seen you
put it in your shorts.

42
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,559
Okay, well, here's my shorts.

43
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,646
Just fish out the one that's yours.

44
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,365
Thank you so much.

45
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:13,733
I'm Isabella.

46
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:14,967
I'm Chris.

47
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,403
Listen, my aunt is waiting for me,

48
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:19,873
but it was nice to meet you, Chris.

49
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:21,073
You, too.

50
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,575
Enjoy the boobs of your morning.

51
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24,076
Afternoon!

52
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,113
Enjoy the boobs of your afternoon.

53
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:31,751
My word, Chris, that girl
was totally into you.

54
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:32,919
You should ask her out.

55
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,221
Really? But what if she says no?

56
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:37,256
Hey, if you want something,
you've got to go for it.

57
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:40,326
Just like the fat man did
when he changed his name.

58
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:44,231
I'm looking for a Peter Ferrari.

59
00:02:44,232 --> 00:02:46,600
Obviously, that's me.

60
00:02:46,601 --> 00:02:49,936
Yes, there's a soiled
pair of Ferrari underwear

61
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:51,304
in the men's room trash.

62
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:52,605
Who took 'em out of the sink?

63
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:53,773
They were soaking.

64
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:54,941
Sir, I can't park this.

65
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:56,809
There's diarrhea all over the front seat

66
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,578
of your PT Cruiser.

67
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:02,315
Isabella, listen, I'm not great at this,

68
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:05,751
but...

69
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,086
Told you.

70
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:08,821
Also, I was wondering
if there's any chance

71
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:11,024
you'd maybe want to go
out with me sometime.

72
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:12,993
Oh, Chris, that's sweet,

73
00:03:12,994 --> 00:03:15,629
but I don't think you'd
want to go out with me.

74
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,699
- Why not?
- It's just that, well, I have kids.

75
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,301
Oh, wow. And a couple of cuties.

76
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,337
We got any teeth coming in?

77
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:26,772
Oh, oh, I think I feel something.

78
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,674
Please, please don't do that.

79
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:31,878
Hey, your aunt is
Consuela? Hi, Consuela.

80
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,513
- You two know each other?
- Oh, yeah.

81
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:35,882
"Lemon Pledge," "No,
no." All that stuff.

82
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,450
Is time to go.

83
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:39,452
Lemon Pledge, no, no.

84
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,387
See?

85
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,955
But wait, Isabella,

86
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,557
I don't care that you have kids.

87
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,058
I'd still like to go out with you.

88
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,394
Wow, that's really sweet, Chris.

89
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,729
Okay, you're on.

90
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,683
Here's my number.

91
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:56,636
Oh, boy, I haven't been this excited

92
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,704
since our trip to Philadelphia.

93
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,006
<i> Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

94
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:03,142
<i>Flight 427 to Philadelphia
has been canceled.</i>

95
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:04,362
Yay!

96
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:15,755
I saw<i> Lady and the Tramp,</i>
so I asked if we could

97
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:18,525
eat spaghetti in the
alley, but they said no,

98
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:20,927
because of all the
homeless masturbation.

99
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,095
Oh, I love that movie.

100
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,265
Chris, I'm having a really
nice time with you.

101
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,335
You are? Listen, this is probably lame,

102
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:32,505
but I learned a little
bit of your language,

103
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,508
and I just wanted to say...

104
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:40,780
_

105
00:04:40,965 --> 00:04:42,348
What language is that?

106
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,350
You're Korean, are you not?

107
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:46,852
No, I'm Mexican.

108
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,455
_

109
00:04:58,081 --> 00:05:00,700
Hey, Chris. Where are you off to?

110
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:02,068
Oh, Isabella's coming by,

111
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,903
and we're gonna take
the kids to the park.

112
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:06,939
Wow, you two are spending
a lot of time together.

113
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,941
Uh, are you sure you want to date a girl

114
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:12,145
who's... had so much experience?

115
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:13,412
What do you mean?

116
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,481
Like, maybe she's got some city miles

117
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,650
on her voo-voo.

118
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:18,284
Not to mention a couple of blowouts.

119
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:20,287
- Hey, Bri...
- Yup, I heard you.

120
00:05:20,288 --> 00:05:22,054
She's talking about her kids, Chris.

121
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:24,657
Oh, I don't care about that, Mom.

122
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,426
I just want to make sure you're
not getting in over your head.

123
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,395
Well, I'm sure someone's
already been in there

124
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:30,597
deeper than that, Lois.

125
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:33,332
Brian.

126
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,604
Oh, hello, Isabella.

127
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:39,672
Hi, Mrs. Griffin, Mr. Griffin.

128
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,141
Mr. Griffin's up here, sweetheart.

129
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:44,143
Well, I guess you two have fun.

130
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:45,929
Okay, bye.

131
00:05:47,965 --> 00:05:49,616
Look, I can see why you're concerned

132
00:05:49,617 --> 00:05:51,018
that Chris' girlfriend has kids,

133
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:54,253
but he's happy, and she
seems like she's into him.

134
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:56,823
Plus, she's... she's hot.

135
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:59,025
Yeah, she is.

136
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:01,879
I bit my lip off.

137
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:12,972
Go away, Mr. Herbert!

138
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:15,393
It's not me.
I'm in your closet.

139
00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:19,229
Isabella.

140
00:06:20,353 --> 00:06:21,681
Is everything okay?

141
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:24,217
Chris, I just wanted to say good-bye.

142
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:25,785
Wha-What do you mean?

143
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:28,154
I found out that I'm
going to be deported.

144
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:30,456
They're sending me back
to Mexico in the morning.

145
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:32,058
So, in other words,
this could have waited

146
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,292
till the morning?

147
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:35,361
I didn't want to leave
without saying good-bye.

148
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:37,196
But they can't send you away.

149
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:39,032
There's got to be something we can do.

150
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:40,633
Unfortunately, there's not.

151
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,802
But don't worry, I'm planning on

152
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:45,004
getting back into the
country as soon as I can.

153
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:46,073
What are you gonna do,

154
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:48,075
just leave the babies with Consuela?

155
00:06:48,076 --> 00:06:50,876
I wish I could, but she
works seven days a week,

156
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,378
between housekeeping

157
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:54,714
and being the new CEO of Yahoo.

158
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:56,816
Maybe we should improve
our business model.

159
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,919
No, no.

160
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,854
Improve our original content?

161
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:02,823
No, no.

162
00:07:02,824 --> 00:07:05,157
So we have no corporate identity?

163
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,660
We secondary e-mail people use

164
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:10,362
to sign up for porn sites.

165
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:13,099
So, are you taking your
boys back with you?

166
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,068
I guess I have no choice.

167
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:17,069
But I hate having to.

168
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,738
The whole reason I left Mexico

169
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:20,439
was to give them a better life.

170
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,908
Well, I could take them
until you get back.

171
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,377
I mean, I'm no expert
at this sort of thing,

172
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,847
but...

173
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:30,182
Wow, you're getting better at that.

174
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,202
But I can't ask you to
take care of my children.

175
00:07:33,234 --> 00:07:35,521
Isabella, I want to do this.

176
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,022
Chris, stop.

177
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,258
You would really look
after my kids for me?

178
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,027
Of course I would.

179
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:42,895
You're a wonderful man, Chris Griffin.

180
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:44,196
Thank you.<i> Gracias.</i>

181
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,149
I'll be back as soon as I can.

182
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:58,044
Don't worry, I'm gonna
take good care of you.

183
00:07:58,045 --> 00:07:59,980
I'm gonna call you "Juan,"

184
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:02,114
and I'm gonna call you "Two."

185
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:04,134
Good, he's been reading the book.

186
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:15,702
Uh, Dad, you're reading
the paper upside down.

187
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,288
Wrong again, idiot.

188
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:23,209
Chris, what are you doing
with Isabella's babies?

189
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,611
And why are you holding them that way?

190
00:08:24,612 --> 00:08:26,464
You'll hurt them. Where's Isabella?

191
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:28,299
She got deported this morning.

192
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,368
Deported? A-And she just
left her babies with you?

193
00:08:31,369 --> 00:08:33,470
Well, just until she can come back.

194
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,973
Chris, are you crazy?

195
00:08:34,974 --> 00:08:37,241
What makes you think you can
take care of two babies?

196
00:08:37,242 --> 00:08:39,310
I don't know, I've seen
her take care of them.

197
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:40,844
I see you with Stewie.

198
00:08:40,845 --> 00:08:42,980
Frankly, it doesn't seem that hard.

199
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,915
You just shattered her world.

200
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,550
<i>Shattered.</i>

201
00:08:46,551 --> 00:08:49,753
Absolutely not, Chris.
I will not allow this.

202
00:08:49,754 --> 00:08:51,655
Look, I made a promise to Isabella,

203
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:52,823
and I'm gonna keep it.

204
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,159
Now, if you'll excuse me,

205
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,093
these two need to eat.

206
00:08:56,094 --> 00:08:57,862
He bought a breast-feeding book.

207
00:08:57,863 --> 00:08:59,496
Someone may want to pop in on him.

208
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,498
There's no way Chris is
gonna be able to take care

209
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,833
of two babies.

210
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,268
Well, maybe he should
have thought of that

211
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:06,036
before he opened his slut legs.

212
00:09:06,037 --> 00:09:07,371
No, Peter, that's not...

213
00:09:07,372 --> 00:09:09,774
Anyway, we got to call Child Services.

214
00:09:09,775 --> 00:09:11,842
Lois, if you do that,
Chris will resent you

215
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,011
for the rest of his life.

216
00:09:13,012 --> 00:09:14,578
Then what do you suggest we do?

217
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:16,046
I say you let him try.

218
00:09:16,047 --> 00:09:17,948
Trust me, one day of
watching those kids,

219
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:19,217
and he'll want them out of here.

220
00:09:19,218 --> 00:09:21,252
All right, fine.

221
00:09:21,253 --> 00:09:24,088
Yes, taking care of
kids is a 24-hour job.

222
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:25,790
Like when I worked at
that all-night diner

223
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,058
from that painting.

224
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:30,853
They kicked me out of the
war for kissing a guy.

225
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:38,136
All right, guys, nothing
but the best for you two,

226
00:09:38,137 --> 00:09:42,540
so I got you all-organic,
non-GMO, no-hormone food.

227
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,241
That'll be $500.

228
00:09:44,242 --> 00:09:46,210
Ah, well, sorry, kids.

229
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,978
Looks like we're gonna
go to Jersey Mike's

230
00:09:47,979 --> 00:09:50,482
and hope that future
science will save us.

231
00:09:50,483 --> 00:09:54,251
Yay, we're jar people!

232
00:09:54,252 --> 00:09:56,655
Ah! Science, help!

233
00:09:56,656 --> 00:09:58,055
<i> Jersey Mike's.</i>

234
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,775
<i>Bring your girlfriend
with the fat ass in here.</i>

235
00:10:06,855 --> 00:10:08,272
Hey, guys, how about a little TV?

236
00:10:08,273 --> 00:10:10,175
We can watch a baby thing together.

237
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:13,445
<i>Baby Einstein, Muppet Babies.</i>

238
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,281
Uh, what's<i> CSI: Babies?</i>

239
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,216
What's this?

240
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:20,786
They can't solve this crime,
they're just frightened babies.

241
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:21,995
They don't even know it's a crime,

242
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,564
they just know their
parents aren't there.

243
00:10:23,565 --> 00:10:26,133
They're scared, now I'm
scared. Turn this off!

244
00:10:26,134 --> 00:10:28,369
Aah, that's not what I want!

245
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,822
Aah, I'm gonna go hide in my couch fort!

246
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:35,008
Is<i> CSI: Babies</i> over yet?

247
00:10:37,161 --> 00:10:38,513
Oh, hello, Consuela.

248
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:40,215
You must be here for the twins.

249
00:10:40,216 --> 00:10:42,348
No, no take babies.

250
00:10:42,349 --> 00:10:45,753
I have good news and<i> ay, ay, ay</i> news.

251
00:10:45,754 --> 00:10:48,822
Okay, give us the<i> ay, ay, ay</i> news first.

252
00:10:48,823 --> 00:10:50,992
Isabella no can come back.

253
00:10:50,993 --> 00:10:52,560
Stuck in Mexico.

254
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:54,762
The babies, they stay here.

255
00:10:54,763 --> 00:10:55,763
What?!

256
00:10:55,764 --> 00:10:56,822
What's the good news?

257
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,857
Good news is bus get new wiper blades.

258
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:01,926
No more "ee-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa."

259
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,696
"Ee-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa."

260
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:06,179
Well, these kids are not staying here.

261
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,415
You got to take them.

262
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,118
How can I take them...

263
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:12,439
when I was never here?

264
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:18,027
Wow, she's like the
Mexican David Blaine.

265
00:11:18,028 --> 00:11:19,528
Wait, is David Blaine Mexican?

266
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:20,928
He's something.

267
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:21,847
Peter, forget that.

268
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,183
What are we gonna do?

269
00:11:23,184 --> 00:11:25,150
Chris can't just be stuck
with these babies.

270
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,151
Why not?

271
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:27,720
I'm doing a great job.

272
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,956
I love Isabella and I love her kids.

273
00:11:29,957 --> 00:11:31,958
Chris, you're living in a dreamland.

274
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:33,959
How are you gonna support two babies?

275
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,962
I could just take some time
off school and get a job.

276
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:38,898
No, absolutely not.

277
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,466
Well, now-now hold on, Lois, hold on,

278
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:43,035
maybe Chris getting a
job's not the worst idea.

279
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,337
I mean, I made pretty good money

280
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:46,839
when I hosted that confusing game show.

281
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,241
All right, Phil, come stand
by me, it's Ashley's turn.

282
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:51,410
Ashley, go ahead, pick an
answer, find a question,

283
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:54,813
spin the table, and remember,
the clock is ticking backwards.

284
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,882
I'll pass?

285
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:57,916
Congrats, you win.

286
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,184
Sorry to see you go.

287
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,753
And, Phil, we'll see you tomorrow.

288
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:02,322
Well, that's all the time we have.

289
00:12:02,323 --> 00:12:04,390
For those of you playing at home, why?

290
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,558
And how?

291
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,558
Audience?

292
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,161
Why... and... how!

293
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:10,429
Stop that!

294
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,665
Forget it, I will not allow
you to drop out of school.

295
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,834
If Isabella can't get here
to take her kids back,

296
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,986
we'll just have to bring them to her.

297
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,738
What? What do you mean?

298
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,374
I mean we're going to Mexico

299
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,409
so we can give these kids
back to their mother.

300
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,444
Peter, back me up here.

301
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:27,846
♪<i> Let's get those kids
back to their mama.</i> ♪

302
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,552
Look how winded he is
from doing that one spin.

303
00:12:32,553 --> 00:12:35,221
Your
mother's right, Chris.

304
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:37,122
We're going to Mexico.

305
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,390
Oh.

306
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:39,993
I got to sit.

307
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,732
All right, we're off to Mexico.

308
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:48,434
If you kids are good,
we'll bring you back

309
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,102
a tangled marionette.

310
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,737
Is it gonna be a long trip, Dad?

311
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:53,272
No, not too bad.

312
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,875
Especially since we're gonna do
it to the wrong stock footage.

313
00:13:06,402 --> 00:13:07,904
Boy, what a trip.

314
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:14,326
Chris, are you sure this
is Isabella's village?

315
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,261
This place looks pretty rough.

316
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,729
Yeah, this is it.

317
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,820
<i>Santa Terrible.</i>

Isabella, I missed you so much.

<i>Ay,</i> Chris, I missed you, too.

324
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:34,447
Look, Isabella, you shouldn't be
separated from your children,

325
00:13:34,448 --> 00:13:35,981
so we've brought them to you.

326
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,567
We wish you all the best.

327
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:38,816
Say good-bye, Chris.

328
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,853
Mom, we can't just leave them here.

329
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:44,274
This is no place for
Isabella to raise a family.

330
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:52,499
Oh, you're right, Chris.

331
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,267
I didn't want you to have to
raise those babies yourself.

332
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:58,203
But as a mom, I don't know
if I can in good conscience

333
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,005
leave this family here.

334
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,708
We'll just have to smuggle
her and her babies back in.

335
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:05,178
Well, no one's better at
smuggling than El Chapo.

336
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:06,478
Maybe he can help us.

337
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,597
How are you gonna get El Chapo to help?

338
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:09,473
It's easy.

339
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,885
All you got to do is say
"dyed black eyebrows"

340
00:14:11,886 --> 00:14:14,153
into the wind, and he appears.

341
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:16,956
Dyed black eyebrows.

342
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:18,290
Can I help you?

343
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,025
Peter Gallagher?

344
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,059
Maybe I can help.

345
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,361
Mark Cuban?

346
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,639
Oh, we're getting all
the wrong eyebrow guys.

347
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,445
Mrs. Griffin, you would take the risk

348
00:14:31,446 --> 00:14:34,081
of smuggling me and my
children across the border?

349
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:36,084
But you could be arrested.

350
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:38,819
I realize that, but you
have just as much right

351
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,388
to a decent life for your
children as anyone else.

352
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:43,090
Now we just need a plan.

353
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:44,825
All right, what if we...

354
00:14:44,826 --> 00:14:45,826
run!

355
00:14:45,827 --> 00:14:47,495
Damn it, Peter!

356
00:14:47,496 --> 00:14:49,097
What about Quagmire?

357
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:50,898
He could probably get
his hands on a plane.

358
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:52,834
Lois, that's actually a great idea.

359
00:14:52,835 --> 00:14:53,850
"Actually"?

360
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,310
W-Why are you saying it like that?

361
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,604
And Quagmire owes me a
favor anyway, remember?

362
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,460
Last time he went out of town,
I sat on his eggs for him.

363
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,161
Peter, it's time for lunch.

364
00:15:03,162 --> 00:15:06,062
Sorry, Lois, can't leave the
eggs till Quagmire gets back.

365
00:15:06,063 --> 00:15:08,398
We're having sloppy joes.

366
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,152
Well, I guess I haven't seen
that mongoose in a while.

367
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:13,838
We're having sloppy joes.

368
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:14,839
Yeah, I heard.

369
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,107
Please say you got the onion bun...

370
00:15:16,108 --> 00:15:17,675
<i>We're having sloppy joes.</i>

371
00:15:17,676 --> 00:15:19,528
Mongoose!

372
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,597
Mongeese!

373
00:15:31,005 --> 00:15:33,824
Hey, just a heads-up, my
dad's friend, Mr. Quagmire,

374
00:15:33,825 --> 00:15:35,593
is gonna say a lot of stuff to you,

375
00:15:35,594 --> 00:15:37,594
and it's all gonna be disgusting.

376
00:15:37,595 --> 00:15:38,829
Hey, you must be Isabella.

377
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,464
I came as soon as I heard about you.

378
00:15:40,465 --> 00:15:41,833
And then I got on my plane.

379
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:43,200
All right.

380
00:15:43,201 --> 00:15:44,318
Hold it right there!

381
00:15:46,053 --> 00:15:47,604
Uh-oh. Somebody's coming.

382
00:15:47,605 --> 00:15:48,939
N-Now, hold on, hold on.

383
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,508
I put my business card in a
fishbowl at an El Torito.

384
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:52,769
This could be about that.

385
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,372
<i>Policía!</i> Put your hands up!

386
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,873
Is this about the raffle
for the free lunch?

387
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,809
Does it have to be during
the week, because I...

388
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:01,877
Aah!

389
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,780
Wait a second, are we being arrested?

390
00:16:03,781 --> 00:16:05,214
We've done nothing wrong.

391
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:06,648
We're not arresting you.

392
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:08,234
We're taking your plane.

393
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,507
And, Javier, get their
keys and take their SUV.

394
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,050
Ah, that stupid, fat guido.

395
00:16:23,051 --> 00:16:25,001
No, Peter, that's the wrong racial slur.

396
00:16:25,002 --> 00:16:27,770
No, I know, I was just
thinking about Snooki.

397
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:36,912
Boy, I can't believe there'd
be corrupt cops in Mexico.

398
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,348
Yeah, Donald Trump was right:

399
00:16:39,349 --> 00:16:41,917
his daughter is a hot piece of ass.

400
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,986
Uh, you guys, don't panic,

401
00:16:43,987 --> 00:16:45,954
but there's a couple
of coyotes over there.

402
00:16:47,857 --> 00:16:50,792
Oh, like<i> Coyote Ugly</i> with Piper Perabo.

403
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:51,928
Peh... I-is that it?

404
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:53,295
Peh-Peh-ree... Peh-ree-bow?

405
00:16:53,296 --> 00:16:55,931
Peh-Pera... Pera-Pera-boo?

406
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,099
Pera-boo? Say it with me.

407
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,700
Per-Per-a-bow.

408
00:16:58,701 --> 00:16:59,559
Is that right?

409
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,019
It's weird, but you remember.

410
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,020
You know? I guess...

411
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,396
I guess that's the point.

412
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,148
Do you think she's set for life?

413
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,942
Peter, we're about to die!

414
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:10,813
No, my babies!

415
00:17:10,814 --> 00:17:12,047
Get out of here!

416
00:17:12,048 --> 00:17:13,234
You leave them alone!

417
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,951
Ow!

418
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:16,985
Ah! Chris!

419
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:26,562
You guys, I've been bit!

420
00:17:26,563 --> 00:17:28,864
And it got away with my
friendship bracelet.

421
00:17:28,865 --> 00:17:30,732
You are a boy.

422
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:33,001
Chris, you saved my babies.

423
00:17:33,002 --> 00:17:35,003
Oh, my God, Peter, we did nothing.

424
00:17:35,004 --> 00:17:36,872
We're his parents and we did nothing.

425
00:17:36,873 --> 00:17:38,140
I know, but, wow,

426
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:40,242
did you see how Chris
took care of those kids?

427
00:17:40,243 --> 00:17:42,578
Up till now, the only thing
he could take care of

428
00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:44,146
was my traffic tickets.

429
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,748
- Name?
- Uh, Peter Griffin.

430
00:17:46,749 --> 00:17:48,150
Peter Griffin's here to surrender

431
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:49,885
for his vehicular manslaughter.

432
00:17:49,886 --> 00:17:51,186
What? No.

433
00:17:51,187 --> 00:17:52,406
I'm a good boy!

434
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:55,741
He is a good boy.

435
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:02,364
Oh, this is awful.

436
00:18:02,365 --> 00:18:03,732
Chris is injured,

437
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:05,576
and we're completely
out of food and water.

438
00:18:05,577 --> 00:18:06,201
I know.

439
00:18:06,202 --> 00:18:09,271
I'm so thirsty, I'd be willing
to drink anyone's pee.

440
00:18:09,272 --> 00:18:11,341
Not-Not yours, Chris or Peter.

441
00:18:11,342 --> 00:18:13,242
But, you know, you know, anyone.

442
00:18:13,243 --> 00:18:16,379
Mom, Dad, thanks for trying to help.

443
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,715
You know, I just wanted
to do the right thing,

444
00:18:18,716 --> 00:18:21,049
but now we're all gonna die.

445
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:23,118
Did-Did you gals hear my pee thing?

446
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,259
Time for clean getaway.

447
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,227
- Consuela?
<i>- ¿Tía?</i>

448
00:18:32,228 --> 00:18:33,729
<i>Ay,</i> thank God.

449
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,097
How did you find us?

450
00:18:35,098 --> 00:18:37,116
Babies' earring have chip.

451
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,037
Oh, well, this is great.

452
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,805
Can you help us get to the border?

453
00:18:43,806 --> 00:18:46,241
Oh, you already in United States.

454
00:18:46,242 --> 00:18:47,242
We are?

455
00:18:47,243 --> 00:18:48,978
Yes, this Texas.

456
00:18:48,979 --> 00:18:50,279
What?

457
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,147
S-So, wait, so we walked
right across the border

458
00:18:52,148 --> 00:18:53,423
and didn't even know it?

459
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:54,841
That is a problem.

460
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:55,926
Right?

461
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:58,153
I mean, politics aside,
we can all agree,

462
00:18:58,154 --> 00:18:59,806
that is a problem.

463
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,294
Thanks for the ride, Consuela.

464
00:19:05,295 --> 00:19:08,064
And thanks for talking us on
that little detour to Dollywood.

465
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:10,400
Was I right, or was I right?

466
00:19:10,401 --> 00:19:12,319
Yep, totally worth the extra two days.

467
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,305
Look, Chris, I owe you an apology.

468
00:19:16,306 --> 00:19:17,864
I didn't believe in you.

469
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,409
I was wrong to say you couldn't
handle the responsibility

470
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,010
of taking care of two kids.

471
00:19:22,011 --> 00:19:24,279
Y-You risked your life for those babies.

472
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,181
Well, I didn't want them to get hurt.

473
00:19:26,182 --> 00:19:27,316
That's right.

474
00:19:27,317 --> 00:19:29,117
Because you care about them,

475
00:19:29,118 --> 00:19:31,286
just like you care about Isabella.

476
00:19:31,287 --> 00:19:33,288
And if you want to continue to date her

477
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:34,823
and be a part of those kids' lives,

478
00:19:34,824 --> 00:19:37,292
I'd be just fine with that.

479
00:19:37,293 --> 00:19:39,027
Are you kidding? Screw that.

480
00:19:39,028 --> 00:19:40,929
Looking after babies is a nightmare.

481
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,847
Oh, you have no idea.

482
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,133
You know how many times I
had you kids in the oven,

483
00:19:45,134 --> 00:19:46,935
just daring myself to turn it on?

484
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:50,773
Well, thanks for trusting me
to figure it out for myself.

485
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:52,141
I love you, Mom.

486
00:19:52,142 --> 00:19:54,395
I love you, too, sweetheart.

487
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:03,051
Isabella, being with you
has been really great.

488
00:20:03,052 --> 00:20:05,054
But I think I realized my mom was right.

489
00:20:05,055 --> 00:20:08,023
I'm too young to be taking
on this much responsibility.

490
00:20:08,024 --> 00:20:09,558
I understand.

491
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:13,328
But I know someday you will
make an incredible father.

492
00:20:13,329 --> 00:20:14,496
Good-bye, Chris.

493
00:20:14,497 --> 00:20:16,250
Good-bye, Isabella.

494
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,341
Chris, time for dinner.

495
00:20:25,342 --> 00:20:27,175
We're having sloppy joes.

496
00:20:27,176 --> 00:20:28,510
Oh, boy!

497
00:20:28,511 --> 00:20:30,412
We're having sloppy joes.

498
00:20:30,413 --> 00:20:31,832
Yeah, I heard you.

499
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:34,717
Oh, dear God.

500
00:20:34,718 --> 00:20:36,084
Oh, they're all dead.

501
00:20:36,085 --> 00:20:38,353
No, please, no!

502
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:45,448
