<i>Is Netflix Streaming</i>

12
00:00:36,552 --> 00:00:38,079
<i>the right choice for you?</i>

13
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,814
<i>Well, if you like movies in HD,</i>

14
00:00:39,856 --> 00:00:42,016
<i>then frozen pixels, then HD again,</i>

15
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:43,918
<i>the answer is "yes."</i>

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,788
<i>And if you love the golden
year of movies, 2003,</i>

17
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,690
<i>then we might have some of
what you're looking for.</i>

18
00:00:49,732 --> 00:00:51,726
<i>Netflix Streaming:
buffer for 20 minutes,</i>

19
00:00:51,768 --> 00:00:55,553
<i>then watch 35 minutes of a
movie with Jason Statham.</i>

20
00:00:55,904 --> 00:00:57,543
Oh, look what came,

21
00:00:57,585 --> 00:00:59,712
the free DVD from my PBS pledge.

22
00:00:59,754 --> 00:01:01,567
Whatever it is, we're not watching it.

23
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:02,752
Peter, trust me,

24
00:01:02,794 --> 00:01:05,155
you of all people could really
learn something from this.

25
00:01:05,197 --> 00:01:07,724
It's a documentary about
the food industry called,

26
00:01:07,766 --> 00:01:09,259
<i>Food Kills.</i>

27
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:11,561
Huh. Says here that
<i>Colon Health Magazine</i>

28
00:01:11,603 --> 00:01:12,953
gave it two thumbs in.

29
00:01:20,963 --> 00:01:23,573
Hi, I'm Matt Lauer's
cousin, Stephen McCormick.

30
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:25,241
Our moms are sisters.

31
00:01:25,283 --> 00:01:27,777
America is gorging itself
on processed food,

32
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:29,612
creating an obesity epidemic.

33
00:01:29,654 --> 00:01:31,281
We've abandoned natural foods

34
00:01:31,323 --> 00:01:33,783
for chemicals, additives
and refined sugars.

35
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:37,020
At this rate, this is what
the future will look like.

36
00:01:37,062 --> 00:01:38,722
<i>Those are flying cars,</i>

37
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:40,924
<i>but the people in them are too fat.</i>

38
00:01:40,966 --> 00:01:43,793
Oh, no, I left my baby in there.

39
00:01:43,835 --> 00:01:45,695
Without drastic changes in our diet,

40
00:01:45,737 --> 00:01:48,131
Americans are headed for
a health catastrophe.

41
00:01:48,173 --> 00:01:50,200
For more, go to our website at

42
00:01:50,242 --> 00:01:53,103
"double-u double-u
double-u dot PBS dot com."

43
00:01:53,145 --> 00:01:55,405
That's "www" dot,

44
00:01:55,447 --> 00:01:57,273
the word "double-u" three times,

45
00:01:57,315 --> 00:01:59,309
the word "dot," "PBS,"

46
00:01:59,351 --> 00:02:00,910
the word "dot" again,

47
00:02:00,952 --> 00:02:03,146
the word "com," dot com.

48
00:02:03,188 --> 00:02:06,583
There was a miscommunication
when we registered our website.

49
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,218
Well, that's it, from now on,

50
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,919
we're eating healthy around here.

51
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:11,900
We're gonna feel better and
we're gonna look better.

52
00:02:11,942 --> 00:02:14,557
Well, looking better doesn't
always solve your problems, Lois.

53
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:17,174
It sure didn't work for Droopy
Dog when he got that facelift.

54
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:21,297
Contrary to my appearance,
I'm still not happy.

55
00:02:21,339 --> 00:02:26,302
Please study my brain so that
others don't suffer as I have.

56
00:02:37,886 --> 00:02:40,150
Thanks for coming to my
birthday party, you guys.

57
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:42,352
And Esther, I'm so sorry
you ripped your perineum

58
00:02:42,394 --> 00:02:43,853
doing the Hokey Pokey.

59
00:02:43,895 --> 00:02:46,062
That's okay, I got free curly fries.

60
00:02:46,104 --> 00:02:48,258
Okay, let's see what Meg got me.

61
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,460
A crock pot?

62
00:02:50,502 --> 00:02:52,762
Things about to get crazy!

63
00:02:52,804 --> 00:02:55,359
You can cook a pork
tenderloin under your bed.

64
00:02:55,401 --> 00:02:56,696
Excuse me, girls.

65
00:02:56,738 --> 00:02:58,892
We're about to start
roller derby in a minute.

66
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:00,437
Wait, wait.

67
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,671
You. What's your name?

68
00:03:01,713 --> 00:03:03,339
Me? Meg Griffin.

69
00:03:03,381 --> 00:03:04,631
Would you mind standing up?

70
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:07,844
Whoa! What-what-what are you doing?

71
00:03:07,886 --> 00:03:09,145
My God.

72
00:03:09,187 --> 00:03:10,380
The magic ratio.

73
00:03:10,422 --> 00:03:11,681
What's that?

74
00:03:11,723 --> 00:03:13,116
It means your ankles, calves, and thighs

75
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:15,018
are all the same thickness.

76
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,351
How would you like to try out
for the roller derby team?

77
00:03:17,393 --> 00:03:18,355
Really?

78
00:03:18,397 --> 00:03:20,723
- Do it, Meg.
- Yeah, Meg. You should totally do it.

79
00:03:20,765 --> 00:03:22,492
Meg's talking to a boy!

80
00:03:22,534 --> 00:03:24,678
Okay, sure. What the heck?

81
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,429
Here. Take my card.

82
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:28,832
"I am a registered sex offender."

83
00:03:28,874 --> 00:03:30,066
Flip it over.

84
00:03:30,108 --> 00:03:32,001
see other side."

85
00:03:32,043 --> 00:03:32,999
Give me that.

86
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,334
I'm the roller derby coach.

87
00:03:34,376 --> 00:03:36,206
See you at tryouts.

88
00:03:36,248 --> 00:03:37,907
I can't believe it, you guys.

89
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:39,242
This is the biggest surprise

90
00:03:39,284 --> 00:03:41,423
since the last M. Night Shyamalan movie.

91
00:03:41,465 --> 00:03:43,713
Two tickets for the M.
Night Shyamalan movie.

92
00:03:43,755 --> 00:03:45,942
Wow. Really?

93
00:03:50,913 --> 00:03:53,523
Hope you guys are ready
for a healthy dinner.

94
00:03:53,565 --> 00:03:55,758
I went to Whole Foods
today and got this recipe

95
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,279
from an extremely thin man
with a giant Adam's apple.

96
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:00,262
I hate that place.

97
00:04:00,304 --> 00:04:03,001
None of the cereals
are advertised on TV.

98
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:04,700
What's this stuff that looks like sand?

99
00:04:04,742 --> 00:04:06,302
It's quinoa.

100
00:04:06,344 --> 00:04:08,905
Nope, I don't eat foods that
sound like karate words.

101
00:04:08,947 --> 00:04:12,558
Well, according to<i> Food
Kills,</i> quinoa is a superfood.

102
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,545
It's very nutritious, and it
even helps keep you regular.

103
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:16,813
Lois, I have a system...

104
00:04:16,855 --> 00:04:19,115
I poop once a week for
an hour and a half.

105
00:04:19,157 --> 00:04:22,252
I wear a headband and it's
soaked when I'm all done.

106
00:04:22,294 --> 00:04:23,442
Mm.

107
00:04:23,484 --> 00:04:25,455
Wow, Lois, you know, this
is actually pretty good.

108
00:04:25,497 --> 00:04:26,789
Peter, you should try it.

109
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:28,182
Ugh. Fine.

110
00:04:36,158 --> 00:04:37,333
Peter, knock it off.

111
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,635
I can't help it!

112
00:04:38,677 --> 00:04:40,013
My body's rejecting it!

113
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:42,739
Name?

114
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:43,940
Quinoa.

115
00:04:43,982 --> 00:04:45,241
Mm-hmm.

116
00:04:45,283 --> 00:04:47,110
Sorry, sir, we're full.

117
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:49,112
Come on in, gummy bears!

118
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:51,748
Oh, you are looking fine tonight.

119
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,791
Mm!

120
00:04:58,553 --> 00:05:00,827
Thanks again for coming
and supporting me, Chris.

121
00:05:00,869 --> 00:05:03,293
No problem. And I'm gonna
take some pictures

122
00:05:03,335 --> 00:05:05,461
of the other athletes,
if you don't mind.

123
00:05:05,503 --> 00:05:06,996
You might not know this about me,

124
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:09,096
but I am a bit of a shutterbug.

125
00:05:09,138 --> 00:05:12,032
Okay, that's-that's all okay.

126
00:05:12,074 --> 00:05:14,228
All right, ladies, line up.

127
00:05:15,664 --> 00:05:17,307
How about we start with some warm-ups?

128
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:19,309
Bend down and touch your toes.

129
00:05:21,052 --> 00:05:22,512
"Memory card full"?

130
00:05:22,554 --> 00:05:23,970
Come on!

131
00:05:24,012 --> 00:05:26,516
Okay, now, last year we were tricked

132
00:05:26,558 --> 00:05:28,551
by a couch on a dolly with wheels,

133
00:05:28,593 --> 00:05:31,354
so if any of you is a couch
on a dolly with wheels,

134
00:05:31,396 --> 00:05:33,480
I'm gonna ask you to please leave now.

135
00:05:36,552 --> 00:05:38,061
Well, we need five for a team

136
00:05:38,103 --> 00:05:39,362
and there's five of you here,

137
00:05:39,404 --> 00:05:41,231
so congratulations.

138
00:05:41,273 --> 00:05:42,966
Wow! This is awesome!

139
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:44,834
I can't believe I'm a Quahog Thug!

140
00:05:44,876 --> 00:05:46,336
When do we start skating?

141
00:05:46,378 --> 00:05:47,810
Here, look at the schedule.

142
00:05:47,852 --> 00:05:50,640
This is just a list of
Sexaholic Anonymous meetings.

143
00:05:50,682 --> 00:05:51,634
Flip it over.

144
00:05:51,676 --> 00:05:54,043
It says, "Remember to
attend your meetings."

145
00:05:54,085 --> 00:05:55,981
I'm gonna stop handing you stuff.

146
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,387
It's the middle of the night.

147
00:06:05,429 --> 00:06:06,656
Where are you going?

148
00:06:06,698 --> 00:06:08,324
I'm sick of all this healthy crap.

149
00:06:08,366 --> 00:06:10,660
I'm going downstairs to
find something good to eat.

150
00:06:10,702 --> 00:06:13,366
And then I'm gonna fall asleep
watching transvaginal mesh

151
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:14,774
lawsuit commercials.

152
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:19,135
There's nothing.

153
00:06:19,177 --> 00:06:20,394
Thank you, son.

154
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,213
What's going on, man, are you pregnant?

155
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:32,882
No, my wife watched
that food documentary.

156
00:06:32,924 --> 00:06:36,109
And you should never ask that
unless you're sure, by the way.

157
00:06:40,015 --> 00:06:43,993
Aw, yeah, peanut-butter-cup-
Dorito-sausage-car panini.

158
00:06:44,035 --> 00:06:46,562
And let's crack a Cadbury
Egg over the whole thing.

159
00:06:46,604 --> 00:06:49,015
Just gonna use my spare
glove-compartment-underwear

160
00:06:49,057 --> 00:06:50,817
as a napkin.

161
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:54,205
I can't believe Randy Quaid gets
to eat like this every day.

162
00:06:55,297 --> 00:06:56,822
Peter? Is that you?

163
00:06:56,864 --> 00:06:57,657
Cleveland?

164
00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:59,258
Are you cooking in your car?

165
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,533
I am.

166
00:07:02,071 --> 00:07:03,446
Is this because of<i> Food Kills?</i>

167
00:07:03,488 --> 00:07:05,214
Oh, you saw that movie too, huh?

168
00:07:05,256 --> 00:07:07,283
We watched<i> Tyler Perry's Food Kills,</i>

169
00:07:07,325 --> 00:07:09,619
which is the same movie except it stars

170
00:07:09,661 --> 00:07:11,054
black folks you've never heard of

171
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:13,389
and white folks you don't
hear from anymore.

172
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:16,626
But, yeah, now Donna is
forcing me to eat healthy.

173
00:07:16,668 --> 00:07:18,461
I always get confused,
is Donna the wife,

174
00:07:18,503 --> 00:07:20,063
or is Roberta the wife?

175
00:07:20,105 --> 00:07:22,389
I don't know, man, can I
have some of that sandwich?

176
00:07:24,633 --> 00:07:27,280
Oh, our hands just touched.

177
00:07:27,963 --> 00:07:28,907
Mm.

178
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,440
Wow, Peter. That's good.

179
00:07:30,482 --> 00:07:32,369
That's real good.

180
00:07:32,968 --> 00:07:34,788
I'm not sure what we're doing now.

181
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,879
Excuse me,

182
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:38,114
whatever you've got in
there smells incredible.

183
00:07:38,156 --> 00:07:40,583
Man, my wife won't let me
eat any of that stuff.

184
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,852
Tell you what, I'll give you
ten bucks for that thing.

185
00:07:42,894 --> 00:07:44,404
Yeah, me, too.

186
00:07:44,446 --> 00:07:45,922
Wow.

187
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:49,258
Huh, if I sell two
sandwiches for $10 each,

188
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,365
that equals...

189
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:56,816
money.

190
00:07:59,982 --> 00:08:02,872
Peter, you just made $20
from two sandwiches.

191
00:08:02,914 --> 00:08:04,474
Wow, you're right.

192
00:08:04,516 --> 00:08:06,342
Hey, maybe I could turn
this into a business.

193
00:08:06,384 --> 00:08:08,319
You know, selling sandwiches from a car.

194
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:09,979
Wonder how much I could make.

195
00:08:13,275 --> 00:08:16,386
♪ Mad world... ♪

196
00:08:16,428 --> 00:08:18,154
Whoops, I stopped thinking about math

197
00:08:18,196 --> 00:08:20,356
and started thinking about
baby-man Billy Corgan

198
00:08:20,398 --> 00:08:22,444
being sad at Disneyland.

199
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,170
Peter, what the hell is this?

200
00:08:34,212 --> 00:08:36,372
This, Lois, is my new food truck,

201
00:08:36,414 --> 00:08:38,508
specializing in all the
delicious, unhealthy foods

202
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,243
that you won't let me eat.

203
00:08:40,285 --> 00:08:42,512
'Cause you don't let me
eat what I want to eat

204
00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:45,181
and that... and, uh, I am super dizzy

205
00:08:45,223 --> 00:08:47,810
and there might be a gas
leak in this thing.

206
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:56,983
I can't believe you'd buy a food truck.

207
00:08:57,025 --> 00:08:58,845
What are you even selling?

208
00:08:58,887 --> 00:09:00,747
First of all, believe it, baby.

209
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:04,351
Second, uh, mostly hamburgers
where the buns is jelly donuts.

210
00:09:04,393 --> 00:09:07,487
And drinks where hot dogs is the straws.

211
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:09,055
Mm.

212
00:09:09,097 --> 00:09:11,157
Another milkshake, please.

213
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:12,492
Look, I'm happy for the business,

214
00:09:12,534 --> 00:09:14,694
but drinking that on your knees is...

215
00:09:14,736 --> 00:09:16,327
it's putting a hat on a hat.

216
00:09:16,369 --> 00:09:19,232
Look at this food. It's
gross and unhealthy.

217
00:09:19,274 --> 00:09:22,302
It's exactly the stuff I'm
trying to get you not to eat.

218
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:24,638
Yeah, but people like this
food. It makes them happy.

219
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,274
I mean, you can eat sprouts and
vegan crap your entire life

220
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,042
and still get devoured by Gremlins

221
00:09:29,084 --> 00:09:30,777
and-and-and none of it matters.

222
00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:32,879
So you're saying you shouldn't
take care of yourself

223
00:09:32,921 --> 00:09:35,181
because you might get
devoured by Gremlins?

224
00:09:35,223 --> 00:09:36,850
Get a clue, mama.

225
00:09:36,892 --> 00:09:39,185
Think of what you're doing
to your body, Peter.

226
00:09:39,227 --> 00:09:40,954
Oh, there we go.

227
00:09:40,996 --> 00:09:42,188
You think I'm overweight.

228
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,990
I know you're overweight.

229
00:09:44,032 --> 00:09:46,626
Hey, yeah, I'll have the,
uh, Swedish Fish Tacos.

230
00:09:46,668 --> 00:09:49,296
You want the can of chili
dumped on top or on the side?

231
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,797
What does the chef recommend?

232
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:53,233
Me? I like to squeeze the can so hard

233
00:09:53,275 --> 00:09:55,418
the chili flies into
my mouth like Popeye.

234
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,369
Do it up.

235
00:09:56,411 --> 00:09:58,338
You got it. Let me put on my bandana,

236
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,643
fire up my very loud "what"
generator, and get cooking.

237
00:10:04,586 --> 00:10:06,079
Peter, this isn't over!

238
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:07,671
What?!

239
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,356
Ladies and gentlemen,

240
00:10:16,398 --> 00:10:18,258
welcome to the first bout of the season,

241
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,695
the Quahog Thugs versus
the Medford Dump Cakes.

242
00:10:21,737 --> 00:10:25,098
This season we're brought to
you by Barry's Note Cards.

243
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,300
"When you need to remind
yourself of the sponsor,

244
00:10:27,342 --> 00:10:29,727
use Barry's Note Cards."

245
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:49,055
Nice move, Griffin.

246
00:10:49,097 --> 00:10:50,790
Way to go, Meg!

247
00:10:50,832 --> 00:10:53,259
Wow, newcomer Meg Griffin

248
00:10:53,301 --> 00:10:55,395
is lighting up the track
with some amazing moves.

249
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:58,922
"Amazing"? Damn right, amazing.

250
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,202
Make some noise

251
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:05,372
if you're mixing prescription
drugs with alcohol!

252
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:10,176
Wow. This is a lot more
physical than I thought.

253
00:11:10,218 --> 00:11:12,846
My favorite part of a
woman's body is haunches.

254
00:11:12,888 --> 00:11:16,149
And this is all haunch, baby.

255
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,643
Meg!

256
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:22,946
Boy, that was rough.

257
00:11:22,988 --> 00:11:26,393
This sport's even more
dangerous than skeet shooting.

258
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,594
Pull!

259
00:11:27,636 --> 00:11:29,453
I got in the wrong line!

260
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,969
That'll be $16.

261
00:11:36,011 --> 00:11:37,918
$16? That's expensive.

262
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,639
Yes, sir. Everything's very expensive

263
00:11:39,681 --> 00:11:41,374
because you're paying for it on an iPad.

264
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,343
Now, if you'll just select a gratuity.

265
00:11:43,385 --> 00:11:46,613
Options are 60%, 90%, and 200%.

266
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:48,581
Uh, I guess 60%.

267
00:11:48,623 --> 00:11:49,983
Okay, great.

268
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:51,918
And just sign by dragging
your bare finger

269
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,670
across this thing I use to masturbate.

270
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,522
Uh, okay.

271
00:11:55,564 --> 00:11:56,956
Thank you, please make sure

272
00:11:56,998 --> 00:11:58,491
to bang your head on
that low-hanging thing.

273
00:11:58,533 --> 00:11:59,993
What are you...

274
00:12:00,035 --> 00:12:01,294
Oh, you spilled something.
You want a napkin?

275
00:12:01,336 --> 00:12:02,796
Yes, please.

276
00:12:02,838 --> 00:12:05,189
All right, here's 40, blown by the wind.

277
00:12:12,114 --> 00:12:14,007
Oh, Chris, I'm glad you're here.

278
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:15,275
Swing that lamp at me.

279
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,309
But you'll get hurt.

280
00:12:16,351 --> 00:12:17,142
No, I won't.

281
00:12:17,184 --> 00:12:19,012
I'm gonna dodge it.

282
00:12:20,956 --> 00:12:23,016
Oh, my God, are you okay?

283
00:12:23,058 --> 00:12:24,517
Yeah, I'm fine.

284
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:26,586
This roller derby's
really toughened me up.

285
00:12:26,628 --> 00:12:28,868
I got to say, I've-I've
never felt better.

286
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:29,694
Really?

287
00:12:29,736 --> 00:12:32,492
'Cause I watched how rough it
was out there the other day,

288
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:34,332
and I got a little worried for you.

289
00:12:34,374 --> 00:12:36,429
I mean, all it would take is one bad hit

290
00:12:36,471 --> 00:12:37,866
to do permanent damage.

291
00:12:37,908 --> 00:12:39,532
I think you should quit.

292
00:12:39,574 --> 00:12:41,153
What? No.

293
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:43,263
No, I-I love roller derby.

294
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:45,556
It's the first thing I'm really good at.

295
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,441
Plus, I love making other women bleed.

296
00:12:48,483 --> 00:12:50,977
But you know, in ways besides the way,

297
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:52,545
you know, they normally bleed.

298
00:12:52,587 --> 00:12:54,023
She means periods.

299
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,416
Yeah, I got it, Stewie,
but I'm telling you, Meg,

300
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:57,693
something bad is going to happen.

301
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,555
Like when you give a young
athlete too much money.

302
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,516
I, I got to murder somebody.

303
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:10,899
Peter, kids, dinner!

304
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:14,445
Kids? Peter?

305
00:13:14,487 --> 00:13:17,003
It's time for a healthy, veggie dinner!

306
00:13:17,045 --> 00:13:18,738
Come on, I spent the whole day

307
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,575
making the house smell like farts.

308
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:22,600
Where the hell is everybody?

309
00:13:25,747 --> 00:13:27,714
All right, I got a bowl of cereal

310
00:13:27,756 --> 00:13:29,350
that's M&M's and Dr. Pepper?

311
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:30,376
Over here.

312
00:13:31,002 --> 00:13:32,311
Chris, put that down.

313
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,796
You kids get in the house

314
00:13:33,838 --> 00:13:35,555
and eat the healthy dinner I prepared,

315
00:13:35,597 --> 00:13:36,816
and Peter, you, too.

316
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,943
Shut down that truck and get inside.

317
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,027
Lois, I already told you.

318
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,996
I don't want to eat your
garbage food. All right?

319
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:44,081
Now can you go inside and
get me some Pop Rocks?

320
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,157
I'm making a paella.

321
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,567
You know what? Enough of this nonsense.

322
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:49,769
You love this truck so much, stay in it,

323
00:13:49,811 --> 00:13:52,206
'cause I don't want you or
your food in the house.

324
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,457
Fine. I love this truck.

325
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,608
I got everything I need in here.

326
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,236
Maybe I'll just live here.

327
00:13:57,278 --> 00:13:59,032
I can imagine it now.

328
00:14:01,923 --> 00:14:04,384
♪ Living in America... ♪

329
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,686
Whoops. I stopped
thinking about the truck

330
00:14:06,728 --> 00:14:08,588
and started thinking about Amazon woman

331
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,814
Brigitte Nielsen drunk
in a Burbank park.

332
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:35,615
All right, time to greet the day.

333
00:14:35,657 --> 00:14:37,751
Are you living in a truck?

334
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,420
Not bad. I see you got a
Hooters calendar in here.

335
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:41,855
How do you get anything done

336
00:14:41,897 --> 00:14:44,157
with those rocking
knockers staring at you?

337
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:45,692
Hey, who says I get anything done?

338
00:14:45,734 --> 00:14:47,727
Guy talk, guy talk. Yeah, guy talk.

339
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:49,929
Guy talk. This is how guys talk.

340
00:14:49,971 --> 00:14:51,398
Oh, Peter, this is awful.

341
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,632
Well, I love it.

342
00:14:52,674 --> 00:14:54,234
And I'm not going back in that house

343
00:14:54,276 --> 00:14:56,536
and listen to Lois tell me
how fat and unhealthy I am.

344
00:14:56,578 --> 00:14:58,304
You do look like you've put on a few.

345
00:14:58,346 --> 00:15:00,073
Your elbows are starting to pucker.

346
00:15:00,115 --> 00:15:01,925
Yeah, I mean, are you
really happy in here?

347
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,243
You bet I am.

348
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:05,263
I'm happier than a squash on Halloween.

349
00:15:07,015 --> 00:15:09,716
Dad, are they coming
to take us away, too?

350
00:15:09,758 --> 00:15:11,384
No, son, we're fine.

351
00:15:11,426 --> 00:15:12,770
How about on Thanksgiving?

352
00:15:13,295 --> 00:15:15,273
You know what, just enjoy the month.

353
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:31,771
You're going down, Griffin,
like my stepfather's pants!

354
00:15:31,813 --> 00:15:33,740
I guess I see where some
of your anger comes from.

355
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,269
Oh, no. This is bad.

356
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:46,352
That's it. I have to do something.

357
00:15:46,394 --> 00:15:48,421
Chris, what are you doing?

358
00:15:48,463 --> 00:15:51,324
Saving my...

359
00:15:53,602 --> 00:15:55,962
Oh, my God. Chris, are you okay?

360
00:15:56,004 --> 00:15:58,531
I don't think so. I'm hurt pretty bad,

361
00:15:58,573 --> 00:16:00,834
like that time I was
running with scissors.

362
00:16:03,345 --> 00:16:05,263
You run like a girl.

363
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,316
Run like a man, you get a suit.

364
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:16,916
Here you go. And if you'd
like to put your e-mail

365
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,418
on our sign-up list,

366
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,353
I'd be happy to sell
it to Russian hackers.

367
00:16:20,395 --> 00:16:22,188
Peter, Peter, it's happening.

368
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,990
What? The Bing Maps car.

369
00:16:24,032 --> 00:16:26,192
It's three blocks down and
it's coming this way.

370
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:28,728
Holy crap. This is the day
we've been waiting for.

371
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,497
We said we're gonna stand
in our front yards

372
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:33,166
and wave as it goes by so
we're on the street view.

373
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,034
We're gonna be on the Internet.

374
00:16:35,076 --> 00:16:37,170
Mort just called. It went by his house.

375
00:16:37,212 --> 00:16:39,339
Everybody, places! Start waving.

376
00:16:39,381 --> 00:16:41,432
This is not a drill!

377
00:16:46,061 --> 00:16:48,103
Damn it. I can't fit through the door.

378
00:16:48,145 --> 00:16:49,537
I'm stuck in the truck.

379
00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:50,950
What? What are you talking about?

380
00:16:50,992 --> 00:16:54,220
I knew this would happen.
You're too fat to get out.

381
00:16:54,262 --> 00:16:56,347
I see it. I see the Bing car.

382
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:00,927
Oh, my God, Bing! Bing! Over here! Bing!

383
00:17:00,969 --> 00:17:02,212
They can't see you, Peter.

384
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,630
You're facing away from the street.

385
00:17:03,672 --> 00:17:06,324
Stop talking, Quagmire. Just smile.

386
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:10,904
This is amazing.

387
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,438
Crap. Is it gone?

388
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,607
The driver nodded at me.

389
00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:17,277
I... I think I'm gonna cry.

390
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,579
Damn it. I can't believe I missed it.

391
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,214
Jeez, I hope I don't
end up stuck in here

392
00:17:21,256 --> 00:17:22,715
like Winnie the Pooh.

393
00:17:22,757 --> 00:17:24,517
Uh, Rabbit?

394
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,454
Perhaps you should push with
your shoulder and not your fist?

395
00:17:28,496 --> 00:17:30,381
Don't worry about it.

396
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,890
Hey, did that big "boomba
boomba" nurse come in here?

397
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,032
Uh, no.

398
00:17:39,074 --> 00:17:42,063
But Dr. Hartman, is my
brother gonna be okay?

399
00:17:42,105 --> 00:17:43,403
That's her. That's her.

400
00:17:43,445 --> 00:17:44,438
Hi, Juanita.

401
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,856
Hello, Doctor.

402
00:17:47,116 --> 00:17:48,633
Was that weird? Was I just weird?

403
00:17:48,675 --> 00:17:49,576
Kind of.

404
00:17:49,618 --> 00:17:51,220
You don't know. I was fine.

405
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:54,948
Oh, Chris, I'm so sorry
you got hurt like this.

406
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,417
Roller derby was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

407
00:17:57,459 --> 00:18:00,821
I finally felt like I was good
at something, I made friends...

408
00:18:00,863 --> 00:18:03,757
but seeing you like this,
I realize you were right.

409
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:07,561
It's too dangerous.
So I'm going to quit.

410
00:18:07,603 --> 00:18:11,548
No, Meg. I got hurt because
I didn't belong out there,

411
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,599
but you do.

412
00:18:12,641 --> 00:18:14,334
I watched you skate.

413
00:18:14,376 --> 00:18:17,027
You found your calling
and I believe in you.

414
00:18:17,069 --> 00:18:19,473
Now get back to that
rink and help your team

415
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,642
win the championship it deserves.

416
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:25,187
Really? I will. Thanks, Chris.

417
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:28,148
<i>With the spirit in her heart renewed,</i>

418
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,451
<i>Meg returned to the roller derby arena.</i>

419
00:18:31,493 --> 00:18:33,253
<i>I think she did all right,</i>

420
00:18:33,295 --> 00:18:36,990
<i>but no one will know for
sure because halfway through</i>

421
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,992
<i>everyone stopped to watch some fat kid</i>

422
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:43,163
<i>who was killing it on</i>
Dance Dance Revolution.

423
00:18:44,807 --> 00:18:47,491
<i>Dance, you fat bitch.</i>

424
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:53,273
So tonight, we say to the
yellow-billed marsh finch...

425
00:18:53,315 --> 00:18:55,142
you're extinct.

426
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:57,477
But, right now, we're getting
word of breaking news.

427
00:18:57,519 --> 00:18:59,943
We go live to Tricia
Takanawa with details.

428
00:18:59,985 --> 00:19:02,316
- Tricia?
- Tom, I'm standing here

429
00:19:02,358 --> 00:19:04,384
outside a Spooner Street home,

430
00:19:04,426 --> 00:19:07,988
where a local business owner
has apparently eaten himself

431
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,190
into his own food truck.

432
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,894
Oh. It appears they've
finally removed the roof.

433
00:19:13,936 --> 00:19:17,164
Nobody look. This is a
private, gross matter.

434
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:21,301
Mr. Griffin, is this performance art

435
00:19:21,343 --> 00:19:23,870
or, uh, some sort of
political statement?

436
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,206
Well, I'm kind of ticked
about condoms in porn,

437
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,008
but this is unrelated.

438
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:31,345
Oh, hey, Lois. I guess
you must be happy.

439
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:34,214
Yeah, it's every girl's dream
to have her husband hoisted

440
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,049
out of a food truck in a horse harness.

441
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:39,522
No, look, I-I'm just
saying, you were right.

442
00:19:39,564 --> 00:19:41,522
I'm a big tub of lard,

443
00:19:41,564 --> 00:19:43,597
and you have every reason
to be ashamed of me.

444
00:19:43,639 --> 00:19:45,129
Ashamed of you?

445
00:19:45,171 --> 00:19:46,860
I-Is that really what you think?

446
00:19:46,902 --> 00:19:49,429
Well, yeah, you kept saying
how overweight I am.

447
00:19:49,471 --> 00:19:51,231
Peter, don't you get it?

448
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,201
I only wanted you to eat
healthy because I love you,

449
00:19:54,243 --> 00:19:56,579
and I'm concerned about your health.

450
00:19:56,621 --> 00:20:00,040
I want you around for
as long as I'm around.

451
00:20:00,082 --> 00:20:02,903
Really? Well, I love you, too, Lois.

452
00:20:02,945 --> 00:20:04,911
I'm sorry I was such a jerk.

453
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,839
I guess I could do without
eating so much junk,

454
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,550
but I could never do without you.

455
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:12,795
Oh, Peter.

456
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,188
Ma'am, please step back.

457
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,114
We have to wash him with a hose.

458
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,045
Guys, look! Look! The Bing car is back.

459
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:24,221
No. I'm not ready! I'm not ready!

460
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:30,103
<i>Inspired by his love for Lois,</i>

461
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:33,907
<i>Peter had steamed vegetables
and brown rice that evening,</i>

462
00:20:33,949 --> 00:20:37,577
<i>then ate like crap for
the rest of his life.</i>

463
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:41,448
<i>Nonetheless, he was
immortalized on Bing Maps.</i>

464
00:20:42,858 --> 00:20:45,685
<i>Fat people are amusing to me.</i>

465
00:20:45,727 --> 00:20:48,064
<i>Hang there, you fat bitch.</i>
