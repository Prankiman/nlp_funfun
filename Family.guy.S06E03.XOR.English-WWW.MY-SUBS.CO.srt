<i>We now return to Dr. Terry Fabulous,
homosexual gynecologist.</i>

5
00:00:37,767 --> 00:00:40,235
Okay, Mrs. Robinson, let's take a look.

6
00:00:40,477 --> 00:00:43,466
Ew, it looks like a sad, old man!

7
00:00:43,876 --> 00:00:46,913
Hey, check it out, you guys, I got a
new cell phone that takes pictures.

8
00:00:46,927 --> 00:00:49,400
Look, look,
I took a picture of Lois's poo.

9
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:53,308
Oh, that's hilarious,
you should e-mail that to me.

10
00:00:53,328 --> 00:00:55,350
Hey, did you guys see
the game last night?

11
00:00:55,364 --> 00:00:58,418
- Oh, yeah.
- That offensive line is outstanding.

12
00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:00,258
Yeah, you should e-mail me that picture.

13
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,603
Hey, boys!

14
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:03,361
What the hell are you guys doing here?

15
00:01:03,376 --> 00:01:05,943
Oh, we just decided to have
a little girls' night out.

16
00:01:05,957 --> 00:01:08,460
Yeah, you guys talk about
this place all the time,

17
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,361
we figured we'd give it a try.

18
00:01:10,388 --> 00:01:13,030
Bernice, we haven't really
been dating long enough

19
00:01:13,057 --> 00:01:15,770
for you to be hanging out
with my friends' wives.

20
00:01:15,797 --> 00:01:17,472
- Shut up, Cleveland.
- Okay.

21
00:01:18,155 --> 00:01:19,863
Oh, check it out, girls!

22
00:01:19,918 --> 00:01:21,472
Jukebox! Huh?

23
00:01:21,505 --> 00:01:22,982
Hey, you guys want to dance?

24
00:01:23,007 --> 00:01:25,081
- Yeah, totally!
- Hell yeah!

25
00:01:30,887 --> 00:01:32,701
Oh, my God, this sucks!

26
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:35,621
The Clam's the only place we got
to get away from the women.

27
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:38,792
This is a bigger disaster
than Jack Black's last movie.

28
00:01:38,897 --> 00:01:41,121
We now return to Jack Black in

29
00:01:41,145 --> 00:01:43,022
The Unconventional Butler.

30
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:45,521
Edgar, could you bring me some tea?

31
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,493
Yeah!

32
00:01:47,885 --> 00:01:49,531
Yeah!

33
00:01:49,548 --> 00:01:53,121
Wait a minute. Butlers are supposed
to be fancy and well-mannered.

34
00:01:53,136 --> 00:01:55,753
This guy's screaming and
waving his arms around!

35
00:01:55,765 --> 00:01:59,161
You're an old man!
You don't understand the young people.

36
00:01:59,177 --> 00:02:01,241
You're right. I'll change from now on.

37
00:02:04,176 --> 00:02:06,781
Oh my God, that was so much fun!

38
00:02:06,818 --> 00:02:09,901
You know, boys, we just might make this
at regular thought.

39
00:02:13,406 --> 00:02:14,223
Peter.

40
00:02:14,558 --> 00:02:15,343
Peter?

41
00:02:15,366 --> 00:02:18,742
Yeah, sorry Joe, I just had
one of my Scrubs fantasy moments.

42
00:02:18,756 --> 00:02:20,441
It's the best show you're not watching.

43
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:24,561
I hate shows that cut away
from the story for some bullcrap.

44
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:30,821
Fellas, our way of life
is being threatened

45
00:02:30,836 --> 00:02:32,453
and we got to do something about it.

46
00:02:32,465 --> 00:02:34,482
Couldn't we just ask the women to leave?

47
00:02:34,508 --> 00:02:35,161
No, no.

48
00:02:35,176 --> 00:02:38,730
I got something way more expensive
and time-consuming in mind.

49
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:40,091
Well men,

50
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,380
the Quahog Men's Club is complete.

51
00:02:42,978 --> 00:02:45,581
It took six weeks and cost $8,000,

52
00:02:45,615 --> 00:02:46,741
but it was worth it.

53
00:02:46,935 --> 00:02:50,451
Peter, I wish you'd get rid of
this thing. It's an absolute eye sore.

54
00:02:50,488 --> 00:02:52,702
What do you care, Lois?
You girls got the Clam,

55
00:02:52,718 --> 00:02:54,450
we got the Quahog Men's Club.

56
00:02:54,477 --> 00:02:56,062
Besides we not hurting anybody.

57
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:57,412
What are you talking about?

58
00:02:57,425 --> 00:02:59,980
You ripped a whole chunk of wall
out of the house!

59
00:03:00,217 --> 00:03:01,143
What is this?!

60
00:03:01,568 --> 00:03:03,391
There's something wrong with the house!

61
00:03:03,925 --> 00:03:05,801
I don't like change!

62
00:03:05,927 --> 00:03:09,373
Peter, you can't just slap together
flimsy structures in the yard.

63
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:10,693
Why not? Herbert did it.

64
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:13,351
Y-M-C-A

65
00:03:13,376 --> 00:03:15,101
It's fun to stay at the

66
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:17,833
Y-M-C-A...

67
00:03:23,385 --> 00:03:26,081
All right, Peter, this is a tough one.
All right you ready for this? Okay,

68
00:03:26,395 --> 00:03:28,362
would you have sex with Cleveland.

69
00:03:28,386 --> 00:03:31,172
if it meant you could have sex
with Angelina Jolie.

70
00:03:33,216 --> 00:03:34,522
Yeah, yeah, I'd probably do it.

71
00:03:34,537 --> 00:03:35,423
Hang on, hang on.

72
00:03:35,455 --> 00:03:36,432
Missionary,

73
00:03:36,456 --> 00:03:37,851
and you have to look him in the eyes,

74
00:03:37,865 --> 00:03:39,980
no closing your eyes
and pretending it's somebody else.

75
00:03:41,335 --> 00:03:43,733
- I think still yes.
- Thank you, Peter.

76
00:03:43,755 --> 00:03:46,351
All right, here's another one.
Who would you rather have sex with?

77
00:03:46,465 --> 00:03:48,613
A very pregnant Gina Gershon

78
00:03:48,647 --> 00:03:50,723
or Jenny McCarthy after a car accident?

79
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:52,000
Well, hang on, hang on...

80
00:03:52,037 --> 00:03:54,192
You know,
I know this is a men's club but

81
00:03:54,365 --> 00:03:56,273
why does it always have to be about sex?

82
00:03:56,506 --> 00:03:58,391
Okay, look,
how about this, how about this?

83
00:03:58,548 --> 00:04:01,132
Who would you rather start
a small business with,

84
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:03,181
Janet Reno after a safari,

85
00:04:03,198 --> 00:04:05,132
or the fat guy from My Name is Earl?

86
00:04:05,146 --> 00:04:06,753
That still sounds like a sex question.

87
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:07,513
It is not.

88
00:04:07,525 --> 00:04:09,511
Well, then, what the hell does
"safari" have to do with it?

89
00:04:09,527 --> 00:04:11,720
What's the guy from
Earl's credit rating?

90
00:04:11,726 --> 00:04:12,633
651.

91
00:04:12,677 --> 00:04:14,720
- That's not bad.
- Better than mine.

92
00:04:14,775 --> 00:04:18,231
Does he have an idea,
or do I have to come up with it myself?

93
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,472
He's got an idea,
but it's not quite there.

94
00:04:20,495 --> 00:04:23,463
I'd have to give it to Janet Reno,
'cause I've always had this business plan

95
00:04:23,475 --> 00:04:25,482
for a home delivery
of prescription medications,

96
00:04:25,496 --> 00:04:27,421
and that seems like
it's more her market.

97
00:04:27,438 --> 00:04:30,292
This is stupid!
I want to talk about vaginas!

98
00:04:36,765 --> 00:04:40,770
Well, I'd say the men's club
inaugural ball is a huge success.

99
00:04:40,786 --> 00:04:42,521
Hey, guys, let's play a party game.

100
00:04:42,547 --> 00:04:44,182
Let's go stand over near Brian,

101
00:04:44,195 --> 00:04:47,183
and we'll take a drink
every time he says "bonerific."

102
00:04:47,217 --> 00:04:49,393
- Bonerific?
- Yeah, it's his catchphrase.

103
00:04:49,418 --> 00:04:50,642
He says it all the time.

104
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:51,562
- Yeah, sure, I'm in.
- Okay.

105
00:04:51,576 --> 00:04:52,570
Yeah, let's do it!

106
00:04:55,235 --> 00:04:56,480
Hey, hey, Brian,

107
00:04:56,716 --> 00:04:58,102
how you feeling tonight?

108
00:04:58,146 --> 00:04:59,821
Good. Having a nice time.

109
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:02,183
Are you feeling terrific,

110
00:05:02,206 --> 00:05:04,113
or any variation on that word?

111
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:05,693
Oh, sure. No complaints.

112
00:05:05,735 --> 00:05:07,182
My skin's a little dry.

113
00:05:07,697 --> 00:05:09,030
He's not saying it, Peter.

114
00:05:11,517 --> 00:05:12,260
What?

115
00:05:13,557 --> 00:05:15,773
No. Why would I say that?
It's not even a word.

116
00:05:15,787 --> 00:05:17,573
- What isn't a word?
- Bonerific.

117
00:05:19,955 --> 00:05:21,120
Did I tell you?!

118
00:05:21,165 --> 00:05:23,491
You can't keep this guy from saying it!

119
00:05:23,638 --> 00:05:25,570
Boy, great party, huh, Fred?

120
00:05:25,607 --> 00:05:28,822
Yeah. You know, Barn,
I figure I ought to tell you this.

121
00:05:29,098 --> 00:05:31,703
I was walking by your house
the other day,

122
00:05:31,715 --> 00:05:34,030
and, uh, I poked my head in the window

123
00:05:34,058 --> 00:05:35,562
and Betty was undressing.

124
00:05:35,608 --> 00:05:38,271
Uh, she saw me there,
but she didn't stop.

125
00:05:38,307 --> 00:05:39,040
What?

126
00:05:39,078 --> 00:05:40,980
She didn't stop. I mean,

127
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:44,313
she saw me there,
looking at her and she kept undressing.

128
00:05:44,336 --> 00:05:46,601
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, are you serious?
- Yeah.

129
00:05:46,636 --> 00:05:48,443
I got an erocktion.

130
00:05:48,917 --> 00:05:50,872
I got a headache.
Do you have any Anacin?

131
00:05:50,888 --> 00:05:51,800
Any what?

132
00:05:52,155 --> 00:05:53,651
- Anacin?
- Yeah, Anacin.

133
00:05:53,677 --> 00:05:56,253
- Do they even make Anacin anymore?
- Yeah, it's still around.

134
00:05:56,277 --> 00:05:57,273
- Why?
- No, it just...

135
00:05:57,297 --> 00:05:59,373
seems like sort of a '70s medication.

136
00:05:59,408 --> 00:06:01,061
So, you don't have any Anacin?

137
00:06:01,078 --> 00:06:01,642
No.

138
00:06:01,656 --> 00:06:03,913
God, you're more worthless
than Colin Farrell.

139
00:06:04,245 --> 00:06:06,660
So, uh...
Got the wool cap on, huh?

140
00:06:07,077 --> 00:06:07,670
Yeah...

141
00:06:08,116 --> 00:06:10,661
Yeah, I guess, you know,
whatever, it's 96 degrees out.

142
00:06:10,698 --> 00:06:12,743
Yeah, you'd better put on
the old wool cap.

143
00:06:12,766 --> 00:06:13,390
Yeah.

144
00:06:14,014 --> 00:06:16,148
You got a lot going on under there, huh,

145
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:17,938
under... under the wool cap?

146
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,203
Thinking about your sideburns?

147
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:23,832
Yeah. No, no, no, no,
you're not a complete jackass.

148
00:06:23,997 --> 00:06:25,210
Oh, hey, nice T-shirt.

149
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,012
"Phresh"

150
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:28,752
And it's spelled with a p-h.
Oh, that's fun,

151
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:30,753
'cause it's usually spelled with an "f."

152
00:06:30,926 --> 00:06:31,613
Yeah.

153
00:06:31,628 --> 00:06:33,333
Oh, you got a little tear
in your pants, there...

154
00:06:33,366 --> 00:06:35,230
Ohp, that's on purpose, though, isn't it?

155
00:06:35,915 --> 00:06:37,843
Yeah, you're a bad boy.

156
00:06:37,895 --> 00:06:39,060
You're a bad boy.

157
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:41,403
Society wants your pants to be intact,

158
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:43,410
but you're just not
gonna listen, are you?

159
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:46,120
My God, this is ridiculous.
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to kill you.

160
00:06:49,707 --> 00:06:53,302
All right, one more pre-party drink,
and then we'll head off to the Clam.

161
00:06:53,358 --> 00:06:55,672
It's cheaper to drink
at your house first.

162
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,960
Boy, they sure are making
a lot of noise out there.

163
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:01,182
Those idiots have done nothing
but hang out

164
00:07:01,197 --> 00:07:03,331
in that stupid shed
for the last two days.

165
00:07:03,355 --> 00:07:05,181
We should crash that party.

166
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:07,202
Hey, you know what, Bernice is right.

167
00:07:07,238 --> 00:07:09,180
They're always trying
to get away from us.

168
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:12,622
We should march in there
and remind them that they have wives.

169
00:07:12,668 --> 00:07:16,932
Especially if they have food,
because bar food is so overpriced.

170
00:07:16,975 --> 00:07:19,151
Man, who invited Anne Frank?

171
00:07:21,648 --> 00:07:25,132
Quagmire, tell that story about
the girl with the inside-out anus.

172
00:07:25,147 --> 00:07:27,662
- Oh, you mean Blossom?
- Oh, that's a great story.

173
00:07:27,687 --> 00:07:30,120
All right, so I'm skulking around
the intensive care unit,

174
00:07:30,137 --> 00:07:32,042
and all of sudden
this smoking hot chick...

175
00:07:32,045 --> 00:07:34,750
Hey, boys!
Mind if we join the party?

176
00:07:34,797 --> 00:07:36,601
Sorry, Lois, no girls allowed.

177
00:07:36,646 --> 00:07:39,392
Oh, come on, Peter. It'd be
good to have some chicks in here.

178
00:07:39,435 --> 00:07:40,782
Quagmire, you nuts?

179
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,121
This is a men's club.

180
00:07:42,158 --> 00:07:46,880
That's the problem. The ratio be
terrible. It's a total mast-fest in here.

181
00:07:46,928 --> 00:07:48,771
Yeah, this is sort of lame.

182
00:07:48,808 --> 00:07:51,501
Well, we can fix that.
Come on, girls, let's dance!

183
00:07:55,128 --> 00:07:58,122
Hey, hey, hey, stop it!
You women can't dance in here!

184
00:07:58,316 --> 00:08:01,080
Well, I know two people
who'll take my side on this.

185
00:08:01,096 --> 00:08:03,462
The stuffy parents from Dirty Dancing.

186
00:08:03,487 --> 00:08:04,410
Right, guys?

187
00:08:04,425 --> 00:08:07,403
Sorry, Peter.
Even we're getting into it.

188
00:08:11,006 --> 00:08:13,283
What's the matter, Bonnie
don't you want to dance?

189
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,952
Oh, it's okay, Joe.
I don't mind sitting here with you.

190
00:08:16,988 --> 00:08:20,423
What I mean is...
I don't want to hold you back.

191
00:08:20,436 --> 00:08:24,570
Don't be silly, honey. It's just as
nice watching other people have fun.

192
00:08:24,618 --> 00:08:26,651
God, I hate being handicapped.

193
00:08:26,695 --> 00:08:30,321
Sometimes I feel more useless
than the head of the Maid's Union.

194
00:08:30,355 --> 00:08:32,662
And what exactly are your demands?

195
00:08:32,697 --> 00:08:34,520
We need more Lemon Pledge.

196
00:08:34,536 --> 00:08:36,451
You need more Lemon Pledge?

197
00:08:36,498 --> 00:08:37,422
Yes.

198
00:08:37,445 --> 00:08:38,892
We're not responsible for that.

199
00:08:38,896 --> 00:08:41,050
You should just bring it
from your own home.

200
00:08:41,107 --> 00:08:42,333
No.

201
00:08:46,418 --> 00:08:49,573
Hello.
Oh, hi, Lois.

202
00:08:49,598 --> 00:08:52,041
Yeah, last night was fun.

203
00:08:52,075 --> 00:08:56,023
Oh, it's okay,
I'm used to not dancing.

204
00:08:56,096 --> 00:09:00,431
I mean, I knew what to expect after,
you know, Joe's accident,

205
00:09:00,435 --> 00:09:03,961
and I'm prepared to live
the rest of my life this way.

206
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:08,010
Poor Bonnie.
She deserves so much better than me.

207
00:09:08,045 --> 00:09:10,472
God, she must regret this marriage.

208
00:09:10,497 --> 00:09:14,043
If only there was some way
for me to walk again.

209
00:09:14,525 --> 00:09:16,252
Wait a minute, what am I saying?

210
00:09:16,297 --> 00:09:19,583
There's nothing wrong with me.
I'm no different than any other guy!

211
00:09:19,736 --> 00:09:24,083
Joe, would you put on your hand-shoes
and take out the garbage?

212
00:09:26,117 --> 00:09:27,302
Thank you.

213
00:09:34,835 --> 00:09:36,860
Hey, thanks for coming with me, Peter.

214
00:09:36,918 --> 00:09:40,642
It sure would be wonderful
if Dr. Hartman could help me walk again.

215
00:09:40,806 --> 00:09:42,332
I'm sorry, Mayor McCheese,

216
00:09:42,347 --> 00:09:45,163
but I'm not sure if any
cosmetic surgery is even possible.

217
00:09:45,175 --> 00:09:46,583
Look, if it's a financial issue,

218
00:09:46,618 --> 00:09:49,433
It's not an issue of money,
your head is a cheeseburger.

219
00:09:49,465 --> 00:09:52,451
There's no blood flow to it.
It's just, it's just dead cow meat.

220
00:09:52,478 --> 00:09:55,512
All right, well, I appreciate
you giving it to me straight.

221
00:09:55,538 --> 00:09:57,511
All right, then, have a tasty afternoon.

222
00:09:58,155 --> 00:09:59,602
Ah, there's a smile.

223
00:09:59,818 --> 00:10:01,860
So, what can I do for you, Mr. Swanson?

224
00:10:01,887 --> 00:10:03,783
Doc, I can't take it anymore.

225
00:10:03,817 --> 00:10:06,351
I want to walk again.
I'll do what ever it takes.

226
00:10:06,388 --> 00:10:09,331
Well, there is a
highly experimental new procedure.

227
00:10:09,347 --> 00:10:11,331
It's essentially a leg transplant.

228
00:10:11,368 --> 00:10:14,511
If you'd be willing to sign a waiver,
I think I may be able to help you.

229
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:17,220
You know, when you talk,
you sound, a lot like my father-in-law,

230
00:10:17,245 --> 00:10:18,253
Carter Pewterschmidt.

231
00:10:18,275 --> 00:10:20,063
Oh, that's funny.
He's a patient of mine.

232
00:10:20,108 --> 00:10:22,802
- Here's my urine sample, Doctor.
- Thank you, Mr. Pewterschmidt.

233
00:10:22,838 --> 00:10:23,842
Oh, hi, Peter.

234
00:10:23,877 --> 00:10:25,573
You know, Peter says we sound alike.

235
00:10:25,615 --> 00:10:27,903
- Really? I don't hear it.
- Actually, I think I do hear it now.

236
00:10:27,938 --> 00:10:28,710
- Really?
- Yeah,

237
00:10:28,747 --> 00:10:31,240
you know, we've never really had
any extended interactions,

238
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:32,201
so I've never noticed it.

239
00:10:32,218 --> 00:10:34,781
- Hey, I think I hear it, too.
- Seems lazy, doesn't it?

240
00:10:34,788 --> 00:10:36,650
Well, there's only so
many voices in the world.

241
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,123
Some of them are bound to be similar.

242
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:41,153
Now, Mr. Swanson,
through the magic of digital imaging,

243
00:10:41,196 --> 00:10:45,232
we'll select the legs most suited to your
body from our inventory of donors.

244
00:10:53,425 --> 00:10:55,060
Hey, what about these?

245
00:10:55,107 --> 00:10:58,823
Ah, good choice. These are the only ones
we have in stock that aren't hilarious.

246
00:10:58,868 --> 00:10:59,903
I'll take 'em!

247
00:10:59,918 --> 00:11:04,393
Ah, Joe. You are gonna be happier than
bullfrogs on vacation in Ethiopia.

248
00:11:04,977 --> 00:11:08,621
Ah, this is fantastic! This is even better
than they said it was in the brochure!

249
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:11,291
Oh, I feel like a pig,
but, come on, we're on vacation!

250
00:11:11,308 --> 00:11:13,542
Exactly, don't hate yourself,
we're on vacation!

251
00:11:13,575 --> 00:11:16,080
Yeah, I hear Madonna
is raising this guy's kid.

252
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:20,550
Now, just relax, Mr. Swanson,
and let the anesthetic do its job.

253
00:11:20,566 --> 00:11:22,601
- All right, Doc, I trust you.
- Good.

254
00:11:22,636 --> 00:11:24,630
Now, I'll just pop in the how-to video,

255
00:11:24,658 --> 00:11:26,070
- and we'll get started.
- What?!

256
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:30,992
<i>Hi, I'm Jamie Farr, and you're about
to perform leg surgery.</i>

257
00:11:31,008 --> 00:11:32,440
No!

258
00:11:36,805 --> 00:11:41,102
He's been in there an awful long time.
I hope everything's all right.

259
00:11:41,888 --> 00:11:46,361
Gentlemen, I give you...
the new Joe Swanson.

260
00:11:52,506 --> 00:11:53,701
Well, what do you think?

261
00:11:53,845 --> 00:11:56,400
- Oh, honey!
- Oh, my God, you look great, Joe!

262
00:11:56,577 --> 00:11:59,163
They still got that new leg smell.

263
00:11:59,205 --> 00:12:01,340
I put his old legs in a bag
if you want them.

264
00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:03,741
Oh, great. We'll take them home,
we'll give them to Brian.

265
00:12:03,777 --> 00:12:06,112
Come on, Joe, I'll drive you home.

266
00:12:06,127 --> 00:12:07,091
Are you kidding?

267
00:12:07,115 --> 00:12:11,193
I've got working legs for the first time
in 15 years, and I'm gonna use them.

268
00:12:11,216 --> 00:12:12,611
I'm walking home!

269
00:12:12,645 --> 00:12:16,120
I'm sorry, Mr. Swanson. Hospital rules,
you have to leave in a wheelchair

270
00:12:25,797 --> 00:12:28,671
Oh, Joe, that was amazing!

271
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,802
I know.
I was there.

272
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:35,832
My God, we haven't done it in so long,
I had forgotten how big you were.

273
00:12:35,865 --> 00:12:38,391
I was gonna say the same thing to you.

274
00:12:41,776 --> 00:12:44,480
<i>Coming this fall on Fox,
a new reality show.</i>

275
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:47,173
<i>Who Wants To Marry Corky
From Life Goes On?</i>

276
00:12:47,216 --> 00:12:50,543
You won't believe what happens!

277
00:12:51,148 --> 00:12:53,060
Come on, guys, let's go!

278
00:12:53,076 --> 00:12:54,300
Go? Where we going?

279
00:12:54,326 --> 00:12:57,182
Listen, these new legs
have given me my life back.

280
00:12:57,208 --> 00:13:00,622
I want to do all the things I could
never do when I was handicapped.

281
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:04,252
And you guys are my best friends.
I want you to experience it all with me.

282
00:13:04,287 --> 00:13:06,000
You can count on us, Joe.

283
00:13:10,558 --> 00:13:13,583
Oh, this is great! I feel so alive!

284
00:13:13,608 --> 00:13:16,531
Come on, ladies!
Kick your high heels off and get moving!

285
00:13:16,556 --> 00:13:18,373
You guys are a disgrace!

286
00:13:18,385 --> 00:13:21,540
- Peter, this doesn't seem safe.
- Yeah, I'm afraid I might...

287
00:13:26,358 --> 00:13:28,613
Wow. Thanks, Spider-Man.

288
00:13:28,627 --> 00:13:30,760
Everybody gets one.
Tell him, Peter.

289
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,593
Uh, apparently, everybody gets one.

290
00:13:32,615 --> 00:13:33,433
Bingo.

291
00:13:38,508 --> 00:13:42,193
- I don't know about this, Joe.
- There is no fear in this dojo!

292
00:13:42,207 --> 00:13:44,610
Joe, we don't even know what a dojo is.

293
00:13:44,628 --> 00:13:46,573
There is no mercy in this dojo!

294
00:13:46,586 --> 00:13:48,072
Joe, why don't you take it down a notch?

295
00:13:48,088 --> 00:13:49,082
No mercy!

296
00:13:58,726 --> 00:14:00,920
All right, we're gonna do it once more.

297
00:14:02,315 --> 00:14:04,541
And this time, no mistakes!

298
00:14:04,555 --> 00:14:05,793
1, 2, 3, 4...

299
00:14:07,665 --> 00:14:10,043
<i>Good mornin', good mornin'</i>

300
00:14:10,477 --> 00:14:12,310
<i>It's great to stay up late</i>

301
00:14:12,348 --> 00:14:15,421
<i>Good mornin', good mornin' to you</i>

<i>But now the milkman's on his way
It's too late to say good night</i>

304
00:14:25,326 --> 00:14:28,480
<i>- So say good mornin'
- Good mornin'!</i>

305
00:14:28,496 --> 00:14:30,450
<i>Sunbeams will soon smile through</i>

306
00:14:30,475 --> 00:14:33,250
<i>Good mornin', good mornin' to you</i>

307
00:14:33,265 --> 00:14:36,573
<i>Nothing could be grander than to be in
Louisiana In the mornin', in the morn...</i>

308
00:14:36,605 --> 00:14:38,681
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought we were still going.

309
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:43,401
My God, Joe is running us ragged.

310
00:14:43,437 --> 00:14:45,722
Yeah, I haven't been this exhausted
since I had that job

311
00:14:45,745 --> 00:14:48,541
as Jackee Harry's personal
grocery shopper.

312
00:14:48,705 --> 00:14:50,070
A pallet?

313
00:14:50,116 --> 00:14:53,913
Am I reading this right? You need
a pallet of chocolate-covered pretzels?

314
00:14:54,535 --> 00:14:56,720
Where the hell am I supposed to...?
And what is this,

315
00:14:56,748 --> 00:14:58,980
a drum of grape jam?

316
00:15:00,097 --> 00:15:02,860
What is that? Is that like
a drum like they ship oil in?

317
00:15:04,285 --> 00:15:06,690
And look at this one :
"A desk of Cheez-Its."

318
00:15:07,237 --> 00:15:10,420
A desk? Where are you getting
these units of measurement from?

319
00:15:10,446 --> 00:15:11,541
Mary.

320
00:15:12,577 --> 00:15:14,083
That is still funny.

321
00:15:14,115 --> 00:15:18,040
Okay, you stay right here, big
funny gal. I'll be right back with...

322
00:15:18,476 --> 00:15:20,441
a "hammock of cake."

323
00:15:20,635 --> 00:15:23,802
Yeah, Dave Matthews Live.
I'll burn you a copy.

324
00:15:23,825 --> 00:15:26,521
- Stay cool.
- Hey, Joe. What you got there?

325
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:27,620
Mountain bike.

326
00:15:27,665 --> 00:15:30,653
Oh, Joe, I don't know.
I'm still chafed from that power walk.

327
00:15:30,686 --> 00:15:34,252
Both of my inner thighs look
like those big cherry Swedish Fish.

328
00:15:34,297 --> 00:15:36,672
Don't worry.
I'm not taking you pansies

329
00:15:36,715 --> 00:15:40,360
I'm taking my new friends.
This is Parker, Quentin and Portland.

330
00:15:40,496 --> 00:15:43,562
- Is Portland the black one?
- Portland is the black one.

331
00:15:43,605 --> 00:15:44,630
Joe, what the...

332
00:15:44,688 --> 00:15:45,911
What the hell is this?

333
00:15:45,936 --> 00:15:48,970
Well, Peter, I realized over
the last few days,

334
00:15:48,998 --> 00:15:51,180
the only reason I hung out with you guys

335
00:15:51,197 --> 00:15:53,542
is that I was crippled
and you were lazy.

336
00:15:53,555 --> 00:15:57,223
I decided it's time I got some friends
more suited to my status.

337
00:15:57,255 --> 00:15:59,310
But, Joe, we've been friends for years.

338
00:15:59,327 --> 00:16:01,353
Hey, we all make mistakes.

339
00:16:01,438 --> 00:16:03,681
Come on, dudes, let's go exercise.

340
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,212
- Exercise!
- Yeah!

341
00:16:05,228 --> 00:16:07,551
I'm gonna do sit-up still I poop myself!

342
00:16:07,586 --> 00:16:11,340
I can believe it.
Joe just dumped us. He's gone.

343
00:16:11,376 --> 00:16:14,453
And all we got to remember him
by are his old legs.

344
00:16:15,617 --> 00:16:16,660
Okay, okay.

345
00:16:19,835 --> 00:16:22,850
Peter, I wish you'd go over there
and patch things up with Joe.

346
00:16:22,876 --> 00:16:24,180
Hey, screw him, Lois.

347
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:27,112
He doesn't need us anymore now
that he's got his cool, new friends.

348
00:16:27,138 --> 00:16:30,122
I tell you, those legs have turned him
into a complete jerk.

349
00:16:30,196 --> 00:16:33,021
It's like giving a monkey
the keys to an amusement park.

350
00:16:33,478 --> 00:16:35,381
- How is that?
- How is what?

351
00:16:35,426 --> 00:16:39,222
How is it anything like a monkey
having the keys to an amusement park?

352
00:16:39,238 --> 00:16:40,332
I don't know.

353
00:16:40,728 --> 00:16:42,451
The hours would be erratic.

354
00:16:42,978 --> 00:16:45,463
Maintenance would probably
suffer to some degree.

355
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:48,970
The prizes for games of chance
would all be bananas.

356
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:50,863
Lois, don't call me on this stuff,
all right?

357
00:16:50,865 --> 00:16:53,191
I'm... Just go with it.
Support me in these moments.

358
00:16:53,226 --> 00:16:54,710
I'm hurt. I lost my buddy.

359
00:16:54,756 --> 00:16:57,823
Well, Peter, there have been
a lot of changes in Joe's life,

360
00:16:57,846 --> 00:17:00,293
and maybe he just needed to move on.

361
00:17:00,407 --> 00:17:04,660
If I were you, I'd look for
a new friend. A kindred spirit,

362
00:17:04,695 --> 00:17:07,010
like Judas found in Pontius Pilate.

363
00:17:07,207 --> 00:17:09,591
You know, sometimes
I feel like someone should just...

364
00:17:09,606 --> 00:17:12,821
- Crucify Jesus of Nazareth. Oh, my God!
- Crucify Jesus of Nazareth. Oh, my God!

365
00:17:12,846 --> 00:17:14,802
- Shut up!
- No, you shut up!

366
00:17:14,815 --> 00:17:16,431
- I'm Judas.
- Pontius.

367
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:18,441
This is so weird, because just today,

368
00:17:18,466 --> 00:17:20,931
I was thinking about
how I wanted to find the son of God

369
00:17:20,955 --> 00:17:22,350
and nail him to some wood.

370
00:17:22,367 --> 00:17:24,310
Well, let's go find him
and kick his ass!

371
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:25,612
That sounds swell!

372
00:17:28,808 --> 00:17:34,463
<i>Think I'll go for a walk outside now
The summer sun's calling my name...</i>

373
00:17:37,325 --> 00:17:40,102
So, do you really think you're suited
to be the fourth guy

374
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:41,761
in our group, Buzz Killington?

375
00:17:41,787 --> 00:17:44,721
Yeah, I mean, we mainly just sit here
in the booth and crack jokes, but

376
00:17:44,745 --> 00:17:46,170
you're kind of a buzz kill.

377
00:17:46,206 --> 00:17:51,101
Oh, on the contrary. I've quite
a mastery of the humorous yarn.

378
00:17:51,907 --> 00:17:56,272
Do any of you know the tale
of how corn meal came to be

379
00:17:56,447 --> 00:17:58,163
- No.
- No.
- No.

380
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:01,710
Neither did the miller
when he left his house that morning.

381
00:18:03,878 --> 00:18:05,952
We got to get Joe back.

382
00:18:09,668 --> 00:18:12,791
Joe, please, can't we talk about this?!

383
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:15,902
There's nothing to talk about.
I've out grown you, Bonnie.

384
00:18:15,937 --> 00:18:18,013
I need to spread my legs and fly.

385
00:18:20,128 --> 00:18:21,210
Keep the kid.

386
00:18:22,307 --> 00:18:24,713
It was awful.
I mean, he just left Bonnie.

387
00:18:24,738 --> 00:18:26,733
And then the bastard completely
blew me off

388
00:18:26,746 --> 00:18:28,583
to hang out with those new douche bags.

389
00:18:28,595 --> 00:18:30,432
Peter, we got to do something.

390
00:18:30,457 --> 00:18:31,581
You're right, Cleveland.

391
00:18:31,705 --> 00:18:33,962
Boys, there's only one answer.

392
00:18:34,085 --> 00:18:36,482
We got to re-cripple Joe.

393
00:18:36,607 --> 00:18:38,100
It's the right thing to do,

394
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:39,341
like taking out Hitler.

395
00:18:43,377 --> 00:18:45,643
See? We had a plan for that all along.

396
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:49,902
Bye, new awesome friends!

397
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:53,971
Bonnie, I forgot my Soloflex.

398
00:18:53,985 --> 00:18:57,292
- Yo, Joe.
- What the hell you doing here, pansy?

399
00:18:57,498 --> 00:19:00,162
We're gonna break your legs, Joe.

400
00:19:00,187 --> 00:19:01,681
It's for your own good.

401
00:19:01,695 --> 00:19:03,521
Come on, guys, get him!

402
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,360
All right, then.

403
00:19:44,356 --> 00:19:46,951
Bonnie! What the hell?!
Put my gun down!

404
00:19:46,995 --> 00:19:49,640
Not until I have my husband back!

405
00:19:50,547 --> 00:19:54,341
- Ah! My perfect ass!
- Oh, I'm sorry, Joe.

406
00:19:54,357 --> 00:19:56,172
I was aiming for your spine.

407
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:59,641
- Ah! Damn it!
- Joe, I'm so sorry.

408
00:19:59,686 --> 00:20:01,391
I'm a terrible shot.

409
00:20:02,846 --> 00:20:04,941
Oh, for God's sakes,
just give me the gun!

410
00:20:04,956 --> 00:20:06,622
I'll do it myself!

411
00:20:11,298 --> 00:20:13,881
Boy, we, uh, really did
a number on each other.

412
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:17,820
You know, I just want to take this
opportunity to apologize to you guys.

413
00:20:17,876 --> 00:20:20,632
I was acting like a first-class jackass.

414
00:20:20,675 --> 00:20:23,242
I... hope that you can forgive me.

415
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,571
Oh, it's just good
to have our old Joe back.

416
00:20:26,606 --> 00:20:30,570
And once our injuries heal up,
we can all go for a nice, long walk.

417
00:20:30,597 --> 00:20:31,801
All right!

418
00:20:31,825 --> 00:20:33,881
Yeah!
Wait a minute!

419
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:40,742
Joke's on you.

420
00:20:40,777 --> 00:20:42,863
