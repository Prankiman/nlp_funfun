3
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,940
All right,
all bets are in.

4
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:37,756
Ooh, Rupert, bad idea
trusting the Celtics.

5
00:00:37,797 --> 00:00:40,450
Worse than when I trusted Brian
to pack my parachute.

6
00:00:54,945 --> 00:00:57,047
Hey, Brian, care
to place a wager?

7
00:00:57,086 --> 00:00:59,350
Tomorrow night on Fox's
Celebrity Boxing,

8
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:02,188
I've got Carol Channing beating
Mike Tyson in three rounds.

9
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,240
Carol Channing...

10
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:07,381
You've got Carol Channing, the actress,
beating Mike Tyson, the boxer.

11
00:01:07,498 --> 00:01:09,183
Hell, give me
50 bucks on Tyson.

12
00:01:09,197 --> 00:01:12,284
Well, you're in good company.
Betting Freddy took the same wager.

13
00:01:12,315 --> 00:01:15,462
B- b-b-b-b-b-b-
b- b-b-b-b-bet!

14
00:01:15,526 --> 00:01:19,021
Wait a minute. There's nothing funny
about an addiction.

15
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:21,482
Vote "no"
on Indian gaming laws.

16
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:29,101
And we're back with Fox Celebrity Boxing
with Mike Tyson and Carol Channing.

17
00:01:29,165 --> 00:01:32,123
I tell you, Jim, how Carol Channing
outlasted that barrage

18
00:01:32,127 --> 00:01:33,660
in the second round
we'll never know.

19
00:01:37,576 --> 00:01:40,323
Come here, young man.
I'm gonna bop you one.

20
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:47,513
- She's getting beat!
- No, she's getting mad.

21
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:50,232
Ah, you ain't so tough,
young man.

22
00:01:52,638 --> 00:01:56,292
That all you got, you son of a bitch.
You're going down, young man.

23
00:02:00,556 --> 00:02:02,300
You're going down!

24
00:02:02,325 --> 00:02:04,812
I ca... I can't believe this.
She keeps getting up.

25
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,030
I'm so exhausted.

26
00:02:08,825 --> 00:02:13,630
And the winner, by technical knockout,
weighing in at 67 pounds,

27
00:02:13,677 --> 00:02:16,873
Carol "Put on Your
Sunday Clothes" Channing!

28
00:02:16,978 --> 00:02:17,652
Yeah!

29
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,920
Up yours, young people.

30
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:24,090
You and your rock and roll
eight-track tapes!

31
00:02:24,146 --> 00:02:26,922
I don't believe this.
I just lost a $50 bet.

32
00:02:26,965 --> 00:02:29,063
You know, Mike Tyson
once beat up his wife.

33
00:02:29,538 --> 00:02:31,440
But there's nothing
funny about that.

34
00:02:34,658 --> 00:02:36,831
Hi, guys. We're back
from the mall.

35
00:02:36,868 --> 00:02:38,412
I got new shoes.

36
00:02:38,455 --> 00:02:40,552
The old ones
are in the box.

37
00:02:41,475 --> 00:02:43,660
They smell and are old.

38
00:02:44,025 --> 00:02:47,232
Hey, Peter, your 25th high
school reunion is next Sunday.

39
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:49,222
Eh, throw that away.
I don't wanna go.

40
00:02:49,258 --> 00:02:51,411
Besides, Sunday's
my Internet porn night.

41
00:02:52,686 --> 00:02:54,622
Oh, yeah!

42
00:02:54,655 --> 00:02:57,320
You're my Chinese Lois.

43
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,853
Hey, it's me.
Knock-knock.

44
00:03:02,075 --> 00:03:04,940
So, uh, you got, uh,
you got my money?

45
00:03:05,076 --> 00:03:06,900
Huh? Oh, yeah.
I'll pay you soon?

46
00:03:06,935 --> 00:03:09,500
Yeah, well, um,
here's a suggestion. Um...

47
00:03:09,586 --> 00:03:12,503
Have the money by tomorrow
and there won't be any problems.

48
00:03:12,717 --> 00:03:14,521
- Huh?
- Yeah, 24 hours.

49
00:03:14,566 --> 00:03:16,392
Why? What happens
in 24 hours?

50
00:03:16,455 --> 00:03:18,443
Huh? I don't know.
I'm not psychic, man.

51
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:21,423
I'm just saying it would probably be better
for everybody if you had the money tomorrow.

52
00:03:21,478 --> 00:03:23,000
Yeah, all right.
I'll see what I can do.

53
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,962
Sweet, sweet. Great.

54
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,900
- Uh, how's everything else going?
- Good.

55
00:03:26,947 --> 00:03:28,960
All right, all right.
See you later.

56
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:29,820
Don't forget.

57
00:03:30,426 --> 00:03:31,862
Nah, you're not
going to forget.

58
00:03:34,776 --> 00:03:36,492
Hey, Peter, I was
going through your garbage

59
00:03:36,505 --> 00:03:38,372
and I noticed your high school
reunion is coming up.

60
00:03:38,417 --> 00:03:39,722
Why were you
going through my garbage?

61
00:03:39,726 --> 00:03:41,020
Well, when I stopped
over earlier,

62
00:03:41,026 --> 00:03:42,960
I noticed Lois clipping her toenails
and I thought:

63
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:44,482
"Oh, man,
I gotta get in on that. "

64
00:03:44,678 --> 00:03:45,250
Huh.

65
00:03:45,736 --> 00:03:47,690
Yeah, I don't think
I'm going to my reunion.

66
00:03:47,718 --> 00:03:49,492
Everybody's all got
their nice cars

67
00:03:49,506 --> 00:03:52,343
and their big, important
jobs, and their fancy hats,

68
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:56,283
and their fresh strawberries so big
you can eat them like a hand fruit.

69
00:03:56,317 --> 00:03:59,952
Peter, everyone lies at those things.
Just tell them you're a big shot.

70
00:04:00,118 --> 00:04:02,312
Wait a second, Joe,
that's a great idea.

71
00:04:02,415 --> 00:04:05,192
Boy, imagine what it would be
like to be a big shot.

72
00:04:08,905 --> 00:04:10,003
Diego?

73
00:04:10,845 --> 00:04:11,690
Sweaty.

74
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:15,022
Ah... thank you.

75
00:04:22,856 --> 00:04:24,862
- Stewie. Uh, hey.
- Hey, there.

76
00:04:24,988 --> 00:04:27,753
So, uh, it's been 24 hours.
Got my money?

77
00:04:27,887 --> 00:04:30,993
Oh, I... You know what? Just give me
till next Friday, I'll have it for.

78
00:04:31,776 --> 00:04:34,253
Oh, that's funny. I could have sworn
I said, have it today.

79
00:04:34,285 --> 00:04:35,702
Yeah, I don't
have it, sorry.

80
00:04:35,806 --> 00:04:37,500
Oh, well.
All right, then.

81
00:04:38,176 --> 00:04:39,940
Mmm, that's good OJ.

82
00:04:42,045 --> 00:04:44,323
- Yeah, that hurt? That hurt?
- What the hell?

83
00:04:44,328 --> 00:04:46,122
Yeah, that doesn't
feel so good, does it?

84
00:04:46,177 --> 00:04:48,470
- No, huh?
- Oh, oh. Oh, oh.

85
00:04:49,076 --> 00:04:50,811
Yeah, that's what
happens, man.

86
00:04:50,967 --> 00:04:53,582
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, that's what happens.

87
00:04:54,558 --> 00:04:55,592
Where's my money?!

88
00:04:56,707 --> 00:04:59,491
You gonna give me my money?
Where's my money, man?

89
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:03,401
Where's the money?

90
00:05:05,395 --> 00:05:07,122
Yeah, you like that?
That feel good?

91
00:05:07,197 --> 00:05:08,281
That feel good?

92
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:12,642
Where's the money, man?
Where's my money?

93
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:19,753
You've got till 5:00, you hear me?
You got till 5:00.

94
00:05:19,835 --> 00:05:22,611
- You freakin' psychopath!
- Clean yourself up.

95
00:05:29,927 --> 00:05:32,753
Peter, this is ridiculous.
Why can't you just be yourself?

96
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:35,542
Lois, just go along with
it. Act like I'm a big shot.

97
00:05:36,715 --> 00:05:40,731
- Hey, Peter Griffin, is that you?
- Hey, Mike, long time no see.

98
00:05:40,877 --> 00:05:44,670
- Wow, what, uh... what's all this?
- Oh, this? Oh, I just came from work.

99
00:05:44,736 --> 00:05:47,293
I'm a Secret Agent
Astronaut Millionaire.

100
00:05:47,356 --> 00:05:49,322
Cool. Where'd you
get the cowboy hat?

101
00:05:50,035 --> 00:05:50,913
Space.

102
00:05:51,046 --> 00:05:52,981
Oh, by the way,
this is my friend, Tom.

103
00:05:53,576 --> 00:05:56,253
You're Tom Brady
from the New England Patriots!

104
00:05:56,285 --> 00:05:58,491
Oh man, I got to tell you,
you kick ass, man.

105
00:05:58,585 --> 00:06:00,191
In fact, I was just saying
that the other day,

106
00:06:00,196 --> 00:06:01,633
to all the guys down
at the brewery.

107
00:06:01,776 --> 00:06:02,450
Brewery?

108
00:06:02,618 --> 00:06:04,570
I thought you were
a cowboy astronaut millionaire.

109
00:06:04,796 --> 00:06:05,970
He's a fake!

110
00:06:05,996 --> 00:06:07,930
Look, this cowboy hat
comes right off.

111
00:06:12,468 --> 00:06:15,250
Coming here was
a huge mistake, Lois.

112
00:06:15,338 --> 00:06:18,852
Peter, I know you're humiliated,
but getting drunk is not the answer.

113
00:06:18,877 --> 00:06:23,031
Uh-oh. Either my esophagus just got
shorter, or I'm about to throw up.

114
00:06:31,146 --> 00:06:32,942
Peter, that was amazing.

115
00:06:33,006 --> 00:06:35,213
I've never a seen a guy your size
who could move like that.

116
00:06:35,337 --> 00:06:37,841
How would you like to play
for the New England Patriots?

117
00:06:37,876 --> 00:06:39,731
Oh. I'd love to.

118
00:06:40,407 --> 00:06:44,133
Say, listen, uh, Tom, could you get me
a towel? I threw up on the floor.

119
00:06:44,176 --> 00:06:44,733
Sure.

120
00:06:44,777 --> 00:06:46,643
And could you also
get another towel?

121
00:06:46,646 --> 00:06:49,050
I also threw up on
this gentleman's bare lap.

122
00:06:49,127 --> 00:06:51,171
<i>- Could you wet the towel?
- Wet the towel, Tom?</i>

123
00:06:51,997 --> 00:06:55,322
Our top story tonight, we go live
to terrific haircut Bob Costas,

124
00:06:55,326 --> 00:06:57,622
as he talks with local
man Peter Griffin,

125
00:06:57,688 --> 00:07:00,683
who is living his dream of playing for
the New England Patriots. Bob?

126
00:07:00,746 --> 00:07:03,203
Thanks, Tom, I'm fond
of your hair, as well.

127
00:07:03,228 --> 00:07:06,543
I'm standing here with Tom Brady
and his newest teammate, Peter Griffin.

128
00:07:06,587 --> 00:07:10,110
Hey, Ma! Check it out!
I'm married to a pro athlete!

129
00:07:10,508 --> 00:07:11,702
What do you think of that?

130
00:07:12,996 --> 00:07:14,472
We're really excited
to have Peter.

131
00:07:14,528 --> 00:07:16,932
I think he's gonna make a great
addition to a great team.

132
00:07:17,016 --> 00:07:18,440
I want to thank God.

133
00:07:18,536 --> 00:07:20,452
Uh, I want to thank the Lord God.

134
00:07:20,817 --> 00:07:23,132
Uh, 'cause it's not really up
to me, it's up to him.

135
00:07:23,825 --> 00:07:26,203
Um, and I want
to thank the Devil, too.

136
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:29,442
Uh, you know, 'cause that's,
uh, that's why God's there.

137
00:07:29,785 --> 00:07:30,661
He's, uh...

138
00:07:30,727 --> 00:07:33,583
he's minding the fence, making sure
that guy never comes back.

139
00:07:34,135 --> 00:07:34,883
Uh...

140
00:07:35,435 --> 00:07:38,071
You know, if it weren't for the Devil,
God'd probably go insane,

141
00:07:38,105 --> 00:07:40,212
blow his brains out
from boredom, you know?

142
00:07:41,285 --> 00:07:43,251
Everybody likes to feel useful.

143
00:07:44,032 --> 00:07:46,511
Make-a da world go round.

144
00:07:46,728 --> 00:07:47,693
Back to you, Tom.

145
00:07:47,787 --> 00:07:49,974
Diane, didn't your first husband
blow his brains out?

146
00:07:52,407 --> 00:07:53,573
Oh, yes...

147
00:07:53,627 --> 00:07:56,762
Coming up, America's hottest
new curse word, "kleeman. "

148
00:07:56,928 --> 00:07:58,612
We'll tell you
what it means after this.

149
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,861
Boy, Lois, I can't believe
this is happening to me.

150
00:08:00,906 --> 00:08:02,542
I'm somebody now, you know?

151
00:08:02,687 --> 00:08:05,670
I- I don't have to lie to people
about my life anymore.

152
00:08:05,716 --> 00:08:08,130
Oh, I am so happy
for you, Peter.

153
00:08:08,465 --> 00:08:10,133
What the hell
happened to you?

154
00:08:11,298 --> 00:08:12,182
I, uh...

155
00:08:12,435 --> 00:08:13,623
Fell down the stairs.

156
00:08:13,678 --> 00:08:15,162
Oh, you should be more careful.

157
00:08:17,855 --> 00:08:21,120
All right, I'm ready. Come on, good
game. Good game, everybody. Yeah.

158
00:08:21,147 --> 00:08:23,111
Come on, good game.
Let's get out there. Let's do it.

159
00:08:23,155 --> 00:08:25,171
Yeah, yeah.
110%, everybody.

160
00:08:25,236 --> 00:08:28,230
110%. Huh? Come on, let's go.
Let's go. Good game!

161
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:33,131
Ready! Blue 20, blue 20!
Hut, hut!

162
00:08:33,195 --> 00:08:36,192
- Griffin, let go!
- Let's go?!

163
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:57,583
- Mornin'.
- Good day to you, sir.

164
00:08:57,776 --> 00:08:59,220
Hey, wait a minute.
What the hell?

165
00:09:06,566 --> 00:09:08,922
Getting real tired of
you ducking me, man.

166
00:09:09,008 --> 00:09:10,382
- Yeah?
- Oh, my God!

167
00:09:10,448 --> 00:09:12,303
Yeah, getting
really tired.

168
00:09:12,528 --> 00:09:13,190
Huh?

169
00:09:16,147 --> 00:09:18,493
Where's my money?!
Where's my money?

170
00:09:19,205 --> 00:09:22,242
Yeah, you got money to pay
for fake moustaches, huh?

171
00:09:22,315 --> 00:09:25,362
Yeah. Yeah. How-How much
you pay for that fake moustache?

172
00:09:25,418 --> 00:09:27,483
$2.99. Ooooooh!

173
00:09:29,885 --> 00:09:31,513
Listen, you just got
to give me more time...

174
00:09:32,027 --> 00:09:33,810
Don't make a fool
out of me, man.

175
00:09:33,908 --> 00:09:36,371
Don't make a fool out of me.
I want my money.

176
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:38,881
- I want my money, man.
- Stewie...

177
00:09:38,957 --> 00:09:41,431
Listen, this is crazy. You got...
Oh, my God.

178
00:09:47,697 --> 00:09:49,212
All right,
let's go to the bank.

179
00:09:51,806 --> 00:09:54,741
Well, I got to tell you, this was
a delicious dinner, Mrs. Griffin.

180
00:09:54,785 --> 00:09:55,922
Oh.

181
00:09:55,968 --> 00:09:58,203
Well, the pleasure is
all ours, Mr. Brady.

182
00:09:58,248 --> 00:09:59,633
Please, call me Tom.

183
00:10:01,748 --> 00:10:04,181
- Can I call you Tom, too?
- Well, of course.

184
00:10:06,616 --> 00:10:09,652
Mr. Brady, would you please
sign my Trapper Keeper?

185
00:10:09,765 --> 00:10:13,151
Oh, Tom, your shirt.
I'm so sorry.

186
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:15,202
Look, you can use our
shower if you want.

187
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:18,042
No, it's okay. It's just
a little spot. It'll come out.

188
00:10:18,115 --> 00:10:21,023
Well, that's not gonna come out.
You better take a shower.

189
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:29,842
- Mom, let me look!
- Meg, stop shoving.

190
00:10:29,876 --> 00:10:31,252
You wouldn't even know
what to do with it.

191
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:33,290
He's closer to my age,
you cow.

192
00:10:34,207 --> 00:10:35,363
What the hell is this?

193
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:37,993
Oh, hi, Stewie.
We were just leaving.

194
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:40,280
I say, what the devil is all
the fuss about? I don't get it.

195
00:10:40,316 --> 00:10:43,002
What's in there?
Bing, bong! Hello!

196
00:10:44,657 --> 00:10:47,860
- Hey. What's goin' on?
- What the hell?! Get out of here!

197
00:10:47,895 --> 00:10:49,990
Well, we're on the same team.
We shower together.

198
00:10:50,037 --> 00:10:51,391
Yeah, in the locker room.

199
00:10:51,427 --> 00:10:53,641
- Yeah, yeah, come here, you.
- Ah, stop, knock it off.

200
00:10:53,656 --> 00:10:54,572
What are you crazy?

201
00:10:54,608 --> 00:10:57,392
We're just a couple of guys messing
around. That's what we are.

202
00:10:59,056 --> 00:11:01,170
Ooh, ooh, quiet, everybody,
my commercial's on.

203
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:04,580
Hi, I'm Peter Griffin
of the New England Patriots.

204
00:11:04,645 --> 00:11:08,062
I'm here to kick off the
Touchdown of Savings Weekend,

205
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:10,171
at Wilkins Hyundai and Subaru.

206
00:11:10,578 --> 00:11:13,733
We will blitz the competition,
and in no time,

207
00:11:13,787 --> 00:11:18,590
you'll be driving your new Hyundai
or Subaru right to a touchdown.

208
00:11:20,696 --> 00:11:23,962
<i>At Wilkins Hyundai
and Subaru</i>

209
00:11:24,055 --> 00:11:26,840
<i>We have Hyundais
and Subarus.</i>

210
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:32,213
Mom, the game's about to start.
Where's Dad?

211
00:11:32,257 --> 00:11:34,821
I don't know, Chris.
And I'm starting to get worried.

212
00:11:35,026 --> 00:11:37,582
I think all this success
might be going to his head.

213
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:40,911
Do you know he spent
$30,000 on a wax sculpture,

214
00:11:40,947 --> 00:11:43,403
of Harriet Tubman
doing Gwyneth Paltrow?

215
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:44,483
Yeah.

216
00:11:45,067 --> 00:11:47,452
Yeah, that is
happening for real.

217
00:11:47,565 --> 00:11:48,563
Yeah.

218
00:11:49,946 --> 00:11:51,501
I'll enjoy that more tomorrow.

219
00:11:52,575 --> 00:11:55,152
Where the hell is Griffin?
It's almost time for kickoff.

220
00:11:55,186 --> 00:11:57,042
Well, I guess we have
to start without him.

221
00:12:03,158 --> 00:12:06,570
What do you think, huh? I got this
for doing that car dealership ad.

222
00:12:06,655 --> 00:12:09,163
All right, enough messing around, huh?
Let's play this game.

223
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:11,052
Let's play
some football.

224
00:12:11,116 --> 00:12:13,472
Griffin, I'm getting really
tired of your cocky attitude.

225
00:12:13,485 --> 00:12:15,740
How many times have I told you,
no showboating?!

226
00:12:15,828 --> 00:12:19,180
Relax, Tom, I'm just having a little
fun. I got it under control.

227
00:12:19,296 --> 00:12:21,680
Okay, 28-Z right,
pitch left,

228
00:12:21,747 --> 00:12:23,572
on one, on one.
Ready? Break!

229
00:12:24,507 --> 00:12:28,492
Ready? Green 54! Green 54!
Set, hut, hut!

230
00:12:37,165 --> 00:12:38,610
Yeah!

231
00:12:38,856 --> 00:12:41,352
Huh, there might be some hope
for this guy after all.

232
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:46,310
Damn it, Griffin!
I said no showboating!

233
00:12:46,437 --> 00:12:48,560
This calls for a victory tune!

234
00:12:51,975 --> 00:12:55,502
Now, a woman who'll kiss on the very
first date is usually a hussy.

235
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:58,993
And a woman who'll kiss on the
second time out Is anything but fussy

236
00:12:59,075 --> 00:13:01,030
But a woman who'll wait
till the third time around

237
00:13:01,068 --> 00:13:02,793
Head in the clouds,
feet on the ground

238
00:13:02,867 --> 00:13:06,111
She's the girl he's glad he's found.
She's his Shipoopi

239
00:13:06,146 --> 00:13:06,146
She's the girl,
he's glad he's found

240
00:13:06,177 --> 00:13:08,623
Shipoopi, Shipoopi, Shipoopi

241
00:13:08,726 --> 00:13:10,372
The girl is hard to get.

242
00:13:10,487 --> 00:13:12,951
Shipoopi, Shipoopi, Shipoopi

243
00:13:13,047 --> 00:13:14,893
But you can win her yet

244
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:16,930
Walk around once,
just to raise the curtain.

245
00:13:16,935 --> 00:13:18,903
Walk around twice
and you're made for certain.

246
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:20,212
Once more in
the flower garden

247
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,220
She will never get sore
if you beg her pardon

248
00:13:24,018 --> 00:13:26,032
Do, re, mi, fa, so,
la, si, do

249
00:13:26,068 --> 00:13:27,510
Si, la, so, fa, mi, re, do

250
00:13:27,545 --> 00:13:29,283
Squeeze her once
when she isn't looking

251
00:13:29,315 --> 00:13:31,221
Get a squeeze back,
that's fancy cooking

252
00:13:31,265 --> 00:13:32,472
Once more for a pepper upper

253
00:13:32,485 --> 00:13:34,573
She will never get sore
on the way to supper

254
00:13:35,787 --> 00:13:38,403
Do, re, mi, fa, so,
la, si, do...

255
00:13:38,438 --> 00:13:39,321
Si, do

256
00:13:39,447 --> 00:13:43,333
Now little old Sal was a no-gal.
As anyone could see

257
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:46,443
Look at her now, she's a go-gal.
Who only goes for me

258
00:13:46,478 --> 00:13:48,683
Squeeze her once
when she isn't looking

259
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,460
Get a squeeze back,
that's fancy cooking

260
00:13:50,485 --> 00:13:52,073
Once more for a pepper upper

261
00:13:52,087 --> 00:13:53,983
She will never get sore
on the way to supper

262
00:13:54,018 --> 00:13:57,100
Do, re, mi, fa, so,
la, si, do, si, do.

263
00:13:57,155 --> 00:13:59,890
Shipoopi, Shipoopi, Shipoopi

264
00:13:59,977 --> 00:14:01,603
The girl is hard to get

265
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,230
Shipoopi, Shipoopi, Shipoopi

266
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,060
But you can win her yet

267
00:14:25,205 --> 00:14:26,942
No. No!

268
00:14:50,986 --> 00:14:53,080
Shipoopi, Shipoopi, Shipoopi

269
00:14:53,117 --> 00:14:54,803
The girl is hard to get

270
00:14:54,838 --> 00:14:57,570
Shipoopi, Shipoopi, Shipoopi

271
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:59,051
But you can win her yet

272
00:14:59,508 --> 00:15:02,842
You can win her...

273
00:15:02,908 --> 00:15:05,943
Yet...

274
00:15:07,068 --> 00:15:08,083
Shipoopi!

275
00:15:08,727 --> 00:15:10,102
All right.

276
00:15:10,165 --> 00:15:11,771
I made a touchdown.

277
00:15:11,968 --> 00:15:13,791
Griffin, you're fired!

278
00:15:13,885 --> 00:15:16,230
- For what?
- We've had it with your crap.

279
00:15:16,275 --> 00:15:19,352
I talked to the coach and he's selling
your contract to another team.

280
00:15:19,406 --> 00:15:21,002
And the only one that'll take you,

281
00:15:21,008 --> 00:15:22,733
is the worst football team in Europe:

282
00:15:22,836 --> 00:15:24,542
The London Silly Nannies.

283
00:15:29,908 --> 00:15:31,682
So, Brian, we're even now, right?

284
00:15:31,736 --> 00:15:33,580
Ready to start
a new life in England.

285
00:15:33,595 --> 00:15:35,973
I've got my money, your wounds
have healed up nicely.

286
00:15:36,005 --> 00:15:38,101
What do you say we let
bygones be bygones, hmm?

287
00:15:38,155 --> 00:15:41,362
You shot me in both my
knees then lit me on fire.

288
00:15:41,446 --> 00:15:43,150
- Piss off.
- All right, all right.

289
00:15:43,168 --> 00:15:46,201
I tell you what, you get
one free revenge shot at me.

290
00:15:46,306 --> 00:15:46,893
Okay.

291
00:15:47,145 --> 00:15:48,791
But I'm not gonna tell you
when it's coming.

292
00:15:53,955 --> 00:15:55,753
Ah, this is
gonna be fun.

293
00:15:55,885 --> 00:15:57,493
Peter, this is crazy.

294
00:15:57,526 --> 00:16:00,640
Isn't there any way the Patriots
could let you back on the team?

295
00:16:00,677 --> 00:16:02,643
Nah, they said
the decision was final.

296
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,731
It's all right, Lois,
I can make the best of this.

297
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,143
I mean, a British football team
can't be that bad.

298
00:16:09,328 --> 00:16:11,201
Uh, excuse me. Hey, there. Hi.

299
00:16:11,225 --> 00:16:13,491
I'm, uh, Peter Griffin.
I'm your new player.

300
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,870
Oh, yes, Peter,
welcome to the Silly Nannies.

301
00:16:15,896 --> 00:16:18,490
I'm the quarterback, Lesley.
This is our team.

302
00:16:21,345 --> 00:16:22,760
If you'll marry me

303
00:16:22,766 --> 00:16:24,292
I'll dig for you and rake for you

304
00:16:24,328 --> 00:16:25,710
If you'll marry me

305
00:16:25,725 --> 00:16:27,370
I'll scrub for you and bake for you

306
00:16:27,418 --> 00:16:28,722
If you'll marry me

307
00:16:28,768 --> 00:16:30,353
All others I'll forsake for you

308
00:16:30,385 --> 00:16:33,433
All this will I do
if you'll marry me

309
00:16:33,496 --> 00:16:36,680
All this will I do
If you'll marry me.

310
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,371
Oh, crap.

311
00:16:41,236 --> 00:16:44,711
Well, I guess living in a London flat
isn't gonna be too bad, huh?

312
00:16:44,766 --> 00:16:46,860
Mom, there's no water in the toilet.

313
00:16:46,896 --> 00:16:49,192
First of all, Chris, it's called a loo.

314
00:16:49,327 --> 00:16:50,871
Second, there's no water in it,

315
00:16:50,878 --> 00:16:53,392
because everybody here
just uses Elizabeth Hurley.

316
00:16:53,507 --> 00:16:56,193
All right, well, where is she?
'Cause I need her now!

317
00:16:57,746 --> 00:16:59,532
You're watching BBC 4.

318
00:17:02,118 --> 00:17:05,251
Ellen, there's moisture on
the outside of my glass.

319
00:17:05,297 --> 00:17:07,201
It's condensation, Johnny.

320
00:17:07,457 --> 00:17:09,851
But what about the fog
on the windows?

321
00:17:09,886 --> 00:17:11,542
It's not fog, Johnny.

322
00:17:12,007 --> 00:17:14,462
It, too, is called condensation.

323
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,880
Con-den-sation.

324
00:17:16,918 --> 00:17:18,152
<i>sation-sation-sation</i>

325
00:17:19,397 --> 00:17:22,473
Hey, Peter, how was your first
Silly Nannies practice?

326
00:17:22,517 --> 00:17:24,001
It sucked, Lois.

327
00:17:24,045 --> 00:17:26,431
Those Silly Nannies are
just a bunch of losers.

328
00:17:26,485 --> 00:17:28,001
Pack your bags, we're going home.

329
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,413
What, you're just giving up?

330
00:17:29,457 --> 00:17:31,233
Look, Peter, I know you're upset

331
00:17:31,248 --> 00:17:34,150
because you blew your opportunity
with the Patriots but...

332
00:17:34,518 --> 00:17:36,960
This is your chance
to redeem yourself.

333
00:17:37,178 --> 00:17:40,472
Now I bet if you really tried,
you could turn that team around.

334
00:17:40,505 --> 00:17:41,890
You know what, Lois?

335
00:17:41,918 --> 00:17:44,710
When you were talking about
that sale at T.J. Maxx just now,

336
00:17:44,727 --> 00:17:46,061
I came up with an idea.

337
00:17:46,176 --> 00:17:48,410
I am gonna turn that team around.

338
00:17:48,508 --> 00:17:50,651
And we'll challenge
the Patriots to a game,

339
00:17:50,665 --> 00:17:51,900
and we'll kick their ass!

340
00:17:54,777 --> 00:17:56,913
Oh, man, what an attractive woman.

341
00:17:57,615 --> 00:17:59,433
- Hello?
- Hey, Brady!

342
00:17:59,468 --> 00:18:01,450
- You're dead!
- Listen, Leno!

343
00:18:01,478 --> 00:18:04,490
You keep calling here and threatening
me, I'm gonna notify the police.

344
00:18:04,528 --> 00:18:06,591
Leno? No, no,
this is Peter Griffin.

345
00:18:06,617 --> 00:18:09,043
I'm calling to challenge you
to a grudge match

346
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:11,653
between the Patriots and
the London Silly Nannies.

347
00:18:11,726 --> 00:18:13,151
Huh. Well, Griffin.

348
00:18:13,155 --> 00:18:15,350
If you want to embarrass
yourself, be my guest.

349
00:18:15,388 --> 00:18:17,200
Good. What do you
say, England?

350
00:18:17,235 --> 00:18:19,363
- Two weeks from now?
- See you there.

351
00:18:21,195 --> 00:18:22,652
- Hello?
- Hey, Brady!

352
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,742
What kind of suit you
want to be buried in?

353
00:18:33,435 --> 00:18:35,190
Oh, you kids are gonna love this.

354
00:18:35,207 --> 00:18:37,801
England has such a rich heritage
of great theater.

355
00:18:39,287 --> 00:18:41,421
Cramsat on the bingum
with the gam gum?

356
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:43,621
Treaches on the upper
with the trang sang.

357
00:18:45,107 --> 00:18:47,053
Croppers to you,
you crang sang lover.

358
00:18:50,017 --> 00:18:51,623
She rogered the boogley!

359
00:18:55,045 --> 00:18:57,621
All right, now listen up,
you limey bum sniffers.

360
00:18:57,676 --> 00:18:59,772
If we're gonna beat the New England
Patriots next week,

361
00:18:59,776 --> 00:19:00,930
I got to toughen you up.

362
00:19:01,096 --> 00:19:04,000
So you're gonna get in shape
the way American athletes do:

363
00:19:04,087 --> 00:19:05,741
Taking steroids.

364
00:19:05,988 --> 00:19:09,332
I say, Jenkins, you give me
that dirty look one more time,

365
00:19:09,347 --> 00:19:12,441
and I've a good mind to get into my PJ's
and have a pillow fight with you.

366
00:19:12,498 --> 00:19:14,050
Very well,
then. En garde!

367
00:19:16,176 --> 00:19:17,600
- I like your gown.
- I like yours.

368
00:19:26,968 --> 00:19:28,711
When's the beating
gonna come, Brian?

369
00:19:28,788 --> 00:19:31,052
Just tell me when it's gonna come!
Just do something, anything!

370
00:19:31,098 --> 00:19:32,772
Look, look, I'll do it.
I'll do it first.

371
00:19:33,977 --> 00:19:35,452
Look, look, I'll do it even worse.

372
00:19:36,287 --> 00:19:38,042
Oh, oh, oh, look how hurt I am.

373
00:19:38,956 --> 00:19:39,870
We're even now!

374
00:19:45,337 --> 00:19:46,992
You're going down, Brady!

375
00:19:47,025 --> 00:19:49,491
You're the one who's
going down, Griffin!

376
00:19:49,577 --> 00:19:50,533
What the hell?

377
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,783
Those men are tremendous
in stature.

378
00:20:00,806 --> 00:20:02,691
And they're coming
straight at us!

379
00:20:06,336 --> 00:20:07,631
We'll take my carriage!

380
00:20:11,337 --> 00:20:12,251
Ah, crap.

381
00:20:12,366 --> 00:20:14,420
Well, I'm still here,
you bastards!

382
00:20:14,465 --> 00:20:15,591
So let's do this!

383
00:20:21,975 --> 00:20:25,511
Oh. Hey, Brady. You gonna gloat
and call me a loser now?

384
00:20:25,586 --> 00:20:27,562
Actually, Peter, you're
not a loser at all.

385
00:20:27,687 --> 00:20:29,723
What you did just now
was pretty ballsy.

386
00:20:29,808 --> 00:20:31,581
- Really?
- Absolutely!

387
00:20:31,676 --> 00:20:35,342
For one guy to stand up to the entire
New England Patriots team,

388
00:20:35,448 --> 00:20:36,692
that's a winner in my book.

389
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:41,490
Wow. Thanks, Tom Brady.

390
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:44,960
Peter! Oh, my God,
are you all right?

391
00:20:45,016 --> 00:20:46,712
- Yeah.
- Can you move your legs?

392
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,583
- Yeah.
- Oh, good.

393
00:20:48,735 --> 00:20:50,421
I thought you were gonna be a vegetable.

394
00:20:50,438 --> 00:20:51,891
And I got to tell you, Peter,

395
00:20:51,937 --> 00:20:54,453
I- I just don't think
I have it in me.

396
00:20:54,725 --> 00:20:56,783
I mean, if you can't move,
it's over.

397
00:20:56,868 --> 00:20:58,750
I love you,
too, honey.

398
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:00,272
Let's go home.

399
00:21:06,696 --> 00:21:07,802
