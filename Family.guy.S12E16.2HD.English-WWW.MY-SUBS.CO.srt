ANNOUNCER: We now return
to VH1's <i>Behind the Music:</i>

13
00:00:36,021 --> 00:00:38,289
<i>Dr. Teeth</i>
<i>and the Electric Mayhem.</i>

14
00:00:38,323 --> 00:00:41,458
It must've been around 1979
when Animal started

15
00:00:41,493 --> 00:00:43,527
snorting crushed-up
pieces of felt.

16
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:44,962
It got pretty ugly.

17
00:00:44,996 --> 00:00:48,465
Me had big problem
before me found God.

18
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,034
He, like, threw me down
and he said,

19
00:00:50,068 --> 00:00:51,802
"I hope your puppeteer
has big hands,

20
00:00:51,836 --> 00:00:53,704
because I'm not using lube."

21
00:00:53,738 --> 00:00:56,840
Me no remember that,
but me believe it happened.

22
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:58,676
(knocking)
I got it.

23
00:01:00,779 --> 00:01:03,080
Huh, it says "Glenn Quagmire."

24
00:01:03,114 --> 00:01:05,716
But if you squint and imagine
it says "Peter Griffin,"

25
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,717
it says "Peter Griffin."

26
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:07,952
Peter, it's Quagmire's.

27
00:01:07,986 --> 00:01:09,119
Take it next door.

28
00:01:09,154 --> 00:01:10,187
Now, now, hold on, Lois.

29
00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:12,523
Now, this poses a very
difficult ethical dilemma.

30
00:01:12,557 --> 00:01:15,025
Do I deliver the package
to its rightful owner?

31
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,661
Or do I open it up and see
if it contains He-Mans?

32
00:01:17,696 --> 00:01:19,630
Do not open that box.

33
00:01:19,664 --> 00:01:20,985
You know, Lois,
physicists believe

34
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:22,733
there are two
alternate universes:

35
00:01:22,767 --> 00:01:24,601
one in which I don't
open the box

36
00:01:24,636 --> 00:01:26,203
and one in which I do.

37
00:01:26,237 --> 00:01:28,605
I'm not gonna open the box.

38
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,541
I'm gonna open the box.

39
00:01:30,575 --> 00:01:33,043
Aw, sweet! It's a whip!

40
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:35,045
Peter, be careful
with that thing!

41
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,914
Remember, we're renting
this house.

42
00:01:36,948 --> 00:01:38,248
That's depressing.

43
00:01:38,283 --> 00:01:40,150
Wow, I haven't felt
this powerful

44
00:01:40,185 --> 00:01:43,721
since I got to decide which
ant lives and which ant dies.

45
00:01:43,755 --> 00:01:45,122
You shall battle to the death,

46
00:01:45,156 --> 00:01:47,091
and the winner
will be given his freedom.

47
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:49,059
Why are you looking
at me like that?

48
00:01:49,094 --> 00:01:50,861
Peter, would you like
a glass of...?

49
00:01:50,895 --> 00:01:52,129
Oh, my God!

50
00:01:52,163 --> 00:01:55,566
I told you not to play God
with those ants!

51
00:01:58,937 --> 00:02:01,105
All right, Meg,
stay incredibly still.

52
00:02:01,139 --> 00:02:03,019
I'm gonna whip that cigarette
out of your mouth.

53
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:04,808
And maybe not slice
your face in half.

54
00:02:04,843 --> 00:02:06,410
Dad, I don't
want to do this.

55
00:02:06,444 --> 00:02:07,411
Stay still!

56
00:02:07,445 --> 00:02:08,479
Aah!

57
00:02:08,513 --> 00:02:10,748
Okay, tha-that's
pretty cool, too.

58
00:02:10,782 --> 00:02:13,083
Hey, Dad, that's
a cool hwhip.

59
00:02:13,118 --> 00:02:16,020
Aah! I thought
you couldn't understand me!

71
00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:37,674
Thanks. That was way
too much heat on my neck.

72
00:02:42,614 --> 00:02:44,148
Ooh, a message from Joe.

73
00:02:44,182 --> 00:02:45,049
JOE:
Hey, Cleveland.

74
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,917
I just wanted
to give you a heads-up

75
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:49,586
that Peter has a whip,
because, well, you know,

76
00:02:49,621 --> 00:02:52,556
given your racial heritage,
it seems like something

77
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,925
you might want
to keep an eye out for.

78
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,126
(knocking)

79
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:57,327
Grape soda-gram.

80
00:02:57,362 --> 00:02:59,096
I know this is very risky,

81
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,466
but the upside is so good,
I'm taking it.

82
00:03:06,438 --> 00:03:09,673
ANNOUNCER: We now return
to <i>The Outlaw Josey Wales.</i>

83
00:03:09,707 --> 00:03:11,341
Should we bury them?

84
00:03:11,376 --> 00:03:13,444
Nah, leave them
for the buzzards.

85
00:03:13,478 --> 00:03:14,445
I like that guy.

86
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,680
Oh, boy, here comes Harry.

87
00:03:16,714 --> 00:03:19,216
He thinks no one will notice
he got his neck done.

88
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,885
Hey, fellas, I'm back
from that family wedding.

89
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,687
(groans)

90
00:03:23,721 --> 00:03:24,755
Hey, what you watching?

91
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:26,090
<i>The Outlaw Josey Wales.</i>

92
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:27,558
It's a Western.
Ah.

93
00:03:27,592 --> 00:03:29,126
When do the cowboys
go into the tent,

94
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:32,496
Different kind of Western.

95
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:37,701
Ew! What's Clint Eastwood
doing with that Indian chief?

96
00:03:37,735 --> 00:03:39,136
Oh, they're-they're just
becoming blood brothers.

97
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,105
"Blood brothers"?
What the devil is that?

98
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:42,940
Well, it's an ancient ritual
where two friends

99
00:03:42,974 --> 00:03:45,042
intermingle their blood,
thus sealing a bond

100
00:03:45,076 --> 00:03:46,643
even deeper than friendship.

101
00:03:46,678 --> 00:03:47,845
Yes, yes. Let's do that.

102
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,613
Brian, I want you inside me.

103
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:51,115
You-you don't have
to say it like that.

104
00:03:51,149 --> 00:03:52,669
Oh, come on, we're
best friends, right?

105
00:03:52,684 --> 00:03:53,884
Stewie, I'm not...

106
00:03:53,918 --> 00:03:55,285
Actually, we're even
more than best friends.

107
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,920
I mean, we share
the same home.

108
00:03:56,955 --> 00:03:58,789
We've been on countless
adventures together.

109
00:03:58,823 --> 00:04:00,190
And, besides, you
owe me, Brian.

110
00:04:00,225 --> 00:04:03,060
Remember what you did to
my last Halloween costume?

111
00:04:03,094 --> 00:04:05,429
I am going to be
the cutest fire hydrant

112
00:04:05,463 --> 00:04:07,531
in the whole... Aah!
What are you doing?!

113
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,566
(grunts)

114
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:11,902
Okay, your turn.

115
00:04:11,936 --> 00:04:14,771
(groans)

116
00:04:14,806 --> 00:04:16,406
I think we should
hold hands more often.

117
00:04:16,441 --> 00:04:17,841
There you go,
we're blood brothers now.

118
00:04:17,876 --> 00:04:19,009
You happy?

119
00:04:19,043 --> 00:04:20,077
Actually, yes.

120
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:22,146
I mean, I really
feel the bond, Brian.

121
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,413
I feel like we're closer now.

122
00:04:23,448 --> 00:04:25,716
You know, more connected,
more intertwined.

123
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,117
Yeah, I guess in a way we are.

124
00:04:27,152 --> 00:04:29,153
Hey, are-are you blood
brothers with Meg

125
00:04:29,187 --> 00:04:31,088
because you ate her
tampon out of the trash?

126
00:04:31,122 --> 00:04:33,724
No, tha... no, that's...
that's something else.

127
00:04:36,794 --> 00:04:38,529
Oh, man, I could
use a cold beer.

128
00:04:38,563 --> 00:04:41,298
Yeah, me, too.
I just had a killer rehearsal.

129
00:04:41,332 --> 00:04:43,066
I'm not biting.
Me, neither.

130
00:04:43,101 --> 00:04:45,435
You forget
how many scenes Tevye's in.

131
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:48,172
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's this?

132
00:04:48,206 --> 00:04:50,240
That's our booth!

133
00:04:50,275 --> 00:04:52,142
Uh, uh, excuse me.
Hey, fellas.

134
00:04:52,177 --> 00:04:54,018
Uh, hey, listen, this is,
uh, a little awkward,

135
00:04:54,045 --> 00:04:56,180
but, uh, you guys
are sitting in our booth.

136
00:04:56,214 --> 00:04:57,481
Listen here, pencil neck.

137
00:04:57,515 --> 00:04:59,349
This is our booth now,
and we ain't leaving.

138
00:04:59,384 --> 00:05:01,618
So, what are you gonna
do about it, bitch?

139
00:05:01,653 --> 00:05:03,587
Look, dudes, clearly
you don't want to move.

140
00:05:03,621 --> 00:05:04,788
And that's fine.

141
00:05:04,822 --> 00:05:06,256
We'll come back in an hour.

142
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:09,293
Nice try, wheelie, but this
ain't your booth no more.

143
00:05:09,327 --> 00:05:11,828
That's right, we see you losers
anywhere near this booth,

144
00:05:11,863 --> 00:05:13,830
and we'll bust your kneecap.

145
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:15,232
We're willing to take that risk.

146
00:05:15,266 --> 00:05:16,233
Shut up, Joe.

147
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:17,568
All right,
I was hoping

148
00:05:17,602 --> 00:05:19,636
it wouldn't have
to come to this, but...

149
00:05:19,671 --> 00:05:22,039
you fellas are in big trouble.

150
00:05:24,676 --> 00:05:27,611
If, uh... if you could just
move back like eight feet.

151
00:05:27,645 --> 00:05:29,279
Is that my whip?

152
00:05:29,314 --> 00:05:30,280
Hey!

153
00:05:30,315 --> 00:05:32,416
Is that my Taser?

154
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,770
All right, I'll just strangle
him with this Hawaiian shirt.

155
00:05:34,786 --> 00:05:36,653
Will you stop going
through my mail?!

156
00:05:36,688 --> 00:05:38,889
All right, bitches, either
you tuck your little wangs

157
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:40,724
between your legs and
waddle out of here

158
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:43,126
or we're gonna beat
the crap out of you.

159
00:05:43,161 --> 00:05:45,128
So, what's it gonna be?

160
00:05:45,163 --> 00:05:47,531
Uh, I think we're gonna
do the wang thing.

161
00:05:55,273 --> 00:05:57,841
(yawns)

162
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,576
(gasps)

163
00:05:59,611 --> 00:06:01,378
What the hell?

164
00:06:01,412 --> 00:06:03,013
Ow!

165
00:06:03,047 --> 00:06:04,081
Ew!

166
00:06:04,115 --> 00:06:05,649
What's this?

167
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:08,418
(Stewie yells)

168
00:06:08,453 --> 00:06:09,486
(rapid footsteps approaching)

169
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,854
You son of a bitch!

170
00:06:10,888 --> 00:06:11,989
You gave me herpes!

171
00:06:12,023 --> 00:06:13,423
What?
What are you talking about?

172
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,092
When we swapped blood!
Look at my lip!

173
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:16,927
It's a disgusting herpes sore!

174
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:17,995
And now I have some

175
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:20,564
very uncomfortable
phone calls to make.

176
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:22,032
(phone ringing)

177
00:06:22,066 --> 00:06:23,567
<i>Hola.</i> Handy Manny's
repair shop.

178
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:25,068
You break it...

179
00:06:25,103 --> 00:06:26,470
TOOLS:
We fix it!

180
00:06:26,504 --> 00:06:27,938
STEWIE:
Manny? Manny?

181
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:30,207
I'm gonna need you to take me
off speakerphone for this.

182
00:06:35,344 --> 00:06:36,477
Stewie, that's crazy!

183
00:06:36,511 --> 00:06:37,845
There's no way
I gave you herpes.

184
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:39,513
Then how do you explain this?!

185
00:06:39,548 --> 00:06:42,083
I don't know. You're a gross slut.
(gasps)

186
00:06:42,117 --> 00:06:43,351
Look, it-it can't be
my fault, Stewie.

187
00:06:43,385 --> 00:06:44,418
I don't even have herpes.

188
00:06:44,453 --> 00:06:45,853
Oh, yeah? Let me see!

189
00:06:45,887 --> 00:06:47,955
Hey, hey, hey! What are
you doing? Stop it!

190
00:06:49,624 --> 00:06:52,093
Ugh! Oh, my God!
Look at you!

191
00:06:52,127 --> 00:06:53,861
You're more herpes
than dog!

192
00:06:53,895 --> 00:06:55,096
Okay, fine! I admit it.

193
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,297
I gave you herpes.

194
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:57,832
You bastard!

195
00:06:57,866 --> 00:06:59,867
You knew you had herpes,
and-and you still agreed

196
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:01,369
to swap blood with me!

197
00:07:01,403 --> 00:07:02,937
Relax, it's not
that big a deal.

198
00:07:02,971 --> 00:07:04,405
Not that big a deal?!

199
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:07,108
It's a disgusting,
unsightly, unsavory disease,

200
00:07:07,142 --> 00:07:08,476
and it lasts for life!

201
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,544
Yeah, but, you know, I mean,
isn't the worst thing

202
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:12,380
about herpes just the stigma?

203
00:07:12,414 --> 00:07:14,315
I mean, like, what if it
wasn't called "herpes"?

204
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:16,484
Like-like, what if it was
called "boppo," huh?

205
00:07:16,518 --> 00:07:17,718
Oh, I got a little boppo.

206
00:07:17,753 --> 00:07:19,420
Oh, that's cute.
Ah, I want boppo.

207
00:07:19,454 --> 00:07:20,921
You know, my uncle
was in the Army,

208
00:07:20,956 --> 00:07:23,057
and he got genital boppo
from a Saigon whore...

209
00:07:23,091 --> 00:07:24,358
Shut up! Just shut up!

210
00:07:24,393 --> 00:07:25,593
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

211
00:07:25,627 --> 00:07:26,761
I mean, look at me.

212
00:07:26,795 --> 00:07:28,963
And on the same day
I'm supposed to help

213
00:07:28,997 --> 00:07:31,031
with my friend's
wedding invitations.

214
00:07:31,066 --> 00:07:32,666
So, I was thinking, I know

215
00:07:32,701 --> 00:07:34,869
they're kind of
overused lately...

216
00:07:34,903 --> 00:07:38,372
but your colors should be,
like, yellow and gray.

217
00:07:41,877 --> 00:07:44,078
You know, I've always been
against destination weddings,

218
00:07:44,112 --> 00:07:51,452
but it's nice
to finally see Denver.

219
00:07:51,486 --> 00:07:53,454
ANNOUNCER: And now, The History Channel
presents

220
00:07:53,488 --> 00:07:57,324
<i>The Guy who Lived In-Between</i>
<i>the Hatfields and the McCoys.</i>

221
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,960
I'm just going to get my mail.

222
00:07:59,995 --> 00:08:02,096
And I'm not going to ask
who killed my daughter.

223
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,264
It's water under the bridge.

224
00:08:03,298 --> 00:08:04,899
I'm just getting my mail.

225
00:08:04,933 --> 00:08:06,267
Aw, what happened?
I couldn't see.

226
00:08:06,301 --> 00:08:07,435
I have no idea.

227
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:09,570
The TV is, like,
directly over my head.

228
00:08:09,604 --> 00:08:11,505
All I can see
are the spider veins

229
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,607
of alcoholics wearing shorts.

230
00:08:16,144 --> 00:08:18,012
What?
I said...

231
00:08:18,046 --> 00:08:18,879
Huh?

232
00:08:18,914 --> 00:08:20,214
All I can see is...

233
00:08:20,248 --> 00:08:21,348
What? You can't see what?

234
00:08:21,383 --> 00:08:22,416
I can only see...

235
00:08:22,451 --> 00:08:23,651
What? Damn it, Peter!

236
00:08:23,685 --> 00:08:24,685
Ow!

237
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:25,820
Joe, what are you
trying to say?!

238
00:08:25,854 --> 00:08:26,954
Eh, it doesn't matter.

239
00:08:26,988 --> 00:08:28,989
I just...
I hate sitting at the bar.

240
00:08:29,024 --> 00:08:30,558
I wish we had
our old booth back.

241
00:08:30,592 --> 00:08:31,625
Well, what are we
supposed to do?

242
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,560
Fight those guys?

243
00:08:32,594 --> 00:08:34,061
They would've kicked our asses.

244
00:08:34,095 --> 00:08:35,496
Peter's right.

245
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,665
We just got to accept
the fact that, well,

246
00:08:37,699 --> 00:08:39,700
we're... we're
kind of cowards.

247
00:08:39,734 --> 00:08:40,701
I know.

248
00:08:40,735 --> 00:08:41,569
Yesterday, I even went

249
00:08:41,603 --> 00:08:43,571
Cowards Anonymous meeting.

250
00:08:43,605 --> 00:08:45,840
Hello. My name's Cowardly Lion,

251
00:08:45,874 --> 00:08:47,374
and I'm a coward.

252
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:49,210
I'm afraid of
small dogs,

253
00:08:49,244 --> 00:08:51,178
girls with pigtails,
flying monkeys...

254
00:08:51,213 --> 00:08:53,347
Wait-wait, th-there's...
there's flying monkeys?

255
00:08:53,381 --> 00:08:55,282
That's a thing?
Sure.

256
00:08:55,317 --> 00:08:57,017
They got sharp
fangs, claws...

257
00:08:57,052 --> 00:08:58,786
God, they sound terrifying!

258
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,254
Wait, you think so, too?

259
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:03,424
Yes, and fear is a logical
response to actual danger.

260
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,893
Huh. I guess you're right.

261
00:09:06,928 --> 00:09:08,829
Hey. I'm the Rational Lion.

262
00:09:08,864 --> 00:09:10,865
So, (bleep) guys.

263
00:09:15,437 --> 00:09:17,238
Whew, what a morning.

264
00:09:17,272 --> 00:09:19,106
By the time I got done
with my pubes,

265
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,774
I just didn't feel
like shaving anymore.

266
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:22,276
Hey, Charlotte.

267
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,745
That's very cute, Stewie,
but if I let you dress up

268
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:27,681
like Héctor Elizondo,
I have to let everyone.

269
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,918
(gasps)
Oh, my God!

270
00:09:30,952 --> 00:09:34,154
Your mouth looks like
the underside of a boat!

271
00:09:34,189 --> 00:09:35,322
(all scream)

272
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:37,525
Good Lord, nobody wants
to be near me.

273
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:40,394
This is lonelier
than a Kennedy family reunion.

274
00:09:40,428 --> 00:09:42,897
Where is everybody?

275
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:44,865
Oh, yeah, they're dead.

276
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,834
(gunshot)

277
00:09:49,905 --> 00:09:52,840
All right, flight attendants,
please prepare for crosscheck.

278
00:09:52,874 --> 00:09:54,375
I'm not crosschecking anything.

279
00:09:54,409 --> 00:09:56,777
I heard what happened
to you at The Drunken Clam.

280
00:09:56,811 --> 00:09:58,946
I'm not doing
what you tell me to do.

281
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,681
I'll do what he tells me to do.

282
00:10:00,715 --> 00:10:02,449
I was in the military
for 30 years

283
00:10:02,484 --> 00:10:03,584
back when that
meant something.

284
00:10:03,618 --> 00:10:05,419
I don't deal
with gay people.

285
00:10:05,453 --> 00:10:07,955
See? Him I respect.

286
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:12,426
Hey, Bonnie,
you want to fool around?

287
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,761
I bought one of those

288
00:10:13,795 --> 00:10:15,462
crippled-guy robot suits
from <i>Avatar,</i>

289
00:10:15,497 --> 00:10:17,364
so now I can be on top.

290
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,832
No, thanks, Joe.

291
00:10:18,867 --> 00:10:20,501
I heard about what
happened at the Clam,

292
00:10:20,535 --> 00:10:22,336
and I'm not interested
in having sex

293
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,004
with a quarter of a man.

294
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,539
Hey, I'm half a man!

295
00:10:25,574 --> 00:10:27,374
Not anymore.

296
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:30,844
Fine. Well, I'm gonna
go sleep on the couch.

297
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:32,179
You need something, Joe?

298
00:10:32,213 --> 00:10:34,448
Yes, Elton, I'd like
to sleep on the couch.

299
00:10:34,482 --> 00:10:36,483
All right, Joe. Come on.

300
00:10:39,087 --> 00:10:40,788
♪ Love lift us up

301
00:10:40,822 --> 00:10:43,490
♪ Where we belong.

302
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:48,329
Hey, Chris, your mom's
done with the laundry.

303
00:10:48,363 --> 00:10:49,463
Can you help her fold?

304
00:10:49,497 --> 00:10:51,031
No, but you know what?

305
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:52,433
You put on her bra.

306
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:53,834
I-I don't want to.

307
00:10:53,868 --> 00:10:55,035
Well, you're gonna.

308
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,110
Everybody heard about what
happened over at the Clam

309
00:10:57,138 --> 00:10:59,173
and how those guys
made you their bitch.

310
00:10:59,207 --> 00:11:00,908
Um, okay.

311
00:11:00,942 --> 00:11:03,077
(whimpering)

312
00:11:03,111 --> 00:11:04,478
That's right, you wuss.

313
00:11:04,512 --> 00:11:06,046
In fact,
the way I see it,

314
00:11:06,081 --> 00:11:07,581
I'm the man
of the house now.

315
00:11:07,616 --> 00:11:09,016
Which means
there's gonna be

316
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:12,252
some big changes
around here.

317
00:11:12,287 --> 00:11:14,321
It's not very
comfortable, Chris.

318
00:11:14,356 --> 00:11:15,723
My back kind of hurts.

319
00:11:15,757 --> 00:11:17,558
I'm just staring up
at the ceiling.

320
00:11:17,592 --> 00:11:18,692
Shut up!

321
00:11:18,727 --> 00:11:21,261
I promised changes,
and I delivered!

322
00:11:24,966 --> 00:11:28,268
ANNOUNCER: We now return
to <i>Bryan Cranston Sneezes.</i>

323
00:11:28,303 --> 00:11:30,137
(sneezes)

324
00:11:30,171 --> 00:11:31,972
Thank you.

325
00:11:33,608 --> 00:11:35,309
Um, Rupert?

326
00:11:35,343 --> 00:11:38,612
You know how we promised
never to lie to each other?

327
00:11:38,647 --> 00:11:40,581
Well, I lied earlier tonight.

328
00:11:40,615 --> 00:11:43,550
It's not a burn from
Dunkin' Donuts coffee.

329
00:11:43,585 --> 00:11:44,618
It's herpes.

330
00:11:44,653 --> 00:11:46,253
You should get yourself tested.

331
00:11:46,287 --> 00:11:47,454
CHRIS:
Hey, Stewie.

332
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:49,089
(gasps) How long have you
been there?

333
00:11:49,124 --> 00:11:50,658
Long enough to know
you have herpes

334
00:11:50,692 --> 00:11:52,660
and do weird stuff
with your teddy bear.

335
00:11:52,694 --> 00:11:54,328
Yeah, no,
he does weird stuff.

336
00:11:54,362 --> 00:11:55,996
I-I just don't stop him.

337
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:59,166
Yeah, well, I just wanted to
let you know you're not alone.

338
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,601
Oh, yeah? How so?

339
00:12:03,171 --> 00:12:05,272
Good Lord!
You've got herpes, too?

340
00:12:05,306 --> 00:12:08,575
This house is like backstage
at a Whitesnake concert!

341
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:11,245
Not only that, but I
also got it from Brian.

342
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,980
We're blood brothers, too.

343
00:12:13,014 --> 00:12:14,648
You... you are?

344
00:12:14,683 --> 00:12:17,551
Yup, he knew he had herpes
and he didn't say anything.

345
00:12:17,585 --> 00:12:19,319
Maybe he was mad
I gave him fleas.

346
00:12:19,354 --> 00:12:20,621
I don't know.

347
00:12:20,655 --> 00:12:21,955
That bastard!

348
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,657
Well, we need
to teach him a lesson.

349
00:12:23,692 --> 00:12:24,792
He's a menace.

350
00:12:24,826 --> 00:12:27,628
Like that coked-up giraffe
at Studio 54.

351
00:12:28,596 --> 00:12:30,297
Yup, yup, people are watching.

352
00:12:30,331 --> 00:12:32,466
I'm that good.

353
00:12:36,905 --> 00:12:38,138
Are you Donna Summer?

354
00:12:38,173 --> 00:12:39,206
Why, yes, I am.

355
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,275
I just want to thank you
for helping me reach

356
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:44,411
a state of cocaine-fueled
1970s euphoria.

357
00:12:44,446 --> 00:12:45,946
Robert Mapplethorpe?

358
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,148
Can I put this fire extinguisher
someplace interesting

359
00:12:48,183 --> 00:12:49,750
and take your picture?

360
00:12:49,784 --> 00:12:51,885
I would love that!

361
00:13:00,195 --> 00:13:02,496
Um, uh, Meg,
can you, um...

362
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,831
can you please
pass the milk?

363
00:13:03,865 --> 00:13:04,832
Shut up, Dad.

364
00:13:04,866 --> 00:13:05,899
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

365
00:13:05,934 --> 00:13:07,334
I'm sorry. I'll shut up.
What?!

366
00:13:07,368 --> 00:13:08,368
She-she's right, Lois.
She's right.

367
00:13:08,403 --> 00:13:09,570
I-I don't need milk.

368
00:13:09,604 --> 00:13:11,505
I'll just moisten
my cereal with spit.

369
00:13:11,539 --> 00:13:12,372
(spits)

370
00:13:12,407 --> 00:13:14,007
Mmm, mmm, good spit.

371
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:15,943
Peter, what the
hell is going on?

372
00:13:15,977 --> 00:13:18,245
Please tell me this isn't still
about how you punked out

373
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:19,980
in front of those
guys at the Clam.

374
00:13:20,014 --> 00:13:21,115
Oh, God, you're angry.

375
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:22,149
I'll clean the dishes.

376
00:13:22,183 --> 00:13:23,784
Peter, stop it!

377
00:13:23,818 --> 00:13:25,652
Are... are you crying?

378
00:13:25,687 --> 00:13:26,653
(crying):
No!

379
00:13:26,688 --> 00:13:27,921
Oh, this is insane.

380
00:13:27,956 --> 00:13:30,190
Peter, I want you
to march down to the Clam

381
00:13:30,225 --> 00:13:32,926
right now and get
your booth back.

382
00:13:32,961 --> 00:13:34,962
Oh my God, Lois, you're right.

383
00:13:34,996 --> 00:13:37,865
If they see me crying, they'll
have to give us our booth back.

384
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:41,068
No! I'm saying you got to go
down there and take it back.

385
00:13:41,102 --> 00:13:42,669
Like a man.

386
00:13:42,704 --> 00:13:45,072
Yeah.
I mean, I mean, yeah!

387
00:13:45,106 --> 00:13:47,474
I am going to the Clam and
I'm getting my booth back.

388
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:48,842
And, Meg, you're gay.

389
00:13:48,877 --> 00:13:49,843
No, I'm not.

390
00:13:49,878 --> 00:13:50,844
You like guys, right?

391
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:51,712
Yeah.

392
00:13:51,746 --> 00:13:53,413
Yeah, that's
called being gay.

393
00:13:59,227 --> 00:14:00,360
Hey.

394
00:14:00,395 --> 00:14:01,929
Uh, hey, Kevin.

395
00:14:01,963 --> 00:14:04,898
You, uh... you smell
like a rabbit, buddy.

396
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:06,767
Did something just
happen with a rabbit?

397
00:14:06,801 --> 00:14:09,336
I'll go get my dad.

398
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,604
Listen, you guys.

399
00:14:10,638 --> 00:14:11,738
I think we're
all suffering

400
00:14:11,773 --> 00:14:13,207
from what happened
down at the Clam.

401
00:14:13,241 --> 00:14:14,641
Yeah, I had to
start taking pills

402
00:14:14,676 --> 00:14:16,543
so I'd stop
thinking about it.

403
00:14:16,578 --> 00:14:18,045
Quagmire, that's a Cialis.

404
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,347
That's right, I'm not
thinking about it anymore.

405
00:14:20,381 --> 00:14:22,382
I'm thinking
about that couch.

406
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:24,151
Well, I think
we gave up too easy.

407
00:14:24,185 --> 00:14:26,053
We need to march
back down to the Clam

408
00:14:26,087 --> 00:14:27,254
and take back what's ours.

409
00:14:27,288 --> 00:14:29,256
He's right.
We need to sit up to those guys.

410
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,390
No way.

411
00:14:30,425 --> 00:14:31,658
You want to get
yourselves killed,

412
00:14:31,693 --> 00:14:33,160
that's your business,
but I'm not going.

413
00:14:33,194 --> 00:14:34,828
Fine, me and Joe
will go without you.

414
00:14:34,863 --> 00:14:36,663
But just know
you're letting us down.

415
00:14:36,698 --> 00:14:38,232
We're supposed
to stick together.

416
00:14:38,234 --> 00:14:40,667
Like goatee guys
at a barbecue.

417
00:14:42,237 --> 00:14:44,705
Do you mind if I stand next
to you while we eat standing?

418
00:14:44,739 --> 00:14:46,173
No problem.

419
00:14:46,207 --> 00:14:47,608
Hey, let's go grab
some good beer

420
00:14:47,642 --> 00:14:49,877
even though we
brought the bad beer.

421
00:14:49,911 --> 00:14:52,045
NARRATOR:
<i>And these two barbecue scumbags</i>

422
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,047
<i>formed a lifelong friendship</i>

423
00:14:54,082 --> 00:14:57,651

424

<i>in separate ATV accidents.</i>

425
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,821
You know, I'm so glad
you finally agreed

426
00:15:06,828 --> 00:15:07,828
to go out with me, Jenna.

427
00:15:07,862 --> 00:15:10,163
Me, too. I'm having
a really nice time.

428
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:11,698
You seem like a great guy.

429
00:15:11,733 --> 00:15:13,834
STEWIE: Yes, thank you, we'll take
the table in the corner,

430
00:15:13,868 --> 00:15:15,068
next to the herpes dog.

431
00:15:15,103 --> 00:15:16,436
Oh, hey, Brian.

432
00:15:16,471 --> 00:15:18,105
And who's your date?

433
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:20,307
Wow, you must be
such a good person

434
00:15:20,341 --> 00:15:23,477
to knowingly go out with
a herpes-riddled dirtbag.

435
00:15:23,511 --> 00:15:25,812
Ew! I'm sorry, Brian.

436
00:15:25,847 --> 00:15:28,215
I-I've got to go.

437
00:15:28,249 --> 00:15:29,349
Damn it, you guys!

438
00:15:29,384 --> 00:15:31,385
Her dad's really rich!

439
00:15:34,856 --> 00:15:36,123
Wow, you weren't kidding.

440
00:15:36,157 --> 00:15:37,524
Yeah.

441
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:43,063
PETER:
Hey, you bums!

442
00:15:43,097 --> 00:15:44,798
If you bastards
want our booth,

443
00:15:44,832 --> 00:15:46,967
you got to go
through us to get it.

444
00:15:47,001 --> 00:15:49,570
Smells like this guy's
already wet himself.

445
00:15:49,604 --> 00:15:50,938
Don't flatter yourself.

446
00:15:50,972 --> 00:15:52,406
That was from this morning.

447
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,474
Oh, man, this is gonna be fun.

448
00:15:54,509 --> 00:15:56,610
Yeah, and there's only
two of you losers.

449
00:15:56,644 --> 00:15:58,111
Where's your skinny friend?

450
00:15:58,146 --> 00:15:59,613
QUAGMIRE:
Right here.

451
00:16:02,183 --> 00:16:03,817
Quagmire! You came!

452
00:16:03,851 --> 00:16:04,885
Sure did, Peter.

453
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:06,453
Thanks for calling me
skinny, by the way.

454
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:07,621
I realized you
were right.

455
00:16:07,655 --> 00:16:09,356
If we don't stand up
for ourselves now,

456
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,458
we'll regret it
for the rest of our lives.

457
00:16:11,492 --> 00:16:14,261
And this might be the stupidest
thing I've ever done, but...

458
00:16:14,295 --> 00:16:15,429
(grunts)

459
00:16:15,463 --> 00:16:17,998
Oh, now you're gonna get it.

460
00:16:20,868 --> 00:16:22,869
(grunts)

461
00:16:28,409 --> 00:16:30,010
Whelp, I'm out.

462
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:32,946
Aah!

463
00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:39,252
Hey! That was my pool cue.

464
00:16:39,287 --> 00:16:40,887
I brought it from home.

465
00:16:40,922 --> 00:16:42,422
Oh, sorry.

466
00:16:42,457 --> 00:16:43,557
It screws together.

467
00:16:43,591 --> 00:16:46,026
And I even have
this special little case for it.

468
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,894
I-I feel bad now. I...

469
00:16:47,929 --> 00:16:51,598
Aah!

470
00:16:51,633 --> 00:16:52,666
Hyah!

471
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,534
Hey, that was my
Pawtucket Patriot sign.

472
00:16:54,569 --> 00:16:56,436
I brought it from home.

473
00:16:56,471 --> 00:16:58,705
Okay, now I'm starting
to doubt everything you said.

474
00:17:00,274 --> 00:17:01,508
(grunts)

475
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:03,510
All right, guys,
I know this looks desperate,

476
00:17:03,544 --> 00:17:05,746
but I've got
this can of spinach.

477
00:17:19,027 --> 00:17:20,994
Aah!

478
00:17:42,483 --> 00:17:43,984
Aw, God, it's all watery.

479
00:17:44,018 --> 00:17:45,152
Aah!

480
00:17:45,186 --> 00:17:47,621
You know, I almost said
"no chairs" at the beginning.

481
00:17:49,691 --> 00:17:51,491
Haven't you guys
had enough?

482
00:17:51,526 --> 00:17:54,327
Why don't you just admit
you're beat and get out of here?

483
00:17:54,362 --> 00:17:55,328
BOTH:
Okay.

484
00:17:55,363 --> 00:17:56,763
No! Never!

485
00:17:56,798 --> 00:17:58,932
We will never stop fighting
for this booth.

486
00:17:58,966 --> 00:18:00,767
This booth is my home.

487
00:18:00,802 --> 00:18:02,235
I was born in this booth.

488
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,704
I was married in this booth.

489
00:18:03,738 --> 00:18:05,939
My children were all conceived
in this booth.

490
00:18:05,973 --> 00:18:08,542
Hell, I witnessed every
significant historical event

491
00:18:08,576 --> 00:18:10,077
in my lifetime right here!

492
00:18:10,111 --> 00:18:12,713
I was in this booth
when the <i>Challenger</i> exploded.

493
00:18:12,747 --> 00:18:15,048
Oh, my God, no!

494
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:17,017
I was in this booth on 9/11.

495
00:18:17,051 --> 00:18:19,086
Oh, my God, no!

496
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,022
I was in this booth when
President Obama was elected.

497
00:18:22,056 --> 00:18:24,257
Oh, my God, no!

498
00:18:24,292 --> 00:18:26,526
So, if you want this booth,
you're gonna have

499
00:18:26,561 --> 00:18:29,429
to pry it
from my cold, dead hands.

500
00:18:29,464 --> 00:18:31,198
Why are we even bothering
with these idiots?

501
00:18:31,232 --> 00:18:33,867
We're shipping out to
Afghanistan tomorrow.

502
00:18:33,901 --> 00:18:35,368
You guys are soldiers?

503
00:18:35,403 --> 00:18:37,404
It's our
third tour of duty.

504
00:18:39,574 --> 00:18:41,575
(applause)

505
00:18:44,979 --> 00:18:47,748
If I could touch my own head,
I'd salute you.

506
00:18:47,782 --> 00:18:49,883
(grunting)

507
00:18:49,917 --> 00:18:52,285
With his head,
I salute you.

508
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,454
Everyone,
I declare this to be

509
00:18:54,489 --> 00:18:56,389
These Three Guys Day.

510
00:18:56,424 --> 00:18:59,259
And not
These Three Guys Day.

511
00:18:59,293 --> 00:19:01,428
(cheering)

512
00:19:07,668 --> 00:19:11,238
I can't believe I have
to root for Afghanistan now.

513
00:19:15,977 --> 00:19:16,977
Ah, damn it!

514
00:19:19,981 --> 00:19:21,314
Stewie! Chris!

515
00:19:21,349 --> 00:19:22,582
Yes, Brian?

516
00:19:22,617 --> 00:19:24,117
You hacked my
Facebook account!

517
00:19:24,152 --> 00:19:26,653
Oh, yes, we actually just
changed your profile picture.

518
00:19:26,687 --> 00:19:27,921
(computer dings)

519
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,559
Aah! Damn it!
Look, enough, okay?

520
00:19:32,593 --> 00:19:34,427
What the hell do you
guys want from me?!

521
00:19:34,462 --> 00:19:35,662
I want to drive
your Prius

522
00:19:35,696 --> 00:19:37,998
to the end of the block
all by myself.

523
00:19:38,032 --> 00:19:39,199
That's it?
Yes.

524
00:19:39,233 --> 00:19:40,967
Okay.

525
00:19:41,002 --> 00:19:42,636
Yay!

526
00:19:43,971 --> 00:19:45,972
(engine starts)

527
00:19:50,878 --> 00:19:53,513
That's, uh... that's way past
the end of the block.

528
00:19:53,548 --> 00:19:54,781
Yeah, his room's empty.

529
00:19:54,816 --> 00:19:56,183
I don't think
he's coming back.

530
00:19:56,217 --> 00:19:57,350
Huh.

531
00:19:57,385 --> 00:19:58,552
Well, what about you?

532
00:19:58,586 --> 00:20:00,687
I want to go on a date
with Neve Campbell

533
00:20:00,721 --> 00:20:02,889
so I can give her a
nice ladle of Stew.

534
00:20:02,924 --> 00:20:05,625
What? How am I supposed
to even find her?

535
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,861
Damn it, Stewie, why are you
being so vindictive?

536
00:20:07,895 --> 00:20:10,197
Because, Brian,
for the first time in my life,

537
00:20:10,231 --> 00:20:12,332
I realized I couldn't trust you.

538
00:20:12,366 --> 00:20:15,302
I couldn't trust
my own best friend.

539
00:20:16,337 --> 00:20:19,105
(sighs)
I... I'm sorry, Stewie.

540
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,875
You're right. I let you down.

541
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:24,211
I guess... I guess
I was just too embarrassed

542
00:20:24,245 --> 00:20:25,645
to admit I had herpes.

543
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,581
It was a rotten thing to do,

544
00:20:27,615 --> 00:20:30,217
and I promise I will
never lie to you again.

545
00:20:30,251 --> 00:20:31,651
Thanks Brian.

546
00:20:31,686 --> 00:20:33,820
That's all I really wanted.

547
00:20:33,855 --> 00:20:36,256
So, do you forgive me?

548
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:38,391
Yes. I do.

549
00:20:40,695 --> 00:20:43,129
So, I'm gonna have herpes
for the rest of my life, huh?

550
00:20:43,164 --> 00:20:45,665
Yeah, but most of the time,
it won't even be an issue.

551
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,273
It only really flares up
during periods of great stress.

552
00:20:48,274 --> 00:20:51,143
Like your wedding day
or a big job interview.

553
00:20:51,177 --> 00:20:53,220
So, what would you say some
of your weaknesses are?

554
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:56,320
That... that-that's
probably one of them.
