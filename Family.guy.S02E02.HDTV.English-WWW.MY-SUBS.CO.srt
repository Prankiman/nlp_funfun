00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,500
"It seems today that all you see

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,300
"is violence in movies and sex on TV

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,600
"But where are those good,
old-fashioned values

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,200
"on which we used to rely?

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,300
"Lucky there's a family guy

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,600
"Lucky there's a man who'll
positively tell you

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,300
"all the things that make us

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,700
"laugh 'n' cry

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,500
"He's a family guy"

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,800
Mrs. Lipstein, I have bad news.
The tumor is malignant.

11
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,900
I'm afraid you only have six months to live.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,300
Oh, my God!

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,300
Got milk?

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,400
Listen up, everybody.
Your Grandpa Griffin is finally retiring.

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,800
Grandpa Griffin?

16
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,300
Is he the one that smells like firewood
and has big gray pussywillows in his ears?

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,400
Chris, that's a terrible word.
"Pussywillows."

18
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,800
My dad worked at that mill for 60 years.
That's almost 80 years.

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,500
Tomorrow we'll all go
to a big dinner to honor him.

20
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,400
Why? We barely know him.

21
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,300
Yeah. How come he never visits us?

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,600
Kids, your grandfather has never been
comfortable with the fact...

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,600
...that I'm not Catholic.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,100
Dad loves all of us.
He's just too busy working to show it.

25
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,900
He's been that way since I was a kid.

26
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,800
And now the winners of
the father-son three-legged race.

27
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,200
First place, Bobby Hammill and his dad.
Second place, Jimmy Lawson and his dad.

28
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,700
Third place,
Peter Griffin and a stalk of corn.

29
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,100
Now that he's retiring,
we can finally spend some time together.

30
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,200
I want us to have one of those
father-son moments, like on TV.

31
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,700
Where we hug and the music goes...

32
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,500
Thanks, boys. Just like that.

33
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,200
Can you do that fluttery thing like
when the Brady kids run down the stairs?

34
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,200
I don't want to tattle.

35
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,500
But is Bobby really a doctor?

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,100
Mom, I can't eat.
I'm too grossed out by Grandpa's ears.

37
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,700
I know.
They're like a big, gray enchanted forest.

38
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,300
Kids, your grandfather's ears are not gross.

39
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,900
And they are certainly not
an enchanted forest.

40
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,200
But seriously, tonight
we here at Pawtucket Mill celebrate...

41
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,300
...the career of our oldest and
most dedicated employee, Francis Griffin.

42
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,500
Francis.

43
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,500
At mass this morning...

44
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,900
...it occurred to me that I may never see
any of your faces again.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I just want to say that Jesus loves you.

46
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,500
But in my eyes,
you're a bunch of sinners and slackers...

47
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,000
...who forced a hard-working
old man to retire.

48
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,700
So you can take this shiny watch
and shove it.

49
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,200
I adore this man!

50
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,900
That was some speech, Dad.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,700
Yeah. It's a shame Grandma
wasn't there to hear it.

52
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,400
Bless her heart. She's on another one
of her prayer missions in Las Vegas.

53
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,900
Hit me, you five-card stud.

54
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,600
Cocktail!

55
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,700
Aye, she's a rose.

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,700
It's a pity you couldn't find yourself
a nice Irish Catholic girl, Peter.

57
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,400
Francis, this must be embarrassing for you.

58
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,100
I'm in the car.

59
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,600
Now that you're retired, you're
coming to stay with us.

60
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,000
No more excuses.
I'm putting my foot down.

61
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,600
Brian, buckle up. What do you say, Dad?

62
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,900
- I don't want to be a bother.
- It's no bother, is it, Lois?

63
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,600
Of course not. It'll be fun.

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,600
You're a good woman, Lois.
Perhaps you won't burn in Hell after all.

65
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,800
Maybe you'll just go to purgatory
with all the unbaptized babies.

66
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,700
There you go, Lois. You love kids.

67
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,400
Look at that.

68
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,500
Dad's reading Stewie to sleep,
just like he never did for me.

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,600
"So God cast the pagans and sinners
into the fiery bowels of Hell...

70
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,500
"...where their flesh burned in agony
forever and ever."

71
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,300
The end.

72
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,600
Children love a good bedtime story
from the Bible.

73
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,600
Yes, charming.
Like when God told Abraham to kill Isaac.

74
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,400
Hey!

75
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,200
That was a lovely service, Francis.

76
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,300
Super. And only
three more hours till school.

77
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,000
I didn't even know there was
a 5:00 a.m. Mass.

78
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,900
I didn't even know there was a 5:00 a.m.
What else haven't you told me?

79
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,900
I rather like this God fellow.
He's very theatrical, you know.

80
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,200
A pestilence here and a plague there.
Omnipotence!

81
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,800
Got to get me some of that.

82
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,900
Yes. We all enjoy the Bible in this house.

83
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,700
Really? What's your favorite book
of the Bible?

84
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,600
That one where Jesus swallows
the puzzle piece...

85
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,300
...and the man in the big yellow hat
has to take him to the hospital.

86
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,700
Open this door! Open it, I say!

87
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,100
Sorry, Grandpa.

88
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,100
You might want to give that
a minute or two.

89
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,600
I know what you're doing in there,
and it's a sin!

90
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,200
If you ever do it again, you'll burn in Hell!

91
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,000
But I do it every day. Sometimes twice.

92
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,500
Mark my words, lad.

93
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,900
You may think you're alone,
but God's watching.

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,700
Don't do it again!

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,300
God's watching me do number two?

96
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,100
I'm a sinner, and God's a pervert.

97
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,500
Megan!

98
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,100
How was school?

99
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,400
Good. Kevin walked me home.

100
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,900
- Kevin?
- He lives next door.

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,400
He lives next door to a harlot!

102
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,500
Grandpa, we were just holding hands.

103
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,700
It'll be easy for him to take your hand
when God strikes your heart with leprosy.

104
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,500
He can take it right home with him!

105
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,500
Lord, it's great to see you kids.

106
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,100
Francis, we were watching that.

107
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,800
I'll tell you how it ends.
Laura burns the roast...

108
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,900
...and God kills her for parading her bum
around in those pants!

109
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,300
Yeah, not a bad way to kick off
your retirement, huh, Dad?

110
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,500
Yeah, the magic of baseball has brought
fathers and sons together...

111
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,600
...for millions of years.

112
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,100
Stewie's having fun.

113
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,900
Why does that man drop his club
before he runs around?

114
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,600
I would bring it with me.

115
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,600
Hey, who wants a Fenway frank?

116
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,400
Nothing says, "Please talk to me, Daddy,"
like a Fenway frank.

117
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,200
Is there a bathroom here?
I don't think I can wait anymore.

118
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,600
In a public restroom, lad?

119
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,400
For the good of your soul,
show some restraint.

120
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,900
Hey, hot dog guy!

121
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,100
I'll get him.

122
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,800
Oh, no, Dad, they bring them to you.

123
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,200
Well, la-de-da.
I don't need my food brought to me.

124
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,800
I'm not a broken-down old mule!
I can still work!

125
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,600
I can still take orders!

126
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,400
Oh, hey! Hey, look! Hey, Dad!

127
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,200
Aw, crap. That was money well-spent.

128
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,600
He just left without saying anything?
Where would he go?

129
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,000
I don't know. I asked him to buy me
some peanuts and cracker jacks.

130
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,100
I don't care if he ever gets back.

131
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,700
I wasn't being cute. I really hope he's dead.

132
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,200
Tom, the city of Boston
is examining its conscience tonight...

133
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,600
...in preparation for a visit from the Pope.

134
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,400
That's right, Diane. I'll tell you what else
will be examined, this cock.

135
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,400
The Rhode Island Cock Society
is sponsoring free check-ups...

136
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,200
...for this year's Cock Awareness Week.
I don't know why the suggestive name.

137
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,700
They could've just as easily
gone with "rooster."

138
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,100
I'm telling you.
Something must've happened to him.

139
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,800
He's probably hurt, or lost,
or shanghaied by pirates!

140
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,400
That renegade pirate ship captained
by the ruthless Peg Leg Swantoon!

141
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,400
Peter, calm down.
It's his first night of retirement.

142
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,500
He's probably out enjoying himself.

143
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,700
He's in jail.

144
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,100
Dad, my God, are you okay?

145
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,800
Don't be using the Lord's name in vain!

146
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,700
He's okay! Thank God!

147
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,400
It seems he broke into the old mill
after hours.

148
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,300
We found him working on a kick press.

149
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,400
Dad, you left the ball game with me
to go work in a mill?

150
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,200
Yes! I want to work! I want my job back!

151
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,900
But, Dad, you're retired.

152
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,500
I'd rather be dead.

153
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,600
I'll tell you what's dead. Vaudeville.
You know what killed it? Talkie pictures.

154
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,000
But you can still make it.
You just need a gimmick.

155
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,400
I, for one, am a tumbler.
Here, watch my round-off.

156
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,300
Hey, be a sport. Take the pills out of
my pocket and put one under my tongue.

157
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,900
I don't get it, Lois. Baseball's always
been the secret to male bonding.

158
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,600
It even worked for Rosie O'Donnell
and his father in A League of Their Own.

159
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,800
I hate to say this...

160
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,400
...but it doesn't seem like your dad
is interested in bonding with you.

161
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,500
All he cares about is work.

162
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,700
Wait a second. Work!
That's what'll bring us together.

163
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,600
We can start our own father-son business.

164
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,700
What are you doing with all them
bathtubs, you heathen dummy?

165
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,600
Pop, why you gotta be like that?

166
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,500
We cut 'em in half, stick a Virgin Mary
in them and sell them as shrines.

167
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,700
That's my boy. At least,
that's what your mama always told me.

168
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,600
Now give me a hug before I give you
a knuckle sandwich.

169
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,400
Or you could just get your father a job
with you at the toy factory.

170
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,500
That's an even better idea!
Lois, you're a genius.

171
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,500
Now give me a hug
before I give you a knuckle sandwich.

172
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,500
Peter, I can't hug you.

173
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,500
Cut it out. I'm serious.

174
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,300
And this is the nerve center
of the whole factory, my station.

175
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,500
I assemble our new action figure,
Zeke, the moody drifter.

176
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:11,100
You mean to tell me
you stand here all day playing with dolls?

177
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,700
It's not easy.
See, I gotta twist on his head...

178
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,700
...and stick a tiny pack of smokes
in his torn denim jacket.

179
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,300
Any of you kids want to see a dead body?

180
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,700
Wait here, Dad.

181
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,400
Hey, Mr. Weed?

182
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,700
Peter.

183
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Listen, I was wondering if you might
have a job for my dad.

184
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,200
Your father?
He must be a man of at least 70.

185
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,500
Oh, yeah. But he's in great shape.
Except his prostate.

186
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,100
At 2:00 a.m. Last night, I thought
a horse was using the bathroom.

187
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,500
All finished. What's next?

188
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,700
You did my whole day's work
in five minutes.

189
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,000
We should sell you to the circus, you freak!

190
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,300
I've never seen such productivity.
How is this possible?

191
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,100
I'll tell you how it's possible.

192
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,100
Because this man always put his job
before everything else.

193
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,300
His wife, his health, even his own son.

194
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,200
Especially his own son.

195
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:05,000
I need hear no more.
Everyone, this is your new shop foreman.

196
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,600
Welcome aboard, sir. Lead as you see fit.

197
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,200
Dad, after all these years, you and me
together, side by side, father and son.

198
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,700
Peter, this is truly a miracle.
I'm so grateful.

199
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,200
Hold that thought. Hey, boys, you're on.

200
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,900
Go ahead, Dad.

201
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,300
Thank you, Jesus.

202
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,600
I have a purpose in life again.

203
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,300
Hey! Break up the sewing circle
and get back to work!

204
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,000
My, my. What a thumping good read!

205
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,800
Lions eating Christians,
people nailing each other to two-by-fours.

206
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,600
I say, you won't find that
in Winnie the Pooh.

207
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,400
Please don't say "pooh."

208
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,800
Are you all right? Where's your father?

209
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:55,000
Still at the factory.
He's turning the break room into a chapel.

210
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,200
A chapel? Where will you all eat lunch?

211
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,600
Lois, lunch is a sin. Taking a break is a sin.

212
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,400
Bestiality is a sin.

213
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,600
I'm not sure how that came up exactly,
but me and Dad have never been closer.

214
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,100
Having him at the factory is the best...

215
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,600
I got it.

216
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,700
Your dad stinks.

217
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,900
I'm working triple shifts,
and I'm still not Employee of the Week.

218
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,400
How am I supposed to compete with that?

219
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,900
Where is he anyway?

220
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,900
This'll be for my fourth birdie.
Looks like someone's in the zone.

221
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,400
Tough break there, Jesus.

222
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,400
Yup. Or was it?

223
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
Boo-yah!

224
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,100
Back to work, all of you!
What's going on here?

225
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,900
Dad, some of the guys think that...

226
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,100
...since you took over, work is no fun.

227
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,900
- Work's not supposed to be fun.
- Why not?

228
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,700
Why not?

229
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:54,100
That's Satan talking! You're a failure
as a worker and as a father!

230
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,600
Now wait a minute. I may not be perfect.

231
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,700
At least I love my kids enough not to
spend every minute of the day working!

232
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,100
I'm a damn good father,
and that's more than I can say about you!

233
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,500
Peter, you've never spoken to me
like that before.

234
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,200
You're fired!

235
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,300
Well, in that case,
I'm suing you for sexual harassment.

236
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,400
I'll see you at home.

237
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,900
What are you doing, lad?
Nothing!

238
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,000
Something's wrong with
your shower. The water's not cold enough.

239
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,900
I like me showers colder
than a well digger's kerblocken.

240
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,800
I think it's time someone sits
his kerfluffin' down...

241
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,100
...and has a talk with his unemployed son.

242
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,400
If he needs to talk...

243
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,800
...he'd best go to confession
to beg forgiveness for all his failings!

244
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,300
Have a glorious day.

245
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,900
How can you just sit there
and let him talk like that?

246
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,800
He's right, Lois. I am no good.

247
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,300
Even my own dad doesn't love me.
Face it. I'm going to Hell.

248
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,200
Adolf Hitler, Al Capone,
John Wilkes Booth.

249
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,300
Hey, what are you doing here?

250
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,500
I killed a hooker. She made a crack about
me being faster than a speeding bullet...

251
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
...so I ripped her in half like a phone book.

252
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,800
Yes, the fat man's going to Hell.

253
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,900
And from the looks of his midsection,
he'll burn like a tire dump for all eternity.

254
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,600
Oh! I love God!

255
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,700
He's so deliciously evil.

256
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,100
Stewie, eat your oatmeal.
Honey, you're a wonderful husband...

257
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,400
...a loving father, and,
for some reason I'll never understand...

258
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,300
...a very devoted son.

259
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,200
That's a nice thought, Lois, but sadly,
it means nothing coming from you.

260
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,200
The moment has arrived at last.

261
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,800
We now go live
to Logan International Airport...

262
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,400
...where the Pope's plane
has just touched down.

263
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,100
Hello, Boston!

264
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,000
Are you ready to humble...

265
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,400
...yourself before God?

266
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,100
What? Have you all taken a vow of silence?

267
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,200
Come on!

268
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,800
Then put your hands together for the one,
the only...

269
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,700
...His Holiness, the Pope!

270
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,700
Hey, I just got a crazy idea!

271
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,400
Why? Why?

272
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,300
Hey, I just got another crazy idea!

273
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,700
Hey, did you ever notice this?
On page 375, it says "Jebus."

274
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,600
It's supposed to be "Jesus," right?

275
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,700
- Room service!
- We didn't order no room service.

276
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,700
Actually I just wanted
to check the honor bar.

277
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,100
The last Pope we had here
filled his shaving kit with Necco wafers.

278
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,100
All right, wise guy, who are you?

279
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,600
I'm just a faithful Catholic man...

280
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,300
...with a family crisis
only His Holiness can resolve.

281
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,100
I've never asked the church for anything,
but I don't know where else to turn.

282
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,700
Dust him!

283
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,700
My heavens, son! Are you okay?

284
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,200
Yeah. I just got bounced
by the Pope's road crew.

285
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,700
It's good you missed me.
I'm to drive the Popemobile.

286
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,300
Any slight bump on the head
knocks me unconscious for a few hours.

287
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,200
I always wake up fine,
but it's just so darn inconvenient...

288
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,900
...to be knocked out that easily.
Even by the slightest tap. Like this.

289
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,500
Taking it off here, Boss.

290
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,700
- Take it off there, Luke.
- Wiping it off, Boss.

291
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,400
- Wipe it off, Nine.
- Waving at the Pope here, Boss.

292
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,900
Wave at the Pope there, Luke.

293
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,900
Are you sure this is Boston?

294
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,500
Yeah, it's Boston.
See, look, there's Harvard.

295
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,800
That's just a barn.

296
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,300
Someone went to Yale.

297
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,400
Lois, put the coffee on.

298
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
Careful. I just cleaned the floor.

299
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,000
Good thing.

300
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,600
Lemony.

301
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,000
Your Holiness, this is such an honor.

302
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,000
Please, go into the living room
and make yourself at home!

303
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,500
What is the Pope doing here?

304
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,000
Relax. I just hijacked his bubble car
so he can convince my dad I'm a good guy.

305
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,600
You kidnapped the Pope?

306
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,900
This is the most reckless thing
you've ever done!

307
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,600
Come on. What about the time
I was on that airplane?

308
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,700
Peter, you've raised a fine family.

309
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,100
Well, my dad thinks I'm a screw-up.
I was hoping you could change his mind.

310
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,900
He'd have to believe you.
You're God's go-to guy.

311
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Your father is entitled to his opinion.

312
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,600
But more important is what you think.

313
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,400
Look deep in your heart, my son.

314
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,400
Do you think you're a screw-up?

315
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,900
No. I'm not. You know what?
I'm a damn good father.

316
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,800
I have great kids.
That's not what Grandpa says.

317
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,500
Grandpa is wrong.

318
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,500
Meg, it's not a sin
for a girl your age to like boys.

319
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,700
Thanks, Daddy.

320
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,400
And Chris, what you do in the bathroom
is between you and God.

321
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,400
And if you're sorry, he'll forgive you.

322
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,800
Thanks, Dad!

323
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,800
Good for you, Peter.

324
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,300
But isn't there someone else
you should speak to?

325
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,600
Yes, there is.

326
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,400
Scarecrow, you've had brains all along.

327
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,600
Same goes for your heart, Tin Man.

328
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:52,200
And Kristy McNichol,
come back to television. We miss you.

329
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,900
I meant you should talk to your father.

330
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,200
You're right. You with me, big guy?

331
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,100
Peter, I go where I am needed.

332
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,400
To the Popemobile!

333
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,000
Remember when we brought
in that stripper for Lombardi's birthday...

334
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,500
...and it turned out to be his son?
I think this is gonna top it.

335
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,100
Wow, it's the Pope!

336
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,300
Slothful sinners! You're here
to work, not sit around with your...

337
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,700
Holy Mother! It's the Holy Father.

338
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,600
I am not worthy.

339
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,800
Rise, my son.

340
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,000
You are indeed worthy,
for you have raised a fine son.

341
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,700
His zest for life is an affirmation
of God's great love within us all.

342
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,200
Wow! And that's from the freakin' Pope!

343
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,300
So I guess you were wrong about me, Dad.

344
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,900
I was wrong all right.

345
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,100
Stand by, boys.

346
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
I was wrong about you!

347
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,600
You've gone soft on me, Holy Father!

348
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,900
Even a tambourine-shaking Baptist
could tell this boy's no good!

349
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Are you calling me a liar?

350
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,300
- Whoah, easy, Pontiff.
- Because I'll excommunicate your sorry...

351
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,800
Okay, time out.

352
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,300
Oh! I have never met
such an infuriating man!

353
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,200
You must have the patience of a saint.

354
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,800
Well, he's my dad.
And I just want him to love me.

355
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,400
Peter, how could you say such a thing?

356
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,700
I love you with all me heart.

357
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,800
- You do?
- Of course.

358
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,900
I just don't like you.
I don't like anything about you!

359
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,600
Keep playing.
I think this is as good as it gets.

360
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,200
Dad, to be honest, I don't like you either.

361
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,100
Jeez, that's a terrible thing to say.
I guess I am going to Hell.

362
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,700
The good Lord said to honor thy father.

363
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,100
He never said anything about liking him.

364
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,000
Well, in that case, Dad...

365
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,700
...l'm gonna eat meat on Fridays,
golf on Sundays...

366
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,300
...laugh at Jewish comedians,
and yes, sleep with my Protestant wife.

367
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,000
But I won't enjoy it. And she hates it.

368
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,200
Well, fine. I'll be on me way.

369
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,900
Take back your job,
and give your old man a hug.

370
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,500
I love you, Dad.

371
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,300
I know you do, Son.

372
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,800
- What are you gonna do now?
- I don't know.

373
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,200
I guess the good Lord doesn't have
much use for an old man like me.

374
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,000
I suppose I could use
another pair of hands on my tour.

375
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,800
You'd give Dad a job,
even knowing what a jerk he is?

376
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,900
I have to. As you said, Peter,
"I am the freakin' Pope."

377
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,500
All right, get back!

378
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,900
No flash photography,
or you'll go straight to Hell! You!

379
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,000
You're in God's house, you heathen!

380
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,000
Take that cap off before I take it off for you!

381
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,800
I think your father found the perfect job.

382
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,300
Let's hope so. I love being a good father.

383
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,800
But I don't want to have to be
a good son again for a long, long time.

384
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,400
Peter, open the door,
and break out the schnapps!

385
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,800
Guess who needs a place
to sleep it off for the weekend?

386
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,900
- Mom?
- Oh, my God, no!

387
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,100
Quick, everyone! Into the pod!
