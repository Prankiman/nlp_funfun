1
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:15,806
This is a message to all American infidels.

2
00:00:15,893 --> 00:00:18,851
Prepare to die in a sea of holy fire.

3
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:24,212
You will be punished for your decadent ways
on the first day of Radaman. You...

4
00:00:24,293 --> 00:00:26,363
Wait. Did I just say R...?

5
00:00:26,453 --> 00:00:29,411
What'd I say? "Radaman"?

6
00:00:29,493 --> 00:00:32,405
Ramadan. Radaman?
What is that? What is...?

7
00:00:32,493 --> 00:00:37,362
Maybe Dennis Radaman is going
to punish you with his crazy hair. No?

8
00:00:37,453 --> 00:00:40,445
What's that? Right, yeah.

9
00:00:40,533 --> 00:00:42,569
OK. Let's go again.

10
00:00:42,653 --> 00:00:46,328
This is a message to all Amer...

11
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:49,610
I'm not gonna be able to do it now.
I'm not... OK, OK. I know.

12
00:00:49,693 --> 00:00:52,253
I gotta get...
I gotta get all the laughs out. OK.

13
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:55,291
Gotta get all the laughs out.

14
00:00:57,293 --> 00:00:58,851
- OK.
- Today sometime.

15
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:04,371
Stop making that face. What are you doing?
He makes that face and it makes me laugh.

16
00:01:04,453 --> 00:01:09,208
You know what? Just turn around. I don't
care where you look. Just look over there.

17
00:01:09,293 --> 00:01:12,444
They're cracking up over there. OK.

18
00:01:12,533 --> 00:01:14,763
Now look who's snickering over there.

19
00:01:14,853 --> 00:01:17,890
Mr "I Can't Do A Suicide Bombing
Because I'm Sick".

20
00:01:17,973 --> 00:01:23,127
He had a note... He had a note from his
doctor. He brought a note from his doctor.

21
00:01:23,213 --> 00:01:25,966
It's a suicide bombing. What are you...?

22
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:29,568
OK. All right. OK. Here we go.
Here we go. All serious now. OK.

23
00:01:29,653 --> 00:01:31,405
Death to...

24
00:01:31,493 --> 00:01:34,724
I can't... I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't...

25
00:01:34,813 --> 00:01:38,328
Come on. Now you're just trying
to make... Hey, wait, wait, wait.

26
00:01:38,413 --> 00:01:40,722
Look. Look. Rubber chicken, you know?

27
00:01:40,813 --> 00:01:43,691
I should do the whole tape
with this in my hand.

28
00:01:43,773 --> 00:01:47,766
Just with the chicken right here.
Everyone will be, like, "What the hell?"

29
00:01:47,853 --> 00:01:50,003
Death to Americans.

30
00:01:50,093 --> 00:01:55,008
Let him do it. Let him do the tape.
Don't blame me. It was the chicken. He was...

31
00:01:55,093 --> 00:01:57,891
No. Actually,
you know what would be better? Wait.

32
00:01:57,973 --> 00:02:00,248
Just walk out like this.

33
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,801
Just come out like this, but all serious.

34
00:02:02,893 --> 00:02:06,363
Completely serious,
like I don't even know I'm wearing them.

35
00:02:06,453 --> 00:02:09,013
Death to America.

36
00:02:09,093 --> 00:02:12,290
What? What are you looking at?
Do I have something on my face?

37
00:02:12,373 --> 00:02:14,284
What? Right here?

38
00:02:14,373 --> 00:02:17,729
I'm just wearing my regular glasses.
I always wear these. What?

39
00:02:17,813 --> 00:02:20,532
It's me in an '80s movie, right?

40
00:02:20,613 --> 00:02:24,208
Yeah, he got it.
He got it over there. The little guy got it.

41
00:02:24,293 --> 00:02:26,648
Who is that guy? I've never seen him before.

42
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:28,564
How's it going, chief?

43
00:02:28,653 --> 00:02:32,407
Good day to you, sir.
And now prepare to die.

44
00:03:06,373 --> 00:03:08,887
Who are you?

45
00:03:08,973 --> 00:03:11,851
I'm Stewie Griffin.

46
00:03:11,933 --> 00:03:14,766
And don't ever let me
catch you guys in Quahog.

47
00:03:56,373 --> 00:03:59,046
Hey, Stewie. Who the hell is that?

48
00:04:06,973 --> 00:04:09,806
Peter, it's 5:30 in the morning.

49
00:04:09,893 --> 00:04:13,442
- Sorry. I didn't know you were home.
- What the hell are you doing?

50
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:15,808
Laying down the red carpet.
The Emmys are on.

51
00:04:15,893 --> 00:04:18,612
Don't tell me you forgot
about Meg's play tonight.

52
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:22,606
Meg sucks. Everything she does
is so freaking terrible and depressing.

53
00:04:22,693 --> 00:04:24,809
I went to her first-grade play that time.

54
00:04:24,893 --> 00:04:28,681
Robin Hood, the king is keeping me
prisoner here in his castle.

55
00:04:28,773 --> 00:04:31,003
Don't worry, Maid Marian. I'll save you.

56
00:04:31,093 --> 00:04:34,005
Boy, you guys
are not sucking me into the story at all.

57
00:04:34,093 --> 00:04:38,723
I'm just telling for your own benefit. I'm very
aware that I'm watching a play right now.

58
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:42,601
- I gotta watch the Emmys.
- You're going to Meg's play and that's that.

59
00:04:43,093 --> 00:04:46,130
Is that that, now, Mrs That's That?

60
00:04:46,213 --> 00:04:51,003
If you're gonna shoot me
you might want to tie your shoelaces first.

61
00:04:51,093 --> 00:04:53,891
- Are you gonna go to Meg's play or not?
- Yes.

62
00:04:53,973 --> 00:04:56,692
- You like eating red carpet, tough guy?
- Yes.

63
00:04:56,773 --> 00:05:00,766
- Say you like eating red carpet.
- I like eating red carpet.

64
00:05:00,853 --> 00:05:01,922
Giggety.

65
00:05:06,693 --> 00:05:09,253
God, why do you wear
those rainbow suspenders?

66
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,405
Well, I could tell you, but I'd rather show you

67
00:05:12,493 --> 00:05:14,643
through interpretive dance.

68
00:05:25,173 --> 00:05:28,370
Crying baby. I'll take him out.

69
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:32,765
You know, Lois, if we leave now, we can
catch the Emmy for best documentary.

70
00:05:32,853 --> 00:05:36,892
- I hear there's one on vacuuming.
- Really? That sounds interesting...

71
00:05:36,973 --> 00:05:41,091
Wait a minute. You can't fool me that easily.
You are not watching the Emmys.

72
00:05:41,173 --> 00:05:43,528
Now, shush.

73
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:49,609
Excuse me. I gotta do some black-guy stuff.

74
00:05:49,693 --> 00:05:52,571
Man, this sucks
worse than my 16th birthday party.

75
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:55,486
Thanks for coming
to my birthday party, Jake Ryan.

76
00:05:55,573 --> 00:05:58,929
Thanks for having me
to your birthday party, Peter. Make a wish.

77
00:05:59,013 --> 00:06:00,844
It's already come true.

78
00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:03,208
Here's your present.

79
00:06:03,293 --> 00:06:05,523
No! Jake, not like this.

80
00:06:08,813 --> 00:06:11,452
Our top story, beloved entertainer Bob Hope

81
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:15,287
briefly came back to life,
only to die in a tragic motorcycle accident.

82
00:06:15,373 --> 00:06:19,446
Hey, I'm gonnajump all those trash cans.

83
00:06:23,013 --> 00:06:27,689
In other news, actor David Hyde Pierce
created a major controversy at the Emmys,

84
00:06:27,773 --> 00:06:31,163
when a "trouser malfunction"
caused him to expose his testicles.

85
00:06:31,253 --> 00:06:32,971
Glad I didn't miss the Emmys.

86
00:06:33,053 --> 00:06:36,932
That's great. Thanks to you,
I missed a moment of television history.

87
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:40,688
Well, now you know how George W Bush felt
when he showed up in Vietnam.

88
00:06:42,253 --> 00:06:44,813
All right, let's do this. Let's kick some ass.

89
00:06:44,893 --> 00:06:46,645
- George, the war's over.
- What?

90
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:47,768
Yeah, it's done.

91
00:06:47,853 --> 00:06:49,366
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

92
00:06:49,453 --> 00:06:53,082
Oh, man. Oh, man, I just got
your messages and... I'm sorry.

93
00:06:53,173 --> 00:06:55,482
- It's been over for a while.
- Really?

94
00:06:55,573 --> 00:06:56,972
Yeah, it's 1981.

95
00:06:57,053 --> 00:06:59,806
- It's... Wow, so I'm way late. Oh, boy.
- Yeah.

96
00:06:59,893 --> 00:07:02,327
- You wanna do something else?
- I got some blow.

97
00:07:02,413 --> 00:07:05,485
Son of a bitch!
Took you this long to tell me. Break it out.

98
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:10,690
We got 20 calls
about the David Hyde Pierce incident.

99
00:07:10,773 --> 00:07:13,333
As you know,
one call equals a billion people,

100
00:07:13,413 --> 00:07:16,485
which means 20 billion people
were offended by this.

101
00:07:16,573 --> 00:07:18,325
Something must be done.

102
00:07:18,413 --> 00:07:21,007
- Perhaps we should ask the chairman.
- Good idea.

103
00:07:21,653 --> 00:07:26,044
Sir, what course of action do you recommend
regarding the Hyde Pierce incident?

104
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:31,685
You've got to censor television, you fools.
Now, follow my orders.

105
00:07:36,493 --> 00:07:39,132
<i>Stay tuned for Three's Company.</i>

106
00:07:39,213 --> 00:07:42,171
Jack, are you out there?
I want to show you my new bikini.

107
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,892
What? Why are they
blocking out all the good stuff?

108
00:07:44,973 --> 00:07:49,330
<i>It's The... van... Show,
starring... van...</i>

109
00:07:49,413 --> 00:07:51,165
They're messing with my shows.

110
00:07:51,253 --> 00:07:55,132
<i>There was something very different
about that Honeymooners episode.</i>

111
00:07:55,213 --> 00:07:58,046
One of these days, Alice, one of these days...

112
00:07:58,133 --> 00:08:01,523
I'll stimulate the economy
by buying an American car.

113
00:08:01,613 --> 00:08:05,128
The FCC must be overreacting
to the David Hyde Pierce incident.

114
00:08:05,213 --> 00:08:08,330
- They're censoring anything unpleasant.
- What the hell?

115
00:08:08,413 --> 00:08:11,928
They let Sarah Jessica Parker's face on TV
and she looks like a foot.

116
00:08:12,013 --> 00:08:14,652
Well, mark my words, I'm gonna fight this.

117
00:08:16,653 --> 00:08:19,406
You're on TV.
Can't you do something about this?

118
00:08:19,493 --> 00:08:24,089
Well, Peter, I'm flattered you came to me
for help. We'll have more after this.

119
00:08:24,173 --> 00:08:26,403
We're back. To answer your question,

120
00:08:26,493 --> 00:08:29,849
if you want to control content,
start your own TV station.

121
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:34,290
My own TV station. I haven't had my own
business since that mail-order operation.

122
00:08:34,373 --> 00:08:38,685
I bought a giant, life-size slingshot from you.
Itjust slammed me into a mountain.

123
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:41,447
- No returns.
- I've been a customer for years.

124
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:45,162
- I can maybe give you a store credit.
- But... Really? Well, I guess...

125
00:08:45,253 --> 00:08:47,767
- What's the hold-up?
- I'm taking care of it.

126
00:08:49,293 --> 00:08:51,682
What are you doing? What is all this stuff?

127
00:08:51,773 --> 00:08:53,809
Dad's starting his own TV station,

128
00:08:53,893 --> 00:08:57,442
but I'm not supposed to tell Mom
because she'll just bitch him out.

129
00:08:57,533 --> 00:08:59,649
What do you expect to accomplish?

130
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:03,362
I'm saving television.
Apache Chief, put the satellite on the roof.

131
00:09:03,453 --> 00:09:07,048
Sure, Peter. Apache Chief, eeh-nay-chuk.

132
00:09:10,493 --> 00:09:14,930
Well, that was the high point of my day.
Guess I'll go gamble.

133
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,484
Hi there. I'm Peter Griffin,
and you're watching PTV,

134
00:09:24,573 --> 00:09:27,610
with your favourite shows
as nature intended them -

135
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:30,685
with all the sex, violence,
swearing and farts intact,

136
00:09:30,773 --> 00:09:34,243
<i>like in All in the Family,
where Archie got the Jeffersons to move.</i>

137
00:09:35,773 --> 00:09:38,082
Time for you to move there, Jefferson.

138
00:09:38,173 --> 00:09:39,891
Oh, Archie.

139
00:09:39,973 --> 00:09:42,123
I can't see out of my sheet.

140
00:09:42,213 --> 00:09:45,888
Edith, will you stifle yourself?
We're supposed to be incognitus.

141
00:09:45,973 --> 00:09:49,204
<i>And who could forget
that classic episode of The Waltons?</i>

142
00:09:49,293 --> 00:09:52,649
- Good night, Jim Bob.
- Good night, Pa.

143
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:57,011
- Good night. Good night, Elizabeth.
- Good night. Good night, Ma.

144
00:09:57,093 --> 00:10:00,972
Good night, Elizabeth.
Good night, John Boy.

145
00:10:01,053 --> 00:10:03,283
Good night, John Boy.

146
00:10:04,453 --> 00:10:08,002
- John Boy?
- Can't a guy masturbate?

147
00:10:10,973 --> 00:10:15,728
Peter, look at these numbers. We're a hit.
I'd think about expanding your programming.

148
00:10:15,813 --> 00:10:20,250
Brian, that's a great idea. That's exactly
what we need to take PTV to the next level.

149
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,403
Original programming.

150
00:10:22,493 --> 00:10:25,530
<i>Hi, and welcome
to The Peter Griffin Side Boob Hour,</i>

151
00:10:25,613 --> 00:10:29,970
a wonderful look back on all the partial nudity
network television used to offer.

152
00:10:30,053 --> 00:10:32,487
Look at that side boob.

153
00:10:32,573 --> 00:10:35,212
Check out this side boob.

154
00:10:35,293 --> 00:10:38,569
How about that side boob? That turn you on?

155
00:10:38,653 --> 00:10:42,566
Well, it shouldn't, cos that's my side boob.

156
00:10:42,653 --> 00:10:44,132
Good night, everybody.

157
00:10:44,213 --> 00:10:45,566
So, what do you think?

158
00:10:45,653 --> 00:10:49,043
You gotta be careful
about what you put on your network.

159
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:53,649
Children are impressionable.
Remember when Chris saw Jackie Mason?

160
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:55,769
Chris, you should've left for school.

161
00:10:55,853 --> 00:10:59,607
Shiksa, don't start with me.
I forgot to go, I should've gone.

162
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:01,445
- Chris, just go.
- Mom, relax.

163
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:05,082
You look so haggard. Lie down
or your heart might go...

164
00:11:05,173 --> 00:11:08,290
Don't worry.
I got a bunch of great new shows lined up.

165
00:11:08,373 --> 00:11:10,841
Filmed in front of a live audience.

166
00:11:10,933 --> 00:11:13,083
My God. Where's my roast pheasant?

167
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:17,086
By now I think it's in my lower intestine.

168
00:11:17,173 --> 00:11:20,210
You ate it? But I told you
my boss was coming for dinner.

169
00:11:20,293 --> 00:11:23,171
Unless he likes pork rinds,
he's going home hungry.

170
00:11:24,853 --> 00:11:27,447
You cheeky bastard.

171
00:11:31,573 --> 00:11:33,325
<i>Welcome to Midnight Q.</i>

172
00:11:33,413 --> 00:11:36,371
Tonight we'll enjoy
the smooth jazz of Charles Mingus,

173
00:11:36,453 --> 00:11:39,286
Norman Mailer will read
an excerpt from his latest book,

174
00:11:39,373 --> 00:11:42,046
and we have a girl from Omaha
who's hiding a banana.

175
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:46,251
We'll find out where.
Giggety giggety, giggety goo. Stick around.

176
00:11:48,693 --> 00:11:50,206
More fan mail.

177
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,807
Sheesh, people freakin' love us.
We'll be huge.

178
00:11:52,893 --> 00:11:56,124
I want you to cancel that show
with the animals having sex.

179
00:11:56,213 --> 00:11:58,773
<i>For your information,
it's called Dogs Humping.</i>

180
00:11:58,853 --> 00:12:01,367
It is the cornerstone
of our Wednesday line-up.

181
00:12:01,453 --> 00:12:03,683
Responsibility lies with the parents.

182
00:12:03,773 --> 00:12:08,608
There are worse things for children than TV,
like when Peter baby-sat the neighbours' kid.

183
00:12:09,653 --> 00:12:14,773
Couldn't find your toys, so why don't you just
play with this blow-dryer and these rattles?

184
00:12:14,853 --> 00:12:17,606
Guess that's it.
You probably want me out of your hair,

185
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:20,491
so here's the Drano in case there's a clog.

186
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,929
Soap's right there next to the radio,
and towels are on the roof.

187
00:12:24,013 --> 00:12:26,766
So, good night.

188
00:12:26,853 --> 00:12:31,131
It's one thing if a network runs inappropriate
shows I can't do anything about,

189
00:12:31,213 --> 00:12:33,363
but I won't have it happening in my house.

190
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:37,082
There is absolutely nothing
inappropriate about my programming.

191
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:41,889
All right, Dad, you're on.

192
00:12:41,973 --> 00:12:44,931
<i>Hey, PTV fans. Welcome to Douchebags.</i>

193
00:12:45,013 --> 00:12:50,007
We're here on the I95 overpass doing our first
segment, "I Dare You To Crap Off Of That".

194
00:12:50,093 --> 00:12:54,006
We'll spend the day crapping off things
that others have dared us to crap off.

195
00:12:54,093 --> 00:12:57,802
- I dared him.
- All right. Here we go.

196
00:12:57,893 --> 00:13:00,123
I say, are those two pigs vomiting up there?

197
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:10,647
Before you yell, let me remind you
that you recklessly drove into oncoming crap.

198
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:15,124
It was inexcusable, Peter, and Stewie
may never be able to ride in the car again.

199
00:13:15,213 --> 00:13:19,252
Turn off the windshield wipers.
They don't work. They're making it worse.

200
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:22,928
Peter, that's it. I asked you
to stop this and you didn't listen to me.

201
00:13:23,013 --> 00:13:25,607
I'm sorry, but you left me no other choice.

202
00:13:25,693 --> 00:13:31,086
- I called the FCC.
- Oh, yeah. I know all about the FCC.

203
00:13:31,173 --> 00:13:34,563
They will clean up all your talking
in a menace such as this

204
00:13:34,653 --> 00:13:38,282
They will make you take a tinkle
when you want to take a piss

205
00:13:38,373 --> 00:13:41,649
And they'll make you call fellatio
a trouser-friendly kiss

206
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:43,644
Here's the plain situation

207
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:48,648
There's no negotiation
with the fellas at the freakin' FCC

208
00:13:50,693 --> 00:13:54,129
They're as stuffy
as the stuffiest of special-interest groups

209
00:13:54,213 --> 00:13:57,569
Make ajoke about your bowels
and they order in the troops

210
00:13:57,653 --> 00:14:01,089
Any baby with a brain
could tell them everybody poops

211
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,084
Take a tip, take a lesson

212
00:14:03,173 --> 00:14:08,042
You'll never win
by messin' with the fellas at the freakin' FCC

213
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:14,129
And if you find yourself
with some young, sexy thing

214
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:20,571
You're gonna have to do her
with your ding-a-ling

215
00:14:20,653 --> 00:14:22,325
Cos you can't say "penis"

216
00:14:22,413 --> 00:14:26,008
So they sent this little warning,
they're prepared to do their worst

217
00:14:26,093 --> 00:14:29,563
And they stuck it in your mailbox
hoping you could be coerced

218
00:14:29,653 --> 00:14:33,123
I can think of quite another place
they should have stuck it first

219
00:14:33,213 --> 00:14:35,090
They may just be neurotic

220
00:14:35,173 --> 00:14:36,925
Or possibly psychotic

221
00:14:37,013 --> 00:14:43,248
They're the fellas at the freakin' FCC

222
00:14:45,573 --> 00:14:47,768
Mr Griffin, that was terrific,

223
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:51,368
but I'm here to tell you
that as of today, PTV is shut down.

224
00:14:51,453 --> 00:14:55,844
Shut me down, huh?
Well, you'll have to catch me first.

225
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,764
Ow! God!

226
00:15:07,453 --> 00:15:09,091
All right, you caught me.

227
00:15:09,173 --> 00:15:13,963
We're tired of you infecting people with your
smut. It's an epidemic. It must be contained.

228
00:15:14,053 --> 00:15:19,844
Well, Mr FCC, you can stop PTV, but you can
never stop people from being who they are.

229
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:22,444
Or can we?

230
00:15:25,893 --> 00:15:28,327
- What are you doing?
- Censoring real life.

231
00:15:28,413 --> 00:15:31,246
His chin looks like balls.
Want me to cover that too?

232
00:15:34,413 --> 00:15:36,165
How long will you be censoring us?

233
00:15:36,253 --> 00:15:39,325
Until you and all of Quahog
start to clean up your act,

234
00:15:39,413 --> 00:15:42,325
like when Ozzy Osbourne
stopped biting heads off bats.

235
00:15:43,653 --> 00:15:48,522
Before I start playing,
I'm gonna eat this whole sandwich.

236
00:16:01,653 --> 00:16:04,213
I'll finish it later.

237
00:16:04,293 --> 00:16:09,890
Lois, these eggs are scrambled. I thought for
sure you'd be making eggs Benedict Arnold.

238
00:16:09,973 --> 00:16:12,362
Brian, stop writing jokes for Peter.

239
00:16:12,453 --> 00:16:15,809
You brought this on yourself
by putting on those filthy shows.

240
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:18,202
Lois, you are so full of...

241
00:16:18,293 --> 00:16:21,763
What? Now I can't say...
in my own... house?

242
00:16:21,853 --> 00:16:24,003
Great, Lois. Just great.

243
00:16:24,093 --> 00:16:27,244
You know, you're lucky
you're good at... my...

244
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:30,928
You know what I mean - when you...
lubed up... toothpaste in my...

245
00:16:31,013 --> 00:16:33,573
cherry... Episcopalian...

246
00:16:33,653 --> 00:16:38,169
extension cord... wetness...
with a parking ticket - that is the best.

247
00:16:42,253 --> 00:16:45,609
- What is this?
- The FCC has forbidden audible flatulence.

248
00:16:45,693 --> 00:16:50,448
Everyone must wear this device that converts
all fart sounds into Steven Wrightjokes.

249
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:53,650
I spilt spot remover
on my dog. Now he's gone.

250
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:55,007
This is bogus.

251
00:16:58,533 --> 00:17:00,364
Two shakes. That's it. Move along.

252
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:03,331
Why, thank you, tinkle fairy.

253
00:17:04,853 --> 00:17:06,684
Lois, you ruined everything.

254
00:17:06,773 --> 00:17:10,004
I know it's a little extreme,
but when it comes to our children,

255
00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:12,653
it's better to err on the safe side, right?

256
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:15,691
No. You know, if everybody
was as closed-minded as you,

257
00:17:15,773 --> 00:17:18,685
the world wouldn't have
some of its most inspired creations.

258
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:23,245
Man, this chocolate bar is delicious.

259
00:17:24,653 --> 00:17:27,770
Yeah, I love peanut butter.

260
00:17:31,453 --> 00:17:35,969
- I'm Officer Reeses. What happened here?
- He got peanut butter on my chocolate.

261
00:17:36,053 --> 00:17:38,806
He got chocolate in my peanut butter.

262
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:48,528
Come on.
I know what'll make you feel better.

263
00:17:48,613 --> 00:17:50,569
How about a little angry sex?

264
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,484
All right.

265
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:55,610
Whoa. Those actions
are highly inappropriate.

266
00:17:55,693 --> 00:17:58,161
What? Wait, we're not allowed to have sex?

267
00:17:58,253 --> 00:18:01,928
You can have sex, just no moaning,
no tongue kissing, no thrusting,

268
00:18:02,013 --> 00:18:04,607
no movement whatsoever.

269
00:18:06,893 --> 00:18:09,566
This isn't very romantic.
How are we supposed...?

270
00:18:09,653 --> 00:18:11,644
I'm done. Night, Lois.

271
00:18:16,293 --> 00:18:19,012
Come on, you son of a...

272
00:18:19,853 --> 00:18:21,764
...me.

273
00:18:21,853 --> 00:18:24,208
- Brian, would you mind?
- Yeah, sure.

274
00:18:24,293 --> 00:18:29,003
Sorry. I haven't had sex in two weeks.
I'm just a little on edge lately.

275
00:18:29,093 --> 00:18:32,449
There wasn't this much tension
when the slaves were freed.

276
00:18:32,533 --> 00:18:36,765
OK, so you're free to go.
But we're cool, right?

277
00:18:36,853 --> 00:18:38,684
Peter, we have to talk.

278
00:18:38,773 --> 00:18:43,085
I thought this FCC thing was a good idea
at first, but it's just gone way too far.

279
00:18:43,173 --> 00:18:45,004
What are you saying, Lois?

280
00:18:45,093 --> 00:18:48,802
Well, I don't want to admit it,
but I think you were right.

281
00:18:48,893 --> 00:18:51,361
I don't believe it. Finally I can do this.

282
00:18:53,453 --> 00:18:56,809
I set that thing up 15 years ago.
Hey, where's the clown?

283
00:18:56,893 --> 00:19:02,445
We've gotta do something about this. Pack
your bag, Peter. We're going to Washington.

284
00:19:02,533 --> 00:19:03,682
There he is.

285
00:19:05,493 --> 00:19:07,802
- Are we there yet?
- No, honey, we're not.

286
00:19:07,893 --> 00:19:09,963
- Are we there yet?
- No, Chris.

287
00:19:10,053 --> 00:19:12,613
- Are we there yet?
- Yes, Chris. OK? We're there.

288
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,682
Liar!

289
00:19:13,773 --> 00:19:18,085
<i>East of Eden? So you pretty much
do whatever Oprah tells you to.</i>

290
00:19:18,173 --> 00:19:21,131
This book's been around for 50 years.
It's a classic.

291
00:19:21,213 --> 00:19:24,330
You just got it last week.
There's an Oprah sticker on it.

292
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,927
Is that what that is? Let me peel that right off.

293
00:19:27,013 --> 00:19:30,289
- What will you read after that?
- She hasn't told us yet. Damn!

294
00:19:33,093 --> 00:19:36,768
And the motion carries.
The janitor's new nickname is Sweepy.

295
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:49,208
Gentlemen, that was a fart.

296
00:19:49,293 --> 00:19:51,966
- What's going on?
- I'll tell you what's going on.

297
00:19:52,053 --> 00:19:55,887
This government's FCC is trying
to take the farts away from television,

298
00:19:55,973 --> 00:19:58,328
and all the sex and nudity and all the poop.

299
00:19:58,413 --> 00:20:02,645
Well, I say it's wrong. These things
are part of the fabric of American life.

300
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:06,248
We appreciate your passion,
but this Congress supports the FCC.

301
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,085
Indecency is un-American.

302
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:12,325
Yeah? Well, I can prove to you
that that's a bunch of bull. Look around you.

303
00:20:12,413 --> 00:20:16,201
The Washington Monument. Looks
an awful lot like a penis, doesn't it?

304
00:20:16,293 --> 00:20:19,683
The Capitol Building -
quite obviously a giant boob.

305
00:20:19,773 --> 00:20:24,893
And the Pentagon? Well, you look me in the
eye and tell me it doesn't look like a big anus.

306
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,806
My God! How could we have been so blind?

307
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:31,727
He's right. Have you ever
looked closely at the Lincoln Memorial?

308
00:20:35,493 --> 00:20:39,805
Our top story, the FCC's content ban
on Quahog has finally been lifted.

309
00:20:39,893 --> 00:20:44,569
- Well, you did it, Peter. You beat the FCC.
- Shh, Lois.

310
00:20:44,653 --> 00:20:46,371
<i>Let's watch The Brady Bunch.</i>

311
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:51,811
Look what I did. Isn't it the biggest,
most super-special poop you've ever seen?

312
00:20:51,893 --> 00:20:57,365
Well, Cindy, I guess it's true
that big things come in small packages.

313
00:21:22,853 --> 00:21:25,765
