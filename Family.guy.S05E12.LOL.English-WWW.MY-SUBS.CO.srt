<i>Family Guy
Airport '07</i>

2
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:37,693
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Redneck Comedy Tour!</i>

3
00:00:37,709 --> 00:00:38,621
Featuring...

4
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,867
You know you're a redneck if you come
from a rural area and behave as such.

5
00:00:46,556 --> 00:00:48,630
Oh, that dog of mine!

6
00:00:59,283 --> 00:01:01,984
You tell me how that got in there!

7
00:01:05,575 --> 00:01:06,810
He's right.

8
00:01:06,826 --> 00:01:08,780
Who knows how that got in there?

9
00:01:08,813 --> 00:01:11,416
Peter, can we please go now?
This is excruciating.

10
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,493
Are you kidding, Brian?

11
00:01:12,498 --> 00:01:15,193
These men and their redneck
lifestyle really speak to me.

12
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:17,303
This is the greatest show
I've seen in years.

13
00:01:17,325 --> 00:01:19,781
Not like the last time
I was at a comedy club.

14
00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:22,373
I hear this guy's hilarious.
He played Kramer, you know.

15
00:01:22,397 --> 00:01:24,823
Oh, this is gonna be fun!

16
00:01:35,265 --> 00:01:38,110
Peter... what the hell are you
doing with a pickup truck?

17
00:01:38,227 --> 00:01:39,473
Wait. Let me guess.

18
00:01:39,486 --> 00:01:41,931
This is because of the Redneck
Comedy Festival, isn't it?

19
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:43,611
Oh, that dog of mine.

20
00:01:43,635 --> 00:01:47,060
Peter, you can't suddenly decide to be
a redneck just because of some show.

21
00:01:47,098 --> 00:01:48,423
Some show?

22
00:01:48,447 --> 00:01:50,710
Lois, those men showed me
the way to an identity

23
00:01:50,716 --> 00:01:52,493
I've been searching for my whole life.

24
00:01:52,508 --> 00:01:55,153
I am going to do everything
a redneck is supposed to do.

25
00:01:55,338 --> 00:01:57,180
This is going to be more painful to watch

26
00:01:57,195 --> 00:01:59,652
than when he ate
half a Fudgesicle in one bite.

27
00:01:59,778 --> 00:02:01,873
Oh, boy! A Fudgesicle!

28
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,991
Chris, what happened to the couch?

29
00:02:14,015 --> 00:02:16,241
Dad dragged it out on the lawn,
'cause he said

30
00:02:16,257 --> 00:02:18,422
that's what rednecks do.

31
00:02:20,226 --> 00:02:22,192
Hey, Meg, come here. Have a seat.

32
00:02:25,767 --> 00:02:27,901
Dad, what are you doing?

33
00:02:27,937 --> 00:02:29,501
Meg, I'm a redneck,

34
00:02:29,526 --> 00:02:31,873
which means I am about
to do something to you

35
00:02:31,877 --> 00:02:34,421
that you will not remember
until you're 40.

36
00:02:35,995 --> 00:02:37,451
Meg, come back here!

37
00:02:37,475 --> 00:02:38,960
I meant sex!

38
00:02:42,017 --> 00:02:45,073
<i>We now return to Carl Sagan's Cosmos,</i>

39
00:02:45,096 --> 00:02:46,503
<i>edited for rednecks.</i>

40
00:02:46,538 --> 00:02:47,931
I'm Carl Sagan.

41
00:02:47,947 --> 00:02:49,891
Just how old is our planet?

42
00:02:49,908 --> 00:02:51,801
Scientists believe it's four bil...

43
00:02:51,817 --> 00:02:54,341
<i>...hundreds and hundreds of years old.</i>

44
00:02:54,357 --> 00:02:57,652
Scientists have determined that
the universe was created by...

45
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:00,832
<i>God...!</i>

46
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:01,791
...big bang.

47
00:03:01,818 --> 00:03:04,041
<i>- If you look at the bones of a...
- Jesus.</i>

48
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:07,331
...aurus Rex, it's clear, by the
use of carbon-dating that...

49
00:03:07,357 --> 00:03:10,453
<i>Mountain Dew is the best soda ever made.</i>

50
00:03:10,527 --> 00:03:14,030
- Peter, do we have to watch this?
- This is what rednecks watch, Brian.

51
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:20,552
Peter, that's disgusting.
Here. Spit in this cup instead.

52
00:03:22,206 --> 00:03:24,200
Oh, there's my apple juice.

53
00:03:24,477 --> 00:03:25,771
Stewie, wait. Don't...

54
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:28,782
Where's my money?

55
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,173
You going to give me my money?

56
00:03:31,425 --> 00:03:32,582
Never mind.

57
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,393
Hey, Brian, check it out!

58
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:49,531
Peter, you painted over the back window.
Isn't that dangerous?

59
00:03:49,548 --> 00:03:50,722
I'm a redneck, Brian.

60
00:03:50,746 --> 00:03:53,723
We like people driving behind us
to know what our beliefs are.

61
00:03:59,997 --> 00:04:02,190
Peter, what the hell?! My car!

62
00:04:03,467 --> 00:04:05,361
Aw, damn it!
Hey! Hey, come back!

63
00:04:11,845 --> 00:04:13,452
Oh, sorry, Quagmire.

64
00:04:13,467 --> 00:04:15,201
How the hell am I supposed
to get to the airport?!

65
00:04:15,226 --> 00:04:16,971
I got to fly a plane in 20 minutes.

66
00:04:16,977 --> 00:04:19,031
Oh, I can drive you.
I got a pickup truck. See?

67
00:04:19,047 --> 00:04:19,982
Well, come on!

68
00:04:24,368 --> 00:04:27,052
- Quagmire, I am so sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

69
00:04:27,068 --> 00:04:28,580
- We can go after them.
- Don't worry about it.

70
00:04:28,597 --> 00:04:30,593
They're tagged! They're tagged!
Just get me to the airport.

71
00:04:40,536 --> 00:04:42,061
All right. Thanks a lot, Peter.

72
00:05:14,497 --> 00:05:17,711
That's all the motivation
I need to actually do this.

73
00:05:26,165 --> 00:05:27,522
Did we finish fueling?

74
00:05:27,547 --> 00:05:29,252
Do you see the hose in the plane?

75
00:05:29,255 --> 00:05:29,913
No.

76
00:05:29,937 --> 00:05:31,693
Well, then, I guess we're finished.

77
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,550
Thanks, George. You want to say that
one more time without the sarcasm?

78
00:05:36,967 --> 00:05:40,691
<i>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
This is your captain, Glenn Quagmire.</i>

79
00:05:41,496 --> 00:05:44,902
<i>We're looking at about a
four-and-a-half-hour flight time today.</i>

80
00:05:45,705 --> 00:05:48,091
<i>We've got clear skies, good visibility.</i>

81
00:05:48,135 --> 00:05:51,422
<i>The temperature in Atlanta is 64 degrees.</i>

82
00:05:53,117 --> 00:05:55,751
<i>The flight's going to be a
little longer than we've expected.</i>

83
00:05:55,776 --> 00:05:58,391
<i>We've got some very strong headwinds...
giggety.</i>

84
00:05:58,407 --> 00:06:00,593
<i>Uh, flight attendants,
please prepare for takeoff.</i>

85
00:06:06,447 --> 00:06:07,573
What the hell?!

86
00:06:09,565 --> 00:06:11,141
Oh, my God! We're going down!

87
00:06:16,257 --> 00:06:19,143
Secure your own mask first,
and then assist the child!

88
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,741
- But the bag's not inflating!
- It's all right!

89
00:06:21,768 --> 00:06:24,783
Even though oxygen is flowing,
the bag may not inflate!

90
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:39,723
That was too close.

91
00:06:40,816 --> 00:06:44,373
Sir, we have a confirmed crash.
Flight 37 is down.

92
00:06:44,406 --> 00:06:47,760
We'd better alert the mayor.
I'll have to interrupt his photo op.

93
00:06:49,657 --> 00:06:52,911
My Pet Goat. Page one.

94
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:58,032
"You know, said my pet goat, I'm sure,
if I watched Grey's Anatomy, I'd like it,"

95
00:06:58,067 --> 00:07:00,743
"but I just don't have the time."

96
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:15,240
"You should make the time,
said the farmer."

97
00:07:20,445 --> 00:07:23,713
Our top story : There was drama
in the skies of Quahog today,

98
00:07:23,727 --> 00:07:27,472
as a Trans National 767 was
forced to make a crash-landing.

99
00:07:27,486 --> 00:07:30,521
That's right, Diane. As if the world
weren't already scary enough,

100
00:07:30,546 --> 00:07:33,933
it seems you can't even get
on a plane safely these days.

101
00:07:33,956 --> 00:07:36,103
Channel 5 has the spectacular footage.

102
00:07:41,036 --> 00:07:42,850
Fortunately, no one was injured.

103
00:07:42,865 --> 00:07:46,123
However, using state-of-the-art
Channel 5 computer technology,

104
00:07:46,146 --> 00:07:48,710
we'll show you how disastrous
it could have been.

105
00:07:48,738 --> 00:07:51,713
Here's how it would have looked if
the plane had crashed into a school.

106
00:07:58,518 --> 00:08:00,672
Now here's how it would've
looked if the plane had crashed

107
00:08:00,687 --> 00:08:02,180
into a school for bunnies.

108
00:08:08,968 --> 00:08:11,000
Now here's how it would've
looked if the plane had crashed

109
00:08:11,016 --> 00:08:13,790
into a school for bunnies
but one passenger had survived,

110
00:08:13,807 --> 00:08:16,133
gone home, and mercilessly beat his wife.

111
00:08:22,976 --> 00:08:24,400
I'm alive!

112
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:26,153
But boy, am I angry!

113
00:08:26,175 --> 00:08:28,063
Someone's gonna have to pay for this!

114
00:08:29,648 --> 00:08:31,753
Why! Why!

115
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:34,870
Is this because
I overcooked the roast?!

116
00:08:35,726 --> 00:08:36,940
Powerful stuff.

117
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:39,772
You'd have to be made of stone
not to feel saddened by that.

118
00:08:39,927 --> 00:08:42,493
Boy, Quagmire,
I'm really sorry they fired you.

119
00:08:42,525 --> 00:08:44,733
I feel like this is partially my fault.

120
00:08:44,746 --> 00:08:48,093
No, Peter, it's perfectly normal to
siphon jet fuel from an active runway

121
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:49,813
with the intention of
flying a pickup truck.

122
00:08:49,838 --> 00:08:53,000
Look, I know I caused a lot of trouble,
but my redneck days are over.

123
00:08:53,036 --> 00:08:55,731
No more crotch shots of me
getting out of a car.

124
00:08:58,196 --> 00:09:00,522
Well, what are you
gonna do now, Quagmire?

125
00:09:00,545 --> 00:09:01,631
Hey, it-it's all right.

126
00:09:01,648 --> 00:09:04,142
I got enough in my savings
until I find another job.

127
00:09:04,158 --> 00:09:05,101
I'll be fine.

128
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:15,941
Mom! Dad!
There's somebody in my tree house!

129
00:09:15,966 --> 00:09:18,900
Yeah, and there's an annoying
little homo screaming in my kitchen.

130
00:09:18,915 --> 00:09:20,832
Which one do you think
I'm more pissed about?

131
00:09:20,835 --> 00:09:23,592
I'll remind you that I was invited here!

132
00:09:24,056 --> 00:09:25,721
All right, who's up there?

133
00:09:25,905 --> 00:09:29,430
- Oh, hey, Peter. Hey, Lois.
- Glenn, what are you doing up there?

134
00:09:29,465 --> 00:09:31,833
Oh, I kind of moved in, if that's okay.

135
00:09:31,846 --> 00:09:34,052
No airline'll hire me after the accident.

136
00:09:34,088 --> 00:09:35,862
I'm broke and jobless.

137
00:09:35,907 --> 00:09:38,993
Quagmire, you belong in a tree.
You're a nut.

138
00:09:43,696 --> 00:09:44,803
What?!

139
00:09:49,027 --> 00:09:51,521
Come on down, Quagmire.
You're staying with us.

140
00:09:51,547 --> 00:09:55,300
Oh, great. This is gonna be worse
than the time I lived with Marlee Matlin.

141
00:09:56,577 --> 00:09:57,860
Hi, Stewie.

142
00:09:58,203 --> 00:10:00,616
Oh, come on, Marlee,
I know you can't hear them,

143
00:10:00,614 --> 00:10:03,223
but you got to feel those
things slapping out of there!

144
00:10:07,368 --> 00:10:11,213
Listen, I really want to thank you guys
for taking me in in my time of need.

145
00:10:11,249 --> 00:10:14,270
Aw, forget it, Quagmire. It's the least
we could do after what happened.

146
00:10:17,087 --> 00:10:18,032
Hello?

147
00:10:18,808 --> 00:10:20,590
Oh, you must have a wrong number.

148
00:10:20,616 --> 00:10:23,861
There's no one here by the name
of Longrod Von Hugendong.

149
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,562
- Okay, now add 20.
- Okay.

150
00:10:31,717 --> 00:10:33,891
- Now multiply it by four.
- Okay.

151
00:10:34,227 --> 00:10:36,401
- And what do you got?
- 8,008.

152
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:39,381
And what does 8,008 look
like on a calculator?

153
00:10:40,937 --> 00:10:42,472
Oh, "boob"!

154
00:10:42,527 --> 00:10:45,101
Boob! Yeah!
All right! All right! All right!

155
00:10:45,115 --> 00:10:45,841
Boob!

156
00:10:45,856 --> 00:10:49,493
What if we had two calculators
and we put them next to each other?

157
00:10:50,336 --> 00:10:52,263
Yes, yes, yes.

158
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,871
Find one, yes!

159
00:11:08,646 --> 00:11:10,361
Didn't mean to wake ya.

160
00:11:15,786 --> 00:11:18,452
Peter, you and I need
to talk about Quagmire.

161
00:11:18,465 --> 00:11:22,233
He's been living with us for over a
month, and I think it's enough now.

162
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:25,103
Lois, I'm the whole reason
he lost his job and his house.

163
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,563
Besides, I can't throw
my best friend out on the street

164
00:11:27,568 --> 00:11:29,592
like a prom night Dumpster baby.

165
00:11:32,035 --> 00:11:34,851
Hey, what are you doing out here?
Don't you want to dance?

166
00:11:34,876 --> 00:11:35,792
Sure!

167
00:11:39,228 --> 00:11:44,243
<i>I'm just a prom night Dumpster baby</i>

168
00:11:44,646 --> 00:11:47,570
<i>I got no mom or dad</i>

169
00:11:48,565 --> 00:11:52,321
<i>Prom night Dumpster baby</i>

170
00:11:52,455 --> 00:11:56,430
<i>My story isn't long,
but boy, it's awfully sad</i>

171
00:11:57,245 --> 00:12:02,092
<i>- And though I came from a hole
- And though he came from a hole</i>

172
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:06,670
<i>- I'm singing right from the soul
- He's singing right from the soul</i>

173
00:12:06,698 --> 00:12:10,511
<i>My fanny needs a blanket
And somebody to spank it</i>

174
00:12:10,567 --> 00:12:14,033
<i>- I miss my mom
- But she's at the prom</i>

175
00:12:14,135 --> 00:12:18,132
<i>So I'm a prom night Dumpster baby</i>

176
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:21,913
<i>Prom night Dumpster baby</i>

177
00:12:23,186 --> 00:12:27,230
<i>- And I'm takin' a stroll
- He's takin' a stroll</i>

178
00:12:27,327 --> 00:12:31,181
<i>- I'm takin' a stroll
- He's takin' a stroll</i>

179
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:35,212
<i>- I'm takin' a stroll
- He's takin' a stroll</i>

180
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:39,232
<i>- I'm takin' a stroll
- He's takin' a stroll</i>

181
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:41,702
<i>I'm takin' a stroll.</i>

182
00:12:45,388 --> 00:12:47,732
Besides, Quagmire
doesn't even have a job.

183
00:12:47,747 --> 00:12:49,462
Well, you're gonna have
to help him find one,

184
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:51,611
because I've had enough of
him living in this house.

185
00:12:51,635 --> 00:12:53,371
You're overreacting, Lois.

186
00:12:53,385 --> 00:12:56,010
And you can't spell
"overreacting" without "ovary."

187
00:12:56,155 --> 00:12:59,021
- 'Cause you're a girl.
- I'm not overreacting!

188
00:12:59,048 --> 00:13:00,541
Hey, uh, just an FYI,

189
00:13:00,576 --> 00:13:03,163
really no reason to go into
any greater detail than this.

190
00:13:03,186 --> 00:13:06,773
Uh, Stewie should probably
never use this pacifier again.

191
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:10,343
Okay, so I'll talk to him tomorrow?

192
00:13:21,998 --> 00:13:25,401
- So how's the job hunt going?
- It's awful, Cleveland.

193
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:28,231
- Quagmire blew every gig we got him.
- It's too bad.

194
00:13:28,246 --> 00:13:30,901
I really liked that job working
on the Starship Enterprise.

195
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:33,181
Dude,

196
00:13:33,296 --> 00:13:36,312
you got to introduce me
to that black chick.

197
00:13:36,547 --> 00:13:39,370
Guys, the only thing I know
how to do is fly a plane.

198
00:13:39,388 --> 00:13:41,053
That's what I was born for.

199
00:13:41,107 --> 00:13:43,742
And I'll never be happy
unless I can do it again.

200
00:13:43,767 --> 00:13:45,583
Then that's the only answer.

201
00:13:45,605 --> 00:13:48,452
Somehow we've got to get
Quagmire his job back.

202
00:13:48,485 --> 00:13:51,270
Fellas, I think I have an idea.

203
00:13:54,618 --> 00:13:57,383
Okay, guys, let's go over
the plan one more time.

204
00:13:57,616 --> 00:14:01,852
<i>Quagmire will pose as an airline
passenger on the 6:00 flight to New York.</i>

205
00:14:01,945 --> 00:14:04,990
<i>Then Joe and I will sneak into
the flight attendants' lounge</i>

206
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:07,790
<i>while Cleveland distracts
the security personnel.</i>

207
00:14:08,786 --> 00:14:10,982
<i>Once we have the uniforms
and credentials,</i>

208
00:14:11,015 --> 00:14:14,892
<i>Cleveland, Joe and I will board the
plane posing as flight attendants.</i>

209
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:17,932
<i>Once we're in the air,
we drug the pilots.</i>

210
00:14:17,995 --> 00:14:22,051
<i>At which point, Quagmire is forced to
step in and land the plane safely,</i>

211
00:14:22,075 --> 00:14:23,503
<i>making him a hero.</i>

212
00:14:24,706 --> 00:14:25,821
Everybody clear?

213
00:14:25,886 --> 00:14:29,252
Boy, this sounds like more trouble
than a moose on the interstate.

214
00:14:33,646 --> 00:14:34,793
Hey, can you help me out?

215
00:14:34,806 --> 00:14:37,243
I'm trying to get a couple of
bucks for something to eat.

216
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:40,202
- What's "moose stuff"?
- Whatever you want it to be.

217
00:14:40,236 --> 00:14:41,590
I could have sex with you

218
00:14:41,616 --> 00:14:43,912
or I could just stand over there
and drink from the lake.

219
00:14:43,938 --> 00:14:45,503
And everything in between.

220
00:14:46,096 --> 00:14:47,100
Get in.

221
00:15:08,467 --> 00:15:10,991
All right, I'm gonna go
bring the pilots their coffee.

222
00:15:11,016 --> 00:15:13,533
Hang on to something, 'cause
this ride's about to get rougher

223
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:15,992
than dating a hot girl
with a bad laugh.

224
00:15:16,065 --> 00:15:20,283
- I really like you, Sandy.
- I really like you, too, Peter.

225
00:15:20,338 --> 00:15:23,430
Yeah? You like it when I kiss you here?

226
00:15:23,787 --> 00:15:26,093
- Yeah.
- How about here?

227
00:15:30,085 --> 00:15:31,740
Oh, stop, I'm tick...

228
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:37,900
Ma'am, I hate to be a nuisance,

229
00:15:37,926 --> 00:15:41,020
but your son stopped
kicking the back of my chair.

230
00:15:43,548 --> 00:15:44,731
Thank you.

231
00:15:50,945 --> 00:15:52,102
Oh, no!

232
00:15:52,127 --> 00:15:55,262
Both the pilots are unconscious,
and we're in a nosedive.

233
00:15:55,308 --> 00:15:58,480
If only there was someone
on board who could save us.

234
00:16:00,346 --> 00:16:04,670
I said if only there was someone
on board who could save us.

235
00:16:05,128 --> 00:16:08,042
Uh, Peter, I don't see Quagmire.

236
00:16:08,598 --> 00:16:10,800
- Oh, that was great.
- Thanks.

237
00:16:10,838 --> 00:16:14,683
I know you have a choice in airport sex,
and I appreciate your choosing Quagmire.

238
00:16:14,717 --> 00:16:16,772
Please exercise caution when standing up,

239
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:19,553
as the contents of your panties
may have shifted during coitus.

240
00:16:19,576 --> 00:16:22,670
All right, I got a plane to catch.
Say, which gate is flight 209?

241
00:16:22,687 --> 00:16:25,212
209? That flight left half an hour ago.

242
00:16:25,238 --> 00:16:26,890
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

243
00:16:26,908 --> 00:16:30,282
That plane's going down! My friends are
on that plane! They're all gonna die!

244
00:16:30,297 --> 00:16:33,101
- What?! Oh, no!
- And that's not the worst part.

245
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,162
Here's the condom I said I put on.

246
00:16:36,065 --> 00:16:38,032
Aren't I just the worst?

247
00:16:38,175 --> 00:16:40,783
- Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.
- And I'm Diane Simmons.

248
00:16:40,818 --> 00:16:43,012
More trouble in the skies
over Quahog tonight,

249
00:16:43,026 --> 00:16:46,161
as a Trans National jet is
apparently out of control.

250
00:16:46,177 --> 00:16:50,173
Channel 5 has this exclusive recording of
a mayday communication from the cockpit.

251
00:17:23,047 --> 00:17:25,421
Hey, there, son. Mind if I have a seat?

252
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:26,903
Hugh Hefner?!

253
00:17:26,926 --> 00:17:28,983
You look like you got
something on your mind.

254
00:17:28,995 --> 00:17:32,191
Ah, who the hell am I kidding?
I don't deserve to be a pilot.

255
00:17:32,216 --> 00:17:35,253
- I've let everybody down.
- Did you do the best you could?

256
00:17:35,317 --> 00:17:38,461
No. I was gonna, but I ended up
getting laid instead.

257
00:17:38,865 --> 00:17:41,622
That reminds me of a guy
you might've heard of.

258
00:17:41,668 --> 00:17:43,152
John Holmes.

259
00:17:43,178 --> 00:17:45,451
Greatest porn star who ever lived.

260
00:17:45,507 --> 00:17:47,273
You know what he once said?

261
00:17:47,346 --> 00:17:50,563
He said : "You know,
I've got a 13-inch member..."

262
00:17:50,616 --> 00:17:54,732
"and Glenn Quagmire is the best
damn pilot I've ever seen."

263
00:17:54,768 --> 00:17:57,820
- John Holmes said that?
- You bet he did...

264
00:17:57,846 --> 00:18:01,152
right before he died a very
painful, AIDS-related death

265
00:18:01,155 --> 00:18:04,072
from having unprotected sex
with so many people.

266
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:06,892
Excuse me, Hef.

267
00:18:07,635 --> 00:18:09,421
I got a plane to land.

268
00:18:20,586 --> 00:18:24,363
- We're all gonna die!
- I can't believe this is happening!

269
00:18:27,818 --> 00:18:30,491
<i>- Help us!
- Help!</i>

270
00:18:30,536 --> 00:18:33,303
Men, we're doing everything
in our power to get you down.

271
00:18:33,615 --> 00:18:36,292
Stand aside, sir.
I'll take it from here.

272
00:18:36,377 --> 00:18:37,860
Peter, this is Quagmire.

273
00:18:37,876 --> 00:18:41,053
Now I want you to listen very
carefully and do exactly as I tell you.

274
00:18:41,088 --> 00:18:45,533
Take a firm hold of the throttle, and
pull the red mixture knob out slowly.

275
00:18:45,548 --> 00:18:46,381
<i>Okay.</i>

276
00:18:46,398 --> 00:18:48,990
All right, now do you see a button
that looks like a drunken gay guy

277
00:18:49,005 --> 00:18:50,722
eyeing you from across the bar?

278
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,282
Yeah, I see it.

279
00:18:54,317 --> 00:18:56,230
All right, press the button
right above it.

280
00:18:56,246 --> 00:18:58,772
Some new developments
in the flight 209 drama.

281
00:18:58,797 --> 00:19:01,673
Recently discharged pilot
Captain Glenn Quagmire

282
00:19:01,678 --> 00:19:03,621
is apparently talking the plane down.

283
00:19:03,647 --> 00:19:05,482
Ollie Williams has the story. Ollie?

284
00:19:05,498 --> 00:19:08,032
- I'm at the wrong airport.
- Oops. Well, thanks, Ollie.

285
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:11,362
Coming up : Why calling every
Asian man you meet "Chung King"

286
00:19:11,387 --> 00:19:14,092
can land an anchorman in hot water.
After this.

287
00:19:18,827 --> 00:19:21,522
All right, Peter, slide
the red knob all the way out.

288
00:19:21,546 --> 00:19:25,230
And the second those wheels touch the
ground, you hit the emergency brake.

289
00:19:42,017 --> 00:19:44,200
- We made it!
- Hallelujah!

290
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:45,321
Get some!

291
00:19:45,368 --> 00:19:49,091
Well, guess there's nothing left to
do but watch the end of Last Holiday.

292
00:19:55,548 --> 00:19:56,682
Damn!

293
00:19:58,347 --> 00:20:00,312
Oh, no, she di-in't.

294
00:20:00,348 --> 00:20:03,513
- Oh, yes, she did.
- No, she di-in't.

295
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:05,993
- Yes, she did.
- No, she di-in't.

296
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:09,450
- Yes, she did, Peter! I just saw it!
- All right, take it easy.

297
00:20:12,498 --> 00:20:15,053
Ah, Glenn, we are so thrilled for you.

298
00:20:15,068 --> 00:20:17,470
Yeah, guess it didn't take too much
for you to get your job back,

299
00:20:17,485 --> 00:20:19,922
- now that you're a hero.
- Yeah, and I'm so happy for you,

300
00:20:19,938 --> 00:20:22,142
I don't even mind that I was
raped in a federal prison

301
00:20:22,156 --> 00:20:23,940
after I was arrested for hijacking.

302
00:20:23,955 --> 00:20:25,990
Well, I couldn't have
done it without you, guys.

303
00:20:26,006 --> 00:20:29,242
You put yourselves on the line
and you gave me my life back.

304
00:20:29,277 --> 00:20:30,863
I'll never forget that.

305
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:33,633
Now, if you'll excuse me.
I got to go to work.
