1
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,610
Okay, everyone. Hurry up and hand
in you oscar picks before it starts.

2
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,480
Ladies and gentlemen, Scarlett Johanson
and for some reason Stewe Bushemi.

3
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,320
Man, look at this Stewe Buscemi.

4
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,630
Everyone of his teeth is
in business for itself.

5
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,520
You know, Stewe,
the artdirector's job

6
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,280
is never an easy one.

7
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,310
That's right, Scarlett,
but this year--

8
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,120
Hey, where are you going?

9
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,530
I'm going to the Elton John party.

10
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,530
What the hell? I told you,
we're staying for the governor's ball.

11
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,290
And I told you, Tim, we would
see how the evening plays out.

12
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,000
Peter, may I use your restroom?

13
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,130
I took a lots of any
stool hardner (?), ooh.

14
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,550
And they're fighting
it out in there.

15
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,600
Yeah, it's upstairs, Mort.

16
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,630
Oh, boy! I hope there's
scale in there.

17
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,910
I'd like to have before
and after on this one.

18
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,170
I'll be out in a minute.
<i>I really need to go.</i>

19
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,370
She said she'll be out in a minute.

20
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,690
Oh, I hope there's another
bathroom in there.

21
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,780
Oh god!

22
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,710
Oh, thank god, a porto party (?).

23
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,180
Dad, mr. Goldman never
drank his Ensure.

24
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,360
Can I have it even
know it's dinner time?

25
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,430
Sure Chris. Drink Ensure as a meal.
Or inbetween meals.

26
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,220
Or when you're on the go.

27
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,630
- Is Mort still in the bathroom?
- I'll go see if he's all right.

28
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:07,590
Mort?

29
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,600
Hello? Mort?

30
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,480
Hey! Hey-hey-hey-hey!
What are you doing in my room?

31
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,200
Don't touch my stuff with you
dirty walking on the streets paws.

32
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,570
I'm looking for Mort. He came up here
an hour ago and never came back down.

33
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,360
- O-oh.
- What?

34
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,270
My time machine.
It's been activated.

35
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,890
Time machine? I didn't know
you've had a time machine.

36
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,220
Yeah, built it after I got bored
with that european "see and say".

37
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,670
The pig goes-- Wank!

38
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,330
The cow goes-- Shazoo!

39
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,330
It most certainly does not.

40
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,240
The ruster goes-- Kikkery-gee!

41
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,830
Where? Where does
the ruster say that?

42
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,760
The monkey goes-- Ma-kak!

43
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,700
Oh, no-no-no! It does not.

44
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,880
The elephant goes-
Fuamp! Oh yeah, kinda.

45
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,760
Stewie, do you think Mort might have
accidently stumbled into the time machine?

46
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,340
Yeah, I suppose it's possible.

47
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,780
Let's ask Rick Moranis and the backup
singers from "Little Shop of Horrors"

48
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,910
Da-rum. I saw a red-headed guy
come up here about an hour ago.

49
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,350
Mort...

50
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,590
He seemed to be in a rush and
had a pain look on his face.

51
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,280
Had to poop...

52
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,600
And he stepped into that box there and
suddenly there was a big flash of light.

53
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,620
<i>That's when he get back in time.</i>

54
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,440
- Oh my god! Stewie we have to get him back. Where did the machine sent him?
- I don't know.

55
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,570
How- How can you not know?
It's a time machine.

56
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,350
Doesn't it have like display
that tells the year or something?

57
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,220
Oh, I'm sorry Brian, is my time machine
not as good as your time machine?

58
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,520
Oh, yeah, oh. You probably got a
way better time machine. Yeah.

59
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,050
Stupid dog!

60
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,240
Well then-- Can't you just press a
couple of buttons and bring him back?

61
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,740
No, he can't just come back.
He needs the return pad.

62
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,980
Oh, we can't just leave
Mort back in time.

63
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,740
That'd be more irresponsible
that silent movie porn.

64
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,670
All right. We'll go get him. But remember
Brian, don't touch anything when we're in
the past.

65
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,510
Even stepping on a mosquito could create a
chain reaction that drastically alters the
present.

66
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,080
- Really?
- Nah, you can do whatever you want. C'mon!

67
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,980
Okay. If everything worked properly this
should be the exact time and place that
Mort was sent to.

68
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,320
- Now we just got to figure out where we are.
- Or when we are.

69
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,220
Oh, that's such a douche
time travellers thing to say.

70
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,260
Shazoo!

71
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,860
Okay. We're somewere in Europe.

72
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,710
Aha! Look Brian! This trail of used
tissues should lead us right to Mort.

73
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,060
Or to Quagmire.

74
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,140
Aha-ha-ha-ha. Oh, he's gross.

75
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,050
Warsaw. Well, at least
we know where we are.

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,340
And so we had him crucified.
But this doesn't leave this room.

77
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:29,240
Anyway, the point is, may Haim and Sarah
have many wonderful years together. Amen.

78
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,660
Oh, excuse me!
We're looking for mr. Goldman.

79
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,420
Mr. Mort Goldman.

80
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,190
He's a small business owner. Tends to
wine a lot. Kinda of hypochondriac.

81
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:45,110
Oh no, you can't put you hand back up after
you put it down. You know-- Never mind.

82
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,340
Stewie look at this.
September 1st, 1939.

83
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,690
There's something about that date.

84
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,780
I now pronounce you man and wife.
Mazl tov! Now step on the glass.

85
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,540
Oh, but be careful though.
At my wedding I cut myself on the glass.

86
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:07,190
And when I've got to Palm Beach for the
honeymoon I had to put a wonder bread bag
on my foot to keep the sand out.

87
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,590
Mazl tov!

88
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,000
Oh, Mort, thank god.

89
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,610
Brian and Stewie?
You're in heaven too?

90
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,770
Mort, this isn't heaven.
You've time travelled into the past.

91
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,610
What? How is that possible?

92
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,760
Just trust me, we're here
to bring you back home.

93
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,910
But it's got to be heaven,
Brian. Look!

94
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,130
There's my frugal aunt Ruth, my drifty(?
) uncle Isaac, my bogen hunting aunt Flo,

95
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,710
and my great aunt Vera, who didn't
like to spend a lot on anything.

96
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,060
C'mon Mort,
we gotta get out of here.

97
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:41,750
But Brian, when am I gonna have another
chance to see my grandpa Haim's wedding
with my own eyes.

98
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,330
Yes, you know, he's right, Brian.
Besides, I've never been to hebrew wedding.

99
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,330
Well, I guess we could
stay a little longer.

100
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,970
Oh, wonderful. I wanna be hoisted up on the
chair and see what it feels like to be top
jew.

101
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:19,580
O-oh.

102
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,110
I knew there was something
about this date.

103
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:42,310
September 1st, 1939. This is
the german invasion of Poland.

104
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,830
It's also the exact day and
year that Rene Russo was born.

105
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,340
Stewie, we gotta get
out of here fast.

106
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,410
- Quick, set up the return pad and let's get back to our own time.
- Right.

107
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,370
- What's wrong? Why we're still here?
- I don't know.

108
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,460
Stewie, it's not working.

109
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,260
Yeah. And you know what's not
gonna fix it? Your shouting.

110
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,240
Aw god! Should we ask
somebody for help?

111
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,820
Yeah, right. How many pollocks does it take
to fix the time machine? Let's find out.

112
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:11,990
No, we can't stay here. We'll have to get
Mort to England. It's the only place he'll
be safe from the nazis.

113
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,570
Oh dear, awful those nazis. If they
catch me, they'll beat me unmerciful

114
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,110
and rub dirt my assneck(?
) all over my assy nipples.

115
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:20,970
What?

116
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,130
Juden. Ruber der schmutzen
auf deine assneck.

117
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:36,110
All right, there's the checkpoint. If we can
get past it, we're out of occupied Poland.

118
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,430
Right. Mort, you're set?

119
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,530
Oh god. I hope this works.

120
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,690
Hello. We'd like to
leave Poland now.

121
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,440
And we'll be bringing our friend,
who's absolutely 100% not jewish.

122
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:50,320
Hey, how about the Jesus,
huh? What a guy!

123
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,440
Father, we are so glad you're here.

124
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,240
We needed to conduct last right
for our friend over there.

125
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,200
Oh-- Well, ah-- I suppose, eh--

126
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:05,190
Dear god! Um-- Non jewish god,
be a mensch--

127
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:10,860
I mean a good guy, 'cause it says
in the old book-- Not so old though.

128
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:16,350
You know still good, still good-- Uh,
still something good thing to say--

129
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:22,180
We pray in the name of you
and of your son, who died

130
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,830
in a freak accident, that you
can't really blame on anyone.

131
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,760
Take this man up to
your retail pain place.

132
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,280
Are you sure you are real priest?

133
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,270
Yeah, I can vouch for him,
he's real.

134
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,340
He's molested me many-many times.

135
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,260
Sorry, I'm late.
I was busy doing-- am--

136
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,710
innocent non-molested things.

137
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,850
Wait a minute. Two priests?
That is impossible!

138
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,350
This collier comes right off.

139
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,930
This is a filthy jew!

140
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:54,580
Oh boy, you, you are, you, you, you should
be glad, your HR person was not around here
then.

141
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,160
Run!

142
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,480
Hey, poppy, I need to borrow this.

143
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,670
Das poop!

144
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,430
Well, nazis, that's refreshing.

145
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,670
All right, on three we
make to the closest U-boat.

146
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:23,800
Ah, unsere untersee-boot sind stielen mit
eine dog und baby und ardga(?) fonkel.

147
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,120
Everybody hang on.

148
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,420
We're being pursued by two objects.

149
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,820
Looks like one's another U-boat.

150
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,880
The other appears to be
Terence Trent D'Arby.

151
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:57,950
Fire!

152
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,400
- O-oh.
- What?

153
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,690
Hold on to something.

154
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,690
Brian, I've got an idea.

155
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,690
It's a long shot but
it just might work.

156
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,140
- See that newspaper?
- Yeah.

157
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,490
Staff it in the waist-tube.

158
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,870
Oh my god! It's England.
We've reached England. We're saved.

159
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,970
Ah, London in war time.

160
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,970
This is history right here, Brian.

161
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,010
And look, there's
Winston Churchill.

162
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,010
Maybe we'll get an upclose
look at his legendary wit.

163
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,700
Ah, Winston, drunk again, I see?

164
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,280
Yeah, well, and you are fat bitch.

165
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,680
Wickedly funny!

166
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:15,120
Hm, I guess history is just
wittled it down to the gyms.

167
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,270
Why isn't the time machine working?

168
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,640
I'm working on it Mort, all right?

169
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,700
- Aw, here's the problem.
- What? What is it?

170
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:29,030
The transfer circuts are powered by
uranium and this thing is taped out.

171
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,300
Wait a minute, are you saying
we need to find some uranium?

172
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:35,180
I'm afraid so. But where do
we find uranium in WW2 Europe?

173
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:39,470
There's only one place. At the top
secret atomic research facility.

174
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,850
In Berlin.

175
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:43,720
Wait a minute, germany is building
weapons of mass destruction?

176
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,550
Why doesn't it matter then to
go there and kick their asses?

177
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,590
I don't know. Maybe because
they don't have any oil?

178
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:53,910
Aw, clap-clap-clap-clap-clap.

179
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,600
I don't know.
I don't wanna do this.

180
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,820
Mort, Berlin is the closest place
we're gonna find uranium in this time.

181
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:05,990
It's the only way to get home.

182
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,940
Men, as officers of the royal airforce,
you're the very best in the world.

183
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,830
However this mission to Germany
will not be an easy one.

184
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,670
Four and a half of every
five of you will not return.

185
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,630
Half of Jenson there, I can tell you,
it gets pretty sticky(?).

186
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:21,360
But I've never lost me
good spirit sir ever.

187
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:27,300
So let's get up there, be safe and get back
to the big fat pigs of wives we have
waiting at home.

188
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,130
Pardon me, sir. I'd like to join.

189
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,450
What are your qualifications?

190
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,110
I have british accent, I'm possibly
homosexual, I've never brushed my teeth and
my wife is grossly(?).

191
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,280
Bombs away.

192
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,960
- Talk to me, Gus.
- Please don't call me that.

193
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,850
You're my eyes, Gus.
Keep an eye out for this crowds.

194
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,490
O-oh, germans dead ahead.

195
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,190
Oh no, it's another wave of fighters.
We're outnumbered.

196
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,680
Oh no, we're not.

197
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,220
Stand by, my hohmen(?). DIE!!!

198
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,650
Oh my god and baby Jesus,
we're going down.

199
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,400
Quick, get the parachutes.

200
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,220
There are no parachutes,
all I could find was this.

201
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,030
A raft? We're not sinking.

202
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,150
We're crushing!

203
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,040
There it is. Berlin.

204
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,500
So, this is Berlin,
huh? Doesn't seem so bad.

205
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,980
Dear god, this place is nightmarish. Look
at the offencive way they draw a jewish
people.

206
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,300
It's here. The uranium
lab is in here.

207
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,720
Hey, psst, fellas.
You wanna get free caricature?

208
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,980
Whooo-- Yeah! I want
to be a shcateboarder.

209
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,360
Eh, there's something on here.

210
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,360
Huh, that's weird.

211
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,650
All right, c'mon.
Let's get inside that lab.

212
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,180
Hey guys!

213
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:10,510
- Hitler!
- How is it going, mr. Hitler?

214
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,410
Oh, it's a doggy-dog rike(?
) and I'm wearing a bacon pants.

215
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,260
So, how's the atomic bomb coming?

216
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,880
It's coming, it's coming.
There's some problems,

217
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,720
we have much better luck developing this
impressive collection of luftballons.

218
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,360
Oh damn!

219
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,450
Well, I guess we'll just
get you back to work.

220
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,070
Oh, I almost forgot, I can suppose you
boys have some uranium I could borrow?

221
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,540
Oh, of course. Give him
some uranium, Min Joe Green.

222
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,720
Likee. Catch.

223
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,630
Thanks, Min Joe.

224
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,060
He's not really Min at all.

225
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:43,340
Nah, he's a nice guy.

226
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,020
Okay, the time
machine is refuelled.

227
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,440
Let's find a safe spot and
make the trip back home.

228
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,590
Arrest him! Arrest all sree.

229
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,420
Zis fills are making a mockery
of our Reich. Execute them.

230
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,280
- Unless--
- Unless what?

231
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,380
Unless they can sing a
charming musical number.

232
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:46,660
[sings] Dammit, what are you do?
Just get in the fucking time machine.

233
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,410
We did it! We're home.
Everything's fine.

234
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,580
- Uh, well, not quite.
- What do you mean?

235
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,080
Don't you a little nervous that
Mort knows all about this stuff?

236
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,040
Ah, I'm one step
ahead of you, Brian.

237
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,710
You see, we've arrived thirty seconds
before Mort came up to use the bathroom.

238
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:09,340
Only this time things are gonna
play out a bit differently.

239
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,510
- Can I poop in here?
- No!

240
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:15,820
Too Late.
