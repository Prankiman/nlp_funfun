<i>We now return to JAG.</i>

4
00:00:34,844 --> 00:00:36,988
Harm, I found that evidence we need.

5
00:00:37,015 --> 00:00:40,157
Now we can finally clear that
Chief Petty Officer of all charges...

6
00:00:40,197 --> 00:00:42,672
Oh, what's the point?
Does anybody even watch this show?

7
00:00:42,707 --> 00:00:44,521
Well, yeah, old people.

8
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:46,441
I mean, they, they,
don't really pay attention.

9
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:48,211
They just like the
noise and the company.

10
00:00:48,342 --> 00:00:50,111
Hey, how you doing?

11
00:00:50,218 --> 00:00:51,903
How's that hip doing there?

12
00:00:52,747 --> 00:00:54,304
Remember the '40s?

13
00:00:58,756 --> 00:01:00,133
Hey, everybody.

14
00:01:00,168 --> 00:01:04,162
I'm just here to let y'all know that
movie night's been moved to Joe's place.

15
00:01:04,215 --> 00:01:06,402
What? We always do it here.

16
00:01:06,448 --> 00:01:08,681
Movie night at the
Griffin house is a tradition.

17
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:12,503
Yeah, but Joe just finished
putting in his new home theater.

18
00:01:12,536 --> 00:01:14,562
It's going to be tight, y'all.

19
00:01:17,547 --> 00:01:20,251
Oh, my God, Joe, how did you do this?

20
00:01:20,305 --> 00:01:23,863
I built it myself with supplies I got
at the Home Supply downtown.

21
00:01:23,927 --> 00:01:27,073
Between you and me, I think Joe's
got a little free time these days.

22
00:01:27,106 --> 00:01:29,321
I hear he hasn't touched
Bonnie in months.

23
00:01:29,345 --> 00:01:31,432
Peter, you just whispered that to me.

24
00:01:31,678 --> 00:01:34,900
Here he is...
Joe, what a great job you've done here.

25
00:01:34,937 --> 00:01:36,573
All right, let's get this started.

26
00:01:39,238 --> 00:01:42,193
<i>Thank you for choosing
Joe Swanson Theatres.</i>

27
00:02:01,337 --> 00:02:04,400
Rocky, please don't go to
Mars and fight the Martian.

28
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:06,142
I got to do what I got to do.

29
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,311
But there's no oxygen on Mars.

30
00:02:08,326 --> 00:02:11,153
Yeah? That means there's
no oxygen for him, either.

31
00:02:11,186 --> 00:02:13,341
That Martian wants a fight,
he'll get a fight.

32
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:16,782
You can't win, Rock!
You're 60 years old!

33
00:02:16,838 --> 00:02:19,070
Hey, look what Rocky
bought me with his money.

34
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:26,393
Freakin' Joe with his home theater.
Has to top everything I do.

35
00:02:26,428 --> 00:02:28,573
Well, tomorrow I'm going
to that home supply

36
00:02:28,595 --> 00:02:30,593
and I'm going to build
an entire multiplex.

37
00:02:30,635 --> 00:02:33,593
Well, let's just hope it looks
better than that balcony you built.

38
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:36,400
Boy, that was a great episode
of Lost, wasn't it, fellows?

39
00:02:36,415 --> 00:02:38,260
Well, at least the show's
got the right name.

40
00:02:38,297 --> 00:02:39,970
Yeah, I couldn't follow any of it.

41
00:02:42,065 --> 00:02:44,112
They don't care for most things.

42
00:02:50,675 --> 00:02:51,680
Can I help you?

43
00:02:51,707 --> 00:02:55,403
Yeah, I hate my neighbor and I want
to build something crazy out of spite.

44
00:02:55,448 --> 00:02:57,381
Well, I'll take you to our
"OneUpsmanship" aisle.

45
00:02:57,428 --> 00:02:59,190
Man, this place has everything.

46
00:02:59,227 --> 00:03:01,723
I bet you could even get
one of those gay mailboxes.

47
00:03:01,778 --> 00:03:04,450
Hello, hello! Right here.
Yeah, just right here.

48
00:03:04,486 --> 00:03:06,222
Just go ahead and put
that right in here. Yeah.

49
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,513
Gulp.
Just kidding.

50
00:03:08,736 --> 00:03:09,853
Uh, pardon me.

51
00:03:09,877 --> 00:03:13,993
I just bought a Rottweiler and I need a
sign to warn people how dangerous it is.

52
00:03:14,045 --> 00:03:15,482
Well, we have exactly what...

53
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:18,110
Ah, yes, here it is, "one way. "

54
00:03:18,147 --> 00:03:21,111
So people will know if
they step into my yard,

55
00:03:21,147 --> 00:03:22,983
there's only one way out...

56
00:03:23,095 --> 00:03:24,621
in a body bag...

57
00:03:24,716 --> 00:03:26,433
from dog injuries.

58
00:03:26,558 --> 00:03:27,640
Good day, ma'am.

59
00:03:29,427 --> 00:03:31,663
This'll teach Joe to
steal my movie night.

60
00:03:31,697 --> 00:03:33,940
I'm going to have my
own multiplex theater.

61
00:03:33,966 --> 00:03:36,550
I haven't been this excited since
I learned how to speak Braille.

62
00:03:36,778 --> 00:03:38,362
Hey, bump, bump,

63
00:03:38,406 --> 00:03:40,841
no bump, bump, three vertical bumps,

64
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,283
four bumps and a square.

65
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:44,470
Yeah, I've heard they all look alike.

66
00:03:47,965 --> 00:03:49,590
Hey, look what I found.

67
00:03:49,638 --> 00:03:52,282
Wow, authentic Native American remains.

68
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:53,963
Peter, I'd put that back if I were you.

69
00:03:53,987 --> 00:03:55,942
You may be disturbing
a sacred burial site.

70
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:57,772
Hey, look, it's Robin Williams.

71
00:03:58,588 --> 00:03:59,853
Black preacher voice...

72
00:04:00,837 --> 00:04:02,072
Gay Elmer Fudd.

73
00:04:03,837 --> 00:04:06,851
Ah, the more you hear it,
the funnier it gets.

74
00:04:10,575 --> 00:04:13,003
Want some more peas,
Chief Diamond Phillips?

75
00:04:13,038 --> 00:04:15,160
Peter, I really think you should
put that back where you found it.

76
00:04:15,186 --> 00:04:17,681
You know, Brian, I really don't think
you should breast-feed the skull.

77
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,393
- I'm not breast-feeding.
- All right, fine.

78
00:04:19,417 --> 00:04:21,630
God, you're pushy.
Suck, suck, suck, suck, suck...

79
00:04:22,665 --> 00:04:24,681
- So many nipples. Suck, suck, suck.
- Knock it off!

80
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,763
Oh, I'm Brian. I'm having sustenance.

81
00:04:26,795 --> 00:04:29,903
Look at me, everybody. I'm breast-feeding
in public even though it's wrong.

82
00:04:32,198 --> 00:04:36,213
<i>And now back to 1943's
Fast Talking High Trousers.</i>

83
00:04:36,238 --> 00:04:38,641
- Well, isn't this a fine song and dance?
- What are you getting so hot about?

84
00:04:38,655 --> 00:04:40,701
- Keep your shirt on.
- Where do you get off making remarks like that?

85
00:04:40,726 --> 00:04:42,851
- Supposing I say you're a lunkhead?
- Well, I ain't much for supposing.

86
00:04:42,868 --> 00:04:45,791
- Well, supposing you were?
- Maybe I'm through supposing and I fix to start figuring.

87
00:04:45,805 --> 00:04:48,040
- Ah, horseradish.
- Aren't you a pocketful of firecrackers?

88
00:04:48,065 --> 00:04:50,183
- Yeah? You got something to say about it?
- I'll say plenty.

89
00:04:50,325 --> 00:04:54,403
I can't wait to see the expression on
Joe's legs when I open my multiplex.

90
00:04:54,457 --> 00:04:57,272
I have to say I'm a little
concerned about the zoning for...

91
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,890
Peter, are you peeing in that skull?

92
00:04:59,926 --> 00:05:02,170
No, Lois, I'm getting up
and walking all the way

93
00:05:02,186 --> 00:05:03,762
to the bathroom and doing it there.

94
00:05:04,365 --> 00:05:05,692
Pain in the ass.

95
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,831
This concludes our broadcast day.

96
00:05:25,876 --> 00:05:29,800
The only time of the day I get to try
out my Fred Schneider B-52s voice.

97
00:05:29,846 --> 00:05:33,281
Now try to get some sleep out there.

98
00:05:33,827 --> 00:05:34,982
Not bad.

99
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:36,081
Getting better.

100
00:05:55,846 --> 00:05:57,041
Yeah.

101
00:05:57,707 --> 00:05:58,921
Uh-huh.

102
00:05:59,898 --> 00:06:01,272
I don't know.

103
00:06:02,108 --> 00:06:03,630
I don't know.

104
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:05,432
Oh, you didn't see it? Uh...

105
00:06:05,468 --> 00:06:07,971
Ross and Rachel got back
together. It wasn't that great.

106
00:06:26,746 --> 00:06:28,921
- Holy crap!
- What the hell was that?

107
00:06:28,965 --> 00:06:31,230
Stewie, what are you doing?

108
00:06:31,328 --> 00:06:33,280
They're here.

109
00:06:33,336 --> 00:06:35,710
- Who's here?
- The TV people.

110
00:06:35,737 --> 00:06:36,723
What?

111
00:06:36,745 --> 00:06:39,670
No, they did a spin-off.
He's still playing Joey,

112
00:06:39,705 --> 00:06:42,342
but... eh, it's not doing so well.

113
00:06:49,996 --> 00:06:51,432
Uh, Lois, have you, uh,

114
00:06:51,465 --> 00:06:53,301
noticed some spooky things going on

115
00:06:53,327 --> 00:06:55,233
ever since Peter brought
that skull into the house?

116
00:06:55,265 --> 00:06:57,001
No. What are you talking about?

117
00:06:57,035 --> 00:06:59,510
Well, like the whole business
last night with the TV.

118
00:06:59,537 --> 00:07:01,923
I'm just saying maybe,
maybe we have a poltergeist.

119
00:07:01,957 --> 00:07:04,121
Brian, there's no such thing as ghosts.

120
00:07:04,147 --> 00:07:05,420
It's all just...

121
00:07:06,486 --> 00:07:09,911
Oh, I must have accidentally stacked
all those things upside down

122
00:07:09,938 --> 00:07:13,453
and then just forgot about it.
Yeah, that's probably what happened.

123
00:07:13,477 --> 00:07:17,193
Well, I haven't seen this much denial
since John Travolta married Kelly Preston.

124
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:19,720
John, do you take
Kelly to be your wife?

125
00:07:19,757 --> 00:07:23,090
I totally do. I mean,
yeah, yes. Absolutely.

126
00:07:23,128 --> 00:07:25,750
And I'm going to do
stuff to her, too, like...

127
00:07:25,785 --> 00:07:26,721
touch her.

128
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:28,960
Yeah, touch her and...

129
00:07:29,005 --> 00:07:29,953
kiss her.

130
00:07:29,995 --> 00:07:31,431
And touch her penis.

131
00:07:31,468 --> 00:07:33,361
I mean, no, not that, not that.

132
00:07:38,508 --> 00:07:41,083
Okay, okay, try to think of a
happy place to be. Happy place...

133
00:07:41,118 --> 00:07:42,520
Um, okay, okay...

134
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:44,422
I'm on MTV's Jackass.

135
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:46,063
Hey, I'm Stewie Griffin,

136
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,841
and I'm going to be kicking
my dad's ass all day today.

137
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:54,530
What the hell?! Ah! Stewie!

138
00:07:55,025 --> 00:07:57,071
Stop! Ah! Ah! Knock it off!

139
00:07:57,117 --> 00:07:58,850
Knock it...! Ah! Ah!

140
00:07:59,235 --> 00:08:00,580
Come on!

141
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:02,501
Come on, Stewie.

142
00:08:03,356 --> 00:08:06,203
You're acting crazy out there, man.

143
00:08:11,972 --> 00:08:14,491
I haven't seen anything
suck this much since...

144
00:08:14,538 --> 00:08:17,743
I Heart Huckabees!

145
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,864
Propane.

146
00:08:38,275 --> 00:08:42,871
I wish that scary-looking clown at
the end of my bed would go away.

147
00:08:52,906 --> 00:08:54,682
<i>Hey, skinny britches.</i>

148
00:08:54,878 --> 00:08:56,890
That there is my man.

149
00:08:56,938 --> 00:09:00,092
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

150
00:09:02,937 --> 00:09:05,791
You shall not pass.

151
00:09:36,517 --> 00:09:39,012
Stewie?
Oh, my God, Stewie, honey!

152
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:40,263
Where are you?!

153
00:09:40,816 --> 00:09:42,590
Peter, I can't find him anywhere.

154
00:09:42,677 --> 00:09:44,980
<i>- Mommy?
- Stewie?</i>

155
00:09:45,007 --> 00:09:46,402
Where are you?

156
00:09:46,427 --> 00:09:48,490
<i>Look behind you, you stupid cow!</i>

157
00:09:48,526 --> 00:09:49,852
Stewie?

158
00:09:49,897 --> 00:09:52,063
Oh, my God! What's happening?

159
00:09:52,087 --> 00:09:54,331
<i>Oh, wait, hold on a second.
I want to try something.</i>

160
00:09:54,947 --> 00:09:57,033
<i>I... remember</i>

161
00:09:57,696 --> 00:10:01,141
<i>I remember the worry, worry</i>

162
00:10:01,196 --> 00:10:03,922
<i>How could I ever forget</i>

163
00:10:04,086 --> 00:10:06,232
<i>The hurt doesn't show</i>

164
00:10:06,267 --> 00:10:09,192
<i>but the pain still grows</i>

165
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:12,213
<i>No stranger to you and me</i>

166
00:10:17,997 --> 00:10:19,331
Thank you for coming.

167
00:10:19,356 --> 00:10:21,591
We've never hired a
spiritual medium before,

168
00:10:21,618 --> 00:10:23,813
but I'll do anything
to get my baby back.

169
00:10:23,837 --> 00:10:26,073
You know, Peter, we wouldn't have
to be messing around with ghosts

170
00:10:26,107 --> 00:10:28,382
if you hadn't desecrated
those Indian remains.

171
00:10:28,406 --> 00:10:31,670
Probably a bad time to mention I'm
wearing the skull as an athletic cup.

172
00:10:31,707 --> 00:10:34,412
Okay, let's talk to some spirits.

173
00:10:34,636 --> 00:10:36,563
Hey, how y'all ghosts doing?

174
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:39,493
Y'all got a little friend of
ours named Stewart up there.

175
00:10:39,858 --> 00:10:42,140
We was just wondering
if you could send him back.

176
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:43,753
Uh-huh.

177
00:10:44,557 --> 00:10:45,741
Well, yes, but I...

178
00:10:46,398 --> 00:10:49,583
Well, I don't see how that's
anybody's business but my own.

179
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:53,042
Well, how about you and my father
go and hang out at the gun range

180
00:10:53,075 --> 00:10:56,912
some afternoon and you can spend the
whole day just agreeing with each other.

181
00:10:56,938 --> 00:10:59,193
What are they saying?
Is my baby all right?

182
00:10:59,228 --> 00:11:03,232
They said that your baby had entered
their world through the closet upstairs

183
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:04,652
and that the exit is...

184
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,742
Well, I don't know
how else to say this, but...

185
00:11:06,755 --> 00:11:08,851
the exit is your daughter's bum.

186
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,450
Meg's ass!

187
00:11:14,096 --> 00:11:15,760
You ready down there?

188
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:19,562
Okay, Meg, if this works, then we might
just have a chance at getting Stewie back.

189
00:11:19,605 --> 00:11:20,963
- Are you ready?
- No.

190
00:11:20,997 --> 00:11:23,081
- Ready!
- Okay, here we go.

191
00:11:25,327 --> 00:11:27,003
- Got it!
- Cool!

192
00:11:27,026 --> 00:11:29,402
- Ass ball!
- Peter, it worked!

193
00:11:29,435 --> 00:11:31,761
We found the portal to the other side.

194
00:11:33,497 --> 00:11:35,921
Peter, what the hell
are you doing up there?

195
00:11:35,966 --> 00:11:37,913
We're gonna get those terrorists.

196
00:11:37,935 --> 00:11:39,423
Now watch this drive.

197
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:46,021
Stewie?! Stewie, if you can
hear me head for Meg's butt!

198
00:11:46,065 --> 00:11:48,093
<i>Have you lost your mind?</i>

199
00:11:48,136 --> 00:11:51,440
<i>And, Lois, get ready to laugh.
Get ready to laugh.</i>

200
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:54,850
Gee, must've taken a
wrong turn at Albuquerque.

201
00:12:00,797 --> 00:12:03,402
Are you sure Stewie
can find his way out?

202
00:12:03,427 --> 00:12:05,343
We just got to be patient, Lois,

203
00:12:05,495 --> 00:12:08,262
like waiting on the
results of a blood test,

204
00:12:08,348 --> 00:12:11,152
a real important blood test.

205
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:14,290
Will I ever see my baby brother again?

206
00:12:14,338 --> 00:12:17,340
Only if he can find his
way into the light, Chris.

207
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:20,053
For some people, it's easier than others.

208
00:12:20,096 --> 00:12:23,023
Some people just get lost
on the way to the light.

209
00:12:23,156 --> 00:12:25,710
They're walking along,
they stop and say,

210
00:12:25,747 --> 00:12:27,862
"Ooh, is that a new restaurant?"

211
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,860
"That place must've just opened up. "

212
00:12:29,908 --> 00:12:33,121
Cause I remember there was
another place there a few weeks ago.

213
00:12:33,175 --> 00:12:36,991
I went in there once and there was
a guy with a harelip eating soup,

214
00:12:37,035 --> 00:12:39,273
and I was like, "Ew... '"

215
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:44,240
It wasn't the restaurant's fault, I know.
But I still never went back there.

216
00:12:44,287 --> 00:12:47,631
I mean, I guess there's only,
like, a one in 50 chance

217
00:12:47,657 --> 00:12:50,202
of me getting the same
spoon that he had,

218
00:12:50,255 --> 00:12:52,573
but I still don't like them odds.

219
00:12:55,268 --> 00:12:57,472
Oh, I can't bear this anymore!

220
00:12:57,515 --> 00:12:59,801
If Stewie can't find his
way out of Meg's ass,

221
00:12:59,828 --> 00:13:02,720
we have to enter the other
realm and get him ourselves.

222
00:13:02,745 --> 00:13:04,612
Lois, I told you it ain't safe.

223
00:13:04,638 --> 00:13:07,580
I'll tell you what's not safe:
going hunting with Dick Cheney.

224
00:13:07,645 --> 00:13:09,342
So you all set to go hunting?

225
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:17,840
Sorry, I thought you were a deer.

226
00:13:20,077 --> 00:13:22,583
- Be careful, Lois.
- I will, Peter.

227
00:13:31,006 --> 00:13:32,833
I don't feel anything!

228
00:13:32,908 --> 00:13:35,862
Now she knows how I felt
when I was at her piano recital.

229
00:13:37,265 --> 00:13:39,062
No, you're doing fine, Meg.

230
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:42,872
Stewie, you're all right!

231
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,772
Oh, thank God you guys are... ew!
You're covered in slime.

232
00:13:45,796 --> 00:13:48,872
Ugh! This must be how Tom Arnold
felt on his wedding night.

233
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,443
Holy crap! Let's get out of here.

234
00:13:55,997 --> 00:13:57,803
Wait a minute. Where's Meg?

235
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,002
- I don't know.
- I didn't see her.

236
00:13:59,027 --> 00:14:01,343
Yeah, I kind of thought you
guys would attend to that.

237
00:14:01,356 --> 00:14:02,880
Peter, you got to go back and get her.

238
00:14:02,905 --> 00:14:04,783
Oh, yeah, right, like
I'm going back for Meg.

239
00:14:04,796 --> 00:14:07,203
- Peter!
- Lois, damn it, we both agreed, remember?

240
00:14:07,228 --> 00:14:09,112
If we could only save two, we leave Meg.

241
00:14:09,137 --> 00:14:10,841
- I know, but...
- You bastard!

242
00:14:10,865 --> 00:14:12,242
How could you leave me in there?!

243
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:14,633
Okay, see? It resolved itself.

244
00:14:17,378 --> 00:14:19,050
Oh, I forgot one thing.

245
00:14:28,527 --> 00:14:32,462
A bit of breaking news. A local family
is forced out of their home by ghosts.

246
00:14:32,495 --> 00:14:33,812
Who are they gonna call?

247
00:14:33,978 --> 00:14:35,360
Ghostbusters, Tom?

248
00:14:35,385 --> 00:14:37,450
No, Diane, their insurance company.

249
00:14:37,497 --> 00:14:39,011
That's just stupid what you said.

250
00:14:39,037 --> 00:14:42,673
And now back to Disney's Too
Many Ostriches starring Don Knotts.

251
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,373
There's way too many ostriches.

252
00:14:45,845 --> 00:14:48,732
Why there's so many ostriches?

253
00:14:48,925 --> 00:14:52,591
The brochure said there'd
only be a few ostriches.

254
00:14:52,815 --> 00:14:55,473
This is a terrible vacation!

255
00:14:58,008 --> 00:14:59,940
So, what was it like
on the other side?

256
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:02,410
- Well, I met Jesus up there.
- Wow, what's he like?

257
00:15:02,446 --> 00:15:04,332
Uh, believe it or not, he's Chinese.

258
00:15:04,355 --> 00:15:06,520
- Really?
- Yup, Jesus is Chinese.

259
00:15:06,556 --> 00:15:08,331
In fact, his last name is Hong.

260
00:15:08,358 --> 00:15:09,632
Jesus Hong.

261
00:15:09,907 --> 00:15:12,253
Says he has no idea where
people are getting "Christ. "

262
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,220
Quagmire, you got to help us.

263
00:15:14,235 --> 00:15:15,601
We pissed off a bunch of ghosts,

264
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,881
and now our house is gone
and we got no place to stay.

265
00:15:17,898 --> 00:15:19,692
Uh, Peter, this is the best time.

266
00:15:19,738 --> 00:15:21,360
<i>Glenn, are you coming?</i>

267
00:15:21,525 --> 00:15:23,013
Yeah, honey, I'll be right there.

268
00:15:23,835 --> 00:15:24,831
I'll be right there.

269
00:15:24,855 --> 00:15:27,390
Peter, I'm really slammed right now.
Can you give me the short version?

270
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,993
Uh, what, uh...

271
00:15:29,288 --> 00:15:31,093
- What's going on in there?
- Nothing.

272
00:15:34,966 --> 00:15:37,143
So, as you can see, my family's here.

273
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:38,970
and, uh, it's game night.

274
00:15:39,637 --> 00:15:40,663
We're playing...

275
00:15:41,535 --> 00:15:42,461
sex.

276
00:15:47,258 --> 00:15:49,353
Ugh, a soup kitchen, Dad?

277
00:15:49,388 --> 00:15:51,471
Isn't there any other place we can go?

278
00:15:51,496 --> 00:15:54,212
We're homeless, Meg.
This is where homeless people go.

279
00:15:54,247 --> 00:15:56,341
Well, it'll just be good
to get some food in us.

280
00:15:56,376 --> 00:15:58,411
Hi, welcome to the soup kitchen.

281
00:15:58,437 --> 00:16:02,132
I'll just start you off with this basket
of pizza crusts and apple cores.

282
00:16:02,168 --> 00:16:04,311
Oh, and we do have one special today.

283
00:16:04,327 --> 00:16:07,713
It's an avocado pit with a
little bit of avocado still on it,

284
00:16:07,735 --> 00:16:10,270
and that comes on a ripped
pair of boxer shorts.

285
00:16:10,297 --> 00:16:14,003
Now, I'm trying to decide between
the tossed spaghetti on a newspaper

286
00:16:14,027 --> 00:16:16,400
and the half yogurt with
the balled-up tissue in it.

287
00:16:20,616 --> 00:16:23,332
Hi, there. Do you have any
books on how to get rid of ghosts?

288
00:16:23,365 --> 00:16:26,123
Have you tried telling them
you're ready for a commitment?

289
00:16:30,286 --> 00:16:32,683
- Like a relationship.
- Exactly.

290
00:16:32,718 --> 00:16:34,620
That'll send them running, huh?

291
00:16:36,835 --> 00:16:38,341
I like her.

292
00:16:41,025 --> 00:16:43,052
Here you go. Maybe this'll help.

293
00:16:46,307 --> 00:16:47,261
All right, here it is.

294
00:16:47,288 --> 00:16:51,451
"To vanquish poltergeists, one
must restore all disturbed remains"

295
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:53,332
"to their original resting places. "

296
00:16:53,356 --> 00:16:56,652
So, all we got to do is bring
the skull back home and bury it.

297
00:16:57,218 --> 00:16:58,260
What are you doing?

298
00:16:58,295 --> 00:17:00,583
You said you were using
the skull as an athletic cup.

299
00:17:00,608 --> 00:17:03,240
I was, but don't you remember,
I threw it in the garbage?

300
00:17:04,497 --> 00:17:06,543
So, you're not wearing it now?

301
00:17:06,576 --> 00:17:09,420
No. That's, uh, pretty much
just me you're grabbing.

302
00:17:09,456 --> 00:17:12,311
That's how my old
scoutmaster shakes hands.

303
00:17:21,647 --> 00:17:25,403
- Ew, that is vile.
- I know, I hate myself, but it's so good.

304
00:17:27,736 --> 00:17:30,423
- Can I help you folks find something?
- No, we're just browsing.

305
00:17:30,446 --> 00:17:32,412
God, I hate it when they
pester you like that.

306
00:17:32,446 --> 00:17:34,610
Peter! Yes, we need help.

307
00:17:34,675 --> 00:17:37,483
We're looking for a skull
that my husband threw away.

308
00:17:37,506 --> 00:17:40,182
A skull, huh?
Then you want the human remains bin.

309
00:17:40,215 --> 00:17:42,751
But I should warn you folks,
we're pretty cleaned out right now,

310
00:17:42,786 --> 00:17:45,962
'cause Carrot Top comes by every
morning to rummage for new props.

311
00:17:45,977 --> 00:17:49,180
Well, then we'll just have
to pay this Carrot Top a visit.

312
00:17:49,197 --> 00:17:50,753
He's funny.

313
00:17:50,796 --> 00:17:54,891
Except for that one show he did in Ohio
after the airline lost his luggage.

314
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,291
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Carrot Top!</i>

315
00:17:58,007 --> 00:18:00,213
All right, you guys
look like a good crowd!

316
00:18:00,257 --> 00:18:02,521
I hope it goes well,
'cause I don't have my prop trunk.

317
00:18:02,547 --> 00:18:04,350
I normally have, like,
a case with all my...

318
00:18:04,356 --> 00:18:05,982
little props and gadgets
and what not, but...

319
00:18:05,996 --> 00:18:08,781
it's okay, you can use your imagination,
like maybe a piece of luggage,

320
00:18:08,806 --> 00:18:11,773
that shoots dog biscuits, so, like,
if you had, like, weed in your bag

321
00:18:11,797 --> 00:18:13,712
and you went to the airport,
you could shoot the dog biscuits out,

322
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,072
and then, the drug dog would be...

323
00:18:15,087 --> 00:18:16,770
would go away from your bags, kind of...

324
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,451
if you can imagine the dog...

325
00:18:18,747 --> 00:18:19,540
the dog...

326
00:18:19,675 --> 00:18:22,160
Man, it's a lot funnier
if I had my prop.

327
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:26,222
<i>Well, there it is:</i>

328
00:18:26,348 --> 00:18:28,211
<i>Carrot Top Manor.</i>

329
00:18:35,027 --> 00:18:37,090
So, you having a good time
there, Chief Diamond Phillips?

330
00:18:37,137 --> 00:18:40,152
Oh, that's funny, he came up with the
same thing that... All right, Carrot Top!

331
00:18:40,195 --> 00:18:42,663
- I want that skull.
- Who the hell are you?

332
00:18:42,696 --> 00:18:45,491
I'm Peter Griffin,
and that skull belongs to me.

333
00:18:45,515 --> 00:18:48,140
Well, it's hardly
just a skull, Mr. Griffin.

334
00:18:48,165 --> 00:18:50,231
I put it on my head,
and it's a skull cap!

335
00:18:51,485 --> 00:18:54,091
Put it with David Duchovny,
and it's Agent Skully.

336
00:18:55,285 --> 00:18:57,851
You got to appreciate that...
Hey, don't distract me.

337
00:18:57,898 --> 00:18:59,712
Now, hand it over, Mr. Top.

338
00:18:59,736 --> 00:19:03,103
Very well, Mr. Griffin, I'll give you the
skull, but you have to catch me first!

339
00:19:08,538 --> 00:19:10,903
Looks like you found me, Mr. Griffin.

340
00:19:11,037 --> 00:19:13,992
But which one of us is the
real king of prop comedy

341
00:19:14,017 --> 00:19:15,981
and not just an illusion, huh?

342
00:19:16,206 --> 00:19:19,701
That's right, Mr. Griffin,
just a little further.

343
00:19:24,477 --> 00:19:25,630
Sucker.

344
00:19:26,837 --> 00:19:29,393
What the hell?
How'd you get through the trap door?!

345
00:19:29,427 --> 00:19:32,611
- I found this saw with glasses on it.
- Oh, that's my see-saw.

346
00:19:35,818 --> 00:19:37,281
Oh, my God!

347
00:19:37,487 --> 00:19:38,921
Oh, my God!

348
00:19:39,067 --> 00:19:41,383
You are so ***** funny!

349
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:45,150
You are so ***** you for being so funny!

350
00:19:45,676 --> 00:19:47,180
Oh, my God!

351
00:19:47,918 --> 00:19:50,251
Oh, God. You know what?
Here, here, just, you know what?

352
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:52,151
Keep it. Keep it. You deserve it.

353
00:19:52,827 --> 00:19:53,872
Just take it.

354
00:19:54,795 --> 00:19:56,373
No, no, I need it. I need it.

355
00:19:58,606 --> 00:20:02,032
Well, Chief, time for you to go
back where you came from.

356
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,141
Peter, you did it.

357
00:20:18,497 --> 00:20:19,632
What the hell?

358
00:20:25,397 --> 00:20:27,702
Oh, Peter, I'm so proud of you.

359
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,322
Once again, you brought our
family to the edge of the abyss,

360
00:20:30,346 --> 00:20:33,000
and at the very last minute,
you saved us all.

361
00:20:33,088 --> 00:20:36,450
- I love you, honey.
- And I've grown fond of you, Lois.

362
00:20:36,507 --> 00:20:38,211
Let's go home.

363
00:20:51,157 --> 00:20:54,000
