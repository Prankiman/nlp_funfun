ANNOUNCER: We now return
to <i>Jeopardy Presents:</i>

13
00:00:38,451 --> 00:00:40,619
"The Best of Contestant Banter."

14
00:00:40,654 --> 00:00:43,522
So, Ben, it says here
you have a connection to milk.

15
00:00:43,556 --> 00:00:45,291
Yes, funny story.
I discovered recently

16
00:00:45,325 --> 00:00:47,026
that I have an allergy to milk.

17
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,829
(chuckles) So I guess we won't
be eating any cheese around you.

18
00:00:50,864 --> 00:00:54,066
And Dennis, you once spent
a night in a tent?

19
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,468
So, uh, what do you guys got
planned for the weekend?

20
00:00:56,503 --> 00:00:58,771
I don't know. I might sit
out in the front yard

21
00:00:58,805 --> 00:01:00,372
with a rake and
wave at cars.

22
00:01:00,407 --> 00:01:02,341
Yeah, and I found a hole
in my fence

23
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:03,876
I was gonna maybe
stick stuff through.

24
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:04,943
God, look at us.

25
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:06,712
How'd we become so dull
and pathetic?

26
00:01:06,746 --> 00:01:07,713
You're right.

27
00:01:07,747 --> 00:01:09,214
I mean, we used
to have hobbies.

28
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:10,749
Remember when I was
a horse whisperer?

29
00:01:10,784 --> 00:01:12,685
(whinnies)

30
00:01:14,454 --> 00:01:15,654
Shh, shh, shh.

31
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:17,556
(whinnies, nickers)

32
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:22,094
That's right.
I bet you're hungry.

33
00:01:22,128 --> 00:01:23,529
(softly):
It's okay.

34
00:01:25,398 --> 00:01:27,933
That calmed you down,
you (bleep) horse.

35
00:01:27,967 --> 00:01:29,468
Maybe it's time
the three of us

36
00:01:29,502 --> 00:01:30,936
do something exciting
to shake things up.

37
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,538
Hey, now that's
a good idea, Joe!

38
00:01:32,572 --> 00:01:34,106
All right, okay,
I have two ideas.

39
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,374
One that I think is awesome,

40
00:01:35,408 --> 00:01:36,775
and one that I think
is stupid.

41
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,577
See if you can guess
which one is which.

42
00:01:38,611 --> 00:01:43,082
We could either
A) Rob a Mafia poker game,

43
00:01:43,116 --> 00:01:44,850
(flatly):
or B) Skydive.

44
00:01:44,884 --> 00:01:47,252
Skydiving, huh?
I'd be totally up for that!

45
00:01:47,287 --> 00:01:49,088
Yeah, I've always wanted
to try skydiving!

46
00:01:49,122 --> 00:01:51,690
Really? Eh, could be fun,
I guess.

47
00:01:51,725 --> 00:01:52,925
Besides, I haven't done
anything new

48
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,927
since I learned
to use a palm frond.

49
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:57,329
(whispers): So do I try
to match your speed?

50
00:01:57,364 --> 00:01:58,931
Yeah, just match my speed.

51
00:01:58,965 --> 00:02:00,599
And do we stagger
our waves

52
00:02:00,633 --> 00:02:02,134
or do 'em
at the same time?

53
00:02:02,168 --> 00:02:03,869
Um, they should've covered this
in orientation.

54
00:02:03,903 --> 00:02:06,338
Guards, have
the new guy executed!

55
00:02:06,373 --> 00:02:07,773
Am I the new guy?

56
00:02:11,244 --> 00:02:13,278
All right, we're almost at
our jumping altitude .

57
00:02:13,313 --> 00:02:14,713
Does anyone have
any questions?

58
00:02:14,748 --> 00:02:17,216
Yeah, I got one. Can I listen
to my iPod on the way down?

59
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,717
Of course. Just as long

60
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,619
as it's not
Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".

61
00:02:20,653 --> 00:02:22,287
I'll just keep
it in my pocket.

62
00:02:22,322 --> 00:02:23,322
Any other questions?

63
00:02:23,356 --> 00:02:24,556
Let's do this!

64
00:02:24,591 --> 00:02:28,127
That wasn't a question.
Back of the line.

65
00:02:28,161 --> 00:02:29,628
Okay, let's do this!

66
00:02:29,662 --> 00:02:31,597
JOE:
Hey!

67
00:02:31,631 --> 00:02:33,031
Whoa, is that
Harrison Ford?

68
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:34,533
Yeah. It said in
the brochure

69
00:02:34,567 --> 00:02:36,402
that he assists
with all the jumps.

70
00:02:36,436 --> 00:02:40,305
Get off my plane!
Get off my plane!

71
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,441
Get off my plane!

72
00:02:42,475 --> 00:02:44,877
Oh, look, he even brought
Calista Flockhart with him.

73
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:47,346
Uh, Peter, I think that's
just a piece of paper.

74
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,947
Good, 'cause
she looked fat.

75
00:02:48,982 --> 00:02:51,116
HARRISON FORD:
Get off my plane!

76
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:53,519
Get off my plane!
Get off my plane!

77
00:02:53,553 --> 00:02:55,154
All right!

78
00:02:55,188 --> 00:02:57,356
Yeah! This is amazing!

79
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,824
I know,
it's unbelievable!

80
00:02:58,858 --> 00:03:01,126
Hey, guys, let's try
to re-create this feeling

81
00:03:01,161 --> 00:03:03,028
for the rest of our lives,
with drugs.

82
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:08,033
Oh, it looks like
it's almost time

83
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:10,068
for us to pull our cords.

84
00:03:10,103 --> 00:03:11,703
Wait, wait, guys.
How about this?

85
00:03:11,738 --> 00:03:14,072
Last one to open their chute
gets 20 bucks.

86
00:03:14,107 --> 00:03:15,808
Okay.
I'm in.

87
00:03:18,445 --> 00:03:19,978
Damn it!

88
00:03:21,848 --> 00:03:24,349
I'm dead already, Peter.

89
00:03:24,384 --> 00:03:26,018
You're looking
at a dead man.

90
00:03:26,052 --> 00:03:28,987
I might not even pull
the cord at all.

91
00:03:30,023 --> 00:03:31,990
(groans, whimpers)

92
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:35,694
Holy crap, this is awesome!

93
00:03:35,728 --> 00:03:38,664
I haven't felt a rush like this
since I won that marathon!

94
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,301

winner Peter Griffin.

97
00:03:46,806 --> 00:03:48,106
Peter, how did you do it?

98
00:03:48,141 --> 00:03:49,308
I'll tell ya, Bob.

99
00:03:49,342 --> 00:03:51,210
I just got in my car
and drove it.

100
00:03:51,244 --> 00:03:53,745
And when there was a guy
in my way, I killed him.

101
00:03:57,116 --> 00:03:59,284
Kids, have you seen

Peter, this skydiving thing

You've destroyed half

And I'm afraid you're
gonna really hurt yourself.

No, not my first time.

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,642
Am I living or am I dying?

158
00:06:36,676 --> 00:06:39,011
O, Great Spirit, free me

159
00:06:39,045 --> 00:06:41,813
from the bonds of gravity
and criticism.

160
00:06:41,848 --> 00:06:43,915
Deliver me
from my greatest enemy.

161
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,651
His name is Peter.

162
00:06:45,685 --> 00:06:49,187
More specifically,
Peter's Shyness In Public.

163
00:06:49,222 --> 00:06:50,789
O, Great Spirit,

164
00:06:50,823 --> 00:06:53,392
why do I hold myself back
in such situa...?

165
00:06:53,426 --> 00:06:55,560
Oh, (bleep) (bleep)
the ground!

166
00:06:55,595 --> 00:06:58,730
(gasps) Damn it!

167
00:06:58,765 --> 00:07:00,032
The Eiffel Tower?

168
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:01,800
Oh, cool, I'm in Paris!

169
00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:04,736
MAN: Hey, look at that douchebag
who got stabbed in the butt!

170
00:07:04,771 --> 00:07:07,572
Aw, crap, I'm in Vegas.

171
00:07:13,807 --> 00:07:15,708
Well, Peter, I'm glad
you're all right,

172
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,311
but I hope this is the end
of your skydiving career.

173
00:07:18,345 --> 00:07:19,446
Yeah, I'm sorry, Lois.

174
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,347
You know, when I thought
I was gonna die,

175
00:07:21,382 --> 00:07:23,717
I saw my whole life flash
before my eyes,

176
00:07:23,751 --> 00:07:26,453
and we did way too much
<i>Star Wars</i> crap.

177
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:29,222
I should get the kids home.
It's way past dinner.

178
00:07:29,256 --> 00:07:31,057
What she really means is

179
00:07:31,092 --> 00:07:32,892
that it's shaky Mommy's
white wine time.

180
00:07:32,927 --> 00:07:35,095
Let's go, kids! Come on!
We really gotta go, kids.

181
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:36,262
Let's go! Come on!

182
00:07:36,297 --> 00:07:39,065
Excuse me. Now that
your family is gone,

183
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,401
would you mind if
we turn on the TV?

184
00:07:41,435 --> 00:07:43,570
Oh, hey. I didn't know
anyone was here.

185
00:07:43,604 --> 00:07:45,004
I, uh, I was just kidding

186
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,906
when I told my family
I loved 'em.

187
00:07:46,941 --> 00:07:48,074
I am Mahmoud.

188
00:07:48,109 --> 00:07:51,044
I'm Peter. You know,
I never seen a hat

189
00:07:51,078 --> 00:07:53,079
like that before,
so I'm very scared of it.

190
00:07:53,114 --> 00:07:54,614
No, this is just
a taqiyah.

191
00:07:54,648 --> 00:07:56,349
It's a traditional
Muslim prayer cap.

192
00:07:56,383 --> 00:07:58,985
Oh. Hey, you know who'd look
funny wearing one of those?

193
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:00,353
The Monopoly guy.

194
00:08:00,387 --> 00:08:02,789
(laughs) Correct!

195
00:08:02,823 --> 00:08:05,091
Go directly to jail
and convert to Islam!

196
00:08:05,126 --> 00:08:07,193
(laughs)
'Cause they do that!

197
00:08:07,228 --> 00:08:09,829
(chuckles weakly)
Yes, that is what I intended.

198
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,397
Hey, you're all right,
Mahmoud.

199
00:08:11,432 --> 00:08:12,699
You, too, Peter.

200
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:14,400
So, what do you
wanna watch?

201
00:08:14,435 --> 00:08:16,703
Well, if you turn on
Channel 14,

202
00:08:16,737 --> 00:08:19,072
we can probably catch the end
of <i>Muslim Looney Tunes.</i>

203
00:08:19,106 --> 00:08:21,241
(upbeat Middle Eastern
music plays)

204
00:08:21,275 --> 00:08:22,642
(stuttering)

205
00:08:22,676 --> 00:08:24,377
As a pig, I am very dirty

206
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:26,846
and should not be touched
by humans.

207
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,085
So, how was
the hospital, Peter?

208
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:33,720
Oh, my God,
that place was incredible.

209
00:08:33,754 --> 00:08:36,856
They have this one jar, whole
thing was full of cotton balls.

210
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,759
It's amazing how far
medical technology has come.

211
00:08:39,794 --> 00:08:41,961
Well, sure is good
to have you back.

212
00:08:41,996 --> 00:08:43,630
Joe is, uh...
(clears throat)

213
00:08:43,664 --> 00:08:46,566
chattier than you'd think
he'd be when you're not here.

214
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,667
Look, I'm just saying

215
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:49,669
if "pro" is the opposite
of "con",

216
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:51,371
what is the opposite
of "progress"?

217
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,438
Think about it.

218
00:08:52,473 --> 00:08:53,740
You know, I actually had

219
00:08:53,774 --> 00:08:55,241
a pretty good time in
the hospital.

220
00:08:55,276 --> 00:08:56,943
I even made a new friend.
You did?

221
00:08:56,977 --> 00:08:58,077
Yeah, his name's Mahmoud.

222
00:08:58,112 --> 00:09:00,747
In fact, I told him to swing by
if he had time.

223
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:01,781
It's "congress."

224
00:09:01,816 --> 00:09:03,082
Hello, Peter!

225
00:09:03,117 --> 00:09:05,385
Oh, hey! You made it!
Hey, guys, this is Mahmoud.

226
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,153
Mahmoud, this is Brian,
Quagmire and Joe.

227
00:09:07,188 --> 00:09:08,188
Hello.
Hi, there.

228
00:09:08,222 --> 00:09:09,522
Hey, there.
Hello. How are you?

229
00:09:09,557 --> 00:09:10,757
Have a seat.

230
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,792
Any friend of Peter's is
a friend of ours.

231
00:09:12,827 --> 00:09:15,061
Hey, Mahmoud, you know,
I'm actually glad you're here.

232
00:09:15,095 --> 00:09:16,596
Settle an argument
we were having earlier.

233
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,964
Which Spanish chick has
better jugs:

234
00:09:17,998 --> 00:09:19,866
Salma Hayek
or the other one?

235
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,368
Oh, but I do not pay
attention to such things.

236
00:09:22,403 --> 00:09:23,837
I am married.
What?

237
00:09:23,871 --> 00:09:25,305
Okay, well,
how about this, Mahmoud?

238
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:27,173
You know "progress" has
the word "pro" in it, right?

239
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,408
Shut up, Joe!

240
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,710
Hey, you guys, come on.
Let's get the man a drink.

241
00:09:30,744 --> 00:09:31,811
What are you having?

242
00:09:31,846 --> 00:09:33,379
How about a ginger ale?

243
00:09:33,414 --> 00:09:36,249
But if you'll excuse me,
right now I have to go

244
00:09:36,283 --> 00:09:38,952
bring great shame to myself
by using the restroom.

245
00:09:38,986 --> 00:09:40,453
Isn't he great?

246
00:09:40,487 --> 00:09:41,454
No, he's weird.

247
00:09:41,488 --> 00:09:42,856
Why'd he order
a ginger ale?

248
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,757
And who the hell doesn't
look at jugs?

249
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,459
Yeah, and he's got
his cell phone clipped

250
00:09:46,493 --> 00:09:49,262
to his belt like he's some
kind of big shot on vacation.

251
00:09:49,296 --> 00:09:51,397
Oh, I see what's going on.

252
00:09:51,432 --> 00:09:53,533
You guys are uncomfortable with
Mahmoud because he's Muslim.

253
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:55,368
What? What are you
talking about?

254
00:09:55,402 --> 00:09:57,337
This is your post-9/11 racism
talking.

255
00:09:57,371 --> 00:09:59,839
I, for one, think it's great
that Peter has enough

256
00:09:59,874 --> 00:10:01,975
of an open mind
to have a Muslim friend.

257
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:05,044
You know, a lot of dogs
just sit outside, tied to poles.

258
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:06,546
Look, Mahmoud's my friend, okay?

259
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,415
So he's Muslim.
Every culture has its quirks.

260
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,384
Italian guys talk
with their hands a lot,

261
00:10:11,418 --> 00:10:12,886
Irish guys drink a lot,

262
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,588
black guys change their shirts
while they tell you a story.

263
00:10:15,623 --> 00:10:17,824
So, how's Bernadette?
She's all right.

264
00:10:17,858 --> 00:10:19,459
She's taking interior
design classes

265
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,060
down at the
community college.

266
00:10:21,095 --> 00:10:22,929
I mean, she's good at
haircutting and everything.

267
00:10:22,963 --> 00:10:25,164
They gave her the chair
right by the door.

268
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:26,699
But I guess now
she wants

269
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:28,601
to hang plates on the
wall or whatever.

270
00:10:28,636 --> 00:10:30,336
And you know she gained
the weight back

271
00:10:30,371 --> 00:10:31,337
from the Lap-Band,
right?

272
00:10:31,372 --> 00:10:33,006
That Bernadette
and her pie.

273
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,474
You know it, brother.

274
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,976
Okay, I'm gonna go eat this steak
in the bathroom.

275
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,112
Thanks for getting
dinner, man.

276
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:45,118
(house music thumping, blaring)

277
00:10:45,152 --> 00:10:47,921
Wow, this place is
really cool, Mahmoud.

278
00:10:47,955 --> 00:10:50,290
It's like ear-bloodening
sounds had sex

279
00:10:50,324 --> 00:10:53,026
with nose-bloodening smells
and this is their baby.

280
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,827
I am glad
you are enjoying yourself.

281
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,163
Would you like some
of my meat fooshnoosh?

282
00:10:57,197 --> 00:10:59,599
It's a chicken that has
been yelled at for two hours

283
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:01,434
and then run over
by a Mercedes.

284
00:11:01,468 --> 00:11:03,202
Mmm! Mmm! Oh!

285
00:11:03,237 --> 00:11:05,271
You can really taste
the fear in the chicken.

286
00:11:05,306 --> 00:11:06,372
You know, Peter,

287
00:11:06,407 --> 00:11:08,074
a lot of people are
not as accepting

288
00:11:08,108 --> 00:11:09,676
of Muslim culture
as you are.

289
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,644
Well, I think everything
about it is the best.

290
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,879
Like this hookah.

291
00:11:12,913 --> 00:11:14,447
I mean, who doesn't want
to sit around a table

292
00:11:14,481 --> 00:11:16,482
with a bunch of guys and
suck on the same thing?

293
00:11:20,254 --> 00:11:23,389
Mmm, it's like smoking
my grandfather's jacket.

294
00:11:23,424 --> 00:11:25,458
Man, I wish I could stay
here all night, Mahmoud.

295
00:11:25,492 --> 00:11:26,793
But I'm supposed
to pick up

296
00:11:26,827 --> 00:11:28,148
the dry cleaning
before it closes.

297
00:11:28,162 --> 00:11:29,762
I killed a mouse
with my tie.

298
00:11:29,797 --> 00:11:30,797
Nonsense.

299
00:11:30,831 --> 00:11:32,298
I'll have my wife
pick it up for you.

300
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,599
What?
She'd do that?

301
00:11:33,634 --> 00:11:35,735
Oh, absolutely.

302
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:38,104
I need you to run an errand
for my friend Peter.

303
00:11:38,138 --> 00:11:39,138
Of course.

304
00:11:39,173 --> 00:11:40,840
Anything for you,
husband.

305
00:11:41,976 --> 00:11:43,142
That was amazing.

306
00:11:43,177 --> 00:11:44,877
She just listened
to everything you said.

307
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,112
Of course she listened.

308
00:11:46,146 --> 00:11:47,180
In Muslim culture,

309
00:11:47,214 --> 00:11:48,982
wives are much more obedient.

310
00:11:49,016 --> 00:11:50,516
No way!
That's awesome!

311
00:11:50,551 --> 00:11:51,951
So wait, let me
get this straight:

312
00:11:51,986 --> 00:11:53,619
Sweet hat, obedient wife,

313
00:11:53,654 --> 00:11:55,955
and I get to shout
"Admiral Akbar"

314
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,023
when I do stuff?

315
00:11:57,057 --> 00:11:59,892
You, sir, have got
yourself a Muslim.

316
00:12:05,499 --> 00:12:06,666
Peter, where
are you going?

317
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,201
And why are you
dressed like that?

318
00:12:08,235 --> 00:12:10,069
Well, Lois, I happen
to be a Muslim now,

319
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,804
which means I'll be
spending a lot of my time

320
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,007
in mostly-empty cafes,
watching soccer

321
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,842
on an eight-inch
black-and-white TV.

322
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:17,677
Yes! The team I like
is kicking it!

323
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:19,579
Oh no! The team I don't like
is kicking it!

324
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,614
Yes! The team I like
is kicking it again!

325
00:12:21,648 --> 00:12:23,516
I will celebrate
with finger cymbals.

326
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,718
(chiming)

327
00:12:25,753 --> 00:12:26,986
Hey, is that for real,

328
00:12:27,021 --> 00:12:30,056
that-that "Diarrhea Only" sign
on your bathroom?

329
00:12:33,093 --> 00:12:34,794
Peter, this is my friend Omar.

330
00:12:34,828 --> 00:12:36,662
He can teach you many things
about our faith,

331
00:12:36,697 --> 00:12:38,097
including how to ululate.

332
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,799
What's that?
It's this:

333
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,034
(rapidly trilling
vocalization)

334
00:12:41,068 --> 00:12:43,002
Oh, my God!
That's terrifying.

335
00:12:43,037 --> 00:12:44,237
I don't know if
I'm ready for that.

336
00:12:44,271 --> 00:12:45,571
No, Peter, it's okay.

337
00:12:45,606 --> 00:12:47,540
Just sing the
beginning of "La Bamba,"

338
00:12:47,574 --> 00:12:49,106
but don't say the
"La Bamba" part.

339
00:12:49,131 --> 00:12:50,109
Oh, okay.

340
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,377
(rapidly trilling vocalization)
Yes, good job!

341
00:12:51,412 --> 00:12:52,578
You're doing it!
♪ Bamba.

342
00:12:52,613 --> 00:12:54,047
Ooh, so close.

343
00:12:56,016 --> 00:12:58,718
All right, Lois,
I'm off to the bazaar.

344
00:12:58,752 --> 00:12:59,719
What do you mean?

345
00:12:59,753 --> 00:13:00,720
You mean the market?

346
00:13:00,754 --> 00:13:01,788
Yeah, the bazaar.

347
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:02,989
Well, if you're
going to the market,

348
00:13:03,023 --> 00:13:04,223
can you pick
up some cereal,

349
00:13:04,258 --> 00:13:05,538
some butter, and
a loaf of bread?

350
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,893
I'll see what
they have.

351
00:13:06,927 --> 00:13:08,694
All right, Lois.

352
00:13:08,729 --> 00:13:10,329
Here's six cobras,
a bolt of silk,

353
00:13:10,364 --> 00:13:11,431
and a ram's horn.

354
00:13:11,465 --> 00:13:12,532
Peter, what the hell?

355
00:13:12,566 --> 00:13:14,600
Hey, can you help me
with the 20 paper bags

356
00:13:14,635 --> 00:13:16,035
of dates I got in the car?

357
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,404
Why the hell would you
get 20 bags of dates?

358
00:13:18,439 --> 00:13:20,540
The monkey in the little
vest who was selling them

359
00:13:20,574 --> 00:13:21,808
happened to be
very persuasive.

360
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:22,909
(sighs)
You know what?

361
00:13:22,943 --> 00:13:23,910
Fine.

362
00:13:23,944 --> 00:13:25,511
I'm just gonna
assume this will pass,

363
00:13:25,546 --> 00:13:28,581
like your "everywhere is a
racquetball court" phase.

364
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:39,992
(Peter gasping)

365
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,928
So, Mike, now that you've
thoroughly kicked my butt

366
00:13:41,962 --> 00:13:43,763
all over the court,
what do you say we take

367
00:13:43,797 --> 00:13:45,865
one quick second to talk
about the Wichita account?

368
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:48,101
And let me assure you,
my racquetball game

369
00:13:48,135 --> 00:13:50,770
is no indication of how we do
business here at J.T. Stern.

370
00:13:50,804 --> 00:13:51,771
(chuckles)

371
00:13:51,805 --> 00:13:53,506
Okay, zero serving zero.

372
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,310
I have to say, Peter,

373
00:13:57,344 --> 00:13:58,744
I am impressed by how much

374
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:00,279
you have committed
yourself to Islam.

375
00:14:00,314 --> 00:14:01,547
Are you kidding?
It's awesome.

376
00:14:01,582 --> 00:14:03,249
I even started wearing
leather sandals

377
00:14:03,283 --> 00:14:04,717
with way-too-long
toenails.

378
00:14:04,751 --> 00:14:06,352
See how the big ones
are getting yellow?

379
00:14:06,386 --> 00:14:08,287
Ah, yes, very Muslim.

380
00:14:08,322 --> 00:14:10,690
Listen, Peter, some
friends of mine and I

381
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:11,991
are getting
together tonight

382
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:13,860
and we wanted to invite
you to join us.

383
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,828
O.M.A.

384
00:14:15,863 --> 00:14:17,130
I am so there!

385
00:14:17,164 --> 00:14:18,698
Whose crappy van
should we take?

386
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,133
Actually, we are
meeting here.

387
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:22,068
Follow me.

388
00:14:23,804 --> 00:14:24,770
Oh, hey, you guys.

389
00:14:24,805 --> 00:14:26,139
Hey, is anyone
gonna object

390
00:14:26,173 --> 00:14:27,974
if I pick my nose
with a dagger?

391
00:14:28,008 --> 00:14:29,442
Mahmoud,
who is this man?

392
00:14:29,476 --> 00:14:30,743
Why would you
bring him here?

393
00:14:30,777 --> 00:14:32,411
Do not worry.
This is Peter.

394
00:14:32,446 --> 00:14:33,746
He believes
in our cause.

395
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,181
How can
you be sure?

396
00:14:35,215 --> 00:14:36,215
Give him the test.

397
00:14:38,485 --> 00:14:39,585
Who is better?

398
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,854
Hulk Hogan or the Iron Sheik?

399
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:44,190
Um, the Iron Sheik?

400
00:14:44,224 --> 00:14:46,025
Okay. He is one of us.

401
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:47,160
I told you.

402
00:14:47,194 --> 00:14:48,961
Look at him,
he is the perfect man

403
00:14:48,996 --> 00:14:51,063
to help us blow up
the Quahog Bridge.

404
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,064
(makes car noises)

405
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,733
(imitates explosion)

406
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,067
Ah! Oh my God!

407
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,068
Everybody down!

408
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,303
(imitates gunfire)

409
00:14:57,337 --> 00:14:59,572
So are these toys just, like,
to take?

410
00:15:05,996 --> 00:15:08,097
Hey, guys, what football
team should I like?

411
00:15:08,131 --> 00:15:09,465
Mahmoud says
we all need

412
00:15:09,499 --> 00:15:11,133
to act like we're fans
of American football

413
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:14,737
so we seem less...
b-buh... buhspicious.

414
00:15:14,771 --> 00:15:16,171
What?
What are you talking about?

415
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,573
I'm talking about Mahmoud.

416
00:15:17,607 --> 00:15:19,475
You know, I actually feel
really bad for him.

417
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:22,511
Did you know he knew 19 guys
who died on 9/11?

418
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:23,846
I mean, what are the odds?

419
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,147
Peter, I think
you joined

420
00:15:25,181 --> 00:15:26,582
a terrorist
sleeper cell.

421
00:15:26,616 --> 00:15:28,050
What?! That's crazy.

422
00:15:28,084 --> 00:15:29,852
Look, I'm gonna
call Mahmoud right now

423
00:15:29,886 --> 00:15:31,320
on this cell
phone he gave me.

424
00:15:31,354 --> 00:15:32,121
He'll tell you.

425
00:15:32,155 --> 00:15:33,789
(keypad beeping)

426
00:15:33,823 --> 00:15:34,924
(explosion, glass shattering)

427
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:35,991
Damn phone's busted.

428
00:15:36,026 --> 00:15:37,059
Maybe I dialed wrong.

429
00:15:37,093 --> 00:15:38,894
(keypad beeping)

430
00:15:38,929 --> 00:15:40,462
(explosion, people screaming)

431
00:15:40,497 --> 00:15:42,331
Peter, please stop trying
to call Mahmoud.

432
00:15:42,365 --> 00:15:43,499
This is very
serious.

433
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:44,967
Your friends
are terrorists.

434
00:15:45,001 --> 00:15:46,201
Think about it.

435
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,636
They're... they're
meeting in secret,

436
00:15:47,671 --> 00:15:49,471
they're creating
cover stories...

437
00:15:49,506 --> 00:15:51,040
Oh, my God, you're right!

438
00:15:51,074 --> 00:15:52,975
See, I told you
Mahmoud was bad news!

439
00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:54,510
Those guys are
all bad news.

440
00:15:54,544 --> 00:15:55,945
Hang on there,
Quagmire.

441
00:15:55,979 --> 00:15:58,013
Just because these few
guys are terrorists

442
00:15:58,048 --> 00:15:59,548
doesn't mean
all Muslims are.

443
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,951
Every ethnic group
has their nut-jobs.

444
00:16:01,985 --> 00:16:04,119
We have the Unabomber,
Timothy McVeigh,

445
00:16:04,154 --> 00:16:06,188
and even that fat guy
at the Atlanta Olympics

446
00:16:06,222 --> 00:16:07,890
who didn't do it,
but he looked mean,

447
00:16:07,924 --> 00:16:09,258
so we said he did.

448
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:11,412
Joe, you don't get to talk
about the regular Olympics.

449
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,028
Well, I gotta go
down there right now

450
00:16:13,063 --> 00:16:14,697
and tell Mahmoud we can't
be friends anymore.

451
00:16:14,731 --> 00:16:15,831
Wait a minute, Peter.

452
00:16:15,865 --> 00:16:17,933
This could actually
be an opportunity.

453
00:16:17,968 --> 00:16:19,802
You're already
in their group.

454
00:16:19,836 --> 00:16:21,136
They trust you.

455
00:16:21,171 --> 00:16:23,505
If you can find out what
they're planning next,

456
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,208
we might actually be able
to stop an act of terror.

457
00:16:26,242 --> 00:16:27,610
You'd be a hero.

458
00:16:27,644 --> 00:16:30,245
Well, I...
I could try.

459
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,880
I mean, I am a
pretty good actor.

460
00:16:31,915 --> 00:16:33,449
Remember how upset
I seemed to get

461
00:16:33,483 --> 00:16:34,917
when Lois said she
was leaving town

462
00:16:34,951 --> 00:16:36,452
with the kids
for a few days?

463
00:16:36,486 --> 00:16:38,821
Oh, my God, I'm gonna
miss you guys so much.

464
00:16:38,855 --> 00:16:40,456
Don't forget to call
and let me know

465
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,491
exactly when
you'll be back.

466
00:16:42,525 --> 00:16:43,525
Get out.

467
00:16:47,831 --> 00:16:49,398
Okay, you're all set.

468
00:16:49,432 --> 00:16:52,301
Remember, we'll be in the van
listening to everything,

469
00:16:52,335 --> 00:16:53,569
so if anything goes wrong,

470
00:16:53,603 --> 00:16:55,070
we'll pull you right
out of there.

471
00:16:55,105 --> 00:16:56,205
Don't you worry, Joe.

472
00:16:56,239 --> 00:16:57,906
I'll blend in
like a chameleon

473
00:16:57,941 --> 00:16:59,742
in Courtney
Love's crotch.

474
00:16:59,776 --> 00:17:01,343
Oh my God!

475
00:17:01,378 --> 00:17:02,611
Where did you
just come from?

476
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:05,748
A very, very
bad hiding place.

477
00:17:09,185 --> 00:17:11,186
Okay, before we get started,

478
00:17:11,221 --> 00:17:13,088
I have an announcement
from headquarters.

479
00:17:13,123 --> 00:17:14,723
"No more shorts."

480
00:17:14,758 --> 00:17:17,226
And this isn't coming from me,
this is management.

481
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,727
This is about me, isn't it?

482
00:17:18,762 --> 00:17:20,095
They don't name names.

483
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:23,599
They just say,
"No more shorts," okay?

484
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:25,367
All right, this is our target.

485
00:17:25,402 --> 00:17:26,468
The Quahog Bridge.

486
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,137
We loaded a van
with explosives,

487
00:17:28,171 --> 00:17:29,772
which we will drive
to the bridge and...

488
00:17:29,806 --> 00:17:31,407
Wait a minute-- explosives?

489
00:17:31,441 --> 00:17:33,442
Is this not improv class?

490
00:17:33,476 --> 00:17:34,109
No.

491
00:17:34,144 --> 00:17:35,110
Is...

492
00:17:35,145 --> 00:17:36,211
is this improv?

493
00:17:36,246 --> 00:17:37,613
Are you doing improv?

494
00:17:37,647 --> 00:17:39,448
No. Now get out that door!

495
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:44,086
The real door!

496
00:17:45,655 --> 00:17:47,056
Yes, I have a question:

497
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,191
When exactly are we
doing the bombing?

498
00:17:49,225 --> 00:17:50,693
The attack will
happen tomorrow

499
00:17:50,727 --> 00:17:52,261
during afternoon
rush hour.

500
00:17:52,295 --> 00:17:54,229
And that's actually where
you come in, Peter.

501
00:17:54,264 --> 00:17:56,999
In order to get past the
checkpoint at the toll plaza,

502
00:17:57,033 --> 00:17:59,468
we will need an American
behind the wheel

503
00:17:59,502 --> 00:18:01,770
to arouse the least amount
of suspicion.

504
00:18:01,805 --> 00:18:03,172
Sorry, can you repeat all that?

505
00:18:03,206 --> 00:18:05,207
I just had an itch
right by my microphone.

506
00:18:05,241 --> 00:18:06,241
Microphone?!

507
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,544
He's wearing a wire!

508
00:18:12,682 --> 00:18:14,416
Hey, Joe, can I ask
you a question?

509
00:18:14,451 --> 00:18:16,151
Can you fart?
Oh, of course I can.

510
00:18:16,186 --> 00:18:17,486
I've got a button
for it right here.

511
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,021
(farting)

512
00:18:19,055 --> 00:18:20,055
Aw, cool!

513
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,990
(Peter whimpering)

514
00:18:22,025 --> 00:18:23,926
Hold on. Oh, no!

515
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,728
It sounds like they
found Peter's wire!

516
00:18:25,762 --> 00:18:27,429
Change of plans.

517
00:18:27,464 --> 00:18:29,798
The attack happens now.

518
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,707
Now drive.

519
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,576
Man, I never thought
it would end like this.

520
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,277
Why, what did
you imagine?

521
00:18:42,312 --> 00:18:45,147
Basically the same thing,
only Nathan Lane.

522
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:48,117
♪ Now, drive!

523
00:19:00,697 --> 00:19:02,164
Okay, you're
good to go.

524
00:19:06,503 --> 00:19:08,070
Pull over up here.

525
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,708
Please, Mahmoud,
don't do this.

526
00:19:12,742 --> 00:19:13,776
It is too late.

527
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,010
The job must be done.

528
00:19:15,044 --> 00:19:16,812
Look, I know you're mad
at our government,

529
00:19:16,846 --> 00:19:19,581
but you gotta realize,
that's only part of America.

530
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:20,983
We're the land of the free

531
00:19:21,017 --> 00:19:23,185
and the home of the sunburnt,
freckled fat guy.

532
00:19:23,219 --> 00:19:25,487
A place where Jenny McCarthy
has a role

533
00:19:25,522 --> 00:19:27,489
in the debate over
childhood vaccinations.

534
00:19:27,524 --> 00:19:29,858
A country where you can walk
into any IHOP

535
00:19:29,893 --> 00:19:31,293
and see black women fighting.

536
00:19:31,327 --> 00:19:33,462
And where Ubu is considered
a good dog

537
00:19:33,496 --> 00:19:34,696
even though he never sat.

538
00:19:34,731 --> 00:19:36,698
We're the proud nation
where someone can

539
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:38,734
shoot up their entire workplace
with a thing,

540
00:19:38,768 --> 00:19:41,570
and then the next day nobody
talks about banning that thing.

541
00:19:41,604 --> 00:19:43,772
It's the land that
lets people on Twitter

542
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,874
spell the word "their"
any way they want.

543
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:47,543
And where, if you think
you can dance,

544
00:19:47,577 --> 00:19:50,345
that assertion will be
challenged and evaluated.

545
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,446
For we...

546
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,115
are America.

547
00:19:53,149 --> 00:19:54,516
You will not convince me.

548
00:19:54,551 --> 00:19:56,952
America must pay for its sins!

549
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,957
Hold it right there!

550
00:20:04,294 --> 00:20:06,328
Mahmoud, you're under arrest.

551
00:20:06,362 --> 00:20:08,764
Look, Joe,
I drove a van.

552
00:20:15,138 --> 00:20:17,773
Oh, Peter,
I'm so glad you're okay.

553
00:20:17,807 --> 00:20:19,474
Oh, me too, Lois.

554
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,009
That was some
pretty rough stuff.

555
00:20:21,044 --> 00:20:24,046
You... you didn't
cry, did you?

556
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,315
Well, I mean, I went
through an awful lot.

557
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:28,784
Peter, if you cried,
we are done.

558
00:20:28,818 --> 00:20:30,319
Great job, Peter.

559
00:20:30,353 --> 00:20:32,654
Thanks to you, 30 terrorists are
behind bars,

560
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,323
and every middle-class Arab
in this town

561
00:20:34,357 --> 00:20:36,291
is now under suspicion.

562
00:20:36,326 --> 00:20:37,292
So what
happens next,

563
00:20:37,327 --> 00:20:38,448
do those guys
all get trials?

564
00:20:38,461 --> 00:20:40,696
Well, you know...
(mumbling)

565
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:44,032
(sighs) It's a long... it's the
process, and... whatever.

566
00:20:44,067 --> 00:20:45,300
Well, what do
you guys say

567
00:20:45,335 --> 00:20:46,969
we all go celebrate
at the Clam?

568
00:20:47,003 --> 00:20:48,136
That's a great idea.

569
00:20:48,171 --> 00:20:50,072
Yeah, I think we could
all use a drink.

570
00:20:50,106 --> 00:20:51,607
Tell you what,
let me call Horace

571
00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:53,842
and tell him to
get our table ready.

572
00:20:55,845 --> 00:20:57,813
Peter, did you just...
Let's go, let's go, let's go...

573
00:20:57,847 --> 00:21:02,847
