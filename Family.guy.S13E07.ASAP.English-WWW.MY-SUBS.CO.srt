ANNOUNCER:
You are watching Amazon Prime,

13
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:38,614
the network that brought you
your sunscreen in two days.

14
00:00:38,648 --> 00:00:42,345
Amazon Prime-- like
the eighth best way to watch TV.

15
00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:44,676
Hi, Chris, how
was school?

16
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,976
Wait, what's that note
pinned to your backpack?

17
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,644
Bet it's from a girl
in the lunchroom

18
00:00:48,678 --> 00:00:50,641
who wants a taste
of corn dog.

19
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,304
Was that a sex joke?

20
00:00:52,338 --> 00:00:53,338
It's...

21
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:54,707
I don't know,
shut up.

22
00:00:54,742 --> 00:00:57,400
Oh, dear, it's from
Principal Shepherd.

23
00:00:57,442 --> 00:00:59,936
Peter, he wants to see us
first thing tomorrow.

24
00:00:59,978 --> 00:01:01,546
Oh, Chris is
in trouble.

25
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,881
Sounds like he needs a
little fatherly wisdom.

26
00:01:03,915 --> 00:01:05,510
Better get my pipe.

27
00:01:05,544 --> 00:01:07,506
Peter, I think that's
the wrong kind of pipe.

28
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,841
I'm sorry, Mom.

29
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:10,839
I haven't been doing
too great in school lately.

30
00:01:10,881 --> 00:01:12,508
Well, that's
very disappointing.

31
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:15,177
I guess your father and I will
have to talk to the principal

32
00:01:15,211 --> 00:01:16,669
and figure out
how to handle this.

33
00:01:16,703 --> 00:01:17,836
Ah, I wouldn't
worry, Lois.

34
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,507
I never did very well
in school either.

35
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:21,138
I even failed
homeroom.

36
00:01:21,172 --> 00:01:22,241
Peter Griffin?

37
00:01:22,275 --> 00:01:23,375
There.

38
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:28,970
Thank you for coming,
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin.

39
00:01:29,004 --> 00:01:31,336
Chris seems to be
struggling in his classes,

40
00:01:31,378 --> 00:01:33,670
and often when kids
have trouble in school,

41
00:01:33,712 --> 00:01:35,844
it's because something
is going on at home.

42
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:38,506
I haven't been attracted to Lois
for a year and a half.

43
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,543
Principal Shepherd, exactly
how poorly is Chris doing?

44
00:01:41,577 --> 00:01:44,540
Well, right now,
he has a D-minus average.

45
00:01:44,574 --> 00:01:46,706
His only hope is
his history final tomorrow.

46
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,041
If he fails that,

47
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:50,175
I'm afraid he'll have
to repeat ninth grade.

48
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:53,011
This... seems more
like a phone call.

49
00:01:53,045 --> 00:01:54,170
Oh, my God.

50
00:01:54,212 --> 00:01:56,177
I-I always knew Chris wasn't
a great student,

51
00:01:56,211 --> 00:01:59,005
but I had no idea
the situation was so dire.

52
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,959
Don't worry, I'll make
sure Chris passes history.

53
00:02:00,972 --> 00:02:02,441
You can count on me.

54
00:02:02,475 --> 00:02:05,975
The same way NASA counted on me
during the<i> Apollo 13</i> crisis.

55
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:07,476
All right, I'm gonna
need three coffins--

56
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,811
mahogany with
brass handles--

57
00:02:08,845 --> 00:02:10,640
three new daddies for the
dead astronauts' kids,

58
00:02:10,674 --> 00:02:11,975
and a black
suit for me.

59
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:14,971
Sir, I think I know a way
we can get them back.

60
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:15,970
Is it hard?

61
00:02:16,004 --> 00:02:17,137
It might be.

62
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:18,974
Yeah, we-we've kind
of already decided

63
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,341
we're going in
this direction.

64
00:02:24,371 --> 00:02:26,008
All right, Chris,
you got a lot riding

65
00:02:26,042 --> 00:02:27,343
on this history
exam tomorrow.

66
00:02:27,377 --> 00:02:28,343
I know.

67
00:02:28,376 --> 00:02:30,174
Sam Cooke didn't
know much about history,

68
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,677
and he got shot in a hotel

69
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:34,011
wearing nothing
but a sports coat and a shoe.

70
00:02:34,045 --> 00:02:36,178
Yeah, that's hilarious, Chris,
but we've got to buckle down.

71
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:38,681
Now, I'm gonna help you study
by nailing your door shut.

72
00:02:38,715 --> 00:02:41,218
That way, you'll have no
choice but to hit the books.

73
00:02:41,252 --> 00:02:42,882
(hammering)

74
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:45,216
(cell phone buzzes) Oh, crap, I left
my phone in there.

75
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,718
(jiggles handle) Damn
it, it's nailed shut.

76
00:02:46,753 --> 00:02:49,021
(cell phone beeps) Dad, it looks like
some girl sent you

77
00:02:49,055 --> 00:02:50,347
a picture of her privates.

78
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:52,282
Oh, crap! Lois!
I don't have the phone!

79
00:02:52,324 --> 00:02:53,784
(cell phone beeps twice)
Stop sending pictures!

80
00:02:53,818 --> 00:02:55,550
LOIS:
I already sent four more!

81
00:02:55,584 --> 00:02:57,053
(cell phone beeps four times)

82
00:02:57,087 --> 00:02:58,884
Chris, put down the phone!
Don't look at those!

83
00:02:58,918 --> 00:03:01,323
Wait a minute,
that's both her hands!

84
00:03:01,357 --> 00:03:03,492
Who the hell is
taking the pictures?!

85
00:03:03,526 --> 00:03:05,830
All right, give me that
phone and get back to work.

86
00:03:05,864 --> 00:03:07,199
And before you
judge your mother--

87
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:09,233
you did most
of that damage.

88
00:03:13,108 --> 00:03:14,577
(sighing):
Oh.

89
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,905
Hey, Chris.

90
00:03:15,947 --> 00:03:17,577
Just wanted to see
how the studying's going.

91
00:03:17,611 --> 00:03:19,577
You guys, I've been
at this all night,

92
00:03:19,611 --> 00:03:21,578
and I haven't
learned a thing.

93
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:24,417
There's no way I'm gonna pass
Mr. Harpington's history test.

94
00:03:24,451 --> 00:03:25,585
Oh, come on, Chris.

95
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:27,250
I'm sure that's
just the nerves talking.

96
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,584
Here, I'll quiz you.

97
00:03:28,618 --> 00:03:31,919
Who said, "We have nothing
to fear but fear itself"?

98
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,086
Scooby-Doo?

99
00:03:33,128 --> 00:03:34,254
No.
Shaggy?

100
00:03:34,296 --> 00:03:35,758
It's nobody on<i> Scooby-Doo.</i>

101
00:03:35,792 --> 00:03:37,261
Wow, Chris,
you, uh...

102
00:03:37,295 --> 00:03:38,491
you really don't
know history.

103
00:03:39,861 --> 00:03:42,162
And if I fail ninth grade,
I won't amount to anything.

104
00:03:42,196 --> 00:03:44,160
I'll end up being
one of those bus drivers

105
00:03:44,194 --> 00:03:46,432
that parents don't
completely trust.

106
00:03:48,801 --> 00:03:51,135
You have a beautiful
child, Mrs. Roberts.

107
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,739
God, poor Chris.

108
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:58,261
He's studying as hard as he can,
but it doesn't seem to matter.

109
00:03:58,277 --> 00:03:59,579
Well, we got to
do something.

110
00:03:59,613 --> 00:04:01,346
If he doesn't pass this
test, he's gonna have to...

111
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,681
Hey.

112
00:04:02,715 --> 00:04:04,184
...he's gonna have to
repeat ninth grade.

113
00:04:04,218 --> 00:04:06,047
Well, there's not much
we can do about it.

114
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:08,001
Some people just aren't able
to learn from books.

115
00:04:08,017 --> 00:04:10,714
Well, maybe he
doesn't have to.

116
00:04:10,748 --> 00:04:11,748
What do you mean?

117
00:04:11,786 --> 00:04:12,911
Maybe there's a way

118
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:14,749
to actually show
Chris history...

119
00:04:14,783 --> 00:04:16,084
with my time machine.

120
00:04:16,118 --> 00:04:17,745
You know, that's really
nice of you, Stewie.

121
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:18,912
Well, he's my brother.

122
00:04:18,946 --> 00:04:20,247
We've got to
stick together.

123
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:22,717
Like that two-headed
girl on TLC.

124
00:04:22,752 --> 00:04:25,981
Okay, who wants to taste it,
and who wants to smell it?

125
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:36,148
All right, we'll just
tell Chris he's dreaming,

126
00:04:36,182 --> 00:04:38,411
because I don't want him
to know about my time machine.

127
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,411
Why not?

128
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,850
Eh, it's like having
a pickup truck.

129
00:04:40,884 --> 00:04:42,985
Once people know you got one,
there go your weekends.

130
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:43,984
Chris?

131
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:44,984
Can you hear me?

132
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:45,983
Huh?

133
00:04:46,017 --> 00:04:46,983
You're dreaming.

134
00:04:47,017 --> 00:04:48,656
I'm dreaming?

135
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,689
Yay! No consequences!

136
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:52,993
(screams)

137
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:54,489
So lifelike!

138
00:04:54,531 --> 00:04:57,391
(sighs) All right, let's go back
six minutes and try this again.

139
00:04:57,433 --> 00:05:00,324
Chris, you're dreaming
with consequences.

140
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:01,332
What?

141
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:02,500
That's right.

142
00:05:02,534 --> 00:05:04,500
We're gonna take you on
a special dream trip

143
00:05:04,534 --> 00:05:06,500
to help you pass
your history test.

144
00:05:06,534 --> 00:05:07,500
You are?

145
00:05:07,534 --> 00:05:09,338
Yes, and there's
so much to learn.

146
00:05:09,372 --> 00:05:10,506
For example, did you know

147
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,074
that Jesus didn't really
die on the cross?

148
00:05:13,108 --> 00:05:14,906
So, what was the
cause of death?

149
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,577
Cocaine and severe trauma
to the colon.

150
00:05:17,611 --> 00:05:19,944
Yeah, I'm gonna need
to see those forms.

151
00:05:24,481 --> 00:05:25,783
Don't look at me like that.

152
00:05:25,817 --> 00:05:28,287
Babe, I told you,
it's a business trip.

153
00:05:28,321 --> 00:05:30,224
All right,
I've got the return pad,

154
00:05:30,258 --> 00:05:32,224
and the time machine is
powering up right now.

155
00:05:32,258 --> 00:05:33,559
We should be leaving any moment.

156
00:05:33,593 --> 00:05:35,559
This thing is awesome.

157
00:05:35,593 --> 00:05:37,726
Stewie, can you believe
Brian built this?

158
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,726
Wait, what?

159
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,031
(chuckling):
Oh, hey, come on, guys.

160
00:05:41,065 --> 00:05:42,798
"Who built what"
is not a question

161
00:05:42,832 --> 00:05:44,630
on the history
final, right?

162
00:05:44,672 --> 00:05:45,965
Good point, Brian.

163
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:48,301
That's why victory
is always Brian's.

164
00:05:48,335 --> 00:05:49,804
You dick!

165
00:05:49,838 --> 00:05:52,004
How much of my stuff
have you taken credit for?!

166
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,823
Hey, everybody?

167
00:06:06,857 --> 00:06:09,056
Just so you know,
I'm straight.

168
00:06:18,687 --> 00:06:20,485
All right, Chris, I
reviewed your textbook,

169
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,839
and I've programmed a tour of
the various historical events

170
00:06:22,857 --> 00:06:24,488
that you'll need to
know for your exam.

171
00:06:24,522 --> 00:06:25,826
So, pay close
attention.

172
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,660
First stop--
Washington, D.C.

173
00:06:27,701 --> 00:06:29,164
The year is 1803.

174
00:06:29,198 --> 00:06:31,204
Ah, the future.

175
00:06:33,575 --> 00:06:36,040
Now, the man at the podium
is Thomas Jefferson.

176
00:06:36,082 --> 00:06:37,881
And this is a very
important moment.

177
00:06:37,915 --> 00:06:39,377
He's trying
to convince Congress

178
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,217
to approve
the Louisiana Purchase.

179
00:06:41,251 --> 00:06:42,553
Come on, guys!

180
00:06:42,587 --> 00:06:45,551
We're getting Oklahoma,
Arkansas, Nebraska, Kansas,

181
00:06:45,585 --> 00:06:48,889
Wyoming, North Dakota,
South Dakota and Louisiana.

182
00:06:48,923 --> 00:06:51,290
What are the chances
all those states suck?

183
00:06:58,673 --> 00:07:00,808
STEWIE:
This is Paris, 1920.

184
00:07:00,842 --> 00:07:02,978
This bar is where famous
American writers,

185
00:07:03,012 --> 00:07:04,987
like Ernest Hemingway,
would go for a drink.

186
00:07:05,021 --> 00:07:07,084
Oh, my God,
there he is!

187
00:07:07,118 --> 00:07:09,756
Excuse me, Mr. Hemingway,
can I have a beer with you?

188
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:10,756
Sure!

189
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,123
I love life
and all the people in it!

190
00:07:13,157 --> 00:07:14,157
Thanks.

191
00:07:14,164 --> 00:07:15,362
And, hey, as a
fellow writer,

192
00:07:15,396 --> 00:07:17,426
I would love to talk
to you about the craft.

193
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,435
I mean, God, if only we could
get rid of these damn arms

194
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:22,636
and attach the pen directly
to the heart, right?

195
00:07:25,472 --> 00:07:27,145
You guys,
I got his pen!

196
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,623
Now, Chris,
this is Brazil

197
00:07:32,657 --> 00:07:34,497
before the invention
of the soccer ball.

198
00:07:38,904 --> 00:07:40,904
Australia before
the shark-tooth necklace.

199
00:07:45,482 --> 00:07:47,112
And Italy
before pasta.

200
00:07:47,147 --> 00:07:48,448
Ay!
Oh!

201
00:07:48,483 --> 00:07:49,784
Vowel sound!

202
00:07:49,818 --> 00:07:51,984
They were always
a ridiculous people.

203
00:07:52,018 --> 00:07:55,655
Hey,<i> Family Guy,</i> you're lucky
I got a manicotti in the oven,

204
00:07:55,689 --> 00:07:58,487
or I'd bash your face
into a bolognese.

205
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:00,755
That's two kinds of food.

206
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:02,994
That's how angry I am.

207
00:08:10,194 --> 00:08:12,168
(screams)

208
00:08:12,202 --> 00:08:13,265
CHRIS:
Oh, my God!

209
00:08:13,299 --> 00:08:14,369
Where are we?!

210
00:08:14,403 --> 00:08:16,872
Omaha Beach, 1944.

211
00:08:16,906 --> 00:08:18,368
This is D-Day.

212
00:08:18,402 --> 00:08:19,873
What's that over there?

213
00:08:19,907 --> 00:08:21,136
Oh, that's
Double D-Day.

214
00:08:21,178 --> 00:08:24,640
♪ She's my cherry pie ♪

215
00:08:24,682 --> 00:08:26,817

00:08:26,851 --> 00:08:28,145

217

00:08:31,187 --> 00:08:33,153
<i>Heil</i> hooters!

219
00:08:33,187 --> 00:08:34,489
Be careful.

220
00:08:34,523 --> 00:08:36,490
It could be
a<i> booby</i> trap!

221
00:08:36,524 --> 00:08:39,165
(laughing):
Oh, Otto.

222
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,070
Here we are.

223
00:08:43,104 --> 00:08:45,070
Christmas night, 1776.

224
00:08:45,104 --> 00:08:47,069
The father of our nation,
George Washington,

225
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,406
is about to boldly
cross the Delaware.

226
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,574
What's on his arms?

227
00:08:50,608 --> 00:08:51,608
Those are water wings.

228
00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:53,047
He was terrified
of the water.

229
00:08:54,753 --> 00:08:56,151
Easy!

230
00:08:59,752 --> 00:09:02,054
All right, Chris,
it's 1798,

231
00:09:02,088 --> 00:09:03,885
and we're in the home
of Jane Austen.

232
00:09:03,927 --> 00:09:05,388
Jane Austen?

233
00:09:05,422 --> 00:09:07,388
I don't think she's
on my history test, Stewie.

234
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,724
Oh, I know--
we're just here

235
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:10,564
to release pent-up
time-travel farts.

236
00:09:10,598 --> 00:09:12,061
Awesome!
Yeah!

237
00:09:12,095 --> 00:09:14,069
(farting)

238
00:09:14,103 --> 00:09:15,564
(sniffing)

239
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:17,404
Aw, yeah!

240
00:09:17,438 --> 00:09:18,731
Give me some of that!

241
00:09:18,773 --> 00:09:20,737
Mmm, the insides
of men!

242
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,734
This is what
fuels me!

243
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:23,733
(sniffing)

244
00:09:23,766 --> 00:09:24,931
Mmm!

245
00:09:29,266 --> 00:09:31,398
Okay, time for some
recent history.

246
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,071
This is the 1990s.

247
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:37,577
♪ And I'll tell myself
I'm over you... ♪

248
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:39,577
This is
the entire 1990s?

249
00:09:39,611 --> 00:09:40,814
Yes.

250
00:09:46,182 --> 00:09:47,147
Wait a minute.

251
00:09:47,181 --> 00:09:48,315
Pre-Soviet Russia?

252
00:09:48,349 --> 00:09:49,483
This wasn't
on the manifest.

253
00:09:49,517 --> 00:09:51,251
Yeah, this is kind
of a personal thing.

254
00:09:51,285 --> 00:09:53,756
Hey, Pavlov, you
dog-teasing-dick!

255
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,790
How's this for positive
reinforcement?!

256
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:06,270
All right,
where to next?

257
00:10:06,304 --> 00:10:08,304
I want to kill
more scientists!

258
00:10:13,624 --> 00:10:14,750
All right, Chris,

259
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:16,921
that was the British
Parliament, 1912.

260
00:10:16,963 --> 00:10:18,259
Next, we...

261
00:10:18,293 --> 00:10:20,795
I say, that looks like a
young Charlie Chaplin.

262
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,033
Sir, please, take this money and
use it to pursue your dreams.

263
00:10:28,074 --> 00:10:29,400
<i>Danke.</i>

264
00:10:30,402 --> 00:10:32,703
Stewie, I think
that was a young Hitler.

265
00:10:32,737 --> 00:10:34,374
You just gave money
to Hitler!

266
00:10:34,408 --> 00:10:36,374
Yeah, but before all
the crazy stuff.

267
00:10:36,408 --> 00:10:39,375
All right, Chris, let's discuss
what you've learned so far.

268
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:41,712
Now, what is your biggest
takeaway from our travels?

269
00:10:41,754 --> 00:10:45,151
That you can't take a good nap
with keys in your pocket.

270
00:10:45,185 --> 00:10:46,486
For God's sake, Chris!

271
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,989
You clearly have not
paid attention

272
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:49,317
to anything we've shown you!

273
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:51,156
You're absolutely hopeless!

274
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,155
Did you ever consider--
the reason you're having trouble

275
00:10:53,189 --> 00:10:54,658
passing ninth grade is
that you're incapable

276
00:10:54,692 --> 00:10:55,993
of anything else?!

277
00:10:56,027 --> 00:10:58,655
That this is the absolute zenith
of your ability?!

278
00:10:58,689 --> 00:11:00,254
Zenith means top.

279
00:11:00,295 --> 00:11:02,260
No, it means TV.

280
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:03,996
Ha! Now I'm catching fire.

281
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,996
Damn it, Chris, your problem
isn't book learning,

282
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,500
it's that you're a moron!

283
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:09,668
This whole trip has been
a complete waste of time!

284
00:11:11,534 --> 00:11:12,836
Screw you, Stewie.

285
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,340
You're a jerk!

286
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:18,005
And I'm gonna win that bowling
tournament, with or without you!

287
00:11:18,047 --> 00:11:20,676
(sobs)

288
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,347
What is he... what?

289
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:24,640
He-he doesn't even know what
we're preparing him for!

290
00:11:27,678 --> 00:11:28,812
STEWIE:
Chris?

291
00:11:28,845 --> 00:11:30,042
Chris, come back!

292
00:11:30,077 --> 00:11:31,378
Well, we've looked
all over London.

293
00:11:31,412 --> 00:11:32,881
He's nowhere.

294
00:11:32,915 --> 00:11:35,049
I don't know what the
hell we're going to do.

295
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,083
CHRIS:
Hey, Stewie!

296
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,413
If I'm such a moron, then how
did I get on a fancy boat?!

297
00:11:43,752 --> 00:11:45,717
(horn bellows)

298
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:48,692
See you later, douche bags!

299
00:11:48,727 --> 00:11:49,924
Oh, crap!

300
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,092
Chris is
on the<i> Titanic?!</i>

301
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:52,428
No, no, it's
okay, Brian.

302
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,029
We'll just go back in time
to before Chris ran off.

303
00:11:55,063 --> 00:11:58,164
Oh, and I took
your fancy smoke detector!

304
00:11:58,198 --> 00:11:59,164
(gasps)

305
00:11:59,198 --> 00:12:00,668
My God, he's got
the return pad!

306
00:12:00,702 --> 00:12:02,437
Brian, we've got to
get on that ship!

307
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,269
PURSER:
Attention, passengers.

308
00:12:04,311 --> 00:12:07,445
The karaoke contest
will begin in five minutes.

309
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:10,307
Okay, now we've really
got to get on that ship.

310
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,073
Brian, we have
to get on that ship!

311
00:12:18,107 --> 00:12:19,904
It's our only hope
to save Chris.

312
00:12:19,938 --> 00:12:21,408
There! Jump onto
that mooring rope.

313
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:23,674
We can use it
to pull ourselves up.

314
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:35,256
Oh, thank God, I wasn't
sure we were gonna make it.

315
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,256
I wasn't worried.

316
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,591
I've faced bigger
challenges.

317
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:40,294
Like trying to dress
Jonah Hill for the Oscars.

318
00:12:41,663 --> 00:12:42,787
Okay, okay, perfect.

319
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:44,827
Tell him to stay
exactly that weight.

320
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:46,794
(cell phone rings)

321
00:12:46,828 --> 00:12:47,793
Yes?

322
00:12:47,827 --> 00:12:49,225
(sighs)
Damn it!

323
00:13:16,157 --> 00:13:18,122
Oh, my God, Brian.

324
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,625
This ship, it's...
it's unbelievable.

325
00:13:20,659 --> 00:13:22,664
It's even more magnificent
than I imagined.

326
00:13:23,665 --> 00:13:24,796
That, Brian.

327
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:25,963
That.

328
00:13:25,997 --> 00:13:27,427
That's what I was
telling you about.

329
00:13:27,461 --> 00:13:28,699
That's brocade.

330
00:13:28,733 --> 00:13:30,963
Come on, Stewie, we got
to find Chris and the return pad

331
00:13:30,997 --> 00:13:31,963
before it's too late.

332
00:13:31,997 --> 00:13:33,130
All right,
let's split up.

333
00:13:33,164 --> 00:13:34,466
I'll go search
in first class,

334
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,633
you go down
to steerage

335
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:37,800
and wade through the
gross Irish and Italians.

336
00:13:37,834 --> 00:13:40,269
That's two.

337
00:13:40,303 --> 00:13:43,569
Ugh, God knows what
I'm gonna find in steerage.

338
00:13:43,603 --> 00:13:47,566
Bunch of drunk, fat,
pie-faced Irish fools.

339
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,802
Excuse me, have any of you seen
a blond teenage boy?

340
00:13:50,836 --> 00:13:52,537
Who's asking?

341
00:13:52,571 --> 00:13:54,031
Yeah, who the hell are you?

342
00:13:54,073 --> 00:13:55,798
And I'm the baby!

343
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,837
Chris?

344
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,480
What the hell?

345
00:14:05,514 --> 00:14:07,154
Stewie,
what are you doing?

346
00:14:07,188 --> 00:14:09,153
Uh, dining at the
captain's table.

347
00:14:09,187 --> 00:14:11,318
Everyone at this table
was the first person

348
00:14:11,352 --> 00:14:12,654
to refrigerate
something.

349
00:14:12,687 --> 00:14:14,485
I refrigerated shoes.

350
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,054
Because everybody
likes a cool toe.

351
00:14:17,088 --> 00:14:19,724
Also, I gave the string
quartet the sheet music

352
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:21,396
for "Highway to
the Danger Zone".

353
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,891
You have the sheet music for
"Highway to the Danger Zone"?

354
00:14:23,933 --> 00:14:25,059
Uh, yeah.

355
00:14:25,093 --> 00:14:27,065
What do you think I
keep in this backpack?

356
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,393
It's all PowerBars
and sheet music.

357
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:30,064
Stewie, you're supposed
to be looking for Chris.

358
00:14:30,098 --> 00:14:31,894
I did-- he wasn't
in the Turkish bath,

359
00:14:31,936 --> 00:14:34,669
the veranda café or the
Bloody Handkerchief Ball.

360
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:38,302
Oh, dear.

361
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,972
Relax, Brian, I think
I see Chris right now.

362
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:42,139
Really? Where?

363
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,969
I'm gonna go ahead
and bet he's the guy

364
00:14:44,003 --> 00:14:45,608
with the whole chicken
stuck on his head.

365
00:14:45,642 --> 00:14:47,607
(muffled mumbling)

366
00:14:47,641 --> 00:14:48,943
Hey, you're not Chris.

367
00:14:48,977 --> 00:14:51,441
Pardon me,
that's my hat!

368
00:14:51,483 --> 00:14:53,282
(muffled mumbling)

369
00:14:53,316 --> 00:14:55,788
I know this thing's gonna sink,
but I'm having a good time.

370
00:14:55,822 --> 00:14:56,788
(Chris laughing)

371
00:14:56,822 --> 00:14:57,852
Stewie, look!

372
00:14:57,886 --> 00:14:59,355
(laughing)

373
00:15:00,461 --> 00:15:01,754
Chris, there you are!

374
00:15:01,788 --> 00:15:03,425
Well, well, well.

375
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:06,096
If it isn't Booger Breath
and the Mushroom Tip.

376
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,264
Wh-Which one
of us is which?

377
00:15:08,298 --> 00:15:10,263
Chris, we have got
to get off this boat.

378
00:15:10,297 --> 00:15:12,400
The<i> Titanic</i> was one of the
biggest disasters in history.

379
00:15:12,434 --> 00:15:13,600
Well, if you're
so worried,

380
00:15:13,634 --> 00:15:15,535
why don't you alert
the crew and save everyone?

381
00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:17,703
Because, Chris,
we can't alter the past.

382
00:15:17,737 --> 00:15:19,206
That's the first rule of...

383
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,206
of, uh... uh, dreaming.

384
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,807
Besides, saving
this ship would mean

385
00:15:22,841 --> 00:15:24,112
talking to, like, 80 people,

386
00:15:24,146 --> 00:15:26,449
and I-I'm just not
in that kind of mood right now.

387
00:15:26,483 --> 00:15:28,281
Look, Chris, just give
us that thing you took

388
00:15:28,315 --> 00:15:29,650
so we can
all get home.

389
00:15:38,697 --> 00:15:40,701
(all screaming)

390
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:44,470
Quick, Chris,
Stewie, get on!

391
00:15:44,504 --> 00:15:46,142
To home!

392
00:15:46,176 --> 00:15:48,510
Or I'll just put in
the coordinates.

393
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:03,262
Damn!

394
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,296
The return pad!

395
00:16:04,303 --> 00:16:05,303
It's been destroyed!

396
00:16:05,303 --> 00:16:06,428
What?!

397
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,763
The whole thing's been
waterlogged!

398
00:16:07,797 --> 00:16:09,930
I'll need to dry it out
and completely rewire it.

399
00:16:09,972 --> 00:16:11,831
This would make
a great movie.

400
00:16:11,865 --> 00:16:13,997
And the parts I need
to fix the return pad

401
00:16:14,031 --> 00:16:15,269
certainly aren't
on this ship.

402
00:16:15,303 --> 00:16:17,100
We have to somehow
get to dry land.

403
00:16:17,134 --> 00:16:18,267
Dry land?!

404
00:16:18,301 --> 00:16:20,265
Stewie, almost everyone
on the<i> Titanic</i> died!

405
00:16:20,307 --> 00:16:21,432
All right,
calm down, Brian.

406
00:16:21,474 --> 00:16:23,438
No-- there's so much
I haven't done.

407
00:16:23,472 --> 00:16:25,068
I've never even
successfully made love

408
00:16:25,102 --> 00:16:26,435
to a woman in
the shower.

409
00:16:26,469 --> 00:16:27,635
BRIAN:
Aah, my back!

410
00:16:27,669 --> 00:16:29,804
WOMAN: Should I put my
foot in the soap dish?

411
00:16:29,838 --> 00:16:32,476
Yeah, try that, and maybe
stand on your tippy-toes.

412
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,210
Aah, how does water
make it dry?!

413
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,239
(panicked screaming)

414
00:16:42,449 --> 00:16:43,583
This isn't gonna work.

415
00:16:43,617 --> 00:16:44,920
Brian, this is
our only hope.

416
00:16:44,955 --> 00:16:46,251
The majority
of people

417
00:16:46,293 --> 00:16:48,587
who got on those lifeboats
were women of noble birth.

418
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:50,426
Now, I've given
us all backstories.

419
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,592
I am Lady Antonia
Tyler Carrington,

420
00:16:52,626 --> 00:16:54,928
the Duchess of Lancashire, the
heir to the Earl of Portsmouth,

421
00:16:54,962 --> 00:16:56,591
and the cousin
of the Countess of Wessex.

422
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:57,830
Okay, great. And who are we?

423
00:16:57,864 --> 00:16:59,693
I don't know,
you're just two sluts with me.

424
00:16:59,735 --> 00:17:00,861
Hey, there's a lifeboat.

425
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,197
Uh, yeah,
but it's got one

426
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:04,639
of those funny Southwest
lifeboat attendants.

427
00:17:04,673 --> 00:17:05,968
Hey,
here's a reminder--

428
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,137
as you exit the boat,

429
00:17:07,178 --> 00:17:08,808
don't forget to give us
your extra snacks

430
00:17:08,842 --> 00:17:11,438
because as you know,
we work for peanuts!

431
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,276
(laughs heartily)

432
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,445
That's refreshing.

433
00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:16,382
Most of those guys
are all serious.

434
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,255
(clamoring)

435
00:17:26,297 --> 00:17:27,255
There, that one!

436
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:28,792
It's our last chance.

437
00:17:28,826 --> 00:17:33,405
(playing "Danger Zone")

438
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,072
Hey, they learned it!

439
00:17:35,114 --> 00:17:36,577
What a bunch of pros.

440
00:17:36,611 --> 00:17:38,417
(clamoring)

441
00:17:38,451 --> 00:17:39,746
Hello there, sir.

442
00:17:39,788 --> 00:17:42,083
We are three noblewomen
in distress...

443
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,522
Sorry, boat's full.

444
00:17:43,556 --> 00:17:46,690
Um, what if one of us were
to turn this big ship

445
00:17:46,724 --> 00:17:48,193
into a "tug" boat? (laughs)

446
00:17:48,227 --> 00:17:49,362
Wink, wink.

447
00:17:49,396 --> 00:17:50,530
Wouldn't help you.

448
00:17:50,564 --> 00:17:52,026
You're the fourth person
to offer that,

449
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,066
and I'm kind of spent.

450
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,833
I don't believe this.

451
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,103
Dear God,
we're stuck here.

452
00:17:59,137 --> 00:18:00,831
We're going to drown
on the<i> Titanic.</i>

453
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:02,869
Oh, no, we're not.

454
00:18:04,732 --> 00:18:06,999
Hey! I said
you can't come on here.

455
00:18:07,033 --> 00:18:09,196
Get out of my way,
you son of a bitch!

456
00:18:10,365 --> 00:18:11,932
(screams)

457
00:18:14,437 --> 00:18:15,743
Oh, no!

458
00:18:15,777 --> 00:18:17,944
I can't swim without
my striped one-piece!

459
00:18:19,418 --> 00:18:21,384
Everyone move over.

460
00:18:21,418 --> 00:18:22,712
We're getting on this boat.

461
00:18:27,386 --> 00:18:29,520
Please take my baby!

462
00:18:29,562 --> 00:18:31,857
Yeah, I'm sorry,
if I take your baby,

463
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:33,729
I'm gonna have
to take everyone's baby.

464
00:18:34,995 --> 00:18:36,465
Can you believe
that woman?

465
00:18:36,499 --> 00:18:39,292
Putting me on the spot
in front of everyone.

466
00:18:40,933 --> 00:18:43,869
(passengers screaming)

467
00:18:49,035 --> 00:18:51,671
To home!

468
00:18:51,705 --> 00:18:53,238
You see what
you started?

469
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:56,541
Wow, Chris.

470
00:18:56,575 --> 00:18:58,205
You just saved
our lives.

471
00:18:58,239 --> 00:18:59,573
Thank you.

472
00:18:59,607 --> 00:19:01,413
Oh, it was
nothing, Brian.

473
00:19:01,447 --> 00:19:02,748
Listen, Chris,
I, um...

474
00:19:02,782 --> 00:19:04,316
I think I owe
you an apology.

475
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,316
I'm not someone
who often makes mistakes,

476
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:10,483
but, well, I was wrong earlier
when I called you a moron.

477
00:19:10,518 --> 00:19:12,156
No, you were right.

478
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,727
You're the smart one in the
family, and I'm the dumb one.

479
00:19:14,761 --> 00:19:16,391
Oh, you're being too
hard on yourself.

480
00:19:16,433 --> 00:19:19,894
Look, you may not be
"book smart" or "history smart,"

481
00:19:19,936 --> 00:19:22,564
but you're "throw people
off the boat" smart.

482
00:19:22,598 --> 00:19:24,332
And, frankly,
I'm starting to think

483
00:19:24,366 --> 00:19:26,171
that's the best kind to be.

484
00:19:26,205 --> 00:19:28,034
Thanks, Stewie.

485
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:37,199
Well, looks like
one ship was saved today--

486
00:19:37,233 --> 00:19:39,229
a relation-ship.

487
00:20:00,034 --> 00:20:01,831
Oh, thank God,
we're back.

488
00:20:01,873 --> 00:20:03,838
Wow, what an
adventure!

489
00:20:03,872 --> 00:20:05,007
Thanks, Dream Brian.

490
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,375
Thanks, Dream Stewie.

491
00:20:08,713 --> 00:20:10,007
Brian, Stewie!

492
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,344
I just had the most
amazing dream.

493
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:15,215
I was on a famous boat
called the<i> Gigantic.</i>

494
00:20:16,385 --> 00:20:18,249
Yeah, he's gonna fail
that test tomorrow.

495
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,923
Well, we gave it our
best shot, Stewie.

496
00:20:19,957 --> 00:20:22,124
It was still a nice thing
you did for your brother.

497
00:20:22,158 --> 00:20:23,293
I suppose.

498
00:20:23,327 --> 00:20:25,292
I just hope that Chris
killing one extra man

499
00:20:25,334 --> 00:20:27,698
on the<i> Titanic</i> didn't alter
anything in the present.

500
00:20:32,897 --> 00:20:34,200
There he is.

501
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,105
"Nigel Harpington."

502
00:20:36,139 --> 00:20:37,770
Wait, "Harpington"?

503
00:20:37,812 --> 00:20:39,778
Isn't that the name of
Chris' history teacher?

504
00:20:39,812 --> 00:20:41,106
Yes, I think
you're right.

505
00:20:41,148 --> 00:20:42,442
That must be
his ancestor.

506
00:20:42,476 --> 00:20:45,479
Which means that Chris'
history teacher was never born.

507
00:20:45,513 --> 00:20:47,476
Hey, everybody,
I'm Teacher Doug,

508
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,108
and I don't believe
in tests.

509
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,116
Yay!

510
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:57,650
