All right, class,
today we're going

13
00:00:41,603 --> 00:00:43,921
to be talking about variables.

14
00:00:43,956 --> 00:00:45,590
(kids laughing)

15
00:00:45,624 --> 00:00:47,658
Okay, it's just a rear end.

16
00:00:47,676 --> 00:00:49,043
We all have one.

17
00:00:49,094 --> 00:00:51,696
Mine just happens to be
a hot Brazilian woman's.

18
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,181
No, we're not laughing at you.

19
00:00:53,215 --> 00:00:55,733
We're laughing at
Griffin's shoes.

20
00:00:55,767 --> 00:00:57,401
Why, what's wrong with them?

21
00:00:57,436 --> 00:00:58,586
I don't even know
what those are.

22
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,820
What's "Teslik"?

23
00:00:59,855 --> 00:01:02,223
Um, I'm not sure,
but my mom says they're

24
00:01:02,257 --> 00:01:04,425
very popular
with Latvian athletes.

25
00:01:05,727 --> 00:01:09,096
Running, throwing,
lifting big things.

26
00:01:10,532 --> 00:01:11,766
Teslik.

27
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,168
That's all right with me, man.

ANNOUNCER:
<i>Each shoe sold separate.</i>

29
00:01:16,238 --> 00:01:17,872
Are they really that bad?

30
00:01:17,906 --> 00:01:20,041
(laughs): Are you kidding?
They're terrible.

31
00:01:20,075 --> 00:01:22,009
Man, high school is rough.

32
00:01:22,044 --> 00:01:23,294
This year it's sneakers.

33
00:01:23,312 --> 00:01:25,279
Last year it was all about
being overweight

34
00:01:25,314 --> 00:01:26,731
and wearing a baseball cap.

35
00:01:28,233 --> 00:01:29,817
Hey, guys,
sure hope we win

36
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:31,536
the big game
on Saturday.

00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:32,570
Get lost.
Dork.

Yeah, gain some
weight, will ya?

(laughing)

40
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:39,227
Oh, of all the years
to be trim and well-hatted.

41
00:01:42,281 --> 00:01:44,982
That was a fun birthday
party, huh, Stewie?

42
00:01:45,017 --> 00:01:47,501
That kid was Indian
and 11 years old.

43
00:01:47,536 --> 00:01:49,036
Where are you
finding my friends?

44
00:01:49,071 --> 00:01:51,205
Oh, someone's a
little cranky.

45
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,940

56
00:02:14,363 --> 00:02:16,197
She sounds like an angel.

57
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:20,234

68
00:02:54,102 --> 00:02:55,703
You like that, Stewie?

69
00:02:55,737 --> 00:02:57,221
You like
Anne Murray's music?

70
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:58,489
Do I?

71
00:02:58,523 --> 00:02:59,674
I've never known
such happiness.

72
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,359
This must be what
it's like for you

73
00:03:01,393 --> 00:03:03,828
when you're buying potatoes
or scraping your heels

74
00:03:03,862 --> 00:03:06,697
or smushing on makeup
for a sad night out.

79
00:03:18,744 --> 00:03:21,562
Mom, Dad, I need to
get new sneakers.

80
00:03:21,596 --> 00:03:23,831
What? I just bought you
new sneakers.

81
00:03:23,865 --> 00:03:25,733
I know, but I
need cooler ones.

82
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:27,118
Shut up, and stop complaining.

83
00:03:27,152 --> 00:03:28,736
When I was your age,
I didn't even have sneakers.

84
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,538
We wore stale hamburger buns.

85
00:03:30,572 --> 00:03:31,722
No, you didn't, Peter.

86
00:03:31,757 --> 00:03:32,890
Shh, he doesn't know that.

87
00:03:32,924 --> 00:03:34,058
He's just a dumb, fat loser.

88
00:03:34,092 --> 00:03:35,393
Did you see his shoes?

89
00:03:35,427 --> 00:03:37,962
Look, Chris, I'm sorry,
but money's tight right now.

90
00:03:37,996 --> 00:03:39,714
Yeah, I even had
to take a second job

91
00:03:39,748 --> 00:03:41,682
as a door-to-door
vacuum salesman.

92
00:03:41,717 --> 00:03:42,683
This thing can pick up anything.

93
00:03:42,718 --> 00:03:43,951
Here's a little demonstration.

94
00:03:43,985 --> 00:03:45,986
I'll pour some wine,
rub in some feces,

95
00:03:46,021 --> 00:03:48,539
and, to top it off,
some mustard mixed with feces.

96
00:03:48,573 --> 00:03:49,857
Tough stain, right?

97
00:03:49,891 --> 00:03:51,592
Oh, crap, I forgot the vacuum.

98
00:03:51,626 --> 00:03:53,627

What a woman.

00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,058
To think Canada's got her,

112
00:04:41,093 --> 00:04:44,328
and we have Kelly Clarkson going
to town at a Waffle House.

113
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:56,240
That's it,
I'm getting those sneakers.

I'm a different kind of winner.

119
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,255
Oh, come on, Dad,
there's no cash in here.

120
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:14,625
Just a bunch of cards that say,
"I farted on your car,"

121
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:16,594
with his insurance info.

Busted.

124
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,487
Geez, it's so weird
that Mom and Dad

125
00:05:26,521 --> 00:05:29,023
would leave the house
without their purse and wallet.

126
00:05:29,057 --> 00:05:30,658
I wonder where they are?

127

Can I get you anything else?

128
00:05:32,093 --> 00:05:34,328

Damone, it's Peter.

134
00:05:44,756 --> 00:05:46,524
I'm at my date and I left
my wallet at home.

135
00:05:46,558 --> 00:05:48,125
Will you please borrow
your mom's car,

136
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,440
drive to my house,
get my wallet,

137
00:05:49,461 --> 00:05:50,661

Damone, are you there?
Damone?

139

Yeesh, I'm really kind of busy.

140
00:06:00,455 --> 00:06:02,239
Come on,
just do me this one favor.

141
00:06:02,257 --> 00:06:04,675
All right,
but you owe me for this one.

142
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:06,327
Oh, thanks, Damone.

143
00:06:06,361 --> 00:06:08,863
And that was the last
we ever saw of him.

144
00:06:14,726 --> 00:06:15,893
Well, well, well.

145
00:06:15,927 --> 00:06:17,961
Who do we have here?

146
00:06:17,996 --> 00:06:20,030
It's me, Chris,
you know me.

147
00:06:20,065 --> 00:06:21,765
Why are you talking
like a bad guy?

148
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,902
Listen, I saw you steal
money from Mom's purse.

149
00:06:24,936 --> 00:06:26,637
Oh...

150
00:06:26,671 --> 00:06:28,138
Well, I was just trying
to get new sneakers.

151
00:06:28,173 --> 00:06:30,607
You're not going to
tell on me, are you?

152
00:06:30,642 --> 00:06:33,811
Well, that depends.
On what?

153
00:06:33,845 --> 00:06:36,113
How about, I won't tell
Mom and Dad about the money

154
00:06:36,147 --> 00:06:39,183
if you promise to
do whatever I say.

155
00:06:39,217 --> 00:06:40,984
Meg, this is how a
lot of porn starts.

156
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:42,019
I mean it, Chris.

157
00:06:42,053 --> 00:06:43,087
I'll tell them.

158
00:06:43,121 --> 00:06:44,738
Mom, Chris took
money out of the...

159
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:45,889
Okay, okay, okay.

160
00:06:45,924 --> 00:06:48,992
I'll do whatever you want.

161
00:06:49,027 --> 00:06:50,461
I thought you'd
see it that way.

162
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:52,730
Here's a list of stuff
I need you to do for me.

163
00:06:52,764 --> 00:06:55,549
Shouldn't have taken
that money, Chris.

164
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,451
Eh, she's right.
I'm a horrible person.

165
00:06:57,485 --> 00:06:59,169
I'm only one
step above those people

166
00:06:59,204 --> 00:07:02,873
who really like dive bars and
really need you to know it.

167
00:07:02,907 --> 00:07:04,408
I love this place.
I love dive bars.

168
00:07:04,442 --> 00:07:05,642
Dive bars are my favorite.

169
00:07:05,677 --> 00:07:07,311
They're so much better
than regular bars

170
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:08,379
because worse is better.

171
00:07:08,413 --> 00:07:09,413
I know, right?

172
00:07:09,447 --> 00:07:10,464
They're my favorite, too.

173
00:07:10,498 --> 00:07:11,498
I'm quirky like that.

174
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:12,516
I've got quirky taste.

175
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,767
I'm a quirky girl.

176
00:07:13,802 --> 00:07:15,853
It seems like we would be
perfect for each other.

177
00:07:15,887 --> 00:07:18,689
But really we're
terrible for everyone.

178
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,680
ANNE MURRAY:
♪ And though I...

179
00:07:26,715 --> 00:07:28,515
What the hell?

180
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,134
Are you listening
to Anne Murray?

181
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:32,936
Uh, I am experiencing
Anne Murray.

182
00:07:32,971 --> 00:07:34,838
Why? That music
is complete crap.

183
00:07:34,873 --> 00:07:37,207
Um, excuse me?

184
00:07:37,242 --> 00:07:39,126
It's all just vapid,
overproduced tripe.

185
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,461
It has no edge whatsoever.

186
00:07:40,495 --> 00:07:42,496
Yeah, neither does a
soft summer breeze,

187
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,931
or a letter from
an old friend.

188
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:45,566
I'm pretty sure
envelopes have edges.

189
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,601
Fine, an e-mail. Dick.

190
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:49,203
Whatever. You know what?
I don't care.

191
00:07:49,237 --> 00:07:51,422
I think Anne Murray sucks,
and that's my opinion.

192
00:07:51,473 --> 00:07:52,756
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm going to make

193
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,124
a believer out of you, Brian.

194
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:56,360
I am going to show you the true
meaning of Anne Murray.

195
00:07:56,394 --> 00:07:58,555
Don't waste your time,
I'm not going to change my mind.

196
00:07:58,563 --> 00:07:59,997
I don't know, Bri, I can
make things happen

197
00:08:00,031 --> 00:08:01,265
when I want to.

198
00:08:01,299 --> 00:08:02,933
Just ask my twin brother.

199
00:08:02,984 --> 00:08:05,452
(grunting)
And here's baby boy number one.

200
00:08:05,487 --> 00:08:09,055
I understand you've decided
to name him Stewie.

201
00:08:09,073 --> 00:08:10,541
One more to go.

202
00:08:10,575 --> 00:08:12,476
And here he... oh.

203
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,677
Oh, dear.

204
00:08:13,711 --> 00:08:16,079
Oh, no,
did Dave not make it?

205
00:08:19,684 --> 00:08:21,218
Okay, Meg,
I've cleaned your room

206
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:22,469
and I did your homework.

207
00:08:22,504 --> 00:08:23,670
Can I be done now?

208
00:08:23,705 --> 00:08:25,956
Oh, no, there's a
lot more things

209
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,491
I need you to do for me.

210
00:08:27,525 --> 00:08:28,659
There are?
Like what?

211
00:08:28,693 --> 00:08:30,027
Well, now you
have to watch

212
00:08:30,061 --> 00:08:31,562
<i>An Officer and</i>
<i>a Gentlemen</i> with me.

213
00:08:31,596 --> 00:08:32,696
And that's it?

214
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,364
(laughs)
No.

215
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,866
At the end,
when Richard Gere

216
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,701
carries Debra Winger
out of the paper mill,

217
00:08:37,735 --> 00:08:41,605
you have to read what's
on this index card.

218
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:45,409
(on TV): ♪ Love lift us up
where we belong... ♪

219
00:08:45,443 --> 00:08:46,810
(crying)

220
00:08:46,845 --> 00:08:48,645
That's going to be
you some day, Meg.

221
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,847
I know it will.

222
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:53,116
I just know it will.

223
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,120
Okay, Chris, I want
to wear contacts,

224
00:08:57,155 --> 00:08:58,489
but I'm too squeamish
to put them in myself,

225
00:08:58,523 --> 00:09:00,657
so you need to help me.

226
00:09:00,692 --> 00:09:02,092
Really?
Is it that hard?

227
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:03,494
My eyes are
too sensitive.

228
00:09:03,528 --> 00:09:04,695
It's like they
overreact or something.

229
00:09:04,729 --> 00:09:06,279
Okay.

230
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,567
Ah, what happened
to your eye?!

231
00:09:10,602 --> 00:09:12,503
Don't worry about it.
Just put the lens in.

232
00:09:12,537 --> 00:09:14,004
But where do I put it?

233
00:09:14,038 --> 00:09:15,072
The pupil's gone.

234
00:09:15,106 --> 00:09:16,707
Your eye just looks
like a ping-pong ball.

235
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:18,391
I think it rolled
up into my head.

236
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:20,310
Look, just... just
do the other one.

237
00:09:21,246 --> 00:09:23,197
(screaming)

238
00:09:23,231 --> 00:09:25,732
You look like one of
those blind jazz guys.

239
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:27,801
Where are you?
I can't see anything.

240
00:09:27,836 --> 00:09:30,403
(screaming)

241
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:31,488
I don't like this.

242
00:09:31,523 --> 00:09:32,856
Just wear your
stupid glasses.

243
00:09:32,891 --> 00:09:33,907
Chris, I'm blind.

244
00:09:33,925 --> 00:09:35,742
I'm sorry, Meg.

245
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,127
(crying)

246
00:09:44,102 --> 00:09:45,953
What the hell
is all this?

247
00:09:45,987 --> 00:09:47,387
This is history, Brian.

248
00:09:47,422 --> 00:09:48,856
A key moment in the
history of happiness.

249
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,090
Have a seat.

250
00:09:50,124 --> 00:09:52,292

251
00:09:54,145 --> 00:09:56,780

(sniffles)

272
00:11:17,028 --> 00:11:18,879
Some hardcore
(bleep), right?

273
00:11:18,913 --> 00:11:20,747
Wow, thank you
for turning me on

274
00:11:20,782 --> 00:11:22,349
to something
so amazing.

275
00:11:22,383 --> 00:11:24,051
Hey, I'm just glad
you enjoyed it.

276
00:11:24,085 --> 00:11:25,352
And I'm sure
Buzz Lightyear

277
00:11:25,386 --> 00:11:28,322
would have enjoyed it if he
had bothered to show up.

278
00:11:30,024 --> 00:11:31,858
Hey, how would you like
to go to my apartment...

279
00:11:31,893 --> 00:11:34,127
and beyond?

280
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:39,700
Okay, Meg,
I stood outside

281
00:11:39,734 --> 00:11:41,702
Planned Parenthood
for 36 hours

282
00:11:41,736 --> 00:11:42,769
and here are
the pictures

283
00:11:42,804 --> 00:11:44,554
of every girl in
your class who went in.

284
00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:45,672
All right, good.

285
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:46,940
Now I want you
to call them

286
00:11:46,975 --> 00:11:49,142
as if you're
their dead baby.

287
00:11:49,177 --> 00:11:51,595
No way, that was the last
thing on your list.

288
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:53,380
I-I can't do this anymore.

289
00:11:53,398 --> 00:11:54,531
Well, you should've
thought of that

290
00:11:54,565 --> 00:11:56,400
before you stole money out
of Mom's purse.

291
00:11:56,434 --> 00:11:57,985
I own you.

292
00:11:58,019 --> 00:11:59,753
Now, here's my
post office key.

293
00:11:59,787 --> 00:12:01,121
I need you to
go downtown

294
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:02,322
and get the stuff
from my P.O. box.

295
00:12:02,357 --> 00:12:04,024
You-you don't get
your mail here?

296
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:06,059
No, I get a lot of
private correspondence

297
00:12:06,077 --> 00:12:07,260
from the Netherlands.

298
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,295
Like what?

299
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:09,629
Like, I'm part
of a group that

300
00:12:09,664 --> 00:12:12,065
kind of trashes Anne
Frank's house every year.

301
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,734
You know what?
No. That's it.

302
00:12:13,768 --> 00:12:16,837
I'm not-I'm not doing
any more of your crap, Meg.

303
00:12:16,871 --> 00:12:18,388
Chris, don't you see?
You have no choice.

304
00:12:18,423 --> 00:12:20,991
I'll just go tell Mom
and Dad about the money

305
00:12:21,025 --> 00:12:23,627
and they'll ground
your ass for a year.

306
00:12:23,661 --> 00:12:25,078
I don't care, tell them.

307
00:12:25,096 --> 00:12:26,563
'Cause I'm not even
going to be here.

308
00:12:26,597 --> 00:12:29,533
I'm going to run away and
no one will ever see me again.

309
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,001
Good, go.

310
00:12:31,035 --> 00:12:32,185
And who's even
going to miss you?

311
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,470
You're just a
little thief.

312
00:12:33,521 --> 00:12:35,222
Where you going, Chris?

313
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:36,823
Who are you going to turn to?

314
00:12:36,858 --> 00:12:39,242
You don't even have any friends.

315
00:12:39,277 --> 00:12:40,911
(doorbell rings)

316
00:12:40,945 --> 00:12:42,979
Hi. I ran away from home.

317
00:12:43,014 --> 00:12:45,849
Do you mind if I live with you?

318
00:12:45,883 --> 00:12:47,250
Live with me?

319
00:12:47,285 --> 00:12:48,652
My goodness, I feel like

320
00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:51,688
I want to pinch myself
to see if I'm dreaming.

321
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:56,393
Hot dog, it's real.

322
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:06,393
Mr. Herbert, it's 6:00,
I'm-I'm not really tired yet.

323
00:13:06,427 --> 00:13:08,428
Well, you had those
three cups of Nyquil.

324
00:13:08,463 --> 00:13:10,163
You'll be down
soon enough.

325
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:12,299
Okay, good night,
Mr. Herbert.

326
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,801
Sweet dreams, Chris.

327
00:13:18,873 --> 00:13:22,543
Mr. Herbert, what's
life really all about?

328
00:13:22,577 --> 00:13:25,646
Well, I suppose it's
about trying new things;

329
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,848
sampling the sweet
and the savory;

330
00:13:27,882 --> 00:13:30,083
not being afraid
to take everything

331
00:13:30,118 --> 00:13:32,986
life wants to
throw up on into ya.

332
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,087
Wow.

333
00:13:34,122 --> 00:13:35,489
I never looked at it
like that before.

334
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,823
Thanks, Mr. Herbert.

335
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:42,696
But don't you
think it's scary

336
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:43,964
to try new things?

337
00:13:43,998 --> 00:13:45,799
No, Chris.

338
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,334
Life is like a
new baseball glove.

339
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,036
At first you think

340
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,804
you're never going to get
a ball in there.

341
00:13:50,838 --> 00:13:53,106
But then you oil it up,
work your fingers

342
00:13:53,141 --> 00:13:55,576
around in there a little,
and pretty soon

343
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,744
you're pitching and catching.

344
00:13:57,779 --> 00:13:59,947
I guess that
makes sense.

345
00:13:59,981 --> 00:14:02,683
(farting)

346
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,585
CHRIS:
Sorry.

347
00:14:04,619 --> 00:14:06,520
You really know how
to waste a Cialis,

348
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,522
don't you?

349
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,659
ANNE MURRAY:
♪ The snowbird sings the song

350
00:14:12,694 --> 00:14:15,529
♪ He always sings...

351
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,130
You know,
this is definitely

352
00:14:17,165 --> 00:14:18,365
a mystery song for me.

353
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,300
It's so upbeat,
but the lyrics are so dark.

354
00:14:20,335 --> 00:14:22,069
I'm-I'm sorry, are we both
listening to "Snowbird,"

355
00:14:22,103 --> 00:14:23,904
as recorded by
Miss Anne Murray?

356
00:14:23,938 --> 00:14:25,038
Yeah, the woman
in the song

357
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,473
is trying to cope
with getting older

358
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,658
and she feels
trapped because

359
00:14:27,692 --> 00:14:29,593
she knows she can't
do anything about it.

360
00:14:29,644 --> 00:14:31,011
No, no, no, no.

361
00:14:31,045 --> 00:14:32,679
I mean, you're right that
she's feeling trapped,

362
00:14:32,714 --> 00:14:33,947
but the message
is positive.

363
00:14:33,982 --> 00:14:35,449
It's about being trapped
in a bad relationship

364
00:14:35,483 --> 00:14:37,718
and having the guts
to get out of it.

365
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,286
No, no. See, what I hear,
is that the woman

366
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,604
is starting to hate life.

367
00:14:40,638 --> 00:14:43,473
You know the line, "Now I feel
such emptiness within"?

368
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,108
Yeah, I know the song.

369
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:46,426
Well, Anne Murray feels old.

370
00:14:46,461 --> 00:14:47,494
And then, to make things worse,

371
00:14:47,528 --> 00:14:49,062
the snowbird comes
around every year,

372
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,914
bringing the snow, or "death,"

373
00:14:50,948 --> 00:14:52,366
to remind her that no matter
what she does,

374
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,635
her fate's already written.

375
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:57,287
Brian, the snowbird has nothing
to do with time or fate.

376
00:14:57,322 --> 00:14:58,555
Well, I disagree.

377
00:14:58,589 --> 00:14:59,890
Look, there's only one
way to settle this.

378
00:14:59,924 --> 00:15:02,626
Only the artist knows the
true meaning of their art.

379
00:15:04,162 --> 00:15:05,629
Now, Ms. O'Keefe, the flowers
in your paintings,

380
00:15:05,663 --> 00:15:07,731
what do they represent?

381
00:15:07,765 --> 00:15:10,967
Oh, wow,
that's a really good question.

382
00:15:11,002 --> 00:15:12,569
(sucks air)

383
00:15:12,603 --> 00:15:14,471
La, la, la...

384
00:15:14,505 --> 00:15:15,539
(blathering)

385
00:15:15,573 --> 00:15:18,041
Mm... (blathering)

386
00:15:18,076 --> 00:15:20,544
(blowing raspberries)

387
00:15:24,148 --> 00:15:25,248
Oh, hi, Meg.

388
00:15:25,283 --> 00:15:27,584
Could you tell Chris
breakfast is ready?

389
00:15:27,618 --> 00:15:30,287
Oh, um, I-I-I think
he got up early.

390
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:32,923
He, um, said something
about a fat kid rally

391
00:15:32,957 --> 00:15:34,257
at Little Caesars.

392
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:36,159
Huh, it's not like Chris
to miss breakfast.

393
00:15:36,194 --> 00:15:37,527
Oh, don't worry, Mom.

394
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:40,130
I... I'm sure
he'll be home later.

395
00:15:40,164 --> 00:15:41,264
Well, I hope so.

396
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:43,016
We were supposed
to go to the library

397
00:15:43,051 --> 00:15:44,251
to wipe boogers
in fancy books.

398
00:15:44,285 --> 00:15:45,919
I like to wipe mine
in Bronte novels.

399
00:15:45,953 --> 00:15:49,473
It's like a time bomb to
gross out lonely chicks.

400
00:15:49,507 --> 00:15:51,541
Oh, Heathcliff.

401
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:52,759
Oh, come on.

402
00:15:52,794 --> 00:15:55,295
I want so little.

403
00:15:58,366 --> 00:16:00,734
Chris, what did you
do with my video tapes?

404
00:16:00,768 --> 00:16:03,503
I had a whole system.

405
00:16:03,538 --> 00:16:05,072
I was trying to find a
good movie to watch.

406
00:16:05,106 --> 00:16:06,673
I've never even heard of
most of these.

407
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,275
"Jeffrey at the Park."

408
00:16:08,309 --> 00:16:10,794
"Mikey's Scoliosis Exam."

409
00:16:10,828 --> 00:16:14,347
"Nephew Somersault Compilation."

410
00:16:14,382 --> 00:16:15,862
Well, even if you
never heard of them,

411
00:16:15,883 --> 00:16:17,150
I assume you heard
of the alphabet.

412
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:19,853
You want to explain to me how
"Sammy Popsicle"

413
00:16:19,887 --> 00:16:23,023
comes before "Napping, Various"?

414
00:16:23,057 --> 00:16:24,241
Geez, I'm sorry.

415
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:25,942
Well, can we
watch "Lost Boys"?

416
00:16:25,977 --> 00:16:27,177
I've heard of that one.

417
00:16:27,211 --> 00:16:30,580
Those... those are
different lost boys.

418
00:16:35,136 --> 00:16:37,721
(whistling "Snowbird")

419
00:16:37,772 --> 00:16:38,893
Are you whistling
"Snowbird"?

420
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,173
Yeah.

421
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,224
That's awesome.

422
00:16:41,275 --> 00:16:43,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
why do you get to ring it?

423
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:45,095
Because I was
into her first.

424
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,013
(doorbell rings)
Let's flip for it, or...

425
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,298
I can't believe
you did that.

426
00:16:48,332 --> 00:16:49,866
I cannot believe
you just did that.

427
00:16:49,901 --> 00:16:51,051
(doorbell rings)
Will you stop it.

428
00:16:51,085 --> 00:16:52,235
She's going to
think we're weird.

429
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,286
Hi. Can I help you?

430
00:16:53,321 --> 00:16:54,321
Hi. Miss Murray.

431
00:16:54,355 --> 00:16:55,755
My name's Brian Griffin.

432
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:57,557
Uh, first of all,
I just want to tell you

433
00:16:57,592 --> 00:16:59,125
what a huge fan I am.

434
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,694
Aw, that's very
sweet of you.

435
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:01,862
And I'm Stewie.

436
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:04,731
I'm the one who sent
you the vibrators.

437
00:17:04,765 --> 00:17:06,233
Well, I'm glad you
enjoy my music.

438
00:17:06,267 --> 00:17:07,400
Would you like to come in?

439
00:17:07,435 --> 00:17:08,652
We'd love to.

440
00:17:08,686 --> 00:17:10,186
Wow, nothing says success

441
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,622
like free on a Tuesday
at 3:00 p.m.

442
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,691
I'll get there.

443
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,294
So, Miss Murray,
the reason we came

444
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,095
is that we have a question
about "Snowbird."

445
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,714
It's about
a relationship, right?

446
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,716
No, no, it's obviously
about the fear of growing old.

447
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,470
You know, I think
you're both kind of right.

448
00:17:24,485 --> 00:17:26,152
I guess I always thought it was
about human limitation,

449
00:17:26,187 --> 00:17:28,705
both mental and physical.

450
00:17:28,739 --> 00:17:32,042
Okay, that...
that just blew my face off.

451
00:17:32,076 --> 00:17:33,376
Well, I hope
that helps.

452
00:17:33,411 --> 00:17:35,295
It does. Thank you so much,
Miss Murray.

453
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:36,563
This has been terrific.

454
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,731
Hey, uh, before we go,

455
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:38,949
do you mind if I
use your restroom?

456
00:17:38,983 --> 00:17:40,317
It was a long
drive up here.

457
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,836
No, go right ahead.

458
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,337
We should do something
without him sometime.

459
00:17:44,372 --> 00:17:46,039
Do you like tapas?

460
00:17:46,073 --> 00:17:47,874
Someone invited me
out for that once.

461
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:49,526
I thought they said
topless, so I was like,

462
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,660
(high-pitch): what?

463
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:51,695
That's a good story.

464
00:17:51,729 --> 00:17:53,096
Hey, you know,
that was really cool

465
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,165
how you told us what
"Snowbird" was about.

466
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,433
Well, you know,
that's just the way

467
00:17:56,467 --> 00:17:58,018
I always interpreted the song.

468
00:17:58,052 --> 00:17:59,352
But I suppose Gene probably

469
00:17:59,387 --> 00:18:01,021
could have explained
it better than I.

470
00:18:01,055 --> 00:18:02,689
Who's Gene?

471
00:18:02,723 --> 00:18:04,624
Gene MacLellan.
He wrote the song.

472
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:06,726
I see.

473
00:18:06,761 --> 00:18:08,695
But you wrote all
your other songs, right?

474
00:18:08,729 --> 00:18:10,964
No, all of my songs were
written by other people.

475
00:18:10,998 --> 00:18:12,599
As a singer,
I've been blessed

476
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,968
to interpret the works of
many gifted, sensitive

477
00:18:15,002 --> 00:18:16,236
songwriters.

478
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,872
Oh.

479
00:18:18,906 --> 00:18:21,441
So, you're just
a big (bleep) liar?

480
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,709
Sit back down.

481
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,978
All right, come on, Stewie,
let's go home...

482
00:18:25,012 --> 00:18:26,563
(muffled grunts)

483
00:18:26,597 --> 00:18:28,081
Stewie, what the
hell are you doing?

484
00:18:28,115 --> 00:18:29,349
She's a fraud, Brian.
A fraud!

485
00:18:29,383 --> 00:18:31,034
She didn't write any
of her songs.

486
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,969
Well, so, that's the case
with a lot of singers.

487
00:18:33,004 --> 00:18:34,971
It's a very common
industry practice.

488
00:18:35,006 --> 00:18:37,107
Well, then you're all a bunch of
frauds, aren't you?

489
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:39,042
A bunch of frauds and
charlatans.

490
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,543
You want to be a puppet?

491
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,412
Then sing for your life,
puppet. Come on.

492
00:18:42,446 --> 00:18:46,016
♪ Spread your tiny wings
and fly away! ♪

493
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:50,453
(muffled singing)

494
00:18:50,488 --> 00:18:52,222
Come on, Anne, sing along.

495
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,591
You know it. You didn't write
it, but you know it, bitch.

496
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:58,745
STEWIE AND ANNE:
♪ The one I love forever is untrue ♪

497
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:03,550
♪ And if I could you know that
I would fly away with you. ♪

498
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,521
Hey, Meg, you here for the
expired hot dogs?

499
00:19:08,556 --> 00:19:10,590
No, Carl, I'm
looking for Chris.

500
00:19:10,624 --> 00:19:12,559
I've looked everywhere
and I can't find him.

501
00:19:12,593 --> 00:19:15,061
Uh, I haven't seen him but
I'll keep an eye out.

502
00:19:15,096 --> 00:19:16,363
(knocking on glass)

503
00:19:16,397 --> 00:19:18,965
Hey, bozos, what do
you think of this?

504
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,334
(laughing):
I did, I did it!

505
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,602
You're crazy man.

506
00:19:22,636 --> 00:19:24,204
You're so crazy.

507
00:19:27,358 --> 00:19:28,875
(gunfire, men shouting on TV)

508
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:31,011
I thought I told you
to clean up in here?

509
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,545
And why aren't
you dressed?

510
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,813
We're supposed
to have dinner

511
00:19:33,848 --> 00:19:35,415
with Judge
Maynard and Timmy.

512
00:19:35,449 --> 00:19:37,550
Yeah, okay, as soon
as I finish this level.

513
00:19:37,585 --> 00:19:38,952
No, get your coat on.

514
00:19:38,986 --> 00:19:41,321
It's a three-hour
drive to that cabin.

515
00:19:41,355 --> 00:19:43,089
Can't you just
cook something here?

516
00:19:43,124 --> 00:19:44,257
Excuse me?

517
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,059
I am not going
to cook you dinner

518
00:19:46,093 --> 00:19:47,861
while you sit here
in your own mess

519
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,362
playing your TV games.

520
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,698
Oh-ho,
and the martyr returns.

521
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:56,703
Chris, I... I think
it's time for you to go.

522
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,104
Okay, I'll go.

523
00:19:58,139 --> 00:19:59,472
But I want you to know,

524
00:19:59,507 --> 00:20:01,541
I faked all
my light-headedness.

525
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,043
Mm, good Kool-Aid.

526
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:05,645
Whoa, whoa.

527
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:06,980
Sound familiar?

528
00:20:10,134 --> 00:20:11,384
Oh, my God, Chris.

529
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:12,585
Oh, there you are.

530
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,154
I've been looking all
over for you.

531
00:20:14,188 --> 00:20:16,890
Why? You want to humiliate
me with more slave work?

532
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:20,660
No, I...
I wanted to apologize.

533
00:20:20,694 --> 00:20:22,262
I should've never
blackmailed you.

534
00:20:22,296 --> 00:20:23,897
I'm really sorry.

535
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,332
And I want you
to come home.

536
00:20:26,367 --> 00:20:28,201
I thought you said no
one would miss me?

537
00:20:28,235 --> 00:20:30,770
I said a lot of stupid
things I didn't mean, Chris.

538
00:20:30,805 --> 00:20:32,689
But I miss you.

539
00:20:32,723 --> 00:20:35,258
Thanks, Meg.
I miss you, too.

540
00:20:35,292 --> 00:20:37,193
You know,
living in that family,

541
00:20:37,228 --> 00:20:38,595
we both have
pretty crappy lives.

542
00:20:38,629 --> 00:20:40,096
And if we're
going to survive it,

543
00:20:40,131 --> 00:20:41,598
we can't turn on each other.

544
00:20:41,632 --> 00:20:43,166
We're all we have.

545
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,400
I know.

546
00:20:44,435 --> 00:20:46,402
I'll never do anything
like that again.

547
00:20:46,437 --> 00:20:48,204
Do you think you can
ever forgive me?

548
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:50,340
Yeah, I forgive you.

549
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,242
(engine starting)

550
00:20:54,428 --> 00:20:56,396
(tires squealing)

551
00:20:56,430 --> 00:21:01,430
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

552
00:21:02,436 --> 00:21:04,471
(crying)

553
00:21:04,505 --> 00:21:05,939
We broke up.
