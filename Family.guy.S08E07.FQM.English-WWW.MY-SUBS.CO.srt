00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,940
- What?
- That empty space.

38
00:01:49,007 --> 00:01:51,275
It just reminds me that
Cleveland's not here anymore.

39
00:01:51,343 --> 00:01:52,910
Yeah, it's just not
the same without him.

40
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:54,112
I sure wish he...

41
00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:55,746
Hey, guys, look!

42
00:01:56,949 --> 00:01:58,015
It's him!

43
00:01:58,083 --> 00:01:59,417
Hey, Cleveland!

44
00:01:59,485 --> 00:02:01,853
Why didn't you tell us
you were back, buddy?

45
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,254
Oh, it's a lamp.

46
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,525
You know, guys,
I've been thinkin'.

47
00:02:07,593 --> 00:02:09,660
We need a new fourth
guy for our group.

48
00:02:09,728 --> 00:02:10,795
We're a man short.

49
00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:12,396
Like Stadler
without Waldorf.

50
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:15,466
You know, without the other guy
yappin' in my ear,

51
00:02:15,534 --> 00:02:16,834
these guys aren't half bad.

52
00:02:20,906 --> 00:02:23,341
Now I know you're interested
in being the fourth guy

53
00:02:23,408 --> 00:02:25,610
in our entourage,
Kevin Connolly, but don't you

54
00:02:25,677 --> 00:02:27,845
- think you're a little small?
- Listen, I tell you what.

55
00:02:27,913 --> 00:02:30,314
You can be in our group if I can
have some of your cereal.

56
00:02:30,382 --> 00:02:32,950
Oh, no, they're after
me Kevin Connolly charms!

57
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:40,725
How's your friend
search going?

58
00:02:40,792 --> 00:02:42,827
- Not great, Lois.
- What friend search?

59
00:02:42,895 --> 00:02:43,828
Oh, we're just trying to find

60
00:02:43,896 --> 00:02:44,829
a friend to replace Cleveland.

61
00:02:44,897 --> 00:02:45,830
We've been meeting people

62
00:02:45,898 --> 00:02:47,198
for the past three days.

63
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:48,766
Well, you don't need to
look for somebody new.

64
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:50,668
- I'll hang out with you guys.
- Yeah, you know,

65
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:52,236
I don't think that's
gonna work out, Brian,

66
00:02:52,304 --> 00:02:53,404
'cause of the whole
Quagmire thing.

67
00:02:53,472 --> 00:02:54,805
What Quagmire thing?

68
00:02:54,873 --> 00:02:56,307
Oh, you know,
just that he hates you.

69
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,342
- Quagmire hates me?
- Hates you.

70
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,912
I... I don't get it. Why...
why wouldn't Quagmire like me?

71
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:02,547
Because he thinks
you're annoying.

72
00:03:02,614 --> 00:03:04,715
Like people who never
shut up about their kids.

73
00:03:04,783 --> 00:03:07,451
He... he would have
been four today.

74
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,687
I... I still don't understand.

75
00:03:09,755 --> 00:03:12,190
How do you drown
in an inch of water?

76
00:03:12,257 --> 00:03:14,258
Well...

77
00:03:14,326 --> 00:03:17,328
I guess I don't have
a new sweater and a haircut.

78
00:03:21,633 --> 00:03:22,900
Who would've thought

79
00:03:22,968 --> 00:03:24,468
it would be this hard
to replace Cleveland?

80
00:03:24,536 --> 00:03:25,937
You know, guys,
we've kind of been

81
00:03:26,004 --> 00:03:27,338
ignoring the obvious here.

82
00:03:27,406 --> 00:03:28,940
I mean,
if you really break it down,

83
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:30,708
what we need is a black guy.

84
00:03:30,776 --> 00:03:32,810
Yeah, that was the best thing
about Cleveland.

85
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:34,946
Oh, by far.
I sure do miss him.

86
00:03:35,013 --> 00:03:36,981
Peter's right.
We gotta find another black guy.

87
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:38,149
Yeah, 'cause
otherwise we're just

88
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:39,584
a bunch of boring
white guys.

89
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:41,419
Like a London
gentlemen's club.

90
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,943
Hey, you guys want to
enter the darts tournament?

91
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:40,978
First prize is free
drinks all night.

92
00:04:41,046 --> 00:04:43,214
Oh, we'd love to, Horace,
but there's only three of us.

93
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:45,116
Did I hear some
sorry ass fools

94
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,051
in need of a
motherlovin' fourth?

95
00:04:52,157 --> 00:04:54,325
I'll join your darts game.

96
00:04:54,393 --> 00:04:55,626
How do we know
you're any good?

97
00:05:00,032 --> 00:05:03,200
Gentlemen,
we got us a black man.

98
00:05:07,873 --> 00:05:10,641
Oh, boy,
what a fantastic evening.

99
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:13,444
Jerome, you are a wonderful
addition to our group.

100
00:05:13,512 --> 00:05:14,879
Hey, thanks, Peter.

101
00:05:14,946 --> 00:05:16,414
I like you guys, too.

102
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:18,983
What do you say we hit
another bar, keep it goin'?

103
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:21,819
I can't. There's a girl tied up
in my basement who needs some food.

104
00:05:21,887 --> 00:05:24,455
That's funny.
You funny, pointy man.

105
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:26,590
Yeah, I...
I joke around a lot.

106
00:05:31,797 --> 00:05:33,097
Thanks for the lift home,
Jerome.

107
00:05:33,165 --> 00:05:34,532
Hey, if you got time to come in,

108
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:35,900
I'd love for you to meet my wife.

109
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:38,002
I got time for
whatever I want, fool.

110
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,738
My watch don't tell
time, I tell it.

111
00:05:40,806 --> 00:05:43,974
Wow, you're cooler than
a York Peppermint Pattie.

112
00:05:44,042 --> 00:05:46,077
When I bite
into a York Peppermint Pattie,

113
00:05:46,144 --> 00:05:48,112
I get the sensation...

114
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,582
of being on a frozen
mountaintop!

115
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,518
<i>It has been two months
since I made the tragic choice</i>

116
00:05:54,586 --> 00:05:56,654
<i>to bite into a
York Peppermint Pattie,</i>

117
00:05:56,722 --> 00:05:58,389
<i>and still I have made
no progress</i>

118
00:05:58,457 --> 00:06:00,191
<i>finding my way
out of the mountains.</i>

119
00:06:00,258 --> 00:06:02,259
<i>The only food I have
is the rest of this</i>

120
00:06:02,327 --> 00:06:04,595
<i>York Peppermint Pattie,
which unfortunately,</i>

121
00:06:04,663 --> 00:06:07,064
<i>keeps bringing me back

123
00:06:10,535 --> 00:06:12,803
...of being on a frozen
mountaintop!

124
00:06:16,942 --> 00:06:18,943
Hey, Lois. I'd like you
to meet our new friend...

125
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:19,944
Jerome?

126
00:06:20,011 --> 00:06:21,379
Loose Lois?

127
00:06:21,446 --> 00:06:23,447
Wha... You guys
know each other?

128
00:06:23,515 --> 00:06:24,882
Know each other?

129
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,284
Peter, Jerome is an
old boyfriend of mine.

130
00:06:27,352 --> 00:06:29,153
What?!

131
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:31,021
Sorry, I was out of it.
Wait, are we being robbed?

132
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:38,245
Peter, I know I told
you about Jerome.

133
00:06:38,313 --> 00:06:40,080
Lois, I would've remembered
if you told me that.

134
00:06:40,148 --> 00:06:41,582
I told you, Peter.

135
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,651
I remember exactly
what we were doing.

136
00:06:47,622 --> 00:06:49,356
I slept with a black guy.

137
00:06:49,424 --> 00:06:52,259
I hope this doesn't make
you feel awkward, my man.

138
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:54,161
It was a long time ago.

139
00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:55,696
Hey, that's
a beautiful baby.

140
00:06:55,764 --> 00:06:56,931
Mind if I hold him?

141
00:06:56,998 --> 00:06:58,599
Go right ahead.

142
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:00,234
Hey there, lil' fella.

143
00:07:00,302 --> 00:07:01,535
What's that around
your neck?

144
00:07:01,603 --> 00:07:03,971

00:07:15,617 --> 00:07:17,785
We should grab a coffee
or something and catch up.

151

That would be great.

152

00:07:26,695 --> 00:07:28,495
and buy a framed
painting of a tiger.

157
00:07:28,563 --> 00:07:30,831
Catch y'all later.

158
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:33,067
You're not really gonna
hang out with him, Lois, are ya?

159
00:07:33,134 --> 00:07:34,835
We're just friends, Peter.

160
00:07:34,903 --> 00:07:36,337
Don't tell me
you're jealous?

161
00:07:36,404 --> 00:07:39,673
Well, you datin' that guy?
It's just a lot to take in.

162
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:41,575
Oh, you're tellin' me.

163
00:07:41,643 --> 00:07:43,744
Oh, come on! Those kinds
of jokes aren't helpin'.

164
00:07:43,812 --> 00:07:45,412
Well, what do you
want me to say?

165
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,947
You're bein' silly.

166
00:07:47,015 --> 00:07:50,117
I mean, Jerome and I
dated over twelve inches ago.

167
00:07:50,185 --> 00:07:52,086
I said inches!

168
00:07:52,153 --> 00:07:54,188
- What did I just say?!
- I'm sorry.

169
00:07:54,255 --> 00:07:56,523
I'm sorry.
Okay, look, just relax.

170
00:07:56,591 --> 00:07:58,892
You're my husband
and I love you,

171
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,527
so just put Jerome
out of your head.

172
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,931
Get him out of my life
is more like it.

173
00:08:06,768 --> 00:08:09,336
Brian, I just found
out Chris Farley died.

174
00:08:09,404 --> 00:08:11,171
Yeah, that happened
like twelve years ago.

175
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:12,973
But I just watched
<i>Tommy Boy</i> yesterday.

176
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,775
- He was right there.
- Yeah, that's a movie.

177
00:08:14,843 --> 00:08:17,177
It's shot beforehand.
It's not happening right now.

178
00:08:17,245 --> 00:08:19,880
Really? But I thought
my knocking on the TV glass

179
00:08:19,948 --> 00:08:22,316
Distracted him, and that's
what made him fall down that hill.

180
00:08:22,384 --> 00:08:24,385
Oh, oh,
seeing him fall down that hill

181
00:08:24,452 --> 00:08:25,953
put me in a good humor!

182
00:08:26,021 --> 00:08:27,187
Stewie, get lost.

183
00:08:27,255 --> 00:08:28,856
What are you doing
just standing out here?

184
00:08:28,923 --> 00:08:30,724
I'm waiting for Quagmire
to get his mail.

185
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:32,359
I'm gonna
conveniently stroll by

186
00:08:32,427 --> 00:08:33,861
and strike up a
conversation with him,

187
00:08:33,928 --> 00:08:35,529
and maybe find out
why he hates me.

188
00:08:35,597 --> 00:08:37,164
Oh, I'm sure it's just
a misunderstanding.

189
00:08:37,232 --> 00:08:38,666
You'll smooth it over.

190
00:08:41,836 --> 00:08:43,871
Hey, Quagmire,
what a coincidence.

191
00:08:43,938 --> 00:08:45,806
You and me just runnin'
into each other.

192
00:08:45,874 --> 00:08:47,141
- How, how ya doin'?
- Fine.

193
00:08:50,045 --> 00:08:51,745
Oh, takin' a break, huh?

194
00:08:51,813 --> 00:08:53,380
She's a hot piece of ass.

195
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:55,315
And from the looks of it,
she likes it rough.

196
00:08:55,383 --> 00:08:56,684
That's my sister, Brian.

197
00:08:56,751 --> 00:08:58,686
Her boyfriend has been
beating her mercilessly.

198
00:08:58,753 --> 00:09:01,021
The last thing she'd want
right now is to be objectified.

199
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:03,290
Oh, God.
I'm... I'm really sorry.

200
00:09:03,358 --> 00:09:05,325
I got a deaf brother,
you want to make fun of him, too?

201
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:13,067
- Where is she?
- She's not here.

202
00:09:13,134 --> 00:09:14,268
Get out, Jeff!

203
00:09:14,335 --> 00:09:15,969
Just get out of here!

204
00:09:16,037 --> 00:09:17,938
Oh, I'll get out
when I'm finished.

205
00:09:18,006 --> 00:09:19,339
No! Ow!

206
00:09:19,407 --> 00:09:21,442
You feel good about your sex
joke earlier, Brian?

207
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:23,510
He's savagely beating her again.
You hear that?

208
00:09:23,578 --> 00:09:24,745
Yeah, I'm not deaf.

209
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:26,280
Oh, oh, what, like my brother?

210
00:09:26,347 --> 00:09:27,881
Boy, you have no class!

211
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:29,683
Yeah, that's the
guy's brother, man!

212
00:09:29,751 --> 00:09:31,218
- Yeah!
- Shut up, bitch!

213
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,057
Hey,
you know what they say.

214
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,660
See a broad,
to get that booty, yak 'em.

215
00:09:39,728 --> 00:09:42,029
Leg her down and smack 'em yak 'em!

216
00:09:42,097 --> 00:09:43,831
Cold got to be.

217
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,668
- Golly!
- If you'll excuse me,

218
00:09:47,736 --> 00:09:49,470
I'm gonna order me
some cheap cognac

219
00:09:49,537 --> 00:09:51,872
and put it
in a fancy glass.

220
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,273
Boy, Jerome
is the greatest.

221
00:09:53,341 --> 00:09:54,408
We really lucked out.

222
00:09:54,476 --> 00:09:55,576
I don't know, you guys.

223
00:09:55,643 --> 00:09:57,077
I'm not so sure
about Jerome.

224
00:09:57,145 --> 00:09:59,012
I mean, how do we know
we can really trust him?

225
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,482
What are you talking about, Peter?
Jerome's awesome.

226
00:10:01,549 --> 00:10:03,350
Yeah, why the hell wouldn't
we be able to trust him?

227
00:10:03,418 --> 00:10:04,918
All right,
you guys want the truth?

228
00:10:04,986 --> 00:10:07,621
Before me and Lois were married,
our new friend

229
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:09,623
used to slip her
the old Pringles can.

230
00:10:09,691 --> 00:10:12,526
Well, so what, Peter.
That was twenty years ago.

231
00:10:12,594 --> 00:10:13,761
That doesn't matter!

232
00:10:13,828 --> 00:10:15,596
Look, Peter,
Jerome's the coolest guy

233
00:10:15,663 --> 00:10:17,097
we've met since
Cleveland left.

234
00:10:17,165 --> 00:10:19,399
Yeah, don't do anything
to ruin this, Peter.

235
00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:21,435
You know,
the way you ruined my parrot.

236
00:10:21,503 --> 00:10:23,036
I just bought it yesterday.

237
00:10:23,104 --> 00:10:24,505
Isn't it beautiful?

238
00:10:24,572 --> 00:10:26,573
Cripple, cripple, cripple,
cripple, cripple, cripple,

239
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:27,975
cripple, cripple, cripple, cripple.

240
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:29,276
- Cripple!
- Damn it!

241
00:10:33,681 --> 00:10:35,182
That son of a bitch.

242
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,884
Thinks he can sleep
with my wife!

243
00:10:36,951 --> 00:10:38,285
Not on my watch.

244
00:10:40,989 --> 00:10:43,123
Listen, I don't care
that you're dating Mallory.

245
00:10:43,191 --> 00:10:44,992
Nobody in this family
likes you, Nick.

246
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:47,761
You just stand your ground,
garbage sculpture man.

247
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:49,363
They'll come to respect you.

248
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,731
You bastard.

249
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,199
Nick was no good for her

250
00:10:52,267 --> 00:10:54,067
and it broke
Skippy Handleman's heart!

251
00:11:03,978 --> 00:11:06,647
Dear God and black Jesus!

252
00:11:14,088 --> 00:11:15,088
Jerome?

253
00:11:15,156 --> 00:11:16,557
What, uh...

254
00:11:16,624 --> 00:11:18,225
What... what the hell
are you doing here?

255
00:11:18,293 --> 00:11:20,694
Oh, Peter, something
terrible has happened.

256
00:11:20,762 --> 00:11:22,963
Somebody burned down
Jerome's house last night.

257
00:11:23,031 --> 00:11:25,833
This whacked-out world.

258
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,835
It just makes you want
to grab your nephew

259
00:11:27,902 --> 00:11:30,304
and get in a van and shoot
people in the D.C. area.

260
00:11:30,371 --> 00:11:32,873
Yeah, well, when I find
the guy who did it,

261
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:36,043
I'm gonna rip his arms off and
do his wife in front of him.

262
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,744
And no one would blame you.

263
00:11:37,812 --> 00:11:39,213
But, meanwhile, Jerome,

264
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,014
you are more than
welcome to stay with us.

265
00:11:41,082 --> 00:11:42,149
What?

266
00:11:42,217 --> 00:11:43,784
Oh, well,
thank you, Lois.

267
00:11:43,852 --> 00:11:46,987
Man, I'm so lucky to have real
friends like you and Peter.

268
00:11:47,055 --> 00:11:48,455
Well, I guess
you can stay here.

269
00:11:48,523 --> 00:11:49,756
But I'll tell you
one thing...

270
00:11:49,824 --> 00:11:51,291
Oh, hang on a second.

271
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:53,126
What is that?

272
00:11:53,194 --> 00:11:55,395
I don't know,
it's trying to do something.

273
00:11:55,463 --> 00:11:56,964
Oh...

274
00:11:57,031 --> 00:11:59,867
Well, well, I guess we're
just gonna have to wait.

275
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:07,735
So how long is Jerome
gonna be staying with us, Dad?

276
00:12:07,803 --> 00:12:10,337
I don't know, Chris, but the sooner
he's out of here, the better.

277
00:12:10,405 --> 00:12:12,506
I don't trust him around
Lois for a second.

278
00:12:12,574 --> 00:12:15,643
Oh, God, Jerome,
that is so good.

279
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,379
Oh, yeah,
it's so hot and moist.

280
00:12:20,682 --> 00:12:23,217
Mmm, these scones are
delicious.

281
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:25,519
You are quite the little baker,
Jerome.

282
00:12:25,587 --> 00:12:26,654
Oh, thank God.

283
00:12:26,721 --> 00:12:28,222
What's going on in here?!

284
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,557
Relax, Mr. Furley.

285
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,192
I thought what you thought,
but it's okay.

286
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:33,627
- Well, it sounded like...
- I know, I know, but it's fine.

287
00:12:33,695 --> 00:12:35,296
Go back to being dead.

288
00:12:35,363 --> 00:12:36,797
Peter,
is everything all right?

289
00:12:36,865 --> 00:12:38,532
Yeah. Yeah, Lois.
Everything's fine.

290
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,801
You guys, uh,
having a little breakfast?

291
00:12:40,869 --> 00:12:43,070
Yes, and Jerome
made scones.

292
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:45,840
Would you like one?
Oh, they're delicious.

293
00:12:45,907 --> 00:12:48,209
I thought maybe later today,
we could all...

294
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:52,847
Oh, my God!
Mom's choking!

295
00:12:52,914 --> 00:12:54,715
Out of the way.
I'm an EMT.

296
00:12:59,287 --> 00:13:00,955
Her airway's jammed.

297
00:13:01,022 --> 00:13:02,189
Come on, now.
Just like that.

298
00:13:03,758 --> 00:13:05,559
I need some
gravitational help.

299
00:13:07,395 --> 00:13:09,597
Oh, no, her clothes
are constricting!

300
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:11,465
As are mine!

301
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:18,873
Oh, my God!

302
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,008
Oh! Thank you, Jerome!

303
00:13:21,076 --> 00:13:22,810
You saved my life!

304
00:13:22,878 --> 00:13:25,513
"Um, I'll have
what she's having,"

305
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,781
says the funniest person
in the room.

306
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,555
Hey, what are you getting
all dressed up for?

307
00:13:34,623 --> 00:13:36,390
I'm treating Quagmire
to a night out.

308
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,758
Really? I thought
he hated you.

309
00:13:37,826 --> 00:13:39,059
How'd you
convince him to go?

310
00:13:39,127 --> 00:13:40,861
I tricked him.
Sent him a phony card.

311
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:43,097
He thinks he's going on a date
with an old girlfriend.

312
00:13:43,164 --> 00:13:45,032
But instead,
you're going to show up.

313
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,634
- You got it.
- Yikes.

314
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,335
That's a recipe
for disappointment.

315
00:13:48,403 --> 00:13:49,970
Like walking
a floral arrangement

316
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,405
through an office
full of fat women.

317
00:13:52,974 --> 00:13:54,508
Is there a Miss...

318
00:13:54,576 --> 00:13:56,076
...es.

319
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:03,250
Brian?
Where's Cheryl Tiegs?

320
00:14:03,318 --> 00:14:05,085
Well, she's not coming.

321
00:14:05,153 --> 00:14:07,655
I wrote you that, because I knew
you'd never come if it was me.

322
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:10,157
But I planned a big night and
we're gonna have a great time.

323
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:12,760
Brian, Cheryl was
the one that got away.

324
00:14:12,827 --> 00:14:14,795
She was the
great love of my life.

325
00:14:14,863 --> 00:14:16,564
I thought this was my chance

326
00:14:16,631 --> 00:14:18,632
to finally achieve
some real happiness.

327
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,168
Ever since she left,
I've been chasing girls

328
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:23,337
to fill the hole she made
when she walked out.

329
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:25,172
And now I'm forever lost.

330
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,241
Well, I bet a thick,
juicy steak

331
00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:28,776
could help fill
that hole, huh?

332
00:14:32,647 --> 00:14:34,815
Aw, come on,
it'll be great.

333
00:14:34,883 --> 00:14:37,518
Listen, Glenn,
I... I want us to be friends.

334
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,587
I think we could be
an even better team

335
00:14:39,654 --> 00:14:42,356
than Lewis and Clark and
the guy who likes to rip up maps.

336
00:14:42,524 --> 00:14:45,426
All right,
the Northwest Passage.

337
00:14:45,493 --> 00:14:47,494
Hey, can I see that?

338
00:14:48,964 --> 00:14:50,564
Damn it! You ass!

339
00:14:50,632 --> 00:14:52,700
- Easy, Clark.
- I hate that guy!

340
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:53,934
It's been a long trip.

341
00:14:54,002 --> 00:14:55,669
- You're tired.
- No! I hate him!

342
00:14:55,737 --> 00:14:57,972
Look, you're angry,
you're dehydrated.

343
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:59,707
Just have some water
from the canteen

344
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:02,009
- and you'll feel better.
- Okay.

345
00:15:02,077 --> 00:15:04,378
I just totally drowned
this ant hill.

346
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:06,571
Hey, when are we
going to get there?

347
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:14,188
Oh, and this is Peter
and I at our wedding.

348
00:15:14,255 --> 00:15:15,756
Aw, you look beautiful.

349
00:15:15,824 --> 00:15:17,558
And he's a handsome fella,
ain't he?

350
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:19,460
Well, I am ready
for my evening.

351
00:15:19,527 --> 00:15:20,928
Oh, my God, Peter!

352
00:15:20,996 --> 00:15:23,197
- What the hell?!
- Peter, what are you doing?

353
00:15:23,264 --> 00:15:25,566
Oh, surely, Jerome, you don't
want to stay in the same house

354
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:27,668
as a ghost who carries
a torch around.

355
00:15:27,736 --> 00:15:30,170
Ooh, fire ghost!

356
00:15:30,238 --> 00:15:31,939
Ooh! Ya scared yet?

357
00:15:32,007 --> 00:15:33,574
Didn't know this place
was haunted, did ya?

358
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,075
Peter,
take that thing off!

359
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:36,543
Hey,
what the hell's going on?

360
00:15:36,611 --> 00:15:37,845
I'll tell you what's going on.

361
00:15:37,912 --> 00:15:39,647
I have had about
enough of you, Jerome.

362
00:15:39,714 --> 00:15:41,949
I know you want my wife,
but you can't have her!

363
00:15:42,017 --> 00:15:44,018
You are no longer
welcome in my house!

364
00:15:44,085 --> 00:15:45,719
Whatchu talkin' 'bout, Peter?

365
00:15:45,787 --> 00:15:47,287
But you can't have
sex with Lois!

366
00:15:47,355 --> 00:15:49,089
Now, I want you out
of here right now!

367
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,525
I can't believe this.

368
00:15:51,593 --> 00:15:53,761
I thought I found
a true friend in you.

369
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:57,398
I'd never do anything to hurt
you or your family.

370
00:15:57,465 --> 00:15:59,600
Man, you're breaking my heart.

371
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:01,001
Jerome, wait.

372
00:16:01,069 --> 00:16:02,803
He doesn't know what
he's talking about.

373
00:16:02,871 --> 00:16:04,371
I'm sorry, Lois.

374
00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:06,707
I think it would be
better if I left.

375
00:16:06,775 --> 00:16:09,843
Peter, I'm sorry
if I caused you any trouble.

376
00:16:09,911 --> 00:16:12,746
I won't be bothering
you again.

377
00:16:15,283 --> 00:16:18,552
Wow, what just happened
was kind of sad.

378
00:16:33,168 --> 00:16:35,703
So... whose leg
do you have to hump

379
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,237
to get a dry martini
around here?

380
00:16:37,305 --> 00:16:39,440
Hmm.

381
00:16:39,507 --> 00:16:41,508
God, look at the size
of these steak knives.

382
00:16:41,576 --> 00:16:43,777
Wha... what are they serving us?
Tyrannosaurus rex?

383
00:16:43,845 --> 00:16:46,613
Not likely.

384
00:16:46,681 --> 00:16:50,684
Hey, what if I just drank
this whole bottle of ketchup?

385
00:16:50,752 --> 00:16:52,553
Can you imagine?
You dare me?

386
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,221
Kind of ruins it
for the next person

387
00:16:54,289 --> 00:16:56,290
who might want
some ketchup.

388
00:16:56,357 --> 00:16:57,958
So, how's
the flying business?

389
00:16:58,026 --> 00:17:00,627
Not so great. The economy's
sort of taken its toll,

390
00:17:00,695 --> 00:17:03,230
- lot of salary cuts, lot of layoffs.
- Yeah?

391
00:17:03,298 --> 00:17:04,631
That's pretty much it.

392
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:07,067
I mean, you want to learn more,
read the papers,

393
00:17:07,135 --> 00:17:08,569
go on the internet,
I... I don't know.

394
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:10,003
Boy, that's got to be
an interesting job.

395
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,705
I'll bet you got...
how do those things work?

396
00:17:11,773 --> 00:17:13,507
What? Planes?

397
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,909
- How does a plane work?
- Yeah.

398
00:17:15,977 --> 00:17:18,712
You want me to sit here and
explain to you how a plane works?

399
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,280
I don't know. Yeah.

400
00:17:20,348 --> 00:17:21,582
You want to maybe just go?

401
00:17:21,649 --> 00:17:23,617
Quagmire, come on,
I'm really trying hard here.

402
00:17:23,685 --> 00:17:25,018
Who asked you to try hard?

403
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,087
Nobody, but all...
I'm trying to establish

404
00:17:27,155 --> 00:17:28,388
a friendship with you.

405
00:17:28,456 --> 00:17:30,390
All I've done is try
to be nice to you,

406
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,926
and you still don't like me.
How can you not like me?

407
00:17:32,994 --> 00:17:35,028
Okay. I'll tell you.

408
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,297
You are the worst person I know.

409
00:17:37,365 --> 00:17:39,066
You constantly hit on your
best friend's wife.

410
00:17:39,134 --> 00:17:40,834
The man pays for your food
and rescued you

411
00:17:40,902 --> 00:17:42,736
from certain death,
and this is how you repay him?

412
00:17:42,804 --> 00:17:45,672
And to add insult to injury,
you defecate all over his yard.

413
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,941
And you're such a sponge.
You pay for nothing.

414
00:17:48,009 --> 00:17:49,510
You always say,
"Oh, I'll get you later."

415
00:17:49,577 --> 00:17:50,811
But later never comes.

416
00:17:50,879 --> 00:17:52,679
And what really bothers me,
is you pretend

417
00:17:52,747 --> 00:17:55,015
you're this deep guy who loves
women for their souls

418
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,617
when all you do is date bimbos.

419
00:17:56,684 --> 00:17:58,418
Yeah, I date women
for their bodies,

420
00:17:58,486 --> 00:17:59,853
but at least
I'm honest about it.

421
00:17:59,921 --> 00:18:01,655
I don't buy them a copy
of <i>Catcher in the Rye</i>

422
00:18:01,723 --> 00:18:04,158
and then lecture them with some
seventh grade interpretation

423
00:18:04,225 --> 00:18:06,660
of how Holden Caulfield
is some profound intellectual.

424
00:18:06,728 --> 00:18:08,796
He wasn't.
He was a spoiled brat.

425
00:18:08,863 --> 00:18:10,764
And that's why you like him
so much... he's you.

426
00:18:10,832 --> 00:18:12,099
God, you're pretentious!

427
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:13,901
And you delude yourself
by thinking you're some

428
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:15,202
great writer,
even though you're terrible.

429
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,570
You know, I should have known
Cheryl Tiegs

430
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:18,105
didn't write me that note.

431
00:18:18,173 --> 00:18:20,307
She would have known there's no
"a" in the word "definite."

432
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,009
And I think
what I hate most about you

433
00:18:22,076 --> 00:18:24,011
is your textbook liberal agenda,
how we should

434
00:18:24,078 --> 00:18:25,612
"Legalize pot, man,"

435
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,548
how big business
is crushing the underclass,

436
00:18:27,615 --> 00:18:29,750
how homelessness is the biggest
tragedy in America.

437
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,084
Well, what have
you done to help?

438
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,686
I work down at the
soup kitchen, Brian.

439
00:18:32,754 --> 00:18:34,121
Never seen you down there.

440
00:18:34,189 --> 00:18:35,656
You want to help?
Grab a ladle!

441
00:18:35,723 --> 00:18:38,826
And, by the way, driving a Prius
doesn't make you Jesus Christ.

442
00:18:38,893 --> 00:18:40,494
Oh, wait, you don't believe
in Jesus Christ,

443
00:18:40,562 --> 00:18:41,929
or any religion for that matter,

444
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,463
because
"Religion is for idiots."

445
00:18:43,531 --> 00:18:45,465
Well, who the hell are you
to talk down to anyone?

446
00:18:45,533 --> 00:18:47,000
You failed college twice.

447
00:18:47,068 --> 00:18:49,203
Which isn't nearly as bad
as your failure as a father.

448
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,771
How's that son of yours
you never see?

449
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,739
But you know what?
I could forgive all of that,

450
00:18:52,807 --> 00:18:55,709
all of it,
if you weren't such a bore.

451
00:18:55,777 --> 00:18:57,311
That's the worst of it, Brian.

452
00:18:57,378 --> 00:19:00,948
You're just a big, sad,
alcoholic bore.

453
00:19:02,584 --> 00:19:03,951
Well, see ya, Brian.

454
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,586
Thanks for the
(bleep) steak.

455
00:19:09,624 --> 00:19:11,191
Boy, it sure is nice

456
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:12,893
having our house
to ourselves again, huh?

457
00:19:12,961 --> 00:19:14,962
Lois?

458
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:18,398
Peter, sometimes you just make
me sick to my stomach.

459
00:19:18,466 --> 00:19:20,868
Look, I know you think Jerome
was a good guy, but...

460
00:19:20,935 --> 00:19:22,669
No, he was a good guy, Peter.

461
00:19:22,737 --> 00:19:24,171
And I'm gonna
prove it to you.

462
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:27,007
And you're gonna feel
like a real jackass.

463
00:19:27,075 --> 00:19:28,442
What's that?

464
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:30,444
It's a gift.
For you.

465
00:19:30,511 --> 00:19:32,279
You don't deserve it,
but if anything,

466
00:19:32,347 --> 00:19:33,780
it's gonna wake you up
a little bit.

467
00:19:33,848 --> 00:19:35,582
Jerome got you this
as a thank you

468
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,118
for letting him stay here.

469
00:19:38,186 --> 00:19:40,954
It's an actual prop
from <i>Family Ties</i>.

470
00:19:41,022 --> 00:19:44,658
This is... This is one
of Nick's garbage sculptures.

471
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,793
Yeah.
Pretty thoughtful, isn't it?

472
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:49,897
Oh, boy,
do I feel like a jackass.

473
00:19:49,964 --> 00:19:52,332
Lois, I'm sorry.
I'm just...

474
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,534
I let my jealousy
get the best of me.

475
00:19:54,602 --> 00:19:56,503
Jerome's such
a cool guy and I...

476
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,005
I guess I was worried
he was cool enough

477
00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,473
to steal you away from me.

478
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,675
You should know better
than that, Peter.

479
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,744
Now, I think you have
an apology to make.

480
00:20:13,955 --> 00:20:16,957
Hey, you look like
you could use a pal.

481
00:20:17,025 --> 00:20:18,992
Oh. Hi, Peter.

482
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,929
Look, I'm sorry
about how I acted.

483
00:20:21,996 --> 00:20:23,630
It's just...

484
00:20:23,698 --> 00:20:24,698
Lois means
everything to me.

485
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:26,133
And when I saw
you together,

486
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,801
I... I didn't know what
was gonna happen.

487
00:20:27,869 --> 00:20:30,103
I just thought you might
try to mount her

488
00:20:30,171 --> 00:20:31,705
or whatever it is
you guys do.

489
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:34,174
Peter, how could you
even think that?

490
00:20:34,242 --> 00:20:36,476
I would never do
anything like that to you.

491
00:20:36,544 --> 00:20:38,445
You were my boy.
We were like family.

492
00:20:38,513 --> 00:20:40,347
Yeah, I know.

493
00:20:40,415 --> 00:20:41,615
I messed up bad.

494
00:20:41,683 --> 00:20:42,983
I'm really sorry, Jerome.

495
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,021
We cool, Peter. We cool.

496
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:50,924
But, listen, there is
something I got to fess up to.

497
00:20:50,992 --> 00:20:52,759
While I was living
with y'all,

498
00:20:52,827 --> 00:20:55,862
I had myself lots of
nasty ass sex with Meg.

499
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,631
I don't care about that.

500
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:03,941
Hey, Brian, how'd it go?

501
00:21:04,008 --> 00:21:05,175
Fine.

502
00:21:05,243 --> 00:21:06,477
Wha... have you been crying?

503
00:21:06,544 --> 00:21:07,878
What happened?

504
00:21:07,946 --> 00:21:09,980
It didn't work.
He still hates me.

505
00:21:10,048 --> 00:21:11,381
You want to know something?

506
00:21:11,449 --> 00:21:12,649
That's okay.

507
00:21:12,717 --> 00:21:14,384
You don't need Quagmire
to like you.

508
00:21:14,452 --> 00:21:18,455
You only need one person to like
you and that person is you.

509
00:21:18,523 --> 00:21:21,125
And I'll tell you something else,
I like you.

510
00:21:21,192 --> 00:21:22,326
Thanks.

511
00:21:22,393 --> 00:21:23,894
You want to sleep
in my room?

512
00:21:23,962 --> 00:21:24,928
Yeah, that'd be nice.

513
00:21:27,717 --> 00:21:29,948
- Good night, Brian.
- Good night, Stewie.

514
00:21:34,548 --> 00:21:37,340
Oh, come on, man.

515
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:43,824
