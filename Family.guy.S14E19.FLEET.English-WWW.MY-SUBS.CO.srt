00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:37,178
Well, Chris, looks
like another day

13
00:00:37,213 --> 00:00:39,146
of nobody joining
us for lunch.

14
00:00:39,182 --> 00:00:40,548
Yeah, we never
should've let

15
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,850
that blind girl
touch our faces.

Attention, students.
This is Principal Shepherd

18
00:00:46,823 --> 00:00:48,856
with the lunchtime
announcements.

19
00:00:48,891 --> 00:00:50,858
And as a special treat,
I thought I'd deliver them

20
00:00:50,893 --> 00:00:54,295
in the rapping style you kids
are so enthused about.

No,<i> you</i> suck.

27
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,043
I can't hear you, I just presume

28
00:01:09,078 --> 00:01:10,478
somebody must have yelled
"You suck."

29
00:01:10,513 --> 00:01:12,313
Anyway, last announcement:

30
00:01:12,348 --> 00:01:15,549
Don't forget it's time to vote
for homecoming king and queen.

31
00:01:15,585 --> 00:01:18,052
Nominations are due
by 3:00 p.m. today.

32
00:01:18,087 --> 00:01:19,220
Peace out.

33
00:01:19,255 --> 00:01:22,056
No,<i> you're</i> a douche bag.

34
00:01:22,091 --> 00:01:25,760
Wow. Can you imagine if one
of us was homecoming king?

35
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:27,928
Then people would want
to sit with us at lunch.

36
00:01:27,964 --> 00:01:29,764
Yeah, you should run.

37
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:30,931
I'll nominate you.

38
00:01:30,967 --> 00:01:33,334
You know what?
I'll do it.

39
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:35,035
Maybe I'll surprise everyone,

40
00:01:35,071 --> 00:01:37,104
like when you find out
a buttoned-up librarian

41
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,373
is actually super sexy.

42
00:01:39,408 --> 00:01:41,175
Excuse me, ma'am?

Yes?

46
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:51,986
There's a dead homeless man
blocking the card catalog.

47
00:01:55,424 --> 00:01:58,025
Well, there goes Jerome,

48
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,927
loading the urinal up with ice.

49
00:01:59,962 --> 00:02:02,963
Gonna go play me
my melting game.

50
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:04,298
Man, I'm starting to get drunk.

51
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,566
Is it even noon yet?

52
00:02:05,601 --> 00:02:07,868
Uh, it's only 10:40.
10:40?

53
00:02:07,904 --> 00:02:09,136
Ah, crap,
we gotta get out of here.

54
00:02:09,172 --> 00:02:10,471
That's when Taco Bell throws all

55
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:12,306
the breakfast food
in the Dumpster.

56
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:13,974
Can't let that raccoon
get all of it.

57
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,142
Ooh, man, you're right.

58
00:02:15,178 --> 00:02:16,310
You know,
this is great, guys.

59
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:17,945
Drinking and
eating garbage.

60
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,314
I'm glad we all took
a mental health day.

61
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,217
Hey, where'd everybody go?

62
00:02:23,252 --> 00:02:24,552
I don't know where they went,

63
00:02:24,587 --> 00:02:26,587
but someone's got
to pay this check.

64
00:02:26,622 --> 00:02:29,557
Damn it. They left without me,
and now I'm stuck with the bill?

65
00:02:29,592 --> 00:02:32,560
Man, who do those guys think
I am, Mark Zuckerbrothers?

66
00:02:32,595 --> 00:02:34,428
Seems like they
do that a lot.

67
00:02:34,463 --> 00:02:36,463
Tell you what,
this one's on me.

68
00:02:36,499 --> 00:02:37,631
Thanks, Jerome.

69
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:38,732
Since there's
no one here,

70
00:02:38,768 --> 00:02:40,301
do you mind
turning the TV up?

71
00:02:40,336 --> 00:02:43,304
That little Lamisil guy
always makes me laugh.

72
00:02:43,339 --> 00:02:45,639
(laughs)
Yeah.

73
00:02:49,178 --> 00:02:50,811
What do you think he is,
like a Martian?

74
00:02:50,847 --> 00:02:52,179
Like a little
shoe Martian?

75
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:53,514
I don't know.

76
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:55,749
I just hope he ain't
down there in my shoes.

77
00:02:55,785 --> 00:02:57,084
No, he's loud.

78
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:59,453
If he were down there,
we'd know it.

79
00:02:59,488 --> 00:03:02,189
I ain't got
no toenails nohow.

80
00:03:06,162 --> 00:03:08,596
Hey, everybody,
guess what.

81
00:03:08,631 --> 00:03:11,165
I'm running for
homecoming king!

82
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,200
You're what?

83
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:13,834
Yeah. Neil nominated me.

84
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,103
Why are you home
from school and Meg's not?

85
00:03:16,138 --> 00:03:17,771
(gasps)
Has she taken a lover?

86
00:03:17,807 --> 00:03:20,541
Well, the voting is tomorrow,
so I've got to write my speech.

87
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:23,978
Luckily, "Chris Griffin"
rhymes with "homecoming king,"

88
00:03:24,013 --> 00:03:26,013
so I've got my opening line.

89
00:03:27,149 --> 00:03:28,315
Oh, my God.

90
00:03:28,351 --> 00:03:30,117
Did you see how
excited he is?

91
00:03:30,152 --> 00:03:31,285
Yeah, isn't that great?

92
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,887
No, it's not great.

93
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:35,289
Chris is not
homecoming king material.

94
00:03:35,324 --> 00:03:37,024
He doesn't have a
chance of winning.

95
00:03:37,059 --> 00:03:38,626
We got to be at
that school tomorrow

96
00:03:38,661 --> 00:03:40,227
to help pick up the
pieces when he loses.

97
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:41,328
(bell dings)

98
00:03:41,364 --> 00:03:42,396
Oh, my Hot Pocket!

99
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:45,266
Ow, it's hot!

100
00:03:49,672 --> 00:03:50,672
(horn honking)

101
00:03:50,706 --> 00:03:52,406
Oh, that must be Jerome.

102
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:53,674
What the hell
is Jerome doing here?

103
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:55,042
We didn't order any drinks.

104
00:03:55,077 --> 00:03:56,977
No, he and I got plans.

105
00:03:57,013 --> 00:03:58,812
We're gonna go down
to Carver High School

106
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:01,015
and look at that mural
of black achievement.

107
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,052
Mm, they got a manila folder
taped over Dr. Cosby's face.

108
00:04:05,087 --> 00:04:06,887
What? Cleveland,
you didn't tell us

109
00:04:06,923 --> 00:04:08,656
you had plans with Jerome.

110
00:04:08,691 --> 00:04:10,157
Some things are
my business.

111
00:04:10,192 --> 00:04:12,493
You don't tell me when
you play with yourself.

112
00:04:12,528 --> 00:04:13,928
Well, if you checked
my Twitter feed,

113
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:15,529
I wouldn't have to.

114
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:25,105
(applause)

115
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:27,074
And if you elect me,
I will be as good

116
00:04:27,109 --> 00:04:29,743
a homecoming king
as a touchdown.

117
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:31,345
(applause)

118
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,013
And our final nominee

119
00:04:33,049 --> 00:04:35,416
for homecoming king
is Chris Griffin.

120
00:04:35,451 --> 00:04:36,884
(weak clapping)

121
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:38,052
(microphone feedback)

122
00:04:38,087 --> 00:04:39,386
Thank you.

123
00:04:39,422 --> 00:04:40,854
I'm Chris Griffin.

124
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,924
Webster's dictionary
defines "smegma" as

125
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,859
"a sebaceous,
cheese-like substance

126
00:04:45,895 --> 00:04:48,128
around the head of the penis."

127
00:04:48,164 --> 00:04:50,698
But what is a "king"?

128
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:52,700
Oh, God,
this is already hard to watch.

129
00:04:52,735 --> 00:04:55,903
Like that<i> Bourne</i> movie where
they couldn't get Matt Damon.

130
00:04:55,938 --> 00:04:58,472
We're facing a biochemical
attack of untold proportions.

131
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:00,240
Unfortunately,
Jason Bourne is not available.

132
00:05:00,276 --> 00:05:01,875
Who have we got?

133
00:05:01,911 --> 00:05:04,078
We have the sixth-billed
guy from<i> The Avengers.</i>

134
00:05:04,113 --> 00:05:05,980
The arrow guy
who frowns a lot.

135
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:07,214
Uh, okay.

136
00:05:07,249 --> 00:05:08,615
Does he look
like Bourne?

137
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:10,050
Yeah, yeah.

138
00:05:10,086 --> 00:05:11,919
He sort of looks
like a young Popeye.

139
00:05:11,954 --> 00:05:13,954
Well, sounds like he's
the right guy for this.

140
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,757
Yeah... yeah.

141
00:05:16,792 --> 00:05:18,759
All right, students.
The votes have been tabulated,

142
00:05:18,794 --> 00:05:21,996
so if you could all look up
from your phones for a minute,

143
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:23,497
I'll tell you who won.

144
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:27,735
Children.
A man is talking.

145
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,103
All right, I better
head down there.

146
00:05:29,138 --> 00:05:30,671
I brought a bag
of marshmallows

147
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:32,006
and a belt for
Chris to bite on

148
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,640
during his meltdown.

149
00:05:33,676 --> 00:05:37,678
And this year's James Woods High
homecoming king is...

150
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:39,113
Chris Griffin.

151
00:05:39,148 --> 00:05:40,681
Yay!

152
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:43,517
(laughing):
Yay!

153
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:44,985
Holy crap!

154
00:05:45,021 --> 00:05:47,121
I don't believe it.
Chris won!

155
00:05:47,156 --> 00:05:49,656
All right, now it's time
for these four poor kids

156
00:05:49,692 --> 00:05:51,859
to thank you for
subsidizing their lunches.

157
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:53,627
ALL:
Thank you.

158
00:05:53,662 --> 00:05:55,162
Mean it.

159
00:05:55,197 --> 00:05:56,497
ALL:
Thank you.

160
00:05:56,532 --> 00:05:57,798
All right.

161
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,133
Time for my car nap.

162
00:06:05,806 --> 00:06:07,760
Hey, hey, hey,
there he is!

163
00:06:07,761 --> 00:06:08,827
The new king!

164
00:06:08,862 --> 00:06:10,662
I already called
and quit my job.

165
00:06:10,697 --> 00:06:12,831
Peter, he doesn't get money
for being homecoming king.

166
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:14,098
Does he get land?

167
00:06:14,134 --> 00:06:15,333
No, of course not.

168
00:06:15,368 --> 00:06:16,634
Does he get this joke?

169
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,770
"Shagadelic, baby!"

170
00:06:18,805 --> 00:06:20,472
Austin Powers!

171
00:06:20,507 --> 00:06:23,007
Oh, very good.
Very good, my liege.

172
00:06:23,043 --> 00:06:25,109
Well, Chris, since
you're royalty now,

173
00:06:25,145 --> 00:06:26,344
I made your favorites.

174
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:27,579
Dinner for breakfast?

175
00:06:27,614 --> 00:06:28,813
That's right.

176
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:30,815
Pork chops
and French onion soup.

177
00:06:30,851 --> 00:06:32,183
Oh, boy!

178
00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:34,419
Well, as king,
I shall eat this breakfast

179
00:06:34,454 --> 00:06:37,422
on a tray in front
of<i> Wheel of Fortune.</i>

180
00:06:37,457 --> 00:06:40,458
I'll get the TV tray,
Your Majesty.

181
00:06:40,494 --> 00:06:42,827
How does nobody see what's going
on with this Chris thing?

182
00:06:42,863 --> 00:06:44,095
What are you talking about?

183
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,663
Well, it's obvious.

184
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:47,632
The only reason they
elected him king

185
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:50,034
is because they're gonna
prank him at homecoming.

186
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,836
Shut up, Hat.
That's my brother.

187
00:06:51,872 --> 00:06:53,471
They're not gonna mess with him.
He's the man.

188
00:06:53,507 --> 00:06:56,007
He's got real Griffin beef
in those trousers.

189
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:57,542
Meg, how can you be so sure?

190
00:06:57,577 --> 00:06:59,277
Because this kind of stuff
happens all the time

191
00:06:59,312 --> 00:07:00,678
to unpopular kids.

192
00:07:00,714 --> 00:07:02,280
They're just trying
to embarrass him

193
00:07:02,315 --> 00:07:03,715
and make him look stupid.

194
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,183
You don't really think
they're going to pull

195
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:06,484
a prank on Chris,
do you?

196
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,986
I don't know,
but if they are,

197
00:07:08,021 --> 00:07:09,787
we got to get down to that
school and talk 'em out of it.

198
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,055
Good idea.

199
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:12,290
And luckily,
I'm great at connecting

200
00:07:12,325 --> 00:07:13,825
with that generation.

201
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,828
Like when I went on that
campout with One Direction.

202
00:07:16,863 --> 00:07:18,796
So they checked
into their hotel suite,

203
00:07:18,832 --> 00:07:21,065
but the minibar
had no sparkling water.

204
00:07:21,101 --> 00:07:22,367
Only still.

205
00:07:22,402 --> 00:07:23,568
(all gasp)

206
00:07:23,603 --> 00:07:25,003
Ah, stop. It's too scary.

207
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:26,671
Oh, but that's not all.

208
00:07:26,706 --> 00:07:27,972
They looked
in the wardrobe

209
00:07:28,008 --> 00:07:29,741
and discovered
that the stylist

210
00:07:29,776 --> 00:07:31,543
had only brought
non-skinny jeans!

211
00:07:31,578 --> 00:07:33,011
(all gasp)

212
00:07:33,046 --> 00:07:35,179
Do mean like a
Levi's 513 skinny straight?

213
00:07:35,215 --> 00:07:37,348
No. Just regular
pants that fit normal!

214
00:07:37,384 --> 00:07:38,816
(all gasp)

215
00:07:38,852 --> 00:07:41,019
That's not real, right?
Those aren't real?

216
00:07:41,054 --> 00:07:42,754
Of course not, Louis.
It's-it's just a story.

217
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:44,689
Well, I guess that means
these aren't real!

218
00:07:44,724 --> 00:07:46,024
(screaming)

219
00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:47,659
Yeah, they're gonna die
in the woods.

220
00:07:47,694 --> 00:07:49,193
Simon, are they tagged?

221
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:50,395
They're tagged, right?

222
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,263
Oh, they're tagged.
Good.

223
00:07:52,299 --> 00:07:53,865
Simon, did I ever
tell you the one

224
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,166
about the
loose-fitting T-shirt?

225
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:58,102
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no...

226
00:08:02,142 --> 00:08:03,441
All right,
if we want Cleveland

227
00:08:03,476 --> 00:08:05,116
to stop spending
all his time with Jerome,

228
00:08:05,145 --> 00:08:06,578
we got to remind him
how much fun<i> we</i> are.

229
00:08:06,613 --> 00:08:07,845
So let's just have fun.

230
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:09,047
How do we do that?

231
00:08:09,082 --> 00:08:10,248
I don't know.

232
00:08:10,283 --> 00:08:12,183
Little bit of this.

233
00:08:12,218 --> 00:08:13,918
Okay.
That seems like fun.

234
00:08:13,954 --> 00:08:15,520
What about one of these?

235
00:08:15,555 --> 00:08:16,921
Yeah, sure.
There's no wrong moves.

236
00:08:16,957 --> 00:08:18,890
What if I brush
my shoulders off?

237
00:08:18,925 --> 00:08:21,626
Original ideas
are preferred, but sure.

238
00:08:21,661 --> 00:08:24,395
Three fun guys,
room for four.

239
00:08:24,431 --> 00:08:25,563
I don't know if
it's working, Peter.

240
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,731
I don't know
if it's fun.

241
00:08:26,766 --> 00:08:28,533
It's more than fun,
it's "foon."

242
00:08:28,568 --> 00:08:30,201
That's a fun way
to say "fun."

243
00:08:30,236 --> 00:08:32,904
Hey, how foon would it be
if we waved sticks around?

244
00:08:32,939 --> 00:08:34,806
I-I really don't know
what we're doing.

245
00:08:34,841 --> 00:08:36,441
It's foon,
from the word before.

246
00:08:36,476 --> 00:08:38,309
I don't see what's...
(yells)

247
00:08:38,345 --> 00:08:41,112
All right, first,
let's take your blood pressure,

248
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:42,614
'cause that's-that's
like our favorite thing

249
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:44,415
to do around here.

250
00:08:47,954 --> 00:08:50,321
Okay, we all know how much
Cleveland loves<i> Tecmo Bowl,</i>

251
00:08:50,357 --> 00:08:51,723
so let's start playing.

252
00:08:51,758 --> 00:08:52,957
I'm the Raiders.
I'm Bo Jackson.

253
00:08:52,993 --> 00:08:54,459
And hopefully,
he'll show up.

254
00:08:54,494 --> 00:08:56,260
That's no fair.
Bo Jackson's too fast.

255
00:08:56,296 --> 00:08:58,296
Guys, do we want
Cleveland back or don't...

256
00:08:58,331 --> 00:08:59,497
Uhp, here we go.

257
00:08:59,532 --> 00:09:01,933
PETER (laughs):
Bye-bye.

258
00:09:01,968 --> 00:09:03,167
QUAGMIRE:
See, Peter? He's too fast.

259
00:09:03,203 --> 00:09:04,569
PETER: You got to tackle me.
It's "B."

260
00:09:04,604 --> 00:09:06,070
You got to press "B."

261
00:09:06,106 --> 00:09:07,772
QUAGMIRE:
I'm pressing "B." He's too fast.

262
00:09:07,807 --> 00:09:09,340
PETER:
Going over here.

263
00:09:09,376 --> 00:09:10,675
Going over here now.

264
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,909
Never get tired.

265
00:09:11,945 --> 00:09:14,112
JOE:
Change your guy, Quagmire.

266
00:09:14,147 --> 00:09:15,313
Change your guy.

267
00:09:15,348 --> 00:09:16,581
QUAGMIRE: I'm trying.
Peter's cheating.

268
00:09:16,616 --> 00:09:17,949
You're cheating, Peter.

269
00:09:17,984 --> 00:09:19,183
PETER: I'm not cheating.
I'm following the rules.

270
00:09:19,219 --> 00:09:20,618
I'm just really good.

271
00:09:20,654 --> 00:09:22,954
QUAGMIRE: You're not really good.
You just got Bo Jackson.

272
00:09:22,989 --> 00:09:25,957
JOE: Bo Jackson also played
professional baseball.

273
00:09:25,992 --> 00:09:27,925
QUAGMIRE: Shut up, Joe.
Everybody knows that.

274
00:09:27,961 --> 00:09:29,127
JOE:
Kansas City.

275
00:09:29,162 --> 00:09:30,261
Royals.

276
00:09:30,296 --> 00:09:32,130
PETER: Can't stop.
Won't stop.

277
00:09:32,165 --> 00:09:36,801
Bo... might...
go... all... the...

278
00:09:36,836 --> 00:09:38,636
Nope, going back
the other way.

279
00:09:38,672 --> 00:09:40,505
QUAGMIRE: What? Are you going backwards?
Just score.

280
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,340
PETER: Nah, I'm gonna run
out the quarter.

281
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,475
QUAGMIRE: I'm not playing now.
My controller's down.

282
00:09:44,511 --> 00:09:46,377
PETER (quietly): Seems like your controller's
been down the whole time.

283
00:09:46,413 --> 00:09:49,347
JOE: Who's Veris?
You gotta switch off Veris.

284
00:09:49,382 --> 00:09:51,549
Get it to Ronnie Lott.

285
00:09:51,584 --> 00:09:54,385
Pretty much anyone
but Veris.

286
00:09:54,421 --> 00:09:57,155
PETER: Oh, no, I'm all the
way back here now.

287
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,223
I'm in my own end zone.
What am I doing?

288
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:00,958
Too bad I'm not
Bo Jackson.

289
00:10:00,994 --> 00:10:02,193
Oh, wait. I am!

290
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:03,528
QUAGMIRE:
Ridiculous.

291
00:10:03,563 --> 00:10:05,296
PETER:
Oh, yeah.

292
00:10:05,331 --> 00:10:06,731
There you go,
Quagmire.

293
00:10:06,766 --> 00:10:07,999
You're about
to tackle me.

294
00:10:08,034 --> 00:10:09,300
But then...

295
00:10:09,335 --> 00:10:11,335
QUAGMIRE:
Damn it!

296
00:10:11,371 --> 00:10:12,470
JOE:
Less than a minute.

297
00:10:12,505 --> 00:10:13,805
QUAGMIRE:
Shut up, Joe!

298
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,972
JOE:
He's gonna do it.

299
00:10:15,008 --> 00:10:16,240
He might do this.

300
00:10:16,276 --> 00:10:17,408
I don't know, a
lot of football

301
00:10:17,444 --> 00:10:18,576
still to be
played here.

302
00:10:18,611 --> 00:10:19,844
QUAGMIRE:
I'm hitting reset.

303
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:21,179
PETER: Don't you dare
hit reset.

304
00:10:21,214 --> 00:10:22,513
You hit reset, you're
banned for life.

305
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:23,715
QUAGMIRE: 
I hate this.

306
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,183
Joe, do you want to play?

307
00:10:25,218 --> 00:10:27,151
JOE: Nah, I like being
this guy.

308
00:10:27,187 --> 00:10:29,687
PETER: A zig. A zag.
A touchdown!

309
00:10:29,723 --> 00:10:31,989
Yeah!

310
00:10:32,025 --> 00:10:33,324
♪ I won the game ♪

311
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:34,926
♪ And now I'm gonna jump ♪

312
00:10:34,961 --> 00:10:36,360
♪ Bo Jackson! ♪

313
00:10:38,131 --> 00:10:39,731
All right, if we want
to get Cleveland back,

314
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:41,733
we should just put out
his favorite snack:

315
00:10:41,768 --> 00:10:43,234
an open can of tuna.

316
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:46,104
Often he'll come running
when he hears a can opening.

317
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:47,772
Peter, stop.

318
00:10:47,807 --> 00:10:49,407
Yeah, I think it's
time we addressed

319
00:10:49,442 --> 00:10:51,008
the elephant
in the room.

320
00:10:51,044 --> 00:10:52,410
There's a simple reason

321
00:10:52,445 --> 00:10:54,946
Cleveland is hanging out
with Jerome and not us.

322
00:10:54,981 --> 00:10:56,848
Jerome is black
and we're not.

323
00:10:56,883 --> 00:10:58,216
Yeah, I mean,
you can't blame him.

324
00:10:58,251 --> 00:10:59,951
It's just a thing
they have in common.

325
00:10:59,986 --> 00:11:01,352
Something they can bond over.

326
00:11:01,387 --> 00:11:02,954
Well, I guess
that makes sense.

327
00:11:02,989 --> 00:11:05,089
I suppose people do want
to be with their own kind.

328
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:08,092
Like the audience at a
Decemberists concert.

329
00:11:08,128 --> 00:11:09,927
Good evening,
white guys who weigh less

330
00:11:09,963 --> 00:11:11,596
than their girlfriends.

331
00:11:11,631 --> 00:11:13,798
(cheering)

332
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,437
(indistinct chatter)

333
00:11:19,472 --> 00:11:21,038
God, a lot
of gym teacher

334
00:11:21,074 --> 00:11:22,974
suicide memorials
in this place.

335
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:24,709
All right, let's find
the coolest kids here,

336
00:11:24,744 --> 00:11:26,811
and see if they know anything
about a prank on Chris.

337
00:11:26,846 --> 00:11:29,046
Those chicks in the
skirts look pretty cool.

338
00:11:29,082 --> 00:11:31,616
Hey there.
Brian Rockwell.

339
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:33,317
This is my friend,
Stewie Goldberg.

340
00:11:33,353 --> 00:11:34,719
What?

341
00:11:34,754 --> 00:11:35,987
I don't know my way
around the school,

342
00:11:36,022 --> 00:11:37,121
so I figured I'd get the deets

343
00:11:37,157 --> 00:11:38,222
from a couple of seniors.

344
00:11:38,258 --> 00:11:39,457
Download me.

345
00:11:39,492 --> 00:11:41,058
Brian-- it's not
Goldberg, by the way--

346
00:11:41,094 --> 00:11:42,226
we should ask
about the prank.

347
00:11:42,262 --> 00:11:43,761
I'm earning their trust.

348
00:11:43,797 --> 00:11:44,996
Hey, uh, I'm new here,

349
00:11:45,031 --> 00:11:46,564
but you know what'd be crazy?

350
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:47,899
If me, a guy,

351
00:11:47,934 --> 00:11:49,967
went in the girls' room
with you two.

352
00:11:50,003 --> 00:11:52,270
(laughing): I mean, that would be,
that would be so wild.

353
00:11:52,305 --> 00:11:54,071
We should, we should
totally just go in there.

354
00:11:54,107 --> 00:11:55,306
Brian, stop.

355
00:11:55,341 --> 00:11:56,474
That'd be hilarious.

356
00:11:56,509 --> 00:11:57,675
I'm in.

357
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,076
Stewie, go wait
in the car.

358
00:11:59,112 --> 00:12:00,912
No, we are here to get
information about Chris.

359
00:12:00,947 --> 00:12:03,014
I said, go wait
in the (bleep) car.

360
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:08,853
They had security guards
in the bathroom.

361
00:12:08,888 --> 00:12:12,156
We-we live in such
a culture of fear now.

362
00:12:14,661 --> 00:12:16,194
(knocking)

363
00:12:16,229 --> 00:12:18,763
Hey, guys, what are
you doing here?

364
00:12:18,798 --> 00:12:20,498
And why are you
dressed like that?

365
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:22,366
Well, we realized you like
hanging out with Jerome

366
00:12:22,402 --> 00:12:23,835
because he's black,

367
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,504
so we wanted you to know
we can be black guys, too.

368
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:29,507
Yeah, in fact, we can even
be famous movie black guys.

369
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:30,775
I'm Bagger Vance.

370
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,543
I also am
Bagger Vance.

371
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:34,645
I'm Kazaam from<i> Kazaam.</i>

372
00:12:34,681 --> 00:12:36,214
You really think
I'm only hanging out

373
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:38,049
with Jerome 'cause he's black?

374
00:12:38,084 --> 00:12:41,219
I hang out with Jerome because,
unlike some people,

375
00:12:41,254 --> 00:12:43,788
he actually takes
an interest in my life.

376
00:12:43,823 --> 00:12:45,623
And he would never
stick me with the bill

377
00:12:45,658 --> 00:12:47,758
by walking out
on me at the Clam.

378
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:51,662
Well, we could have come over
and graciously apologized,

379
00:12:51,698 --> 00:12:53,231
but we took a chance.

380
00:12:53,266 --> 00:12:55,333
That's what I like about us.

381
00:13:00,373 --> 00:13:02,073
Sucks we didn't find
out what kind of prank

382
00:13:02,108 --> 00:13:03,407
they're gonna
pull on Chris.

383
00:13:03,443 --> 00:13:05,009
I know that book
is<i> The Hunger Games</i>

384
00:13:05,044 --> 00:13:06,344
with the cover taken off.

385
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:08,145
Oh, look, something on TV.

386
00:13:08,181 --> 00:13:11,182
And finally, tonight, a moving
story from James Woods High,

387
00:13:11,217 --> 00:13:14,418
where the student body has made
their homecoming a special event

388
00:13:14,454 --> 00:13:16,587
for a very special boy.

389
00:13:16,623 --> 00:13:18,189
And this year's James Woods High

390
00:13:18,224 --> 00:13:21,859
homecoming king is
Chris Griffin.

391
00:13:21,895 --> 00:13:23,928
Yay!

392
00:13:23,963 --> 00:13:26,397
(laughing):
Yay!

393
00:13:26,432 --> 00:13:27,832
TOM:
That's right. Chris Griffin,

394
00:13:27,867 --> 00:13:30,201
a tubby spaz
with a heart full of dreams,

395
00:13:30,236 --> 00:13:32,203
gets to feel normal for a night,

396
00:13:32,238 --> 00:13:34,405
thanks to the kindness
of his peers.

397
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,241
BOTH:
Oh.

398
00:13:37,277 --> 00:13:38,609
I just see him
walking around

399
00:13:38,645 --> 00:13:40,411
with his hands down
his pants all day,

400
00:13:40,446 --> 00:13:42,213
and he's just so
fat and weird,

401
00:13:42,248 --> 00:13:43,948
so we feel bad.

402
00:13:43,983 --> 00:13:47,585
Yeah, last year we did the burnt
up kid, so this was a slam dunk.

403
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,787
Oh, my God, they just
elected him out of pity,

404
00:13:49,822 --> 00:13:51,622
because they think he's
mentally challenged.

405
00:13:51,658 --> 00:13:54,258
Kind of like we did
with George W. Bush.

406
00:13:54,294 --> 00:13:56,460
(chuckling):
Huh? Right?

407
00:13:56,496 --> 00:13:59,130
(sighs) I-I guess.
I guess, Brian.

408
00:13:59,165 --> 00:14:00,564
I-I don't--
I don't know.

409
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,160
Let's-let's just watch
some commercials.

410
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,342
Well, that explains it.

411
00:14:08,377 --> 00:14:09,776
The only reason Chris
is homecoming king

412
00:14:09,812 --> 00:14:11,778
is that all the other
kids feel sorry for him.

413
00:14:11,814 --> 00:14:13,013
Do you think he knows?

414
00:14:13,048 --> 00:14:14,181
I can't imagine.

415
00:14:14,216 --> 00:14:15,415
And we can't tell him.

416
00:14:15,451 --> 00:14:16,717
It would destroy him.

417
00:14:16,752 --> 00:14:19,353
(imitating trumpet fanfare)

418
00:14:19,388 --> 00:14:20,554
Look away!

419
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:23,023
No one may meet
the king's gaze.

420
00:14:23,058 --> 00:14:24,524
So, uh, hey,

421
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,693
congratulations
again on that, uh,

422
00:14:26,729 --> 00:14:28,095
homecoming thing.

423
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,696
Why congratulate
me on a right

424
00:14:29,732 --> 00:14:31,631
and natural
turn of events?

425
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:32,966
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

426
00:14:33,001 --> 00:14:34,434
I shall select
three things

427
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,970
from Stewie's room
that I wish to be mine.

428
00:14:37,005 --> 00:14:39,473
There's a book in there
on how to eat healthy.

429
00:14:39,508 --> 00:14:41,641
Why don't you take that,
you fat bitch?

430
00:14:41,677 --> 00:14:44,077
Well, he obviously doesn't
know it's just a pity vote.

431
00:14:44,113 --> 00:14:46,046
In fact, this whole
homecoming king thing

432
00:14:46,081 --> 00:14:48,148
seems to have just gone
straight to his head.

433
00:14:48,183 --> 00:14:50,117
I know, he's acting like
an arrogant jerk.

434
00:14:50,152 --> 00:14:51,618
Quiet, Rupert!

435
00:14:51,653 --> 00:14:53,787
It is an honor to serve
the king in this manner.

436
00:14:53,822 --> 00:14:54,988
Brian, this can't go on.

437
00:14:55,023 --> 00:14:56,723
Chris is out of control.

438
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:59,593
He's even more arrogant
than an actor/writer/director.

439
00:14:59,628 --> 00:15:02,262
Well, my script is brilliant,
and I'm a great director.

440
00:15:02,297 --> 00:15:06,032
The question is,
how bad do I want this part?

441
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:10,170
(crying):
Okay, I'll do it.

442
00:15:14,877 --> 00:15:16,009
Well, now we know.

443
00:15:16,044 --> 00:15:18,111
Neither of us
likes crepes.

444
00:15:18,147 --> 00:15:20,580
See, that's another thing
we got in common.

445
00:15:20,616 --> 00:15:22,649
In fact, you want
to hear something crazy?

446
00:15:22,684 --> 00:15:25,585
Peter and the fellas think that
you and I only hang out together

447
00:15:25,621 --> 00:15:27,187
because we're both black.

448
00:15:27,222 --> 00:15:28,455
Uh-huh.

449
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,123
But I told them
that's insulting.

450
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:31,425
Why is that insulting?

451
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,993
People like to be
with their own.

452
00:15:33,028 --> 00:15:35,095
I mean, you don't think I
hang out with you because

453
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,864
of your endless stories about
working your remote control

454
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,868
or your fat son or how you once
made a dog shake its head "no"?

455
00:15:41,904 --> 00:15:45,305
I manipulated the
cheeseburger what like this.

456
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,873
You boring, man.

457
00:15:46,909 --> 00:15:48,508
But you're black,
so we cool.

458
00:15:48,544 --> 00:15:50,677
That's racist.
I'm offended.

459
00:15:50,712 --> 00:15:51,978
Whatever.

460
00:15:52,014 --> 00:15:53,647
I'll see you around,
Cleveland.

461
00:15:53,682 --> 00:15:57,684
Man, I guess this whole
friendship was a bad idea.

462
00:15:57,719 --> 00:16:00,887
Just like Goodyear's
advertising strategy.

463
00:16:00,923 --> 00:16:02,889
All right, we have $14 million
to play with.

464
00:16:02,925 --> 00:16:04,791
I say we spend it all on blimps,

465
00:16:04,827 --> 00:16:06,126
'cause who do we want to reach?

466
00:16:06,161 --> 00:16:07,861
Drivers.

467
00:16:07,896 --> 00:16:09,629
And where are people looking
when they're driving a car?

468
00:16:09,665 --> 00:16:11,164
Straight up.

469
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:18,038
Squire, my chamber pot
needs emptying.

470
00:16:18,073 --> 00:16:19,406
What's he talking about?

471
00:16:19,441 --> 00:16:20,974
He's been pooping
in the waffle iron.

472
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:22,075
Just plug it in
and close it.

473
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,376
It'll burn off.

474
00:16:23,412 --> 00:16:24,578
Look, Chris.

475
00:16:24,613 --> 00:16:25,712
You know, being
homecoming king

476
00:16:25,747 --> 00:16:28,081
doesn't mean you can
just start acting crazy.

477
00:16:28,116 --> 00:16:29,916
I can do whatever I want.

478
00:16:29,952 --> 00:16:33,253
I've been acknowledged
by my peers as their superior.

479
00:16:33,288 --> 00:16:35,388
You're just jealous 'cause
you've never done anything

480
00:16:35,424 --> 00:16:37,324
that deserves
being elected king.

481
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:38,892
Okay, you want
to know the truth?

482
00:16:38,927 --> 00:16:40,894
They only picked you
because they felt sorry for you.

483
00:16:40,929 --> 00:16:42,162
Sorry?

484
00:16:42,197 --> 00:16:43,763
Why would they
feel sorry for me?

485
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:46,433
Well, because they all think
you're a, um, you know,

486
00:16:46,468 --> 00:16:50,270
"groundskeeper at a public
institution" kind of guy.

487
00:16:50,305 --> 00:16:51,404
A what?

488
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,707
A dope.
An idiot. A water head.

489
00:16:53,742 --> 00:16:56,276
You guys don't know
what you're talking about.

490
00:16:56,311 --> 00:16:58,912
Tonight, when they put
that crown on my head,

491
00:16:58,947 --> 00:17:01,381
it's gonna be the
greatest night of my life.

492
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:04,718
Even better than when
I had my first kiss.

493
00:17:11,593 --> 00:17:13,960
(phone buzzes)

494
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,867
("True" by Spandau Ballet
playing)

495
00:17:28,644 --> 00:17:30,377
I say, we were a
little hard on Chris,

496
00:17:30,412 --> 00:17:31,745
but I'm glad we came.

497
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,280
He's still my brother.

498
00:17:33,315 --> 00:17:34,981
Hey, look, there's
the security guard

499
00:17:35,017 --> 00:17:36,657
that threw me out
of the bathroom earlier.

500
00:17:36,685 --> 00:17:38,318
And he's here
with his wife.

501
00:17:38,353 --> 00:17:40,453
This is like
a date for them.

502
00:17:40,489 --> 00:17:43,123
Good evening,
fingerers and fingerees.

503
00:17:43,158 --> 00:17:44,991
Sorry,
I had a little rum in the car.

504
00:17:45,027 --> 00:17:48,094
Anyway, please welcome your
homecoming king, Chris Griffin.

505
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,596
(applause)

506
00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:54,234
Good evening, subjects.

507
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:58,238
The boys' showers shall run red
with the blood of my enemies.

508
00:17:58,273 --> 00:17:59,606
We believe in you!

509
00:17:59,641 --> 00:18:00,607
Good for you, Chris!

510
00:18:00,642 --> 00:18:01,808
No one clap too loud.

511
00:18:01,843 --> 00:18:03,643
We don't want
to frighten him.

512
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,145
Wait a minute.

513
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,279
And now your queen,

514
00:18:06,315 --> 00:18:08,081
prom night car crash victim

515
00:18:08,116 --> 00:18:09,950
Kathleen Fitzpatrick.

516
00:18:11,853 --> 00:18:12,953
ALL:
Aw.

517
00:18:12,988 --> 00:18:14,487
We miss you, Kathleen!

518
00:18:14,523 --> 00:18:16,156
You're heaven's queen now!

519
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,591
BRIAN:
Wow, she was hot.

520
00:18:17,626 --> 00:18:19,759
The queen is a dead girl?

521
00:18:19,795 --> 00:18:21,528
What does that make me?

522
00:18:21,563 --> 00:18:23,663
(gasps)
Brian and Stewie were right.

523
00:18:23,699 --> 00:18:25,532
This was a pity vote.

524
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:26,967
We love you, Chris!

525
00:18:27,002 --> 00:18:28,335
You love me?

526
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,270
You don't even know
anything about me.

527
00:18:30,305 --> 00:18:33,239
You just voted for me
to make yourselves feel better.

528
00:18:35,877 --> 00:18:38,545
She was on PCP that night,
you idiots!

529
00:18:45,554 --> 00:18:48,054
Chris, I-I'm so sorry.

530
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,222
That's okay.

531
00:18:49,257 --> 00:18:50,991
You guys tried
to warn me.

532
00:18:51,026 --> 00:18:52,692
I'm sorry I was
such a jerk.

533
00:18:52,728 --> 00:18:53,827
Ah, don't worry about it.

534
00:18:53,862 --> 00:18:54,894
Are you okay?

535
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,731
You know what?
I am.

536
00:18:57,766 --> 00:18:59,165
I may not be king,

537
00:18:59,201 --> 00:19:01,501
but I learned
I don't need anyone's pity.

538
00:19:01,536 --> 00:19:02,869
That's the spirit, Chris.

539
00:19:02,904 --> 00:19:04,838
And, hey, you're not
the homecoming king,

540
00:19:04,873 --> 00:19:07,340
but you'll always
be my brother.

541
00:19:07,376 --> 00:19:08,642
Thanks, Stewie.

542
00:19:08,677 --> 00:19:10,176
It means a lot
to me to know

543
00:19:10,212 --> 00:19:13,013
I've always got my family
looking out for me.

544
00:19:13,048 --> 00:19:14,814
Oh, hey, Chris.

545
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,583
This is Tyler.

546
00:19:16,618 --> 00:19:19,252
Don't make this weird now.

547
00:19:19,287 --> 00:19:21,688
(laughs)
Oh, what a gentleman.

548
00:19:29,564 --> 00:19:31,731
Well, Cleveland, it's good
to have you back, buddy.

549
00:19:31,767 --> 00:19:33,133
It's good to be back.

550
00:19:33,168 --> 00:19:34,534
Hanging with Jerome was fun,

551
00:19:34,569 --> 00:19:37,137
but my best friends are
right here in this room.

552
00:19:37,172 --> 00:19:39,205
Hey, to celebrate,
how about we play a little

553
00:19:39,241 --> 00:19:41,174
old-school<i> Double Dribble?</i>

554
00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:43,410
Okay, but no stupid-ass
shots from the corner,

555
00:19:43,445 --> 00:19:44,878
because that's a glitch
in the software and...

556
00:19:44,913 --> 00:19:46,112
Game on!

557
00:19:48,483 --> 00:19:51,451
All right, bring it up the
court, and corner three!

558
00:19:51,486 --> 00:19:53,620
CLEVELAND: No, no. That's what
I'm talking about!

559
00:19:53,655 --> 00:19:55,121
PETER:
Steal.

560
00:19:55,157 --> 00:19:58,058
Uhp, corner three.

561
00:19:58,093 --> 00:19:59,093
CLEVELAND:
All right, here we go.

562
00:19:59,127 --> 00:20:00,527
I got something cooking.

563
00:20:00,562 --> 00:20:02,529
PETER: Uhp, you dropped
something.

564
00:20:02,564 --> 00:20:04,197
Think I'll head over
in this direction.

565
00:20:04,232 --> 00:20:05,532
Corner three!

566
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:07,133
JOE: It's a rout.
It's a blowout.

567
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:08,768
CLEVELAND:
It's some bullcrap.

568
00:20:08,804 --> 00:20:10,937
JOE: Couple nice passes
there... hey!

569
00:20:10,972 --> 00:20:12,305
PETER:
See? Competitive ball game.

570
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,573
What should I do?

571
00:20:13,608 --> 00:20:14,808
Pass and then go up?

572
00:20:14,843 --> 00:20:17,577
And corner three!

573
00:20:17,612 --> 00:20:19,446
CLEVELAND: All right, 
enough of this mess.

574
00:20:19,481 --> 00:20:21,147
QUAGMIRE: Shoot it!
Shoot it from there.

575
00:20:21,183 --> 00:20:22,749
JOE:
The refs are lettin' 'em play.

576
00:20:22,784 --> 00:20:24,451
I do appreciate that.

577
00:20:24,486 --> 00:20:25,652
CLEVELAND: Yeah, that's what
I'm talkin' about.

578
00:20:25,687 --> 00:20:26,953
Now I'm playing
for reals.

579
00:20:26,988 --> 00:20:28,154
PETER: Yeah, you're
doing pretty good.

580
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,456
What play
should I call now?

581
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:31,291
Maybe... corner three!

582
00:20:31,326 --> 00:20:32,759
JOE:
He's hot. He is hot.

583
00:20:32,794 --> 00:20:34,427
Keep feeding that guy.

584
00:20:34,463 --> 00:20:36,296
PETER: Hi, nice to meet you.
Can I have that?

585
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:37,571
Hang out over here
for a second.

586
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:39,132
Corner three!

587
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:40,567
JOE: You got to get
out there, Cleveland.

588
00:20:40,602 --> 00:20:42,001
CLEVELAND:
I'm trying.

589
00:20:42,037 --> 00:20:44,270
He's taking advantage
of poor technology.

590
00:20:44,306 --> 00:20:45,839
PETER:
Oh, lot of dribbling. Swipe.

591
00:20:45,874 --> 00:20:47,841
Here we... aw,
I hit the wrong button.

592
00:20:47,876 --> 00:20:50,343
I think you all know I was
going for a corner three.
