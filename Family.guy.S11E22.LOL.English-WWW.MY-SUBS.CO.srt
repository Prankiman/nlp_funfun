Hey, Brian,
have you seen the remote?

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,601
I want to watch
The Weather Channel.

14
00:00:39,635 --> 00:00:41,135
There are tornados
in the Midwest,

15
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,904
and I like watching
poor people scramble

16
00:00:42,938 --> 00:00:44,339
to save
what little they have.

17
00:00:44,373 --> 00:00:45,974
Uh, I don't know
where the remote is.

18
00:00:46,008 --> 00:00:47,308
All right,
I'll find it myself.

19
00:00:49,311 --> 00:00:51,846
Oh, my God, my old harmonica!

20
00:00:51,881 --> 00:00:54,148
I'm gonna play this
really loud tonight

21
00:00:54,183 --> 00:00:56,584
to get back
at our Armenian neighbors.

22
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,387
Hey.

23
00:00:59,421 --> 00:01:00,788
Hey, looks like
a fun party.

24
00:01:00,823 --> 00:01:03,091
Um, hey, listen, it's
2:00 in the morning.

25
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:05,760
Uh, when is your five-year-old
gonna go to sleep?

26
00:01:05,794 --> 00:01:06,895
Soon, very soon.

27
00:01:06,929 --> 00:01:09,464
You want weird food
wrapped in weird leaves?

28
00:01:09,498 --> 00:01:11,132
Yeah, look, I'm guessing
there's some kind of

29
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:13,401
soccer match from your
home country going on,

30
00:01:13,435 --> 00:01:15,136
and I get that, I do.

31
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,472
But, uh, some of us
are trying to sleep,

32
00:01:17,506 --> 00:01:19,540
and I could almost
deal with the noise,

33
00:01:19,575 --> 00:01:21,876
but it's the
cologne, all right?

34
00:01:21,911 --> 00:01:24,879
I can smell it in my bed, and
I live two houses from here.

35
00:01:24,914 --> 00:01:27,548
That's how powerful
it is, okay?

36
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:28,850
That's how powerful it is.

37
00:01:28,884 --> 00:01:30,618
You like it?

38
00:01:30,653 --> 00:01:32,120
Yeah, I kind
of like it.

39
00:01:36,692 --> 00:01:38,259
Okay, so I know
you're a harmonica,

40
00:01:38,294 --> 00:01:40,295
but right now
you're a 40-year-old woman

41
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:42,163
with a good body
in a hotel pool.

42
00:01:42,197 --> 00:01:43,865
Hey, everybody, look at me.

43
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:46,534
I work out seven days a
for these five minutes.

44
00:01:46,568 --> 00:01:48,169
Your attention
is going to keep me

45
00:01:48,203 --> 00:01:49,771
from swallowing
a bottle of pills.

46
00:01:49,805 --> 00:01:51,940
Hey, everyone, I made brownies!

47
00:01:51,974 --> 00:01:53,207
I better hurry up.

48
00:01:53,242 --> 00:01:54,509
I'm gonna miss the show.

49
00:01:54,543 --> 00:01:56,511
What did I do?

50
00:01:56,545 --> 00:01:58,546
What did I do?

51
00:02:01,483 --> 00:02:03,685
I love brownie day.

52
00:02:06,722 --> 00:02:08,389
Hey, so, uh,

53
00:02:08,424 --> 00:02:10,625
I'm digging a hole
under the fence in the backyard.

54
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:11,960
Brian, you have a car.

55
00:02:11,994 --> 00:02:13,261
You don't have to escape.

56
00:02:13,295 --> 00:02:14,896
Just don't
say anything, okay?

57
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,398
Oh, you know what, hang on, I
left my harmonica in the tub.

58
00:02:17,433 --> 00:02:19,067
I think Peter's in there
taking a bath.

59
00:02:19,101 --> 00:02:20,802
Aah! Son of a bitch!

60
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:22,737
What the hell did
I just sit on?

61
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:24,906
Where is it?
Where's my harmonica?

62
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:25,974
It's not here!

63
00:02:26,008 --> 00:02:27,241
Peter, have you seen
Stewie's harmonica?

64
00:02:27,276 --> 00:02:28,376
It was in the tub.

65
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,511
Oh, my God, it
was in the tub,

66
00:02:30,546 --> 00:02:32,213
and now it's
in my butt!

67
00:02:32,247 --> 00:02:34,082
No!

68
00:02:34,116 --> 00:02:36,584
Stewie, Daddy needs
your tiny hands

69
00:02:36,618 --> 00:02:39,387
for a very
special project.

70
00:02:43,592 --> 00:02:46,060
Well, good heavens, that's
something, isn't it?

71
00:02:46,095 --> 00:02:48,162
By the way, Mr. Griffin,
regarding your X-rays,

72
00:02:48,197 --> 00:02:49,764
we're making a
coffee table book.

73
00:02:49,798 --> 00:02:51,232
Can you sign this
release, please?

74
00:02:51,266 --> 00:02:54,202
Okay, but first can we address
my husband's situation?

75
00:02:54,236 --> 00:02:56,070
Well, the harmonica's
up there pretty good.

76
00:02:56,105 --> 00:02:58,139
Unfortunately, removing
it would require

77
00:02:58,173 --> 00:02:59,640
a very expensive surgery

78
00:02:59,675 --> 00:03:02,143
that's not covered by your
T.G.I. Friday's gift card.

79
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:05,546
What was that?
I don't know,

80
00:03:05,581 --> 00:03:08,483
but suddenly it smells
like John Popper in here.

81
00:03:08,517 --> 00:03:10,518
That was me.
I got musical farts.

82
00:03:12,121 --> 00:03:14,622
Holy crap, this is awesome.

83
00:03:14,656 --> 00:03:16,324
I will not allow
this opportunity

84
00:03:16,358 --> 00:03:17,625
to go to waste.

85
00:03:21,463 --> 00:03:23,197
Hey, Lois, how
was your day?

86
00:03:23,232 --> 00:03:25,400
Terrible. I accidentally
backed over a kid

87
00:03:25,434 --> 00:03:27,402
in the grocery store
parking lot.

88
00:03:29,104 --> 00:03:30,671
Peter, I'm serious.

89
00:03:30,706 --> 00:03:32,974
I ran right over
the soft part of the face.

90
00:03:33,008 --> 00:03:34,542
I had to run away.

91
00:03:34,576 --> 00:03:36,944
I ditched the car
and jumped on a passing train.

92
00:03:40,983 --> 00:03:42,350
I was so scared.

93
00:03:42,384 --> 00:03:44,452
I didn't get off
until I was in the South.

94
00:03:47,356 --> 00:03:48,756
What'd you do today?

95
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,224
I pushed a boy
behind your car

96
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:52,393
so I could do all
this harmonica stuff.

97
00:03:55,764 --> 00:03:56,964
All right, Chris,

98
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:59,400
Meg loves to listen
to music when she sleeps.

99
00:03:59,435 --> 00:04:01,436
Let's see how she likes this.

100
00:04:03,172 --> 00:04:05,907
Uh, Dad, I don't think
that's how it works.

101
00:04:12,181 --> 00:04:14,749
This had nothing to do
with the harmonica.

102
00:04:18,787 --> 00:04:22,090
Everybody, brace yourselves,
'cause I have got big news.

103
00:04:22,124 --> 00:04:23,958
I have been selected
to be a contestant

104
00:04:23,992 --> 00:04:25,426
on <i>America's Got Talent!</i>

105
00:04:25,461 --> 00:04:28,129
And they're gonna fly us all
to America for the show!

106
00:04:28,163 --> 00:04:30,031
What?! Oh, my God!

107
00:04:30,065 --> 00:04:31,866
Finally, we make'a da dreams

108
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,534
come true in America!

109
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:35,369
I am gonna make
this family proud,

110
00:04:35,404 --> 00:04:36,671
and not just you guys,

111
00:04:36,705 --> 00:04:39,140
but that old painting
of my ancestor in the attic.

112
00:04:39,174 --> 00:04:41,109
I did it! I'm
gonna be on TV!

113
00:04:41,143 --> 00:04:42,543
Did you kill the others?

114
00:04:42,578 --> 00:04:44,212
I shan't!
You must.

115
00:04:44,246 --> 00:04:46,981
I'm gonna go talk to
the statue in the basement.

116
00:04:47,015 --> 00:04:48,549
Did you kill
the painting?

117
00:04:48,584 --> 00:04:50,651
This place is a nuthouse.

118
00:04:56,325 --> 00:04:58,459
Yo, welcome back
to <i>America's Got Talent!</i>

119
00:04:58,494 --> 00:04:59,927
Let's welcome
our next performer,

120
00:04:59,962 --> 00:05:02,563
here to play the harmonica,
Peter Griffin.

121
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,633
Hi.

122
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:07,802
So, where are you from, Peter?

123
00:05:07,836 --> 00:05:10,304
Um, I'm from
Quahog, Rhode Island.

124
00:05:11,507 --> 00:05:12,840
Quahog!

125
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,175
That's my family.

126
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:16,644
My wife daytime drinks
on vacation.

127
00:05:16,678 --> 00:05:19,213
Okay, Peter,
let's hear what you've got.

128
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:45,006
Wow, he's nailing it.

129
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,174
I know, shut up.

130
00:06:00,722 --> 00:06:02,623
Well, there goes
my music career.

131
00:06:02,658 --> 00:06:04,792
I wonder if I can get
my old job back

132
00:06:04,826 --> 00:06:07,061
painting kids' faces
at birthday parties.

133
00:06:07,095 --> 00:06:08,763
There you go, Timmy.

134
00:06:08,797 --> 00:06:10,264
Sir, you're gonna have
to leave.

135
00:06:10,299 --> 00:06:12,033
You're just drawing penises
with a Sharpie

136
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:13,234
on children's faces.

137
00:06:13,268 --> 00:06:15,236
I don't know how
to draw a cat.

138
00:06:19,808 --> 00:06:21,542
Hi, I'm Amanda.

139
00:06:21,577 --> 00:06:23,544
I'm Chris.
You look nice,

140
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:25,513
so I'll blow my burps
the other way.

141
00:06:26,715 --> 00:06:28,082
You're funny.

142
00:06:28,116 --> 00:06:29,250
Oh, thanks.

143
00:06:29,284 --> 00:06:31,085
Usually people
just find me awkward.

144
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:33,154
I have a hard time
with small talk.

145
00:06:33,188 --> 00:06:35,456
Did you find everything
you were looking for?

146
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,857
Eh, I did all right

147
00:06:36,892 --> 00:06:39,012
for a guy who just had his
first homosexual experience

148
00:06:39,027 --> 00:06:40,861
with his guitar teacher.

149
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:46,267
All right, guys,
keep an eye out for our stuff.

150
00:06:46,301 --> 00:06:48,569
I got tired of not being able
to find my bags,

151
00:06:48,604 --> 00:06:50,438
so I tied a vaguely
Hanna-Barbera-looking

152
00:06:50,472 --> 00:06:51,906
character to it.

153
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,709
This trip was imposserous!

154
00:06:54,743 --> 00:06:56,143
There we go.

155
00:06:56,178 --> 00:06:58,913
I really enjoyed sitting next
to you on the plane, Chris.

156
00:06:58,947 --> 00:06:59,981
Me, too.

157
00:07:00,015 --> 00:07:01,315
I'm sorry I screamed

158
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,584
when that guy from India
got up to stretch.

159
00:07:03,619 --> 00:07:05,519
Look, I'm having brunch
tomorrow with my grandparents

160
00:07:05,554 --> 00:07:07,021
at the Barrington
Country Club.

161
00:07:07,055 --> 00:07:08,256
Maybe your family
could join us.

162
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,291
Okay, that sounds like fun.

163
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,530
Oh, my God.

164
00:07:16,565 --> 00:07:17,865
Chris is dating
a Barrington.

165
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:19,467
Who are the
Barringtons?

166
00:07:19,501 --> 00:07:21,502
They're the richest family
in all of Rhode Island.

167
00:07:21,536 --> 00:07:23,604
I must notify Gossip Girl!

168
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:26,974
"Pass this along
to Gossip Girl."

169
00:07:41,556 --> 00:07:43,958
It's me. I'm Gossip Girl.

170
00:07:50,562 --> 00:07:53,848
I still can't believe Chris
is dating a Barrington.

171
00:07:53,882 --> 00:07:55,399
They own this whole club.

172
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:57,318
Yeah, look at
all this luxury.

173
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:00,053
It's like being in
a gay guy's dream.

174
00:08:01,723 --> 00:08:03,290
Enjoying the view?

175
00:08:03,325 --> 00:08:04,708
It's glorious, Edwin.

176
00:08:04,743 --> 00:08:06,026
Would you like
another salad bowl

177
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,378
of chocolate-covered oysters?

178
00:08:07,412 --> 00:08:08,479
Is that gay enough?

179
00:08:08,513 --> 00:08:09,697
And then some.

180
00:08:09,731 --> 00:08:11,966
This has been the gayest
vacation I've ever had.

181
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,869
I love smelling me
on your breath.

182
00:08:14,903 --> 00:08:16,287
Peter, what are
you doing here?

183
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:17,404
You're not a member!

184
00:08:17,422 --> 00:08:18,989
And that means me
and the other jocks

185
00:08:19,024 --> 00:08:20,441
get to throw you
in the pool.

186
00:08:20,475 --> 00:08:21,876
Hey, Banks, Duffy,
get over here!

187
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,511
This guy's going
for a swim.

188
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:24,879
Grab him!

189
00:08:26,581 --> 00:08:27,865
All right,
you're kind of heavy,

190
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:29,650
so-so-so
we're gonna pee on you.

191
00:08:33,255 --> 00:08:34,555
Not happening.

192
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:36,490
All right, all right,
we'll just spit on you.

193
00:08:41,413 --> 00:08:43,481
Oh, nothing we have works.

194
00:08:43,515 --> 00:08:46,116
Daddy, we're here to have
brunch with the Barringtons.

195
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,352
The Barringtons?!
How is that possible?

196
00:08:48,386 --> 00:08:50,421
That family is the pinnacle
of high society.

197
00:08:50,455 --> 00:08:52,156
They-they haven't worked
in eight generations.

198
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,657
All the kids have drug problems.

199
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:55,159
Most of them have O.D.'d.

200
00:08:55,193 --> 00:08:56,527
That's terrible.

201
00:08:56,561 --> 00:08:58,028
Well, not all kids
make it, Lois.

202
00:08:58,063 --> 00:08:59,980
Just ask the
Sugar Smacks frog.

203
00:09:00,015 --> 00:09:02,733
I'm sorry, I'm afraid
you've lost two more.

204
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:04,468
What should we do
about the graves?

205
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:05,736
Dig 'em.

206
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,176
You look really
handsome today, Chris.

207
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,511
Thanks, Amanda.

208
00:09:13,545 --> 00:09:14,778
Hey, Chris, say it.

209
00:09:14,813 --> 00:09:17,214
I use Stewart Griffin
Facial Cleanser.

210
00:09:17,249 --> 00:09:18,249
Try some.

211
00:09:18,283 --> 00:09:19,383
Give her
the Web site.

212
00:09:19,417 --> 00:09:21,418
StewieGriffinFacial.com.

213
00:09:21,453 --> 00:09:22,920
No, no, no,
th-th-that's something else.

214
00:09:22,954 --> 00:09:25,956
It's
StewieGriffinFacialCleanser.com.

215
00:09:25,991 --> 00:09:27,324
Hey, listen,
Mr. Barrington,

216
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:29,426
y-your granddaughter
ain't no tease, right?

217
00:09:29,461 --> 00:09:31,101
'Cause Chris really
wants to get in there.

218
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:33,264
Oh, you're a funny guy,
Griffin.

219
00:09:33,298 --> 00:09:34,532
I like that.

220
00:09:34,566 --> 00:09:36,634
Oh, well, you should hear
my prank phone calls.

221
00:09:38,436 --> 00:09:40,571
Hey,
is your refrigerator running?

222
00:09:40,605 --> 00:09:41,739
Yes, it is.

223
00:09:41,773 --> 00:09:43,340
Are your doors unlocked?

224
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,975
What? Why?

225
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,981
I don't know, they all
kind of look the same.

226
00:09:51,016 --> 00:09:54,451
What do you mean "they
all look the same"?

227
00:09:55,587 --> 00:09:58,222
Hey, there's all
my favorite people!

228
00:09:58,256 --> 00:10:00,157
Oh, no, not this suck-up.

229
00:10:00,191 --> 00:10:01,525
What are we talking about?

230
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,993
Black people? Mexicans?

231
00:10:03,028 --> 00:10:04,929
Jews?

232
00:10:04,963 --> 00:10:06,664
So good to see you,
Barrington.

233
00:10:06,698 --> 00:10:08,232
Hey, hey, where we going today,
Reginald?

234
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:09,500
Huh? Huh?
Where we going today?

235
00:10:09,534 --> 00:10:10,901
You and me is pals,
ain't we, Reginald?

236
00:10:10,936 --> 00:10:12,336
Pewterschmidt,
settle down!

237
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,805
I was having a nice
conversation with Peter.

238
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:17,074
Uh, Peter, why don't you tell me
more about your job.

239
00:10:17,108 --> 00:10:18,709
You said you like
to drink at work?

240
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,843
I do.
Oh, me, too!

241
00:10:19,878 --> 00:10:21,011
Me, too.
I'll drink anything.

242
00:10:21,046 --> 00:10:22,686
Even that hollandaise sauce.
Give me that.

243
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,285
Hey, Brian,
Meg's Benedict.

244
00:10:31,723 --> 00:10:33,023
Oh, God.
Ho, ho, ho.

245
00:10:33,058 --> 00:10:34,191
Stop. Stop.

246
00:10:34,225 --> 00:10:35,826
Stop.
I'm sorry I even said it.

247
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,294
I'm so...
It was a mistake.

248
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:39,229
It was a mistake.
I'm sorry I said it.

249
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,932
Peter, why don't you
and I grab some air, huh?

250
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:44,301
Daddy, you're making a
fool out of yourself.

251
00:10:44,336 --> 00:10:45,803
Why are you
acting like this?

252
00:10:45,837 --> 00:10:47,137
Look, I've been
trying to get

253
00:10:47,172 --> 00:10:49,306
into Reginald Barrington's
inner circle for years.

254
00:10:49,341 --> 00:10:51,008
They've been
the most elite family

255
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:52,743
in this country
ever since it was founded.

256
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,412
They were the ones who invented
the buckle on the hat.

257
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:56,847
Hey, I like
your zipper hat.

258
00:10:56,881 --> 00:10:58,382
I like your zipper hat.

259
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,883
Morning, fellas.

260
00:10:59,918 --> 00:11:03,387
Oh, that's gonna
be a game changer.

261
00:11:03,421 --> 00:11:05,289
Do you hunt, Peter?

262
00:11:05,323 --> 00:11:07,925
Well, I went to three
stores to find this shirt.

263
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,027
Peter, you-you've got moxie.

264
00:11:10,061 --> 00:11:11,195
I like that.

265
00:11:11,229 --> 00:11:12,896
Hey, I've got moxie, too!
Watch this!

266
00:11:12,931 --> 00:11:15,232
♪ Carmen Miranda,
Carmen Miranda ♪

267
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:16,634
♪ Was she a singer?

268
00:11:16,668 --> 00:11:17,901

270
00:11:19,204 --> 00:11:20,838
♪ They just remember
the fruit. ♪

271
00:11:20,872 --> 00:11:23,140
Pewterschmidt,
you imbecile!

272
00:11:23,174 --> 00:11:25,209
You think that's funny,
wasting fruit?

273
00:11:25,243 --> 00:11:27,378
There are people dying
in hilarious places.

274
00:11:27,412 --> 00:11:28,479
That is it!

275
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:30,914
You are officially
kicked out of this club!

276
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:32,049
What?

277
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,584
Griffin,
we just had an opening.

278
00:11:33,618 --> 00:11:36,053
Congratulations,
you are now a member.

279
00:11:36,087 --> 00:11:37,488
Oh, my God, really?

280
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:39,590
And to think,
yesterday I was just a guy

281
00:11:39,624 --> 00:11:41,325
at home eating catnip.

282
00:11:51,102 --> 00:11:52,569
Excuse me, Mr. Pewterschmidt,

283
00:11:52,604 --> 00:11:54,571
but you're no longer
a member at this club.

284
00:11:54,606 --> 00:11:55,939
Don't worry,
he's my guest.

285
00:11:55,974 --> 00:11:57,341
Now, look, Peter,

286
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,543
j-just because you're
a member now and I'm your guest,

287
00:11:59,577 --> 00:12:01,845
that doesn't mean things are
gonna change between us, right?

288
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,247
No, no, of course not.

289
00:12:03,281 --> 00:12:05,416
Excuse me a
moment, Carter.

290
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:08,185
Hey, guys, I just bumped into
Carter Pewterschmidt outside.

291
00:12:08,219 --> 00:12:09,453
What a loser, huh?

292
00:12:10,822 --> 00:12:12,089
Okay, when he
wasn't looking,

293
00:12:12,123 --> 00:12:14,324
I stuck a springy
snake in his wallet.

294
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,026
What? Aah!

295
00:12:16,061 --> 00:12:17,695
And I switched out
one of his eyeballs

296
00:12:17,729 --> 00:12:19,196
for a gag
exploding eyeball.

297
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,364
What? That's impossib...

298
00:12:20,398 --> 00:12:21,432
Aah!

299
00:12:21,466 --> 00:12:23,067
And then I paid a
couple of Mexicans

300
00:12:23,101 --> 00:12:25,102
to run over him
with their car.

301
00:12:26,571 --> 00:12:28,706
I hope they don't just take
the money and skip town.

302
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:32,943
Okay, you ready
for some polo?

303
00:12:32,977 --> 00:12:34,478
All right,
this is more like it.

304
00:12:34,512 --> 00:12:35,479
Where's Buttercup?

305
00:12:35,513 --> 00:12:37,281
Oh, only members
can ride Buttercup.

306
00:12:37,315 --> 00:12:40,117
Guests have to ride Topsy
the Roid Rage Horse.

307
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,554
Now, whatever you do,
don't say his trigger word.

308
00:12:43,588 --> 00:12:45,689
What?
Aah! That's his trigger word!

309
00:12:47,692 --> 00:12:49,426
Don't yell! His parents
were slaughtered by yellers.

310
00:12:49,461 --> 00:12:50,461
Just submit.

311
00:12:50,495 --> 00:12:52,129
I am submitting!
It's getting worse!

312
00:12:52,163 --> 00:12:53,530
No, I mean really submit.

313
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:54,998
Okay, okay!

314
00:12:55,033 --> 00:12:56,700
Oh, my God,
I meant say you're sorry,

315
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,368
not take off your pants.

316
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,738
Carter, what are you doing?
Oh, my God!

317
00:13:00,772 --> 00:13:02,906
And now that I've made you aware
of the misunderstanding,

318
00:13:02,941 --> 00:13:04,408
you're still continuing with it.

319
00:13:04,442 --> 00:13:06,510
Oh, my God!
And I'm still watching.

320
00:13:06,544 --> 00:13:07,811
What's wrong with me?

321
00:13:07,846 --> 00:13:09,480
Oh, my God!

322
00:13:12,884 --> 00:13:16,653
We now return
to <i>Game of Thrones</i> on BET.

323
00:13:16,688 --> 00:13:19,189
I got a big-ass coat,
chair to sit in,

324
00:13:19,224 --> 00:13:21,391
chalice cup of wine
and a midget,

325
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:22,726
but I ain't going out there

326
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:24,528
with all them monsters
out there!

327
00:13:27,165 --> 00:13:29,032
Daddy, what
happened to you?

328
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:31,235
I can't live
without the country club.

329
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:32,302
You did this, Peter!

330
00:13:32,337 --> 00:13:33,437
This is all your fault!

331
00:13:33,471 --> 00:13:35,038
I like your hair.
Well, Daddy,

332
00:13:35,073 --> 00:13:37,040
you've been treating
Peter like dirt for years.

333
00:13:37,075 --> 00:13:39,343
It's-it's choppier;
it's more texturized.

334
00:13:39,377 --> 00:13:41,779
Did you go to the Asian
guy with the one name?

335
00:13:41,813 --> 00:13:43,647
Well, now that you
know how it feels,

336
00:13:43,681 --> 00:13:45,449
maybe you want to
give him an apology.

337
00:13:45,483 --> 00:13:46,750
You went to Taki,
didn't you?

338
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:49,186
Look, Peter, I'm sorry
for the way I treated you,

339
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,122
but is there anything you can do
to get me back in the club?

340
00:13:52,157 --> 00:13:53,791
Well, I suppose I could
talk to Barrington.

341
00:13:53,825 --> 00:13:55,159
Really? Oh, Peter,

342
00:13:55,193 --> 00:13:56,794
you don't know
what this means to me.

343
00:13:56,828 --> 00:13:59,263
Oh, you know, I was so desperate
there for a while,

344
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:00,531
I even tried a Jewish club.

345
00:14:00,565 --> 00:14:01,932
Oh, you don't want
to get involved

346
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,100
with them
religious groups.

347
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:05,169
They believe in all
kinds of weird stuff.

348
00:14:05,203 --> 00:14:06,937
If I believe
in Jesus hard enough,

349
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,639
I will not die.

350
00:14:08,673 --> 00:14:10,674
If I believe
in Snake Jesus hard enough,

351
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:11,975
he will die.

352
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:14,144
If I believe
in Tree Jesus hard enough,

353
00:14:14,179 --> 00:14:15,612
both of them will die.

354
00:14:17,081 --> 00:14:19,583
Yay! Thank you, Tree Jesus!

355
00:14:21,452 --> 00:14:23,253
Hey, Mr. Barrington.

356
00:14:23,288 --> 00:14:24,354
Oh, hello, Peter.

357
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:25,656
I'm so glad you're here.

358
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,058
We're shooting bald guys
under five-seven today.

359
00:14:28,092 --> 00:14:29,560
Hey, there's the guy

360
00:14:29,594 --> 00:14:31,228
who denied
my health insurance claim.

361
00:14:31,262 --> 00:14:32,763
Sir, your nipples are fine!

362
00:14:32,797 --> 00:14:34,798
You don't need
to reconstruct them!

363
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:38,001
I want Hershey Kiss nipples,
and I want you to pay for them!

364
00:14:38,036 --> 00:14:39,837
Look, Mr. B.,
if it's okay with you,

365
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,172
I'd like to give
my membership back to Carter.

366
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:44,007
I'm sorry, Peter, but
I just don't think

367
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:45,909
Pewterschmidt is
country club material.

368
00:14:45,944 --> 00:14:47,110
Now if you'll excuse me,

369
00:14:47,145 --> 00:14:49,346
I'm about to shoot
Michael Stipe.

370
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,948
Is that...

371
00:14:50,982 --> 00:14:52,249
Is that him
in the corner?

372
00:14:52,283 --> 00:14:53,684
Yes, that is him
in the corner.

373
00:14:53,718 --> 00:14:55,352
Is that him
in the spotlight?

374
00:14:55,386 --> 00:14:56,787
Would you...
Oh, damn it!

375
00:14:56,821 --> 00:14:57,955
Now he got away!

376
00:14:57,989 --> 00:14:59,857
Oh, no...
I said too much?

377
00:14:59,891 --> 00:15:01,491
I want you
out of here!

378
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:03,460
Look, Mr. Barrington,
he's my father-in-law.

379
00:15:03,494 --> 00:15:05,395
So if he goes, I go.

380
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,030
Fine, I don't care.

381
00:15:07,065 --> 00:15:09,666
Your low-brow antics no
longer amuse me, Griffin.

382
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,168
You're both out
of the club.

383
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,769
Well, I guess that's it then.

384
00:15:12,804 --> 00:15:14,872
Oh, there is one
more thing, actually.

385
00:15:14,906 --> 00:15:17,040
Can you talk to that
angry little boy

386
00:15:17,075 --> 00:15:18,542
down by the river bank?

387
00:15:18,576 --> 00:15:20,978
Uh, yeah, sure.

388
00:15:24,983 --> 00:15:26,383
Hey, what's eating you?

389
00:15:26,417 --> 00:15:27,517
Grown-ups.

390
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,186
Yeah, grown-ups suck.

391
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,288
Why do they get to make
all the rules?

392
00:15:31,322 --> 00:15:33,357
I know it seems
unfair, but, hey,

393
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,225
there ain't no rules
in a tickle fight.

394
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,727
Stop!

395
00:15:36,761 --> 00:15:38,562
You're tickling!

396
00:15:38,596 --> 00:15:40,030
Timmy, there you are!

397
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,531
Who the
are you?!

398
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:42,966
Get away from our son!

399
00:15:43,001 --> 00:15:44,301
But Mr. Barrington
told me to...

400
00:15:44,335 --> 00:15:45,669
Who's Mr. Barrington?

401
00:15:45,703 --> 00:15:47,504
From the club.
What club?

402
00:15:47,538 --> 00:15:49,172
You're in a lot
of trouble, mister.

403
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:58,694
I'm sorry I got us both
kicked out, Carter.

404
00:15:58,728 --> 00:16:00,362
I was just trying
to help you out.

405
00:16:00,396 --> 00:16:03,098
Mr. Barrington told me
I couldn't see Amanda anymore.

406
00:16:03,132 --> 00:16:05,534
We never even got
a chance to have sex.

407
00:16:05,568 --> 00:16:09,054
Everyone knows rich, Waspy girls
are the best at it.

408
00:16:09,088 --> 00:16:10,889
I'm really gonna miss that club.

409
00:16:10,923 --> 00:16:12,641
You know what part
I liked the most?

410
00:16:12,675 --> 00:16:14,376
Walking around
the locker room naked

411
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:17,446
and offering people sections
of a tiny clementine.

412
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,714
Clementine?

413
00:16:18,748 --> 00:16:20,332
Oh, thank you.

414
00:16:20,366 --> 00:16:21,583
Clementine?

415
00:16:21,617 --> 00:16:22,601
None for
me, thanks.

416
00:16:22,652 --> 00:16:23,685
Clementine?

417
00:16:23,719 --> 00:16:25,487
Yes, thank you.

418
00:16:25,521 --> 00:16:26,855
Clementine?
Yeah, I'll have one.

419
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:28,240
Ooh, softly.
Sorry.

420
00:16:28,274 --> 00:16:29,658
Yes, I'll have one.

421
00:16:29,692 --> 00:16:31,460
There you go.

422
00:16:31,494 --> 00:16:34,596
God, it's good
to be old and nude.

423
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,565
Look, Carter,
you can't be that surprised.

424
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:37,833
I mean,
it's just human nature

425
00:16:37,867 --> 00:16:39,451
to suck up to the people
above you,

426
00:16:39,485 --> 00:16:41,820
crap on those beneath you
and undercut your equals.

427
00:16:41,854 --> 00:16:43,588
Well, then we just
got to figure out a way

428
00:16:43,623 --> 00:16:44,923
to make you fancier
than Barrington,

429
00:16:44,957 --> 00:16:46,558
so he's got
to suck up to you.

430
00:16:46,592 --> 00:16:47,692
I don't know, Peter.

431
00:16:47,727 --> 00:16:49,144
That'd be pretty
tough to pull off.

432
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:50,429
We just got to be bold.

433
00:16:50,463 --> 00:16:52,497
Like those
backwards-knee birds.

434
00:16:53,516 --> 00:16:54,516
Oh, what? What?

435
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,051
Oh, what? What are
you looking at?

436
00:16:56,085 --> 00:16:57,252
Oh, you coming for me?

437
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,720
No, no, I'll just take

438
00:16:58,754 --> 00:17:01,106
a big backward-knee step
in the opposite direction.

439
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,208
Yeah, yeah, you think
I'm afraid of you?

440
00:17:03,242 --> 00:17:06,511
I slept on your back
last night, you.

441
00:17:11,217 --> 00:17:12,684
Yes, I'll have
the filet mignon,

442
00:17:12,718 --> 00:17:14,719
and they can start
the sunset now.

443
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,707
Someone important
must be arriving

444
00:17:18,741 --> 00:17:20,942
because they're making
a big entrance.

445
00:17:37,176 --> 00:17:40,128
Announcing the arrival
of His and His Majesty,

446
00:17:40,163 --> 00:17:42,264
the exceedingly wealthy
and very important

447
00:17:42,298 --> 00:17:44,499
Viscount James Earl
Tennis Racquet,

448
00:17:44,534 --> 00:17:46,401
and Duke of
Lacrosse Team.

449
00:17:46,435 --> 00:17:48,603
Hello, I'm Reginald
Barrington.

450
00:17:48,638 --> 00:17:50,739
Where are you fine
gentlemen from?

451
00:17:50,773 --> 00:17:51,973
We are European,

452
00:17:52,008 --> 00:17:53,942
from the United
Coloreds of Benetton.

453
00:17:53,976 --> 00:17:55,944
But you don't sound
like you're from Europe.

454
00:17:55,978 --> 00:17:57,345
Is that so?

455
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,514
Well, perhaps I should take
my thong elsewhere.

456
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:01,516
Well, let's
not be hasty.

457
00:18:01,551 --> 00:18:04,136
Your Majesty, won't
you please join me

458
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,922
as my personal guests
in the Barrington Room?

459
00:18:06,956 --> 00:18:08,423
The Barrington Room?!

460
00:18:08,457 --> 00:18:10,876
Peter, that's the most exclusive
room in all of New England.

461
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:13,145
Yeah, I hear it's even
harder to get in there

462
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:14,679
than the University
of Arizona.

463
00:18:14,714 --> 00:18:16,348
Well, it's beating.

464
00:18:16,382 --> 00:18:18,934
Welcome to the Wildcats.

465
00:18:18,968 --> 00:18:20,935
This is the
Barrington Room.

466
00:18:20,953 --> 00:18:22,404
Have a seat in
the deepest,

467
00:18:22,438 --> 00:18:25,774
most luxurious leather chair
in the world.

468
00:18:27,777 --> 00:18:30,679
Oh, that's nice.

469
00:18:30,713 --> 00:18:32,931
Sir, may I offer you
a shoe drink?

470
00:18:32,965 --> 00:18:35,383
Why, yes, that'd
be lovely.

471
00:18:37,136 --> 00:18:39,487
Ah, the finer things.

472
00:18:39,522 --> 00:18:41,456
So, what brings
you gentlemen to town?

473
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,674
We're here on business.

474
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,326
In fact, we just
came from a meeting

475
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,161
with the venerable
Carter Pewterschmidt.

476
00:18:46,195 --> 00:18:47,462
Outstanding man.

477
00:18:47,496 --> 00:18:48,730
Really? Yeah, well,

478
00:18:48,764 --> 00:18:51,483
he used to be a member here,
but he was very annoying.

479
00:18:51,517 --> 00:18:53,451
Oh, my, that's-that's
surprising.

480
00:18:53,486 --> 00:18:55,937
I-I've heard he has quite
the blue-blood pedigree.

481
00:18:55,972 --> 00:18:57,806
You know, he got a
piece of Jackie Kennedy

482
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,442
before she was defiled by
that hairy olive-eater.

483
00:19:00,476 --> 00:19:02,410
Yeah, and-and
he once made me

484
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:04,246
a grilled cheese
sandwich after this.

485
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,414
Well, I wasn't sure
about Pewterschmidt,

486
00:19:06,449 --> 00:19:08,149
but after hearing
you gentlemen talk,

487
00:19:08,184 --> 00:19:10,085
maybe I could give him
another chance.

488
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,486
Really?
Oh, wow!

489
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,355
That's great news,
Carter. You're back in!

490
00:19:13,389 --> 00:19:14,806
Hey, let's get a
couple of girls

491
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,108
and have seventh-grade-in-
the-same-room-make-outs.

492
00:19:17,143 --> 00:19:19,144
"Carter"? Wait a minute.

493
00:19:19,178 --> 00:19:20,829
You're not
Duke of Lacrosse Team!

494
00:19:20,863 --> 00:19:23,848
And you're not Viscount
James Earl Tennis Racquet!

495
00:19:23,883 --> 00:19:25,133
Security!

496
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:27,335
Come throw these frauds
out of my club!

497
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,803
Damn it, Peter,
you blew it!

498
00:19:28,838 --> 00:19:31,089
I knew I couldn't depend
on you!

499
00:19:31,123 --> 00:19:33,441
You're not worthy to lick
my designer shoes,

500
00:19:33,476 --> 00:19:34,809
you fat, low-life slob!

501
00:19:34,844 --> 00:19:36,378
But, Carter, please!

502
00:19:36,412 --> 00:19:39,130
Here, skip this rope and do
a lively schoolgirl chant.

503
00:19:39,165 --> 00:19:41,333
But, Carter, I don't know
any city girl rhymes.

504
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:42,817
Do it!

505
00:19:42,851 --> 00:19:45,186
Lettuce, carrots,
peppers and peas.

506
00:19:45,204 --> 00:19:47,706
Your mother says to
got to have these.

507
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,491
Now do it double time
with new vegetables!

508
00:19:49,525 --> 00:19:51,693
Cabbage, taters,
spinach and peas.

509
00:19:51,711 --> 00:19:52,994
You already said "peas"!

510
00:19:53,028 --> 00:19:55,630
I don't know any
more vegetables.

511
00:19:55,665 --> 00:19:57,916
Wait a second,
hang on there.

512
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,752
The way you abused
that man just now,

513
00:20:00,786 --> 00:20:02,587
the way you treated
your lesser--

514
00:20:02,622 --> 00:20:04,856
I underestimated you,
Pewterschmidt.

515
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:07,259
I thought you were just
some suck-up loser,

516
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:08,660
but you have shown me

517
00:20:08,694 --> 00:20:10,829
that you've got the mettle
to be one of us.

518
00:20:10,863 --> 00:20:12,197
You are back in the club.

519
00:20:12,231 --> 00:20:14,165
Oh, thank you,
Mr. Barrington!

520
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,002
Yes. Now, I believe
there is just one last piece

521
00:20:17,036 --> 00:20:19,471
of unfinished business
to take care of here.

522
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:26,478
I'm sorry, but the Viscount
James Earl Tennis Racquet

523
00:20:26,512 --> 00:20:29,247
and Duke of Lacrosse Team
already arrived two hours ago.

524
00:20:29,282 --> 00:20:31,683
But that's impossible!

525
00:20:35,488 --> 00:20:36,721
Peter, I'm sorry

526
00:20:36,756 --> 00:20:38,923
you've got to give up
the country club life.

527
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,258
Oh, that's okay, Lois.

528
00:20:40,293 --> 00:20:41,626
'Cause you know,
I got to say,

529
00:20:41,661 --> 00:20:43,695
I don't think those rich guys
have it all that great.

530
00:20:43,729 --> 00:20:45,096
Too much stress.

531
00:20:45,131 --> 00:20:46,364
You know,
you give me the choice,

532
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:48,066
I'll choose our life
any day of the week.

533
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,467
Me, too, Peter.

534
00:20:49,502 --> 00:20:51,469
Can I have $50 to
get my hair cut?

535
00:20:51,504 --> 00:20:53,071
Absolutely not.
That's a waste of money.

536
00:20:53,105 --> 00:20:54,639
I will cut it myself.

537
00:20:56,108 --> 00:20:58,376
You look like garbage.
What happened?

538
