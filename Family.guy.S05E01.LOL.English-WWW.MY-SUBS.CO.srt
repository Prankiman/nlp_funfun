1
00:00:34,184 --> 00:00:36,503
We interrupt this program
with a special report.

2
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:39,240
Quahog is seeing its worst
flu epidemic in years,

3
00:00:39,267 --> 00:00:41,553
due in part to a severe
shortage of flu shots.

4
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,257
Let's go live to Asian flu
correspondent Tricia Takanawa, Tricia?

5
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,382
Diane, I'm...

6
00:00:48,786 --> 00:00:52,342
Thank you, Tricia. We now return
you to Robin, Boy Wonder.

7
00:00:55,336 --> 00:00:57,910
Hey, don't worry. I'm here.

8
00:00:57,952 --> 00:01:00,081
Robin? They sent you?

9
00:01:00,118 --> 00:01:03,113
Yeah. Everyone else was busy so,
uh, they sent me.

10
00:01:03,157 --> 00:01:05,954
What the hell are you going to do?
You don't have any superpowers.

11
00:01:05,998 --> 00:01:09,140
Uh, I... got a cell phone.

12
00:01:09,707 --> 00:01:12,362
Oh, no bars.

13
00:01:17,897 --> 00:01:19,782
All right, who's next for a flu shot?

14
00:01:19,817 --> 00:01:21,760
Oh, that's me, I'm, uh, I'm Peter Griffin.

15
00:01:21,778 --> 00:01:24,161
Mr. Griffin, these flu shots
are in short supply.

16
00:01:24,175 --> 00:01:25,680
We need to save them for the elderly.

17
00:01:25,697 --> 00:01:27,922
- Like these folks here.
- Oh. Okay.

18
00:01:27,997 --> 00:01:31,460
Well, I guess I'll be heading out
then and... Whoa!

19
00:01:31,588 --> 00:01:33,213
Oh, look at that.

20
00:01:33,238 --> 00:01:35,410
Oh, well, since it's already in there,
you might as well,

21
00:01:35,446 --> 00:01:37,211
push down on the ol' plunger there.

22
00:01:37,247 --> 00:01:38,501
You're a monster.

23
00:01:38,527 --> 00:01:42,410
You know what was a monster?
Frampton Comes Alive, 1976.

24
00:01:42,447 --> 00:01:45,923
Is there anyone you knew who didn't
have that record? I don't think so.

25
00:01:45,945 --> 00:01:47,982
Bam!
All right, have a good winter.

26
00:01:48,158 --> 00:01:50,342
Very well, Mr. Griffin,
you got your flu shot.

27
00:01:50,365 --> 00:01:51,970
Now, if you'll just sign here...

28
00:01:52,057 --> 00:01:53,802
- Hmm, well, this is odd.
- What?

29
00:01:53,827 --> 00:01:57,833
Well, you're 42 years old and it says
here you've never had a prostate exam.

30
00:01:57,866 --> 00:02:00,650
No, but I've had other exams.
Like that one in college.

31
00:02:01,547 --> 00:02:03,453
Damn it, this is too hard!

32
00:02:03,516 --> 00:02:06,450
Here's what I think of your test,
Mr. Teacher.

33
00:02:08,398 --> 00:02:11,351
You just stood up to me.
Congratulations.

34
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:12,882
That was the test.

35
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:20,763
<i>Heaven helps the man
who fights his fear.</i>

36
00:02:22,696 --> 00:02:24,483
Okay, heart sounds good.

37
00:02:24,505 --> 00:02:26,832
All right, Mr. Griffin, I'm just going
to need you to drop your pants

38
00:02:26,858 --> 00:02:28,311
and we'll check your prostate.

39
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:29,520
Uh, what?

40
00:02:29,547 --> 00:02:31,650
Drop your pants, turn around,
and lean forward.

41
00:02:31,696 --> 00:02:33,341
Um, okay.

42
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,962
So, how's this work,
you just feel my pulse or...

43
00:02:44,647 --> 00:02:46,132
What the hell was that?

44
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:48,012
Mr. Griffin, that's a prostate exam.

45
00:02:48,038 --> 00:02:50,142
Shut up!
You had your finger in my ass!

46
00:02:50,155 --> 00:02:52,341
That's how a prostate exam is performed.

47
00:02:52,368 --> 00:02:54,493
- Now, if you'll just let me...
- Get away from me!

48
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,973
Ugh. Get a tan.

49
00:03:17,827 --> 00:03:20,903
Peter, my God, you look terrible.
What happened?

50
00:03:20,926 --> 00:03:22,741
I was raped.

51
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:25,782
What?

52
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:30,113
Dr. Hartman violated me.
He took my innocence.

53
00:03:31,296 --> 00:03:33,203
Wh-What?

54
00:03:34,997 --> 00:03:37,033
Peter, that's a prostate exam.

55
00:03:37,048 --> 00:03:40,061
It's an important part of a
physical for men your age.

56
00:03:40,078 --> 00:03:42,471
You sound just like him!

57
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,132
idiot.

58
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:53,873
Hey, Peter, buddy.
How 'bout some TV, huh?

59
00:03:53,935 --> 00:03:56,493
<i>We now return to:
Freddy got fingered.</i>

60
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:57,611
Oh, God.

61
00:03:59,178 --> 00:04:01,243
<i>- Oh, God.
- ... Yellow Pages.</i>

62
00:04:01,268 --> 00:04:03,150
<i>Let your fingers do the walking.</i>

63
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:08,281
Are we still going to the baseball game?

64
00:04:08,306 --> 00:04:09,911
Get that away from me, Chris.

65
00:04:13,728 --> 00:04:14,980
Stop it, Meg.

66
00:04:20,035 --> 00:04:20,860
Peter...

67
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:26,221
I'm trying to be supportive
but after all, it was just a prostate exam.

68
00:04:26,248 --> 00:04:28,152
You weren't there, Lois.

69
00:04:28,297 --> 00:04:30,100
You weren't there.

70
00:04:33,187 --> 00:04:34,361
Who's that?

71
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:36,592
Who are you?
Where's Peter?

72
00:04:36,638 --> 00:04:38,843
Where is he?
You're a whore.

73
00:04:38,868 --> 00:04:41,230
Wear your whore makeup, you whore.

74
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:43,851
- Is somebody in there?
- Ocupado.

75
00:04:44,215 --> 00:04:48,193
Filthy whore.
You're somebody's father, you filthy whore.

76
00:04:50,295 --> 00:04:53,131
- Hi, sweetie.
- Ugh, look at her staring.

77
00:04:53,178 --> 00:04:54,481
What are you looking at, huh?

78
00:04:54,526 --> 00:04:57,092
God, I should take her out right here
with these, man.

79
00:04:57,115 --> 00:05:00,321
Oh, hey, Lois. Oh, you like staring?
Oh, why don't I give you a closer look?

80
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,941
Yeah, you want some of this,
Maury Po-bitch?

81
00:05:04,676 --> 00:05:07,362
Oh, oh, what's that, oh,
you come back for more, huh?

82
00:05:08,195 --> 00:05:10,042
I'd freakin' drop her ass.

83
00:05:13,176 --> 00:05:15,540
Oh, an unfamiliar dog.

84
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,470
Why don't you go away?
I don't want to be your friend.

85
00:05:19,197 --> 00:05:22,033
Rupert!
Oh, dear God, somebody help!

86
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:24,951
R upert!

87
00:05:26,996 --> 00:05:28,520
Give me that bear!

88
00:05:30,846 --> 00:05:34,421
Oh, honey, I'm afraid
Rupert had a little injury.

89
00:05:35,088 --> 00:05:38,933
Oh, Rupert, please live.
Please, I'll never be short with you again.

90
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:42,301
W- We'll go away. W-We'll go to Hawaii.
Would you like that?

91
00:05:42,315 --> 00:05:44,291
I always envisioned how it would be.

92
00:05:51,728 --> 00:05:54,721
I never knew there could be
such a thing as a perfect day.

93
00:05:54,736 --> 00:05:58,870
Don't frolic too much, Rupert.
Save some energy for the hula contest.

94
00:06:03,576 --> 00:06:06,501
Stewie, I have a surprise for you.

95
00:06:06,607 --> 00:06:08,452
Good as new.

96
00:06:08,867 --> 00:06:12,293
Rupert, it's really him.
I don't believe it.

97
00:06:12,386 --> 00:06:14,723
You-you did this for me?

98
00:06:14,755 --> 00:06:17,932
And to help you feel better,
I made your favorite dinner.

99
00:06:18,335 --> 00:06:20,182
Cut green beans...

100
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:24,911
Atkins-friendly potato sticks arranged
according to size from largest to smallest,

101
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:28,383
and a Scooby-Doo yogurt with
Shaggy's eyes scratched out.

102
00:06:28,398 --> 00:06:30,653
Oh, it's perfect down to the last detail.

103
00:06:30,736 --> 00:06:33,060
Lois, I was wrong about you.

104
00:06:33,147 --> 00:06:34,173
You're...

105
00:06:34,357 --> 00:06:36,271
you're my everything.

106
00:06:36,298 --> 00:06:38,440
Mommy loves you, sweetheart.

107
00:06:40,028 --> 00:06:42,453
Stewie loves Lois.

108
00:06:42,467 --> 00:06:44,592
Brian loves Olympia Dukakis.

109
00:06:44,615 --> 00:06:46,220
Oh, yeah, I do.

110
00:06:48,685 --> 00:06:52,021
Peter, what's the matter with you today?
You're not yourself.

111
00:06:52,057 --> 00:06:55,212
Guys, I went to Dr. Hartman
yesterday and...

112
00:06:56,097 --> 00:06:58,870
he did things to my fanny.

113
00:07:01,936 --> 00:07:04,432
- Peter, it's okay.
- It's not okay.

114
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,052
- You don't know what it's like.
- You're wrong.

115
00:07:07,097 --> 00:07:12,192
I, too, have felt the cold finger of injustice
on my insidey parts.

116
00:07:12,986 --> 00:07:14,870
He did it to you, too?

117
00:07:14,895 --> 00:07:16,720
I have something to say.

118
00:07:16,767 --> 00:07:19,370
Dr. Hartman violated me, as well.

119
00:07:19,396 --> 00:07:22,482
I only went in there
for a physical-slash-guinea pig sremoval,

120
00:07:22,506 --> 00:07:27,051
but I turned out to be the guinea pig,
for a sexual experimentation.

121
00:07:27,138 --> 00:07:29,453
You guys are a bunch of queers.

122
00:07:30,256 --> 00:07:31,913
And so am I!

123
00:07:31,925 --> 00:07:35,690
Oh, God, it was horrible!
I scrubbed and I scrubbed, but damn it,

124
00:07:35,715 --> 00:07:37,661
they don't make water hot enough!

125
00:07:37,698 --> 00:07:42,223
My God, we've all been victims
of Dr. Hartman's "prostate exam. "

126
00:07:42,266 --> 00:07:44,693
Well, gentlemen, the abuse stops here.

127
00:07:44,735 --> 00:07:46,900
I will not turn a brown eye to this.

128
00:07:46,936 --> 00:07:50,113
I am going to sue that bastard
and make him pay out the ass.

129
00:07:50,148 --> 00:07:51,960
No ifs, ands, or buts.

130
00:07:51,977 --> 00:07:54,773
I'm going to be really anal about this.

131
00:07:55,788 --> 00:07:57,052
Sphincter.

132
00:08:01,007 --> 00:08:02,570
Good morning, Lois.

133
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:05,210
My, Stewie, you're in a good mood today.

134
00:08:05,236 --> 00:08:08,770
Well, why shouldn't I be?
You saved Rupert's life and I love you for it.

135
00:08:08,798 --> 00:08:12,541
So warn the villagers,
here comes the cuddle monster.

136
00:08:15,638 --> 00:08:18,662
Oh, Lois, your breasts are great.

137
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,280
Well, good morning, Mr. Nipple.

138
00:08:21,347 --> 00:08:24,250
Hey, there.
Must be cold in here.

139
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:29,511
Peter, you're going to sue Dr. Hartman?

140
00:08:29,526 --> 00:08:32,093
You can't do that, all he did was
give you a prostate exam.

141
00:08:32,102 --> 00:08:34,241
Are you saying I asked
for this to happen?

142
00:08:34,268 --> 00:08:37,403
You know, Dad, there's this lawyer at
the mall who says he'll take any case,

143
00:08:37,427 --> 00:08:39,444
- no matter how frivolous.
- Yeah, yeah...

144
00:08:39,466 --> 00:08:42,320
and-and they also have an Orange Julius.

145
00:08:44,155 --> 00:08:46,860
Just-just trying to keep
the conversation going.

146
00:08:48,097 --> 00:08:50,503
Well, whatever happens,
I'm not going to stand for this.

147
00:08:50,525 --> 00:08:52,612
Too many people get away with injustice.

148
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,953
Like the folks you meetin
those Louisiana swamps.

149
00:08:56,205 --> 00:08:58,342
Excuse me,
do you know how to get to town?

150
00:08:58,397 --> 00:09:00,540
Yeah, it's back the way you came.

151
00:09:03,538 --> 00:09:04,953
I love you, Lois.

152
00:09:05,008 --> 00:09:06,172
You know that, right?

153
00:09:06,198 --> 00:09:08,580
Just in case, I'll say it again.
I love you.

154
00:09:08,606 --> 00:09:11,243
Oh, you are just so cute, sweetie.

155
00:09:11,276 --> 00:09:13,953
Look at that little foot.
I'm gonna eat that foot.

156
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:16,032
Give me that foot, it looks delicious.

157
00:09:16,077 --> 00:09:18,040
Don't-don't eat my foot.
Oh, God.

158
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:21,870
Oh, it is so hard to find funny women,
and you are hilarious.

159
00:09:21,897 --> 00:09:24,221
Oh, you're like a female Bonnie Hunt.

160
00:09:24,256 --> 00:09:28,413
Sit right there, honey. Mommy'll go get
Rupert so he can eat with you.

161
00:09:28,446 --> 00:09:30,342
Oh, God. Thoughtful.

162
00:09:30,377 --> 00:09:34,810
- Lois, I made coffee if you want some.
- Oh, thank you, Brian. That'd be nice.

163
00:09:35,636 --> 00:09:38,453
Uh, hey, Brian.
Uh, listen, I've got a favor to ask.

164
00:09:38,475 --> 00:09:41,300
Could you, uh, could you
not talk to Lois anymore?

165
00:09:41,346 --> 00:09:42,112
What?

166
00:09:42,138 --> 00:09:46,183
You know, it's just I'm tired of you
hitting on her. That's all, it's-it's not cool.

167
00:09:46,206 --> 00:09:48,530
I was just making coffee.
I didn't hit on her.

168
00:09:48,575 --> 00:09:51,071
Besides, Lois is my friend.
I'll do whatever the hell I want.

169
00:09:51,105 --> 00:09:53,740
I'm asking you nicely, Brian.
Stop hitting on her.

170
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:55,840
- That's ridiculous.
- I see the way you look at her.

171
00:10:04,608 --> 00:10:07,762
Sorry, I fell asleep watching
Sabado Gigante last night.

172
00:10:09,898 --> 00:10:12,141
Chiste grande.

173
00:10:16,225 --> 00:10:18,101
Lois, you know what
we should do right now?

174
00:10:18,136 --> 00:10:20,311
We should play restaurant
with my Play-Doh.

175
00:10:20,337 --> 00:10:23,501
I'll make you a hamburger.
Perhaps I'll make it blue.

176
00:10:23,535 --> 00:10:25,452
Oh, can you imagine such a world?

177
00:10:25,477 --> 00:10:29,302
Uh, Stewie, I love you,
but you're wearing Mommy out.

178
00:10:29,346 --> 00:10:33,140
- Now it's time for bed.
- Hey, Lois, I have a secret for you.

179
00:10:33,606 --> 00:10:35,201
You're awesome.

180
00:10:36,127 --> 00:10:39,002
Our top story: a local woman
loses her sex drive

181
00:10:39,037 --> 00:10:42,041
after a $125 dinner at Alfredo's.

182
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:46,682
But first in medical news, Dr. Elmer Hartman,
beloved family doctor to all of Quahog,

183
00:10:46,707 --> 00:10:48,982
is the target of a molestation lawsuit.

184
00:10:49,007 --> 00:10:50,973
The trial is set to begin tomorrow.

185
00:10:50,987 --> 00:10:53,940
We now return you to
Native American What's Happening!

186
00:10:53,976 --> 00:10:56,192
Hey, Rerun, you see Dwayne?

187
00:10:56,216 --> 00:10:58,750
Not today.
Oh, here he come.

188
00:10:58,817 --> 00:11:00,143
How, how, how.

189
00:11:00,387 --> 00:11:02,760
Peter, I don't know
how much more I can take.

190
00:11:02,786 --> 00:11:04,602
Stewie used to be so independent,

191
00:11:04,617 --> 00:11:08,412
but now he just clings to me night and day.
I'm exhausted.

192
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:10,960
Oh, look at me, I'm Lois.
The sun revolves around me.

193
00:11:10,985 --> 00:11:12,983
I'm the one who's got
to go to court tomorrow.

194
00:11:12,995 --> 00:11:16,461
Peter, isn't there anything I can do
to talk you out of this lawsuit?

195
00:11:16,488 --> 00:11:19,820
Hey, I was violated sexually
and that man is going to pay.

196
00:11:19,857 --> 00:11:22,783
And I suppose it wouldn't matter
if I told you for the 50th time

197
00:11:22,805 --> 00:11:26,402
that it's a legitimate medical
procedure to test for cancer.

198
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,570
Lois.

199
00:11:28,537 --> 00:11:29,490
Lois.

200
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:30,572
Lois.

201
00:11:30,688 --> 00:11:31,551
Lois.

202
00:11:31,718 --> 00:11:32,770
Lois.

203
00:11:32,968 --> 00:11:33,830
Lois.

204
00:11:34,095 --> 00:11:34,963
Mom.

205
00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:36,000
Mom.

206
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:37,150
Mom.

207
00:11:37,378 --> 00:11:38,240
Mommy.

208
00:11:38,438 --> 00:11:39,323
Mommy.

209
00:11:39,558 --> 00:11:40,441
Mommy.

210
00:11:40,727 --> 00:11:41,640
Mama.

211
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:42,810
Mama.

212
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:43,960
Mama.

213
00:11:44,065 --> 00:11:44,922
Ma.

214
00:11:45,168 --> 00:11:46,001
Ma.

215
00:11:46,396 --> 00:11:47,241
Ma.

216
00:11:47,626 --> 00:11:48,471
Ma.

217
00:11:48,756 --> 00:11:49,583
Mum.

218
00:11:49,796 --> 00:11:50,583
Mum.

219
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:51,721
Mum.

220
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:52,802
Mum.

221
00:11:53,035 --> 00:11:53,843
Mummy.

222
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:54,871
Mummy.

223
00:11:55,146 --> 00:11:56,003
M um-ma.

224
00:11:56,237 --> 00:11:57,152
Mum-ma.

225
00:11:57,356 --> 00:11:59,013
- Mum-ma.
- What?!

226
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:00,001
Hi.

227
00:12:04,077 --> 00:12:06,773
Is it not true that you went
to see Dr. Hartman

228
00:12:06,797 --> 00:12:08,760
for a simple prostate exam?

229
00:12:08,778 --> 00:12:10,500
No, I went for a flu shot.

230
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,591
At first, I thought he was nice
and that he was kind of handsome.

231
00:12:13,618 --> 00:12:14,840
I trusted him

232
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,943
and then, he told me to bend over.

233
00:12:21,118 --> 00:12:23,690
And then, I just felt like something was wrong.

234
00:12:32,306 --> 00:12:34,651
I tried to get him to stop,
but he kept saying,

235
00:12:34,665 --> 00:12:36,360
"Relax, I'm a doctor. "

236
00:12:36,387 --> 00:12:39,601
- This is ridiculous, that never happened.
- Sit down, you rapist!

237
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:42,721
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm supposed to wait
until I've heard everything.

238
00:12:42,757 --> 00:12:43,943
Go ahead, Mr. Griffin.

239
00:12:43,966 --> 00:12:46,100
And that's when things got bad.

240
00:12:54,378 --> 00:12:56,822
He made me feel so dirty.

241
00:13:00,677 --> 00:13:02,591
Relax...

242
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,912
I'm a doctor.

243
00:13:13,047 --> 00:13:15,293
Your Honor, I can't believe
you're even listening to this.

244
00:13:15,308 --> 00:13:17,132
For God's sake, you're a patient of mine.

245
00:13:17,158 --> 00:13:19,710
I gave you a prostate exam last year,
don't you remember?

246
00:13:19,728 --> 00:13:20,823
Come to think of it,

247
00:13:20,865 --> 00:13:22,950
I remember it as a pretty standard exam.

248
00:13:22,977 --> 00:13:24,343
Are you sure, Judge?

249
00:13:24,358 --> 00:13:28,083
Are you sure it wasn't all evil and grainy
and black and white? Think about it.

250
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,183
Relax.

251
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,802
I be a doctor.

252
00:13:41,045 --> 00:13:43,381
Guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty!

253
00:13:43,427 --> 00:13:46,823
Dr. Hartman, your medical license
is hereby revoked.

254
00:13:46,857 --> 00:13:48,213
That's outrageous!

255
00:13:48,246 --> 00:13:52,261
God, I've looked forward to this moment
more than the second coming of Jesus.

256
00:13:52,297 --> 00:13:54,880
Okay, everybody, uh,
I know you were expecting something else,

257
00:13:54,905 --> 00:13:58,971
but as science will tell you,
people were a lot shorter 2,000 years ago.

258
00:13:59,107 --> 00:14:03,012
So let's try to be adult about this.
Uh, no snickering and... Hey!

259
00:14:03,637 --> 00:14:05,203
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

260
00:14:05,737 --> 00:14:07,611
Okay, so if we can all be mature...

261
00:14:07,635 --> 00:14:10,931
give me the gum,
we can all get through this a lot faster.

262
00:14:13,027 --> 00:14:15,472
I have so much fun
when we hang out, Lois,

263
00:14:15,498 --> 00:14:16,821
and I love your hair.

264
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:19,043
We should make up a name
for your hair color.

265
00:14:19,087 --> 00:14:21,682
We could call it, like, like,
strawberry sunset

266
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,340
or ginger maiden,

267
00:14:23,366 --> 00:14:26,980
o- o-or-or one of those hair color names
that's a random noun, like

268
00:14:27,016 --> 00:14:28,400
like temptress.

269
00:14:28,438 --> 00:14:30,762
Oh, at some point,
you have to let me braid it!

270
00:14:31,007 --> 00:14:33,073
Lois, what are you doing?

271
00:14:38,685 --> 00:14:40,160
Oh, my God.

272
00:14:40,187 --> 00:14:42,733
Oh, my God, what's happening to me?

273
00:14:42,797 --> 00:14:45,580
I'm like that Texas woman
who gave her son brain damage

274
00:14:45,605 --> 00:14:50,100
by holding him underwater.
I'm just like Barbara Bush!

275
00:14:52,376 --> 00:14:55,143
Brian, what kind of a mother
has homicidal thoughts

276
00:14:55,165 --> 00:14:58,471
about her own baby?
I'm a horrible person.

277
00:14:58,488 --> 00:14:59,862
Lois, you're just exhausted.

278
00:14:59,877 --> 00:15:03,261
Somehow, you've got to break Stewie
of this new over dependence on you.

279
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:05,300
Well, it's worth a try.

280
00:15:05,328 --> 00:15:07,641
Lois, I've got a surprise for you.

281
00:15:07,676 --> 00:15:11,042
You and I are going to see Eddie Money!

282
00:15:11,096 --> 00:15:14,320
Two tickets, won'em on the radio.
We're gonna have a ball.

283
00:15:14,428 --> 00:15:16,280
God, he's like a totally different person,

284
00:15:16,306 --> 00:15:18,310
like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Sulu.

285
00:15:20,556 --> 00:15:23,913
Oh, no, I never should have
drank those chemicals.

286
00:15:24,805 --> 00:15:25,941
Hello.

287
00:15:28,357 --> 00:15:32,763
Peter, congratulations on taking down
that monster Dr. Hartman.

288
00:15:32,785 --> 00:15:34,830
Yeah, what'd you do with
your pain and suffering money?

289
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:36,312
I got collagen.

290
00:15:36,646 --> 00:15:38,941
Hey, Lois, want to make out?

291
00:15:39,046 --> 00:15:42,783
Yeah, what do you think
of new sexy lips Peter?

292
00:15:42,877 --> 00:15:46,300
Yeah.
This is your life from now on.

293
00:15:46,337 --> 00:15:48,311
Enjoy it, lucky wife.

294
00:15:48,358 --> 00:15:52,022
I tell you, boys, this is a victory
not just for my anus but for anuses...

295
00:15:52,056 --> 00:15:53,813
Oh, hang on, I got to go pee.

296
00:15:54,728 --> 00:15:57,761
That's a lot better. So, anyway, this is a...
Oh, I got to take a leak.

297
00:15:58,627 --> 00:16:00,450
There we go.
Oh, pee time.

298
00:16:02,217 --> 00:16:05,152
Peter, you're urinating unusually frequently.

299
00:16:05,196 --> 00:16:06,331
Yeah, what gives?

300
00:16:06,368 --> 00:16:08,892
If it's gale-force peeing you be doing,

301
00:16:08,918 --> 00:16:11,893
it could mean you've got
barnacles on your prostate.

302
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:14,532
Best have sick bay check below your decks.

303
00:16:14,587 --> 00:16:18,021
Wait a minute. Are you telling me
I need a prostate exam?

304
00:16:18,047 --> 00:16:21,261
Aye, and soon,
before your rudder jams with flotsam

305
00:16:21,287 --> 00:16:24,012
and you're dropping anchor
without an order from the captain.

306
00:16:24,205 --> 00:16:26,071
How are you liking
all these nautical puns?

307
00:16:26,097 --> 00:16:27,982
- Cute. - Not bad.
- Somewhat entertaining.

308
00:16:28,006 --> 00:16:29,973
My God, I'd better see a doctor.

309
00:16:30,006 --> 00:16:33,370
But no doctor in town
will see you after that lawsuit.

310
00:16:33,395 --> 00:16:35,780
Well, then, I'll just find
a doctor out of town.

311
00:16:35,815 --> 00:16:37,911
Listen, uh, I know
I'm not a regular patient,

312
00:16:37,936 --> 00:16:40,320
but I think I have some
trouble with my prostate.

313
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:43,913
- So can you help me out, Dr. McCoy?
- What, so you can sue me, too?

314
00:16:43,938 --> 00:16:47,853
- Oh, come on, it'll only take a sec.
- Forget it. I'm a doctor, not a patsy.

315
00:16:48,245 --> 00:16:49,690
Hello.

316
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:55,223
Lois, what are you doing?
I want to sleep in your bed.

317
00:16:55,255 --> 00:16:57,762
Good night, honey.
I love you.

318
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,790
This is for your own good.

319
00:16:59,838 --> 00:17:01,832
Lois, wh-wh-where are you going?

320
00:17:01,856 --> 00:17:03,711
Lois... Lois.

321
00:17:03,758 --> 00:17:04,992
Lois, answer me!

322
00:17:05,028 --> 00:17:07,742
Damn you, I will not be ignored!
Get back in here!

323
00:17:07,775 --> 00:17:10,112
Get back in here and love me!

324
00:17:12,217 --> 00:17:14,301
Lois!

325
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,663
Maybe I should go in. He's so upset.

326
00:17:17,695 --> 00:17:21,440
He's just being melodramatic. You've got
to ignore it if you really want to help him.

327
00:17:21,677 --> 00:17:24,201
- Are you flexing?
- What, me?

328
00:17:24,225 --> 00:17:27,491
Ha, no.
Wha... why-why would I be flexing?

329
00:17:27,545 --> 00:17:29,873
I mean, I have, uh,
sort of been hitting the gym,

330
00:17:29,908 --> 00:17:32,952
so uh, if-if you wanted
to see how it's going...

331
00:17:35,505 --> 00:17:37,073
What am I going to do, Seamus?

332
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:40,443
Dr. Hartman is my only hope,
and there's no way he's going to see me.

333
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,653
Well, you best come up
with something, Peter.

334
00:17:42,675 --> 00:17:45,070
Otherwise, this will happen
to your prostate.

335
00:17:47,436 --> 00:17:50,991
You just, uh, carry a picture
of a diseased prostate around with you?

336
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:53,401
Never know when it's going
to come up in conversation

337
00:17:53,437 --> 00:17:55,793
and then, who's the
one who's prepared?

338
00:17:55,816 --> 00:17:57,630
I've also got a map of Middle Earth,

339
00:17:57,656 --> 00:17:59,142
a cat doing a pull-up,

340
00:17:59,187 --> 00:18:00,961
and the guys from Primus.

341
00:18:01,468 --> 00:18:03,502
These poster jokes
doing anything for you?

342
00:18:03,545 --> 00:18:05,862
- Eh, hit and miss.
- We should hang out more.

343
00:18:07,738 --> 00:18:10,800
I need her love.
I need her love, and she's ignoring me.

344
00:18:10,847 --> 00:18:13,073
Well, let's see her try to ignore this.

345
00:18:16,877 --> 00:18:18,532
Lois, help!

346
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:22,752
I ate this whole jar of pills that
look like candy and now I feel sick.

347
00:18:23,258 --> 00:18:26,050
- You look like a jackass.
- Can't hear you, Brian. I'm dead.

348
00:18:26,096 --> 00:18:27,220
All right.

349
00:18:30,768 --> 00:18:32,130
What did you do?

350
00:18:34,187 --> 00:18:37,013
Oh, that is so not cool.

351
00:18:39,015 --> 00:18:41,972
Mommy, I'm dying!
I'm dying!

352
00:18:42,007 --> 00:18:44,213
I said I'm dying!
Hey!

353
00:18:44,255 --> 00:18:45,711
I'm dyin'up here.

354
00:18:45,747 --> 00:18:48,991
What is this? A Tommy Lee pool party?
Come on, Lois, get with the...

355
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,161
Oh, my God.
Stewie, are you all right?

356
00:18:59,246 --> 00:19:01,412
Oh, my sweet baby.

357
00:19:01,456 --> 00:19:05,663
And to think I ignored your cries
for attention. I'm so sorry, honey.

358
00:19:05,707 --> 00:19:09,302
Never again, Stewie. I'm going to give
you all the love you could ever want.

359
00:19:12,477 --> 00:19:15,010
Forget it, you neglectful,
swag-bellied measle.

360
00:19:15,037 --> 00:19:17,882
You had your chance and you blew it.
Well, now you're too late.

361
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:20,901
I hope they charge you with
child abuse for my broken arm.

362
00:19:20,936 --> 00:19:24,100
I'll testify against you
just like I did against Michael Jackson.

363
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:27,340
Stewie, did Mr. Jackson behave
inappropriately toward you?

364
00:19:27,385 --> 00:19:30,040
Well, yes, but the worst part
was he never called back.

365
00:19:31,778 --> 00:19:35,303
No, but in all seriousness, yeah,
he was actually pretty aggressive.

366
00:19:39,447 --> 00:19:42,630
- Uh, package for Dr. Hartman?
- All right, where's the package?

367
00:19:42,656 --> 00:19:43,743
Here it is.

368
00:19:43,778 --> 00:19:47,620
Uh, so why don't you go ahead and
open it up and reach on in there?

369
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,171
It's probably cookies or something.

370
00:19:49,197 --> 00:19:51,563
Wait a minute, there's
something strange about this.

371
00:19:51,598 --> 00:19:54,252
I wasn't expecting any package.
Who are you?

372
00:19:54,757 --> 00:19:55,702
Griffin!

373
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:57,291
You got to help me, Dr. Hartman.

374
00:19:57,308 --> 00:19:59,953
I think there may actually be
something wrong with my prostate.

375
00:19:59,975 --> 00:20:02,743
Well, don't look at me.
I lost my license, thanks to you.

376
00:20:02,765 --> 00:20:05,141
Look, I-I know what I did was wrong, but

377
00:20:05,198 --> 00:20:07,250
you're the only one I can turn to.

378
00:20:07,298 --> 00:20:11,390
So, I'm asking you...
as a man with no more options...

379
00:20:11,657 --> 00:20:13,922
will you take a look in my ass?

380
00:20:14,537 --> 00:20:16,631
Despite everything that's happened,

381
00:20:16,665 --> 00:20:19,711
I suppose I can't ignore
my Hippocratic oath.

382
00:20:19,755 --> 00:20:21,512
All right, drop your pants.

383
00:20:23,777 --> 00:20:27,463
Oh, well, this is nothing. Just a little
swelling. Probably a minor infection.

384
00:20:27,506 --> 00:20:29,331
Looks like there's some blockage.

385
00:20:29,366 --> 00:20:30,753
What the devil is that?

386
00:20:30,775 --> 00:20:32,321
<i>Hello.</i>

387
00:20:34,718 --> 00:20:38,570
Dr. Hartman,
your license is hereby reinstated.

388
00:20:39,848 --> 00:20:42,512
Oh, I'm so glad you two
worked things out.

389
00:20:42,545 --> 00:20:45,121
And to think I actually thought
you raped me.

390
00:20:45,157 --> 00:20:47,370
Well, I was going to,
but you ran out of the room.

391
00:20:47,397 --> 00:20:48,301
What?

392
00:21:01,767 --> 00:21:06,331
<i>Family Guy was recorded on tape
before a live audience.</i>
