<i>This Tuesday on Lifetime,</i>

5
00:00:36,126 --> 00:00:39,212
<i>Valerie Bertinelli stars
in a Lifetime original movie.</i>

6
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:42,203
You know, Doctor, you said
you were going to cure my cancer,

7
00:00:42,216 --> 00:00:43,921
but all you did was rape me!

8
00:00:43,932 --> 00:00:46,144
I'm starting to think
I don't have cancer at all.

9
00:00:46,156 --> 00:00:48,047
Well, you're right, about the rape part,

10
00:00:48,068 --> 00:00:50,240
but I'm sorry, you still do have cancer.

11
00:00:52,113 --> 00:00:53,890
<i>Valerie Bertinelli in...</i>

12
00:00:57,653 --> 00:01:01,795
Brian, did you know that
Daryl Hannah has one wooden finger?

13
00:01:01,826 --> 00:01:03,505
Really? Where did you read that?

14
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:05,732
- In Pee-opple magazine.
- Huh.

15
00:01:05,945 --> 00:01:08,531
Jillian, can you, uh, run and
get me a beer from the kitchen?

16
00:01:08,545 --> 00:01:10,251
Oh, yeah, sure, no problem.

17
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,770
Hey, Jillian, you and Brian
got big plans tonight?

18
00:01:12,798 --> 00:01:15,681
Yeah. Brian's taking me
to Disney On Ice.

19
00:01:16,415 --> 00:01:18,113
- I want to go.
- Uh...

20
00:01:18,148 --> 00:01:20,571
Well, Peter, if you want,
you can have my ticket.

21
00:01:20,607 --> 00:01:23,590
What? But, Brian,
I thought you wanted to go?

22
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:27,142
Stitch is going to do a skating duet
with Sebastian the Crab.

23
00:01:27,956 --> 00:01:29,730
It's not really my cup of tea.

24
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,502
Plus, Walt Disney was
an outspoken anti-Semite.

25
00:01:32,756 --> 00:01:37,562
So, Disney, ABC, ESPN, Touchstone...
these would all be things to avoid.

26
00:01:37,688 --> 00:01:39,392
Well, oh, okay.

27
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:42,711
Um, Peter, you want to go
see Disney On Ice?

28
00:01:47,165 --> 00:01:48,670
Oh, God, yes!

29
00:01:48,705 --> 00:01:52,031
I'll be right back. I'm going to go
put on my Donald Duck costume.

30
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,862
Ready.

31
00:01:59,508 --> 00:02:03,120
Meg, lend me 25 cents
so I can ride the toy airplane outside

32
00:02:03,138 --> 00:02:05,041
and make the immigrant kids jealous.

33
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:07,903
Look at me!

34
00:02:07,938 --> 00:02:12,222
I'm having a magical aerial adventure
because my family has disposable income.

35
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:13,300
Here you go.

36
00:02:13,335 --> 00:02:14,423
What is this?

37
00:02:14,445 --> 00:02:16,621
It's a pamphlet on why I'm bombing you.

38
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:18,411
- Hey, Meg.
- Hi, Carl.

39
00:02:18,425 --> 00:02:21,772
How come you're always here by yourself?
Are you like a bitch or something?

40
00:02:21,786 --> 00:02:23,600
- No, I have friends.
- Oh.

41
00:02:23,865 --> 00:02:25,951
Well, you should bring
some of them in here.

42
00:02:25,978 --> 00:02:28,010
- Any of them have braces?
- Yeah.

43
00:02:28,046 --> 00:02:29,520
I love braces.

44
00:02:29,627 --> 00:02:31,083
My mom has 'em.

45
00:02:32,086 --> 00:02:33,571
Well, listen, um...

46
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:36,582
I need disposable diapers,
but it looks like you're out.

47
00:02:36,596 --> 00:02:38,970
Oh, no, I got some in the stockroom.
Hang on.

48
00:02:39,385 --> 00:02:41,990
Oh, Vince Vaughn's on the cover
of Entertainment Weekly.

49
00:02:42,007 --> 00:02:44,361
Here's my summary
of every Vince Vaughn movie:

50
00:02:44,388 --> 00:02:46,722
"Oh, I'm incapable
of loving another person."

51
00:02:46,736 --> 00:02:48,580
"Oh, wait, no, I'm not. The end."

52
00:02:48,597 --> 00:02:50,743
I don't even want to look at his face.

53
00:02:51,936 --> 00:02:54,152
Stewie, what the hell are you doing?!

54
00:02:54,176 --> 00:02:56,723
Oh, my God!
Now I've got to clean up this up!

55
00:02:59,655 --> 00:03:02,252
- Carl, I'm so sorry.
- Wow, Meg,

56
00:03:02,268 --> 00:03:04,540
you alphabetized all the magazines.

57
00:03:04,556 --> 00:03:06,773
- Hey, you want a job?
- What? Me?

58
00:03:07,047 --> 00:03:10,430
- Here? Yeah, sure!
- Great. You start tomorrow.

59
00:03:14,685 --> 00:03:16,670
- Hey, Chris.
- Hey, Meg.

60
00:03:17,185 --> 00:03:19,863
I don't have any money
so I'm going to have to pay

61
00:03:19,876 --> 00:03:22,132
for these comic books with my poo.

62
00:03:22,148 --> 00:03:25,013
Chris, how come you don't have any
money? I thought you had a paper route.

63
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:28,401
Well, I'm taking a sabbatical
to focus on my pottery.

64
00:03:28,415 --> 00:03:29,121
Oh.

65
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:32,383
- How's that working out?
- Not good, Meg, not good.

66
00:03:32,395 --> 00:03:35,400
Well, maybe I can talk to Carl
and get you a job here.

67
00:03:35,426 --> 00:03:37,763
- You could do that?!
- Absolutely.

68
00:03:37,798 --> 00:03:39,400
Carl totally trusts me.

69
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:43,751
You and I will be the best brother-sister
team since Maggie and Jake Gyllenhaal.

70
00:03:43,825 --> 00:03:47,020
- I'm more off-putting.
- No, I'm more off-putting.

71
00:03:47,045 --> 00:03:49,533
I'm more unattractive
to put in a lead role.

72
00:03:49,546 --> 00:03:51,661
Well, I'm a bigger box office drag.

73
00:03:51,686 --> 00:03:53,592
Kids, kids. You're both...

74
00:03:53,645 --> 00:03:55,153
...just awful.

75
00:03:58,258 --> 00:03:59,493
Oh, hi, Brian.

76
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:01,520
I thought you were spending
the day with Jillian.

77
00:04:01,538 --> 00:04:03,890
I was, but Peter took her off my hands.

78
00:04:03,918 --> 00:04:06,642
Perfect timing. I've been feeling
a little smothered lately.

79
00:04:06,655 --> 00:04:08,933
Plus, it's given me a chance
to work on my novel.

80
00:04:08,956 --> 00:04:11,792
- And I finally have a title.
- Oh, what is it?

81
00:04:11,815 --> 00:04:14,362
"Faster Than the Speed of Love."

82
00:04:17,996 --> 00:04:20,443
That is the worst title I've ever heard.

83
00:04:20,475 --> 00:04:23,533
No, it's the story of a boy
who has to rescue his father,

84
00:04:23,547 --> 00:04:27,242
who's a pilot, that's been taken captive
by a militant Islamic country.

85
00:04:28,326 --> 00:04:31,040
- That's the movie Iron Eagle!
- What?

86
00:04:31,665 --> 00:04:33,391
Is that, is that a recent film?

87
00:04:34,115 --> 00:04:36,380
They made three sequels!

88
00:04:36,486 --> 00:04:40,201
Yeah, well, in mine, the boy's gotta
gather all these old World War II pilots

89
00:04:40,225 --> 00:04:42,263
to help him rescue his father.

90
00:04:42,358 --> 00:04:44,772
That's one of the sequels!

91
00:04:46,688 --> 00:04:48,183
Well, well, in mine,

92
00:04:48,217 --> 00:04:51,971
one of the World War II guys is Japanese,
but they accept him anyway.

93
00:04:53,295 --> 00:04:55,721
I'm going to pee in my pants!

94
00:04:58,278 --> 00:05:01,470
Boy, it sure is fun
hanging out with you, Peter.

95
00:05:04,007 --> 00:05:06,881
That means "thank you"
in my new language I'm inventing.

96
00:05:07,926 --> 00:05:10,472
Anyway, all I was saying is,
if you think about it,

97
00:05:10,495 --> 00:05:12,850
it shouldn't have been
Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

98
00:05:12,868 --> 00:05:15,403
It should've been
Ferris Bueller's Day On,

99
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,361
'cause that was all the stuff
he wanted to do.

100
00:05:17,377 --> 00:05:22,263
Yeah. And he was so "on" that day,
so it kind of works on two levels.

101
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:25,540
Well, I don't know what you mean by
that, but how about that Cameron, huh?

102
00:05:25,568 --> 00:05:27,821
- Oh, definitely.
- Am I right?

103
00:05:27,857 --> 00:05:29,700
It was his day off, too.

104
00:05:29,715 --> 00:05:31,873
That is just what I was going to...
His day off...

105
00:05:31,888 --> 00:05:35,201
that is just what I was going to say.
You know, you are a catch, young lady.

106
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,111
You know that?

107
00:05:36,138 --> 00:05:38,641
I don't know when the hell
Brian is going to open his eyes

108
00:05:38,645 --> 00:05:40,053
and get serious with you.

109
00:05:40,568 --> 00:05:42,362
I really wish he would.

110
00:05:42,388 --> 00:05:45,592
It'd be so great if we were
at least living together.

111
00:05:45,605 --> 00:05:47,953
Well, you need to just lay it
on the line with him.

112
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:50,080
Either he commits to you,
or you're gone.

113
00:05:50,148 --> 00:05:52,461
What the hell did you do?!

114
00:05:52,496 --> 00:05:55,480
Because of what you said,
Jillian wants us to move in together!

115
00:05:55,486 --> 00:05:58,370
Well, I think you should, Brian.
She's beautiful, she's funny,

116
00:05:58,395 --> 00:06:01,092
and she is smart as the day is wide.

117
00:06:01,105 --> 00:06:05,030
Don't you understand?! I don't want a
committed relationship with Jillian.

118
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,730
Well, it sounds like she does.

119
00:06:06,746 --> 00:06:09,910
And if you're never going to get serious,
then you're not being fair to her.

120
00:06:09,926 --> 00:06:12,002
You don't really think
I'm like that, do you?

121
00:06:12,035 --> 00:06:13,211
Prove me wrong.

122
00:06:13,735 --> 00:06:14,891
All right, I will, Lois.

123
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:18,370
I will ask her to move in with me.
and you'll see, I've got what it takes.

124
00:06:22,826 --> 00:06:26,860
Boy, you know, I gotta tell you, Jillian,
this move is really working out great.

125
00:06:26,885 --> 00:06:29,412
- It just feels right, you know.
- Cool!

126
00:06:29,447 --> 00:06:31,893
- Rock on, Brian!
- Okay, done.

127
00:06:35,058 --> 00:06:36,690
Stewie. Hey. What's up?

128
00:06:36,706 --> 00:06:39,003
Oh, I was just on my way back
from the cobbler.

129
00:06:39,015 --> 00:06:40,990
Figured before I stopped
by the apothecary,

130
00:06:41,007 --> 00:06:43,042
I'd come here, and then
it's off to the haberdasher.

131
00:06:43,715 --> 00:06:46,641
These turn-of-the-century business jokes
doing anything for you?

132
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:47,531
Not really.

133
00:06:47,606 --> 00:06:49,792
- Did you use the jokes?
- Yeah, they're not landing.

134
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:53,640
Got your mail. So, how's it going?

135
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,790
I tell you, Stewie, it's going great.

136
00:06:55,838 --> 00:06:58,530
And that's the worst part.
I can't afford the rent.

137
00:06:58,546 --> 00:07:00,800
I'll be lucky if I can make it
to the end of the month.

138
00:07:00,817 --> 00:07:02,810
Sounds like you need a roommate.

139
00:07:02,836 --> 00:07:04,301
Where did you get that kind of money?

140
00:07:04,327 --> 00:07:06,133
I picked up Chris's paper route.

141
00:07:09,235 --> 00:07:11,081
Oh, OshKosh B'Gosh,

142
00:07:11,095 --> 00:07:13,410
it's a brand-new paperboy.

143
00:07:13,445 --> 00:07:15,660
That's a mighty full sack
you're carrying.

144
00:07:15,673 --> 00:07:17,680
Piss off, you perverted old freak!

145
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:19,665
Oh, we got a fighter.

146
00:07:23,006 --> 00:07:25,475
Wow, you were almost in a dirt bike race?

147
00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:27,953
Yeah, yeah, I filled out
most of the paperwork, too.

148
00:07:27,965 --> 00:07:31,030
You are the coolest guy I have ever met.

149
00:07:31,048 --> 00:07:31,651
Yep.

150
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,052
Hey, guys.
Um...

151
00:07:33,068 --> 00:07:35,742
Chris, I need you to stack the boxes
in the back for me.

152
00:07:35,777 --> 00:07:38,361
Uh, you know what, Meg?
Why don't you do that?

153
00:07:38,398 --> 00:07:39,960
I need Chris up here with me.

154
00:07:39,977 --> 00:07:41,583
But the boxes are really heavy.

155
00:07:41,596 --> 00:07:43,542
Oh, that's 'cause there's
a bunch of stuff in them.

156
00:07:43,565 --> 00:07:45,031
Huh? Chris?

157
00:07:46,355 --> 00:07:47,061
Yeah.

158
00:07:47,815 --> 00:07:50,372
Uh, Chris, you ever see
the movie Cruel Intentions?

159
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:51,023
No.

160
00:07:51,045 --> 00:07:54,021
Oh, Selma Blair and
Sarah Michelle Gellar make out.

161
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,310
It's pretty hot.

162
00:07:55,478 --> 00:07:58,371
- 47 minutes, 16 seconds in.
- No way!

163
00:07:58,397 --> 00:08:00,233
Yeah, yeah.
You know what's another great movie?

164
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,641
Career Opportunities
with Jennifer Connelly.

165
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,931
I mean, that's one of
those movies that...

166
00:08:04,976 --> 00:08:07,033
I mean, she's really hot in it, but

167
00:08:07,065 --> 00:08:08,621
it's also a good movie.

168
00:08:08,837 --> 00:08:11,823
She was in A Beautiful Mind,
and I've gotta say,

169
00:08:11,838 --> 00:08:15,901
the direction was excellent but
I was very disappointed that she, um...

170
00:08:16,438 --> 00:08:18,990
wore clothes the entire film.

171
00:08:19,047 --> 00:08:20,503
Was she hot in it?

172
00:08:20,885 --> 00:08:25,511
Yeah, in the way that, like,
classy women with expensive clothing

173
00:08:25,537 --> 00:08:28,313
who never take the moff are hot,
you know?

174
00:08:29,037 --> 00:08:30,001
No.

175
00:08:30,115 --> 00:08:32,402
All right.
So, like, you see a hotgirl,

176
00:08:32,427 --> 00:08:35,172
and you're like, okay, I appreciate
your exterior beauty

177
00:08:35,188 --> 00:08:38,810
'cause you definitely worked at it
with the clothing, and the jewelry,

178
00:08:38,826 --> 00:08:42,401
and the makeup and stuff,
but secretly, I'm just like, hey, man...

179
00:08:43,238 --> 00:08:46,470
where is the chase and
how do I cut to it?

180
00:08:46,706 --> 00:08:48,280
Wow, you're smart.

181
00:08:50,306 --> 00:08:51,082
What?

182
00:08:54,957 --> 00:08:58,341
Listen, I hope you don't mind Stewie
staying with us for a little while.

183
00:08:58,365 --> 00:09:01,553
He, uh, he just gets really lonely
without me at home.

184
00:09:01,565 --> 00:09:05,203
You're so fatherly.
It really turns me on.

185
00:09:06,696 --> 00:09:10,482
<i>Brian, there's no more graham crackers!</i>

186
00:09:10,497 --> 00:09:11,863
They're in the cabinet!

187
00:09:11,895 --> 00:09:13,612
<i>I don't see them!</i>

188
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,461
They're right in front of you!
Which cabinet are you looking at?!

189
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:19,812
<i>- Can't you just come in here?!</i>
- No, I'm busy!

190
00:09:21,815 --> 00:09:23,711
<i>Oh, no!</i>

191
00:09:23,966 --> 00:09:26,572
<i>Oh, no, Brian!</i>

192
00:09:26,745 --> 00:09:27,842
<i>Oh, no!</i>

193
00:09:27,857 --> 00:09:31,883
<i>Oh, no!
Oh, Brian, we need paper towels!</i>

194
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:34,981
<I>Oh! Oh, it's going under the fridge!</i>

195
00:09:35,027 --> 00:09:36,020
<i>Oh!</i>

196
00:09:36,036 --> 00:09:37,412
Just use a dish towel!

197
00:09:37,426 --> 00:09:39,780
<i>There aren't any, Brian!
You need to come in here!</i>

198
00:09:39,806 --> 00:09:40,883
<i>Oh!</i>

199
00:09:40,906 --> 00:09:42,993
<i>We are going to have ants!</i>

200
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:50,171
Oh-ho, a hundred points!

201
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:51,771
Meg, clean up aisle two.

202
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,121
What the hell is this?!
I am not cleaning this up.

203
00:09:55,145 --> 00:09:57,833
Meg, less talkie, more sweepy.

204
00:09:57,855 --> 00:10:00,262
Shut up, Chris!
You can't tell me what to do.

205
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:02,850
Uh, actually, Meg,
as your supervisor, he can.

206
00:10:02,865 --> 00:10:04,052
Supervisor?

207
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:06,721
- Yeah, I promoted him this morning.
- Promoted me this morning.

208
00:10:06,727 --> 00:10:07,471
What?!

209
00:10:07,497 --> 00:10:10,573
Carl, you promised me that
assistant manager position.

210
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:12,262
Uh, Meg, things change.

211
00:10:12,336 --> 00:10:14,670
Hey, you ever see
Broken Lizard's Club Dread?

212
00:10:14,675 --> 00:10:15,492
No.

213
00:10:15,528 --> 00:10:18,280
Well, go see that movie
and absorb its message,

214
00:10:18,297 --> 00:10:20,422
and you'll get the gist
of what I'm talking about.

215
00:10:20,436 --> 00:10:23,202
- Carl, this isn't fair!
- All right, then, you're fired.

216
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,213
What?

217
00:10:24,565 --> 00:10:25,213
But...

218
00:10:25,385 --> 00:10:26,783
No, you can't...

219
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:32,433
Don't worry about it, Chris,
she'll be fine.

220
00:10:32,538 --> 00:10:36,470
Hey, by the way, you know who else
is hot in kind of a screwed up way?

221
00:10:36,515 --> 00:10:38,201
Mary Stuart Masterson.

222
00:10:38,235 --> 00:10:40,973
Yeah, yeah, in that sort of
"you think you could get her,"

223
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:43,150
"cause she could be your brother"
kind of thing.

224
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:46,701
Like, she's gettable, you know,
like, like, Elizabeth Shue.

225
00:10:46,726 --> 00:10:48,751
- Oh, I remember her.
- Yeah.

226
00:10:48,765 --> 00:10:53,823
You know, she was in Leaving Las Vegas
in addition to Adventures in Babysitting.

227
00:10:53,897 --> 00:10:57,853
One of those underrated actresses
that was always talented and beautiful,

228
00:10:57,867 --> 00:10:59,933
and never quite popped,
if you know the meaning.

229
00:10:59,946 --> 00:11:01,790
- Who, Elizabeth Shue?
- Yeah.

230
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:06,370
Like totally naked in, um,
Leaving Las Vegas.

231
00:11:06,435 --> 00:11:09,081
And, uh, still ,still so hot.

232
00:11:09,316 --> 00:11:10,440
Like, uh...

233
00:11:10,515 --> 00:11:13,620
- I don't see art films.
- Like, like, crazy hot.

234
00:11:13,675 --> 00:11:17,170
Yeah, it's about 39 minutes,
45 seconds in.

235
00:11:17,355 --> 00:11:18,952
It's a really exceptional sequence.

236
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:22,143
I mean, Nick Cage is poisoning himself
with alcohol.

237
00:11:22,196 --> 00:11:24,971
He's a failed writer
who just decides that,

238
00:11:24,998 --> 00:11:27,352
"Ooh, I'm going to have
a big last hurrah in Las Vegas."

239
00:11:27,408 --> 00:11:31,311
And then he meets a whore and pays her
a bunch of money to stay with him,

240
00:11:31,346 --> 00:11:34,672
uh, and have sex with him
while he murders himself slowly.

241
00:11:34,705 --> 00:11:36,452
And, you know, she's game for it, but

242
00:11:36,478 --> 00:11:39,780
she catches feelings midway through
and the whole thing changes.

243
00:11:39,937 --> 00:11:41,793
Wow, h-have youseen Cocktail?

244
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,190
- Uh, yeah, yeah.
- She was in that.

245
00:11:44,305 --> 00:11:46,451
- She was in that.
- Yeah.

246
00:11:54,857 --> 00:11:58,151
- Ah, ah, you like that?
- Yeah, it's rad!

247
00:11:58,177 --> 00:12:00,851
Don't talk, please.
Hang on, let me get a condom.

248
00:12:01,016 --> 00:12:03,313
Brian, are you guys up?

249
00:12:03,345 --> 00:12:05,653
Stewie, what the hell are you doing?
Go back to bed.

250
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:07,242
But I'm not tired.

251
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:09,263
And I'm lonely.

252
00:12:09,435 --> 00:12:11,893
Oh, come get in bed with us.

253
00:12:11,936 --> 00:12:13,713
Ooh, all right, "Dear Penthouse Forum."

254
00:12:13,725 --> 00:12:15,672
No, no, Stewie, go away!

255
00:12:15,697 --> 00:12:17,483
Brian, don't be mean to him.

256
00:12:17,506 --> 00:12:20,662
Yes, Brian, if you're mean to me,
I'll stop paying the rent.

257
00:12:20,688 --> 00:12:22,990
- What did he say?
- Uh, nothing.

258
00:12:23,015 --> 00:12:26,802
That's right, I'm paying
Mr. Lickity-self's half of the rent.

259
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:28,273
Is that true?

260
00:12:28,286 --> 00:12:30,552
All right, yes, fine, it's true!

261
00:12:30,588 --> 00:12:32,380
Why didn't you say anything?

262
00:12:32,398 --> 00:12:36,652
Because you wanted me to move in so
badly, and God knows, I didn't want to...

263
00:12:36,678 --> 00:12:37,402
Wait...

264
00:12:37,587 --> 00:12:39,803
You didn't want to move in with me?

265
00:12:39,988 --> 00:12:41,991
Well, honestly, no.

266
00:12:42,148 --> 00:12:45,920
Oh, my God! I've never felt so stupid!

267
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:46,932
- Really?
- Really?

268
00:12:46,956 --> 00:12:49,562
Well, I don't want to be
your guilty burden, Brian!

269
00:12:49,588 --> 00:12:50,722
We're through!

270
00:12:51,506 --> 00:12:52,672
Jillian, wait!

271
00:12:53,025 --> 00:12:53,950
Damn it.

272
00:12:53,998 --> 00:12:56,800
I'm sorry, Brian.
You'll feel better in the morning.

273
00:13:02,288 --> 00:13:03,521
She's gone.

274
00:13:03,565 --> 00:13:04,930
Jillian's gone.

275
00:13:04,956 --> 00:13:06,653
Look, Brian, I know you're upset now,

276
00:13:06,668 --> 00:13:09,393
but I think it's important
to see things in perspective.

277
00:13:09,507 --> 00:13:12,730
Remember when Alex P. Keaton
lost his girlfriend?

278
00:13:13,007 --> 00:13:15,500
And then he got another one,
and everything was all right?

279
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,262
And then he got Parkinson's.

280
00:13:18,758 --> 00:13:19,680
Yikes.

281
00:13:19,727 --> 00:13:21,433
You know, Stewie, you're right.

282
00:13:21,456 --> 00:13:23,770
This is not a loss, it's an opportunity.

283
00:13:23,807 --> 00:13:26,831
I'm free now.
I've got my own place, no attachments.

284
00:13:26,866 --> 00:13:31,053
There you are. That's just the kind
of can-do spirit that built this nation.

285
00:13:31,168 --> 00:13:33,940
"We hold these truths
to be self-evident,"

286
00:13:33,956 --> 00:13:36,193
"that all men are created equal."

287
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:39,030
- Except the Jews.
- Franklin, for the fifth time,

288
00:13:39,057 --> 00:13:42,053
I'm sorry you overpaid for your house,
but it's not going in.

289
00:13:42,065 --> 00:13:44,910
- You'll be sorry.
- Noted. Moving on.

290
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:50,100
So, Meg, any luck finding another job?

291
00:13:50,135 --> 00:13:50,901
No.

292
00:13:50,915 --> 00:13:53,031
Hardly anybody's hiring right now.

293
00:13:53,055 --> 00:13:56,621
The only job I could find was for
a phone sex line, and I sucked at it.

294
00:13:56,738 --> 00:13:58,070
What am I wearing?

295
00:13:58,147 --> 00:13:59,133
Um...

296
00:13:59,265 --> 00:14:00,312
a hat...

297
00:14:00,566 --> 00:14:01,760
and...

298
00:14:02,085 --> 00:14:03,173
glasses.

299
00:14:03,565 --> 00:14:05,003
What kind of underwear?

300
00:14:05,088 --> 00:14:06,152
Um...

301
00:14:06,395 --> 00:14:07,623
I don't know.

302
00:14:07,678 --> 00:14:09,481
Big underwear, I guess.

303
00:14:09,855 --> 00:14:11,163
I'm sorry, what?

304
00:14:11,407 --> 00:14:13,333
Oh, what would I do to you?

305
00:14:13,408 --> 00:14:14,691
Well, um...

306
00:14:15,436 --> 00:14:18,001
I guess maybe we'd get pizza.

307
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:19,051
And...

308
00:14:19,098 --> 00:14:20,781
we could watch House.

309
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:23,432
All right, I am totally flaccid,
but thank you anyway, m'am,

310
00:14:23,456 --> 00:14:24,903
I appreciated your time.

311
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:26,641
Mom, check it out!

312
00:14:26,698 --> 00:14:31,171
I just got my paycheck and my salary's
doubled ever since Meg got fired.

313
00:14:31,216 --> 00:14:33,401
Oh, shut up, you bastard!

314
00:14:33,585 --> 00:14:35,761
Chris, we should have a talk about Meg.

315
00:14:35,795 --> 00:14:37,933
She's really upset that she got fired.

316
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:41,042
Gee, I didn't realize working at
the store meant that much to her.

317
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:44,712
You know, it would mean the world to her
if she could get her job back.

318
00:14:44,746 --> 00:14:47,962
And you'd be one terrific brother
if you could help her.

319
00:14:47,995 --> 00:14:50,131
Well, gosh, Mom, I'll sure try.

320
00:14:50,176 --> 00:14:51,232
Poor Meg.

321
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:55,572
She got a worse deal than that
no-armed baseball player, Bucky LaGrange.

322
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:59,012
<i>Ground ball to shortstop.
The throw is to second,</i>

323
00:14:59,057 --> 00:15:03,193
<i>and again, the ball sails past LaGrange
into right field.</i>

324
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:07,983
<i>The runners will score and a cascade
of "boos" rain down from the stands</i>

325
00:15:08,016 --> 00:15:12,361
<i>as clearly the fans' sympathy
for this scrappy, little no-armed man</i>

326
00:15:12,395 --> 00:15:13,441
<i>has run out.</i>

327
00:15:13,457 --> 00:15:15,581
<i>Now, granted the throw was a little wide,</i>

328
00:15:15,618 --> 00:15:18,822
<i>but you've got to believe that a
two-armed player would've made the catch.</i>

329
00:15:18,878 --> 00:15:22,220
<i>In fact a one-armed player
would have at least had a shot at it,</i>

330
00:15:22,266 --> 00:15:24,952
<i>which calls to mind
the question once again,</i>

331
00:15:25,018 --> 00:15:28,493
<i>why, with all the two-armed youngsters
waiting in the minor leagues,</i>

332
00:15:28,518 --> 00:15:31,200
<i>does this team stick with
an arm-less second baseman?</i>

333
00:15:31,246 --> 00:15:35,980
<i>- And he hasn't had a hit in ever.
- In ever, Jerry. In ever.</i>

334
00:15:42,177 --> 00:15:44,982
What the hell?! What are you people
doing in my apartment?

335
00:15:45,038 --> 00:15:46,340
Hey!

336
00:15:46,368 --> 00:15:47,660
You made it.

337
00:15:47,677 --> 00:15:49,240
What is all this? What's going on?

338
00:15:49,256 --> 00:15:50,973
You, that's what's going on.

339
00:15:50,996 --> 00:15:52,700
Come on, time for you to meet some women

340
00:15:52,716 --> 00:15:54,722
who are going to make you forget
about Jillian.

341
00:15:55,395 --> 00:15:57,251
Looks like there's
a lot of gay guys here.

342
00:15:57,268 --> 00:15:59,460
Yeah, everybody's having a good time.

343
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,010
Brian, I want to introduce you to Joanna.

344
00:16:02,036 --> 00:16:04,390
Look out for this one,
she's a bit of a card.

345
00:16:04,417 --> 00:16:06,360
Okay, here's one for you.

346
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:09,460
What food can't make up its mind?

347
00:16:10,027 --> 00:16:11,320
This is going to be good.

348
00:16:13,195 --> 00:16:14,690
A waffle.

349
00:16:20,527 --> 00:16:21,562
This one.

350
00:16:21,585 --> 00:16:23,510
Didn't I warn you, right?

351
00:16:23,575 --> 00:16:24,483
Right?

352
00:16:29,245 --> 00:16:31,600
How are you still single?

353
00:16:34,367 --> 00:16:36,583
Hey there, buddy.
Check it out. Check it out.

354
00:16:36,838 --> 00:16:39,402
I put a cruller in the Jerry's Kids' jar.

355
00:16:39,595 --> 00:16:42,142
- I thought that would be funny.
- That is hilarious, but, 

356
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,932
Carl, I want you to hire my sister back.

357
00:16:44,978 --> 00:16:48,280
No, Chris, she's a pain in the ass.
I-I don't want her back in here.

358
00:16:48,325 --> 00:16:50,451
Well, that's a shame, because

359
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:52,953
I watched Event Horizon last night.

360
00:16:52,977 --> 00:16:55,270
No way! We have to talk about it!

361
00:16:55,287 --> 00:16:58,091
Yeah, well, my memory is,
uh, kind of hazy.

362
00:16:58,108 --> 00:17:00,842
We have to talk about every scene, man!

363
00:17:00,868 --> 00:17:01,603
Hey, hey, hey!

364
00:17:01,635 --> 00:17:04,800
Remember when
Jack Noseworthy's eyes explode?

365
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:06,152
Wasn't that awesome?!

366
00:17:06,185 --> 00:17:08,333
Please agree with me that
that was awesome!

367
00:17:08,357 --> 00:17:11,313
Well, if you hire Meg back,
maybe I'll have an opinion.

368
00:17:11,325 --> 00:17:13,183
She's hired, she's hired!

369
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:14,681
What do you think of it?

370
00:17:14,705 --> 00:17:17,000
- It was awesome!
- Wasn't it awesome?!

371
00:17:17,016 --> 00:17:20,822
- It was totally awesome!
- It was the most awesome thing ever!

372
00:17:20,865 --> 00:17:21,941
Hug me!

373
00:17:25,415 --> 00:17:27,021
Hey, how you doing, Brian?

374
00:17:27,048 --> 00:17:27,903
Lousy.

375
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,910
I know who can cheer you up.

376
00:17:30,177 --> 00:17:32,371
The robot from Space Camp.

377
00:17:32,406 --> 00:17:35,472
<i>Brian and Jinx are friends.</i>

378
00:17:35,506 --> 00:17:36,670
Get that out of here.

379
00:17:36,687 --> 00:17:39,021
Okay, how about the robot from Rocky IV?

380
00:17:51,648 --> 00:17:54,261
Look, Stewie, get these
stupid '80s movie robots out of here,

381
00:17:54,278 --> 00:17:55,461
and leave me alone.

382
00:17:55,526 --> 00:17:57,420
It's all your fault that Jillian's gone.

383
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:58,801
My fault?!

384
00:17:58,855 --> 00:18:01,220
Brian, you've got no one
to blame but yourself.

385
00:18:01,295 --> 00:18:03,410
You let the fat man talk you
into moving out.

386
00:18:03,425 --> 00:18:04,881
You let Jillian walk out the door.

387
00:18:04,896 --> 00:18:06,680
Stop getting pushed around.

388
00:18:06,736 --> 00:18:07,792
Be a man.

389
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:09,521
If you want her, go get her.

390
00:18:09,596 --> 00:18:10,700
You know something?

391
00:18:10,738 --> 00:18:13,332
You are absolutely right.
It is time for me

392
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:15,350
 to take charge of my own life.

393
00:18:15,516 --> 00:18:16,820
Stand aside,

394
00:18:16,857 --> 00:18:18,823
I've got to get my girl back.

395
00:18:20,195 --> 00:18:21,753
Go get her, Brian.

396
00:18:35,146 --> 00:18:36,463
Uh, hi.

397
00:18:36,597 --> 00:18:38,481
Hi, Brian.

398
00:18:38,547 --> 00:18:39,901
What are you doing here?

399
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:40,752
Jillian,

400
00:18:41,726 --> 00:18:44,902
look, I made a huge mistake.
I don't want to lose you.

401
00:18:44,947 --> 00:18:47,391
You know, you really hurt me, Brian.

402
00:18:47,435 --> 00:18:49,373
And I can't let you do that again.

403
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,322
Look, I won't. I promise.

404
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:54,661
I don't know how to tell you this,
but you're too late.

405
00:18:54,696 --> 00:18:56,150
I met someone else.

406
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:58,492
Jillian, do you get the Oxygen Network?

407
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:01,493
If I miss my Moesha, I get a bit crabby.

408
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:03,232
In a minute, Adam.

409
00:19:04,326 --> 00:19:05,122
Well...

410
00:19:05,376 --> 00:19:07,272
I guess this is good-bye.

411
00:19:07,325 --> 00:19:09,002
Please don't send me away.

412
00:19:09,126 --> 00:19:10,550
I have to.

413
00:19:10,618 --> 00:19:12,300
You broke my heart.

414
00:19:27,817 --> 00:19:30,431
Well, Meg, you got your job back.

415
00:19:30,498 --> 00:19:32,081
Actually, Chris, I don't.

416
00:19:32,126 --> 00:19:36,051
I really appreciate what you did for me,
but I can't work for that guy anymore.

417
00:19:36,077 --> 00:19:37,320
He's a freak.

418
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:39,481
The important thing is
that you stood up for me.

419
00:19:39,525 --> 00:19:40,863
And I won't forget it.

420
00:19:40,995 --> 00:19:44,770
Oh, Brian, I know you miss Jillian,
but it is good to have you back.

421
00:19:44,805 --> 00:19:46,122
Kind of sucks though.

422
00:19:46,157 --> 00:19:49,142
I mean, you are never going
to find a chick that hot again.

423
00:19:49,318 --> 00:19:51,370
You know what the mistake was,
moving in together.

424
00:19:51,406 --> 00:19:54,202
Well, it's just another
life experience, I guess.

425
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:58,090
Hey, and look on the bright side. Maybe
you got another chapter for your book.

Oh, yeah, pile it on, pile it on.

428
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,973
Welcome home, douche bag!
