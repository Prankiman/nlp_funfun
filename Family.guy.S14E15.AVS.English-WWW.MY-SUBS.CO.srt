00:00:04,633 --> 00:00:07,167
(groaning softly)

2
00:00:11,306 --> 00:00:14,274
Okay, who'd like to start
us off with show-and-tell?

3
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:15,942
Stewie?

4
00:00:15,977 --> 00:00:18,978
Yes, today I brought in
my mother's driver's license.

5
00:00:19,014 --> 00:00:21,915
Now, if you look closely,
she's clearly drunk.

6
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:23,716
You could put a Breathalyzer up
to that photo

7
00:00:23,752 --> 00:00:25,451
and she'd get a DUI.

8
00:00:25,487 --> 00:00:27,620
Ha-ha, Stewie's naked!

9
00:00:27,656 --> 00:00:29,155
What?!

10
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:31,090
(laughter)

11
00:00:31,126 --> 00:00:32,559
Oh, my God!
Don't look! Don't look!

12
00:00:32,594 --> 00:00:34,360
Cell phones down!
Cell phones down!

13
00:00:34,396 --> 00:00:36,663
(ominous music playing)

14
00:00:40,602 --> 00:00:43,303
(shouts) What the deuce?!
Stewie!

15
00:00:43,338 --> 00:00:44,971
Run from the monster.

16
00:00:45,006 --> 00:00:47,340
You might have to drive.

17
00:00:48,343 --> 00:00:50,343
(groaning)

18
00:00:52,347 --> 00:00:55,114
Thank you all so much
for coming this evening

19
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,617
to my very fancy dinner party.

20
00:00:57,652 --> 00:01:00,520
Oh, my God!
I'm at Glenn Close's house!

21
00:01:00,555 --> 00:01:02,622
You look very handsome tonight,
Stewie.

22
00:01:02,657 --> 00:01:04,290
Well, thank you.
And you're the prettiest

23
00:01:04,326 --> 00:01:06,826
of all the women I know
whose name is Glenn.

24
00:01:06,862 --> 00:01:08,828
Everyone,
please finish your salads,

25
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:11,097
because our main course tonight
is...

26
00:01:11,132 --> 00:01:13,933
boiled rabbit.
(laughing)

27
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:15,435
(laughter)

28
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,370
I-I don't... I don't get that.

29
00:01:17,405 --> 00:01:19,639
It seems weird that I'd have
a joke in my own dream

30
00:01:19,674 --> 00:01:21,608
that I don't get.
Oh, thank you so...

Quick, you're
almost on!

34
00:01:31,386 --> 00:01:32,552
What? I'm on?

35
00:01:32,587 --> 00:01:34,587
But I don't know any
of my lines!

Lois, get in here!

57
00:02:27,309 --> 00:02:29,142
It's dark and I'm frightened!

58
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,280
I think they've got this thing
backwards.

59
00:02:35,917 --> 00:02:37,550
Hey, wake up!

60
00:02:37,585 --> 00:02:40,753
I had a bad dream, so now
your night has to be terrible.

61
00:02:40,789 --> 00:02:42,221
Peter, Stewie's upset.

62
00:02:42,257 --> 00:02:44,223
Scooch over so he
can sleep with us.

63
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:46,025
Oh, come on.
Are you serious?

64
00:02:46,061 --> 00:02:47,694
Last time, he kicked me
all night.

65
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:50,530
And I got a big day tomorrow.
I got two shows.

66
00:02:50,565 --> 00:02:52,532
All right, folks,
big treat for you today.

67
00:02:52,567 --> 00:02:54,133
He's a little shy.

68
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:56,803
Put your hands together
for Sham-Peter!

69
00:02:56,838 --> 00:02:59,806
I'm not shy! I'm angry!

70
00:02:59,841 --> 00:03:02,542
I'm in constant pain!

71
00:03:02,577 --> 00:03:05,712
This act has been condemned
by over 30 nations!

72
00:03:05,747 --> 00:03:08,614
I'm gonna kill you all!

73
00:03:12,287 --> 00:03:14,253
PETER: <i>Ah, crap.</i>
<i>I can't sleep like this.</i>

74
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:15,922
<i>And now my mind is racin'.</i>

75
00:03:15,957 --> 00:03:18,191
<i>Like, how does that candle</i>
<i>in</i> Beauty and the Beast

76
00:03:18,226 --> 00:03:20,393
<i>sing so good?</i>
<i>I mean, the teapot I get,</i>

77
00:03:20,428 --> 00:03:22,929
<i>'cause she's a girl. But</i>
<i>the candle, I don't under...</i>

78
00:03:22,964 --> 00:03:24,597
<i>Oh, he's French. That's why.</i>

79

(groans)

81
00:03:29,804 --> 00:03:31,237
Couch it is, I guess.

82
00:03:31,272 --> 00:03:33,039
Oh, my God. The couch is gone.

83
00:03:33,074 --> 00:03:34,574
Where the hell is...
Oh, that's right.

84
00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:36,609
Couchella is this weekend.

85
00:03:36,644 --> 00:03:38,177
(electronic music playing)

86
00:03:38,213 --> 00:03:40,313
Hey, man,
where you been?!

87
00:03:40,348 --> 00:03:43,316
I just had sex with
a girl on her period!

88
00:03:43,351 --> 00:03:45,918
Dude, that's not a brag!

89
00:03:50,492 --> 00:03:52,458
So, how fat are you?

90
00:03:52,494 --> 00:03:54,961
240? Nice.

91
00:03:54,996 --> 00:03:56,963
Oh, Peter! What are
you doing down here?

92
00:03:56,998 --> 00:03:59,465
Oh, hey, Brian. Stewie
kind of took over our bed,

93
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:01,000
so I'm looking
for a place to sleep.

94
00:04:01,036 --> 00:04:02,402
Well, why don't you
go up to the attic?

95
00:04:02,437 --> 00:04:04,003
I think there's even
a futon up there.

96
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,605
Huh. That's a great idea.

97
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,273
Geez, I'm glad you came along.

98
00:04:07,308 --> 00:04:10,209
I'm gonna sleep better
than a cartoon sheriff.

99
00:04:10,245 --> 00:04:12,245
(snoring)

100
00:04:14,716 --> 00:04:17,016
(click)

101
00:04:17,052 --> 00:04:19,419
(twinkly toes sound effect)

102
00:04:19,454 --> 00:04:22,755
(quietly): I was in jail 'cause
I killed a bunch of old ladies.

103
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,491
And now that I'm out,
I'm gonna do it again.

104
00:04:25,527 --> 00:04:27,527
(light-hearted music cue)

105
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:35,501
Wow, Stewie,
you look exhausted.

106
00:04:35,537 --> 00:04:38,504
Yeah, 'cause I was up super late
last night, beefing your mom.

107
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,369
My mom's dead.

108
00:04:39,393 --> 00:04:41,008
Yeah, 'cause I
beefed her to death.

109
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:43,810
Whoa, what's your problem?
Why are you being such a jerk?

110
00:04:43,845 --> 00:04:46,279
I'm sorry, Brian.
I had the absolute worst night.

111
00:04:46,314 --> 00:04:49,482
I had a weird dream.
A frightening dream.

112
00:04:49,517 --> 00:04:50,983
Yeah, Stewie,
that's called a nightmare.

113
00:04:51,019 --> 00:04:52,985
Sounds like you must've had
your first one.

114
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:54,520
That's what a
nightmare is?

115
00:04:54,556 --> 00:04:56,722
I thought "nightmare"
meant, like, being invited

116
00:04:56,758 --> 00:04:58,124
to an apartment party.

117
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,992
Get a house if you
want to have a party.

118
00:05:00,028 --> 00:05:01,661
I'm not going to a
party in an apartment.

119
00:05:01,696 --> 00:05:02,829
Relax, it's no big deal.

120
00:05:02,864 --> 00:05:04,430
People have nightmares
all the time.

121
00:05:04,466 --> 00:05:07,233
Oh, no, Brian. I am not living
through that horror again.

122
00:05:07,268 --> 00:05:09,735
In fact, I've decided
that from this day forward,

123
00:05:09,771 --> 00:05:12,538
I shall never allow myself
to fall asleep again.

124
00:05:12,574 --> 00:05:13,539
Come on, that's ridiculous.

125
00:05:13,575 --> 00:05:14,740
How do you think
you're gonna do that?

126
00:05:14,776 --> 00:05:16,275
I don't know.
Maybe I'll get a job

127
00:05:16,311 --> 00:05:18,711
working the night
shift at a supermarket.

128
00:05:18,746 --> 00:05:20,379
Hey, where's
the vegetable aisle?

129
00:05:20,415 --> 00:05:23,683
Yeah, right, it's 2:00 a.m.
You're not here for vegetables.

130
00:05:23,718 --> 00:05:26,619
(dejectedly): Well, I got the
12 cucumbers.

131
00:05:26,654 --> 00:05:28,488
What's wrong?
Just this guy at the...

132
00:05:28,523 --> 00:05:30,389
(sighs)
Never mind.

133
00:05:34,295 --> 00:05:35,862
Peter, we have a hamper.

134
00:05:35,897 --> 00:05:38,798
Stop throwing your dirty clothes
in the toilet.

135
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:39,966
Peter?

136
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:41,834
Peter, where are you?

137
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,703
(video game sound effects)

138
00:05:44,973 --> 00:05:46,939
What's all this?

139
00:05:46,975 --> 00:05:49,408
Oh, hey, Lois.
Welcome to the Pete Pad,

140
00:05:49,444 --> 00:05:52,345
where the dancing's hot,
the drinks are hot...

141
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,880
Everything's
just freakin' hot.

142
00:05:53,915 --> 00:05:55,748
What have you
done to the attic?

143
00:05:55,783 --> 00:05:57,016
Well, when I slept up here
the other night,

144
00:05:57,051 --> 00:05:58,618
I realized
what a great space it is.

145
00:05:58,653 --> 00:06:01,420
So I dragged up some stuff and
turned it into a sweet hangout.

146
00:06:01,456 --> 00:06:04,757
Even made it extra awesome
by stealing a real street sign.

147
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:06,225
(children giggling in distance)

148
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:08,394
(tires screech, thudding)
(children scream)

149
00:06:08,429 --> 00:06:10,463
I don't understand. What
are you gonna do up here?

150
00:06:10,498 --> 00:06:12,398
Eh, mostly just burn the roof
of my mouth

151
00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:14,734
on unevenly-heated
microwave burritos.

152
00:06:14,769 --> 00:06:17,737
Now I'm busy, so close the floor
and get out of here.

153
00:06:23,178 --> 00:06:24,810
All right, all right,
come on, Stewie.

154
00:06:24,846 --> 00:06:27,146
You've got to stay awake.
I know what'll help.

155
00:06:27,182 --> 00:06:28,481

inconsistent volumes.

157
00:06:30,685 --> 00:06:33,586

Stewie, you okay?
What happened?

167
00:07:08,256 --> 00:07:09,922
I was just sitting here
on the couch and I had

168
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,624
another nightmare
about that horrible monster.

169
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:12,992
Okay, that's it.

170
00:07:13,027 --> 00:07:15,161
I'm gonna help you get these
nightmares under control.

171
00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:17,096
Really?
Oh, thank you, Brian.

172
00:07:17,131 --> 00:07:19,632
And maybe I can help you
control your strange obsession

173
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:21,033
with eating
pencil erasers.

174
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:23,436
It's not an obsession.

175
00:07:23,471 --> 00:07:24,971
Mmm, mmm, oh, yeah.

176
00:07:25,006 --> 00:07:26,672
Oh, so rubbery. Mmm.

177
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,841
It's like a little
steak. Mmm, mmm.

178
00:07:28,876 --> 00:07:30,142
Brian, you really should...

179
00:07:30,178 --> 00:07:32,245
The world is small and
safe when I do this!

180
00:07:38,156 --> 00:07:40,676
Okay, Stewie, I read the review
of a dream book on Amazon,

181
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,111
so I think I can help you.

182
00:07:42,146 --> 00:07:45,381
Literally every other tab
is open to Lusty Matures.

183
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:46,949
Yup, that's what
it takes now.

184
00:07:46,984 --> 00:07:48,917
Anyway, it says here
that most nightmares

185
00:07:48,953 --> 00:07:50,853
are born of
subconscious fears.

186
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,554
So maybe if we make
a list of the things

187
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,690
you're most afraid of,
we can face and conquer

188
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:56,558
these fears together, and
then your nightmares'll end.

189
00:07:56,594 --> 00:07:58,727
Huh, that's actually
a good idea.

190

192
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:05,100
We're completely surrounded.
We need reinforcements.

193
00:08:05,136 --> 00:08:07,302
You know who could
really bail us out?

194
00:08:07,338 --> 00:08:11,140
Somebody who works five days
a week at Enterprise Rent-A-Car.

195
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:17,646
These new digs of yours
are pretty great, Peter.

196
00:08:17,682 --> 00:08:20,049
Hey, I brought
construction paper and markers

197
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:22,017
in case you guys
want to draw breasts.

198
00:08:22,053 --> 00:08:25,788
Cool. But before that, who's up
for another insulation fight?

199
00:08:25,823 --> 00:08:27,556

Heck yeah.

Missed me.

doing up here?

208

I need you to take

You gave that to yourself.

it says "official."

Now, it sounds like
you're scared of monsters.

222
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:21,110
So to help you get over it.

No.

not sure.

that deep down,

the thing I'm most afraid
of is disappointing you.

Well, think about it.

You've been more of a
father figure to me

than the fat man ever
has been or ever will be.

429

Look, I know
I'm always busting your balls,

430
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:16,794
but it's just because you're
the only person in this house

actually matters to me.

449

Damn it, you're right.

450
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:01,705
Lois, let us out of here!

451
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:03,974
No way! You like it so much?!

452
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,976
Then you can rot up there
with your buddies!

453
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:07,244
Lois, so help me God,

454
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,113
if you don't let us out
right this second,

455
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,048
I'm gonna take a dump
on your wedding dress!

456
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,349
You wouldn't dare!

457
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:14,685
Don't test me. I'll do it!
We'll all do it!

458
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,120
Quagmire, pull down
your pants!

459
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,588
QUAGMIRE:
What?! I'm not doing that!

460
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,223
You leave my dress alone, Peter!

461
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:22,460
CLEVELAND: If it'll get us out of here,
I'll make a doodie on it.

462
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,694
QUAGMIRE:
What, are you nuts?!

463
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,329
CLEVELAND: I've been crowning
for six hours!

464
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:26,831
PETER:
Cleveland's pants are off, Lois!

465
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:28,466
Here come mine!
This is happening!

466
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,401
QUAGMIRE: Lois, they're not bluffing!
Open the door!

467
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:31,735
JOE:
I miss Bonnie!

468
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:33,370
Damn it, Peter,
you hold that in!

469
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:34,605
I know you can!

470
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,307
You did it on the ferry
to Block Island!

471
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,975
QUAGMIRE:
Oh, my God, I'm gonna puke!

472
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,110
PETER: That's good! Puke on the dress!
Puke on the dress!

473
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:41,512
Aah, damn it!

474
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:46,116
MAN (over headphones):
Not all snake bites are lethal.

475
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:48,319
(grunts)

476
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,954
(all yelling)

477
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:51,222
There! You happy?!

478
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:53,691
You were too late.
We pooed on the gown.

479
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,793
Ripped a big hole
in your ceiling, too.

480
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:57,161
I barfed on Peter's ass.

481
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,263
I-I don't know if it got
on the dress or not, Lois,

482
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:00,798
but I-I am... I am so sorry.

483
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,467
Yeah, this was all
a huge disaster.

484
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:07,872
Let's just agree that we both
went a bit too far, hmm?

485
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:09,907
I, uh... I might...

486
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,810
I might need two weeks off
from this friendship.

487
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:23,053
Stewie, you awake?

488
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:24,588
Did you have any nightmares?

489
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:25,956
I don't think so.

490
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:27,591
(gasps)
Did you get rid of the monster?

491
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:30,027
Sure did. Turned out
that monster was nothing more

492
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,295
than a manifestation

493
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,797
of your subconscious desire
not to disappoint me.

494
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,833
Apparently, I'm like
a father figure to you.

495
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:39,169
Okay. Wow. Somebody's
got a big head.

496
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:42,640
Stewie, I want you to know...
I'm very proud of you.

497
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:44,075
All right, that's...
that's awkward.

498
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,976
How-how am I supposed
to respond to that?

499
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:48,178
You are a good person.
Stop complimenting me.

500
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:51,115
"Oh, I sure hope the dog
approves of who I am."

501
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,417
I'm out of here, weirdo.

502
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:54,685
(door opens)

503
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,760
There's a wedding dress out here
covered in (bleep).
