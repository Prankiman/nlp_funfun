for babies. Here. Watch the Teletubbies.

00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:19,148
How dare you! That book may hold the key
to my enslaving of all mankind.

More than I hate spinach, traffic jams,
and the last few years of M* A*S*H.

When Alan Alda took over
behind the camera...

got all dramatic and preachy?

You have impeccable credentials.

a new line of TV action figures.

No. I don't want anything to do
with neighbors.

borrowed my toaster. Never saw it again.

Oh, what? Is the baby coming out of him?
Jeez, I'll pitch.

Where the hell am I gonna find a guy
as strong as Guillermo?

113

One time I walked into the locker room,
I swear he was bench-pressing Mr. Weed.

that time we planted trees in Jerusalem.

117

What? Look, all I'm saying is
put an Israeli guy next to an Arab guy...

118
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,421
...and I can't tell the difference.

- You must be Peter. Joe Swanson.
- Yeah, yeah. Nice to meet you, Phil.

You got a neighbor
on the other side of your house, too.

121
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:08,196
So, don't think you always have to bug me.

122
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:11,532
I'll keep that in mind. Say, do you have
a screwdriver I can borrow?

Man, you neighbors are like viruses.

"Do you have a screwdriver I can borrow?"

What an ass.

128

- Did you find a replacement for the team?
- No. Believe me, I've been looking.

Hideo-san would be honored to play
for your team.

See, this is why I ask you
to submit everything to me in writing first.

He played in college.

when I asked to borrow a screwdriver.

You can borrow whatever you want.

to have any picture wire, do you?
