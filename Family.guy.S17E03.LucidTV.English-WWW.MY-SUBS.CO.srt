<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

00:00:03,989 --> 00:00:07,226
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

3
00:00:07,262 --> 00:00:10,865
<i>But where are those
good old-fashioned values</i>

4
00:00:10,899 --> 00:00:13,868
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

5
00:00:13,902 --> 00:00:17,371
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

6
00:00:17,406 --> 00:00:20,741
<i>Lucky there's a man
who positively can do</i>

00:00:20,776 --> 00:00:22,310
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:00:22,344 --> 00:00:23,711

11
00:00:42,097 --> 00:00:43,965
At last, I shall exact my vengeance

12
00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:45,566
and snuff out the miserable flame

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,069
that has been your life, vile woman.

14

<i>Growing one carrot</i>

15
00:00:50,772 --> 00:00:53,574
<i>Taking up time</i>

<i>What a day</i>

20
00:01:10,726 --> 00:01:12,960
<i>Think I'll check the mail.</i>

21
00:01:12,995 --> 00:01:16,464
Time to put you out of your misery.

22
00:01:18,967 --> 00:01:20,434
What the deuce?

23
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:21,936
Sorry I broke your toy.

24
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:24,205
Toy? This is a drone.

25
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:26,807
Grown men who have never had
sexual relations

26
00:01:26,842 --> 00:01:28,142
fly them over people's houses

27
00:01:28,176 --> 00:01:29,777
to try and see something. I don't know.

28
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:31,713
Here, want to play with my toy?

29
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:33,948
- What the hell is this?
- It's a magic wand.

30
00:01:33,982 --> 00:01:35,683
Watch. Alakazam!

31
00:01:35,717 --> 00:01:37,284
I cast the tickle spell.

32
00:01:38,687 --> 00:01:39,954
Okay, okay, you got me.

33
00:01:39,988 --> 00:01:42,957
But seriously, cross me again,
and I will end you.

34
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:45,126
You're funny. My name's Hudson.

35
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,794
Want to play "spin in a circle"?

36
00:01:46,828 --> 00:01:48,963
I'm Stewie. Yeah, I don't think I...

37
00:01:48,997 --> 00:01:50,364
What the...? Stop it!

38
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,166
I'm losing track of my surroundings.

39
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,635
Hey, this is kind of fun.

40
00:01:54,669 --> 00:01:55,970
Whee!

41
00:01:56,004 --> 00:01:57,505
Yes. Whee.

42
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:59,173
Whee!

43
00:02:00,542 --> 00:02:02,810
Oh, my. Oh, my.

44
00:02:02,844 --> 00:02:04,412
Hudson, time to go.

45
00:02:04,446 --> 00:02:05,813
I got to go home now.

46
00:02:05,847 --> 00:02:07,415
I'm glad I met you, Stewie.

47
00:02:07,449 --> 00:02:08,916
You're neat. Bye.

48
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,384
Bye, Hudson.

49
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:11,652
I like him.

50
00:02:11,686 --> 00:02:13,988
He's more fun than an Eddie Murphy bed.

51
00:02:14,022 --> 00:02:15,523
And check this out.

52
00:02:17,692 --> 00:02:19,660
That's cool. Is it a queen?

53
00:02:19,694 --> 00:02:23,364
Not sure, but people have said it is.

54
00:02:29,037 --> 00:02:31,272
Wait a minute.

55
00:02:31,306 --> 00:02:33,674
This is a self-empowerment seminar.

56
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:34,775
You lied to me.

57
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,610
You said we were going
to Baskin-Robbins.

58
00:02:36,645 --> 00:02:39,580
I said we were going
to bask in Robbins' glow.

59
00:02:39,614 --> 00:02:41,182
You know what you did.

60
00:02:41,216 --> 00:02:42,516
I do.

61
00:02:42,551 --> 00:02:45,019
Ladies and gentlemen,

62
00:02:45,053 --> 00:02:47,855
give it up for Tony Robbins.

63
00:02:56,431 --> 00:02:58,466
How the (BLEEP) is everyone?

64
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,569
Ooh, he swore. I trust this guy.

65
00:03:01,605 --> 00:03:04,203
All of you here are capable
of greatness.

66
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,706
Yay!

67
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,575
But some will never achieve it.

68
00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:08,976
Oh, no!

69
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,211
You, sir.

70
00:03:10,245 --> 00:03:12,079
Come out here.

71
00:03:16,084 --> 00:03:19,386
Sheesh, your head is the size
of a picnic watermelon.

72
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:21,055
Ha! I've been told that.

73
00:03:21,089 --> 00:03:23,090
And you sound like you were lost at sea

74
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:26,060
and told not to drink seawater
but drank seawater.

75
00:03:26,094 --> 00:03:28,095
Peter, will you just listen to him?

76
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,897
Tony, this is why I brought him.

77
00:03:29,931 --> 00:03:32,900
He's never willing
to actually confront his issues.

78
00:03:32,934 --> 00:03:35,269
Sounds like you have no self-esteem.

79
00:03:35,303 --> 00:03:37,071
I don't deserve self-esteem.

80
00:03:37,105 --> 00:03:39,240
Peter, I was once a lot like you:

81
00:03:39,274 --> 00:03:42,943
unmotivated, dangerously obese,
always relying on cutaways...

82
00:03:42,978 --> 00:03:44,645
You know, that reminds me of the time...

83
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:46,080
No, Peter. No more cutaways.

84
00:03:46,114 --> 00:03:47,748
- Stay in the present.
- Okay.

85
00:03:47,782 --> 00:03:50,084
Okay. Now tell me what you feel.

86
00:03:50,118 --> 00:03:52,086
Uh, a partial erection.

87
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,954
I don't get touched very often.

88
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:56,423
You know you deserve
a better life, right, Peter?

89
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,792
Yes. Getting hard to breathe in here.

90
00:03:58,827 --> 00:04:00,828
I want to give you that life, Peter.

91
00:04:00,862 --> 00:04:03,430
Time to seize your personal power.

92
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,800
Yeah, by getting away from you,
you weirdo.

93
00:04:06,835 --> 00:04:08,936
But first, here's that cutaway
I was gonna do

94
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,204
before you made me skip it.

95
00:04:10,238 --> 00:04:12,106
Only now it'll make no sense.

96
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:16,310
"Cast of <i>Parks and Rec</i> Peter" away!

97
00:04:20,515 --> 00:04:22,616
I can't believe you dragged me
to that fraud.

98
00:04:22,651 --> 00:04:24,652
That man has nothing to offer me.

99
00:04:26,555 --> 00:04:28,122
Tony Robbins.

100
00:04:28,156 --> 00:04:29,657
Listen, I don't have long.

101
00:04:29,691 --> 00:04:32,459
If I get soaked in the rain,
I'll be too heavy to move.

102
00:04:32,494 --> 00:04:35,129
Peter, I've seen thousands
of people over the years

103
00:04:35,163 --> 00:04:37,298
and helped every single one of them.

104
00:04:37,332 --> 00:04:40,301
I'm not going to let you
be my first failure.

105
00:04:40,335 --> 00:04:42,036
I told you, I don't want your help.

106
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,808
Peter, I swear,

107
00:04:47,842 --> 00:04:49,810
I won't stop trying to help you
no matter what.

108
00:04:55,183 --> 00:04:56,817
Oh, my God! Peter, stop the car!

109
00:04:56,851 --> 00:04:58,986
I think he got struck by lightning.

110
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:03,991
Wait, w-where is he?

111
00:05:04,025 --> 00:05:05,159
He's gone.

112
00:05:05,193 --> 00:05:07,328
This is freaking me out.

113
00:05:07,362 --> 00:05:10,164
Are... are you carrying a flask now?

114
00:05:10,198 --> 00:05:12,833
This is about you
getting better, not me.

115
00:05:18,707 --> 00:05:20,941
Hey, there's Hudson.

116
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,012
Stewie, you're, like, 100 times
more advanced than that kid.

117
00:05:25,046 --> 00:05:26,680
Why do you want to hang out
with him so badly?

118
00:05:26,715 --> 00:05:28,582
He's just, like, a cool guy.

119
00:05:28,617 --> 00:05:31,185
Hi, Stewie.
I'm putting sand on a cat poo.

120
00:05:31,219 --> 00:05:32,620
Cool!

121
00:05:33,888 --> 00:05:35,522
I like you, Stewie.

122
00:05:35,557 --> 00:05:37,691
Can I come over for a playdate?

123
00:05:37,726 --> 00:05:39,526
Oh, my God.

124
00:05:39,561 --> 00:05:41,295
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

125
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:42,563
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

126
00:05:42,597 --> 00:05:44,865
Brian, can Hudson come over
for a playdate?

127
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:46,867
Sure, I guess so.

128
00:05:46,901 --> 00:05:48,869
Never heard you ask
for a playdate before.

129
00:05:48,903 --> 00:05:51,205
I know, but there's a first time
for everything.

130
00:05:51,239 --> 00:05:53,540
Like when I finally built
the Leaning Tower of Pisa

131
00:05:53,575 --> 00:05:55,075
out of LEGOS.

132
00:05:57,078 --> 00:05:58,479
I did it!

133
00:05:58,513 --> 00:06:00,881
Mom! Come look! Mom!

134
00:06:00,915 --> 00:06:02,616
Yeah, be right there, Stewie.

135
00:06:02,651 --> 00:06:04,084
Where's the bush vodka?

136
00:06:05,253 --> 00:06:06,620
Where is it? Where is it?!

137
00:06:06,655 --> 00:06:08,989
Ah, there it is.

138
00:06:09,024 --> 00:06:11,425
Hi, Stewbie.

139
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:14,261
You playing with your kitty cat?

140
00:06:20,268 --> 00:06:23,404
Ah, the privacy of all glass around me.

141
00:06:23,438 --> 00:06:25,406
Finally, I can pick my nose.

142
00:07:41,383 --> 00:07:43,484
Hey, Peter, next time use a tissue.

143
00:07:43,518 --> 00:07:46,253
- Who said that?
- It's me. Tony Robbins.

144
00:07:46,287 --> 00:07:47,421
Tony Robbins?

145
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,989
That's impossible. You're dead.

146
00:07:49,023 --> 00:07:50,157
That may be true,

147
00:07:50,191 --> 00:07:51,825
but the lightning bolt that killed me

148
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,661
seems to have magically
transferred my personal power...

149
00:07:54,696 --> 00:07:56,163
Trademark... into your car.

150
00:07:56,197 --> 00:07:58,999
Peter, I told you
I was going to help you,

151
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:01,835
and I'm not leaving
until I make good on my promise.

152
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,404
Suit yourself.

153
00:08:03,438 --> 00:08:06,006
Hey, if you're dead,
can you ask Bill Paxton

154
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,741
if he's the same as Bill Pullman?

155
00:08:07,776 --> 00:08:10,344
Sure. Hang on.

156
00:08:10,378 --> 00:08:12,346
He said no, but he winked.

157
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,022
Ah!

158
00:08:18,386 --> 00:08:20,554
Hey, Stewie,
let's play cops and robbers.

159
00:08:20,588 --> 00:08:23,190
Bang! Bang! Bang! Got you.

160
00:08:23,224 --> 00:08:24,958
Gun?

161
00:08:24,993 --> 00:08:28,729
Oh, that's-that's not...
that's not a gun.

162
00:08:31,551 --> 00:08:33,901
<i>These</i> are guns.

163
00:08:33,935 --> 00:08:35,536
You're welcome, Paul Hogan.

164
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,238
Any time someone says
a weapon is not what it is,

165
00:08:38,273 --> 00:08:40,207
Paul Hogan gets a royalty.

166
00:08:40,241 --> 00:08:42,276
Royalty check, Mr. Hogan.

167
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:44,411
Thanks, Jumpy.

168
00:08:44,446 --> 00:08:47,080
Whoa! What are all these for?

169
00:08:47,115 --> 00:08:48,215
Oh, the yoozh:

170
00:08:48,249 --> 00:08:49,983
destroying enemies, world domination.

171
00:08:50,018 --> 00:08:51,218
Oh, and killing my mother.

172
00:08:51,252 --> 00:08:52,986
You want to hurt your mommy?

173
00:08:53,021 --> 00:08:54,221
Stewie?

174
00:08:54,255 --> 00:08:55,722
Blast! Here she comes.

175
00:08:55,757 --> 00:08:59,560
Well, look at the handsome little boys.

176
00:08:59,594 --> 00:09:01,728
Come downstairs. I made your favorites:

177
00:09:01,763 --> 00:09:04,765
grilled cheese
cut to look like a dinosaur.

178
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:06,934
Ugh. They never look like a dinosaur.

179
00:09:06,968 --> 00:09:09,570
- Your mom seems nice.
- She's a slag.

180
00:09:09,604 --> 00:09:11,405
Well, I hope you don't use your guns

181
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:13,240
to kill your mom or do anything bad.

182
00:09:13,274 --> 00:09:14,408
'Cause if you do,

183
00:09:14,442 --> 00:09:16,076
I won't be able to play with you,

184
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,945
and that's my favorite thing now.

185
00:09:17,979 --> 00:09:19,246
It is?

186
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,114
- Uh-huh.
- Mine, too.

187
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:23,917
You know what?
I'm going to let her live.

188
00:09:23,952 --> 00:09:26,119
I must say, I've been evil so long,

189
00:09:26,154 --> 00:09:27,921
I've forgotten
what it's like to be kind.

190
00:09:27,956 --> 00:09:30,424
And it's all because
of our friendship, Hudson.

191
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,860
- You really mean that?
- You bet I do.

192
00:09:32,894 --> 00:09:34,595
And I always tell it like it is,

193
00:09:34,629 --> 00:09:37,231
like when I used to write tombstones.

194
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,689
Complained a lot is what she did.

195
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,476
Stewie, what are you doing?

196
00:09:49,511 --> 00:09:50,978
Having a funeral, Bri.

197
00:09:51,012 --> 00:09:53,280
Say good-bye to Evil Stewie.

198
00:09:53,314 --> 00:09:55,315
Did we get a pool?

199
00:09:57,175 --> 00:09:58,609
Is this a pool?

200
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,740
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

201
00:10:04,776 --> 00:10:07,077
Stewie, slow down, slow down.
What happened?

202
00:10:07,112 --> 00:10:09,046
We went to the zoo. We saw an ape.

203
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,381
At first we didn't think we'd see him

204
00:10:10,415 --> 00:10:12,149
'cause he was, like, hiding
back in his house.

205
00:10:12,183 --> 00:10:13,717
But then he came out. We saw him!

206
00:10:13,752 --> 00:10:15,719
We saw the ape! He was <i>big.</i>

207
00:10:15,754 --> 00:10:17,221
And then... and then... and then...

208
00:10:17,255 --> 00:10:18,756
And then... and then... and then...

209
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,557
Okay, I get it. You had fun.

210
00:10:20,592 --> 00:10:23,533
Wait, you're not mad
I went without you, are you?

211
00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:25,496
No, no, I-I was only going for you.

212
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:28,565
And maybe to taunt the animals
that aren't able to leave.

213
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,100
Which is all of them.

214
00:10:30,135 --> 00:10:31,735
Losers.

215
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,237
All right, you have to take us to lunch,

216
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:35,606
but first we need to take our nap.

217
00:10:39,978 --> 00:10:43,614
Here's your triple bacon burger
and your onion rings.

218
00:10:44,783 --> 00:10:46,083
Ah, crap.

219
00:10:46,117 --> 00:10:47,684
There's only nine pieces of bacon.

220
00:10:47,719 --> 00:10:48,952
I paid for 12.

221
00:10:48,987 --> 00:10:50,421
But I don't wanna make a fuss.

222
00:10:50,455 --> 00:10:51,955
Peter, listen to yourself.

223
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:55,092
No one will respect you until
you respect yourself first.

224
00:10:55,126 --> 00:10:56,693
Yeah. But I'm a nobody.

225
00:10:56,728 --> 00:10:58,095
You're not a nobody.

226
00:10:58,129 --> 00:11:00,798
Your meal is just as important
as anyone else.

227
00:11:00,832 --> 00:11:02,099
You're right.

228
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:03,600
I'm not a nobody.

229
00:11:03,635 --> 00:11:04,802
Say it again.

230
00:11:04,836 --> 00:11:06,203
I'm not a nobody!

231
00:11:06,237 --> 00:11:07,704
That's the spirit, Peter.

232
00:11:07,739 --> 00:11:09,773
Now yell at that nobody in the window.

233
00:11:09,808 --> 00:11:11,942
You there! I demand more bacon.

234
00:11:11,976 --> 00:11:13,944
Oh, I'm sorry. Here's more bacon.

235
00:11:13,978 --> 00:11:15,779
That's not more bacon...

236
00:11:15,814 --> 00:11:17,614
This is more bacon!

237
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:19,616
Big day, Mr. Hogan.

238
00:11:19,651 --> 00:11:21,652
Keeping coming, Jumpy!

239
00:11:23,655 --> 00:11:25,622
Here's your <i>Star Wars kids' meal.</i>

240
00:11:25,657 --> 00:11:27,324
Which action figures did we get?

241
00:11:27,358 --> 00:11:29,059
I got Kylo Ren.

242
00:11:29,093 --> 00:11:31,662
I got the role during the
two months I was a hot actor,

243
00:11:31,696 --> 00:11:33,297
and now they're stuck with me.

244
00:11:33,331 --> 00:11:34,898
I got Forest Whitaker.

245
00:11:34,933 --> 00:11:37,668
Even as a toy you can't tell
where he's looking.

246
00:11:37,702 --> 00:11:40,170
I wish I had the poorly-cast Kylo Ren.

247
00:11:41,706 --> 00:11:43,640
Here, Stewie. You can have mine.

248
00:11:43,675 --> 00:11:45,642
You're giving me the better one?

249
00:11:45,677 --> 00:11:47,144
Why would you do that?

250
00:11:47,178 --> 00:11:48,645
Because you're my friend.

251
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,647
Yes.

252
00:11:50,682 --> 00:11:52,850
You're my friend.

253
00:11:52,884 --> 00:11:55,652
You're my best friend.

254
00:11:55,687 --> 00:11:59,323
Let's choke on these... together.

255
00:12:05,897 --> 00:12:07,664
That was fun.

256
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:10,033
Let's switch.

257
00:12:19,544 --> 00:12:21,345
Okay, guys. Time to play "parachute."

258
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:22,546
Grab an end

259
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,681
and... lift.

260
00:12:24,716 --> 00:12:26,550
You know who loves "parachute"?

261
00:12:26,552 --> 00:12:27,951
My best friend, Hudson.

262
00:12:27,986 --> 00:12:29,853
- You know Hudson?
- I know Hudson, too.

263
00:12:29,888 --> 00:12:31,688
Are you going to his birthday
party tomorrow?

264
00:12:31,723 --> 00:12:33,023
I'm autistic.

265
00:12:33,057 --> 00:12:34,725
And... lift.

266
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:35,859
Birthday party?

267
00:12:35,894 --> 00:12:37,594
Yeah, it's at the Family Fun Zone.

268
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:38,962
Everyone was invited.

269
00:12:38,997 --> 00:12:41,298
I take up a great deal
of the teacher's time.

270
00:12:45,236 --> 00:12:47,204
- Where's the mail?
- On the table.

271
00:12:47,238 --> 00:12:48,906
What's going on? You seem upset.

272
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,874
Oh, you're a... you're a real student

273
00:12:50,909 --> 00:12:52,242
of the human condition, aren't you?

274
00:12:52,277 --> 00:12:54,378
Yet, somehow, it escapes your writing.

275
00:12:54,412 --> 00:12:56,380
Whoa! Why are you attacking me?

276
00:12:56,414 --> 00:12:57,748
I'm sorry, Brian.

277
00:12:57,782 --> 00:13:01,051
Everyone but me got an invite
to Hudson's birthday.

278
00:13:01,085 --> 00:13:02,386
I know why this happened.

279
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,888
I called him my best friend too quickly.

280
00:13:04,923 --> 00:13:06,423
Well, maybe it wasn't meant to be.

281
00:13:06,457 --> 00:13:08,425
But, hey, I'm-I'm still your friend.

282
00:13:09,928 --> 00:13:12,062
Yeah, but Hudson isn't.

283
00:13:12,096 --> 00:13:15,399
And that's just something
I have to live with.

284
00:13:29,147 --> 00:13:31,315
Stewie, it's 2:00 a.m.

285
00:13:31,349 --> 00:13:33,116
Revenge doesn't sleep.

286
00:13:33,151 --> 00:13:34,918
Come on. Come back to bed.

287
00:13:34,953 --> 00:13:36,086
No.

288
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,255
There's something I gotta do.

289
00:13:38,289 --> 00:13:39,790
Go get 'em, tiger.

290
00:13:39,824 --> 00:13:41,525
Hey.

291
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:43,527
Shut your (BLEEP) mouth.

292
00:13:52,904 --> 00:13:55,105
Victory shall be mine.

293
00:13:58,643 --> 00:14:00,477
Ha. That's what the baby used to say

294
00:14:00,511 --> 00:14:02,012
when I was your age.

295
00:14:02,046 --> 00:14:04,982
Shut up, Dad.
I'm watching <i>Rick and Morty.</i>

296
00:14:07,986 --> 00:14:12,289
So... does Mommy have friends
over sometimes at night?

297
00:14:12,323 --> 00:14:14,391
Sometimes.

298
00:14:14,425 --> 00:14:17,794
It must be weird having only
women come over to see Mommy.

299
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:19,496
No, it's mostly men.

300
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,231
Oh, it is.

301
00:14:21,265 --> 00:14:23,500
And you'd be comfortable
telling that to a judge?

302
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:29,952
Good morning, family.

303
00:14:29,986 --> 00:14:32,387
My, who's this go-getter?

304
00:14:32,422 --> 00:14:34,856
Tony Robbins has helped me
become a better person.

305
00:14:34,891 --> 00:14:39,361
In fact, today, I'm gonna ask
for... nay, demand a raise.

306
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:41,196
"Nay"? Wow.

307
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,298
This new you is a bigger surprise

308
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,866
than when they're making fun
of a celebrity

309
00:14:44,901 --> 00:14:46,401
on <i>Saturday Night Live</i>

310
00:14:46,436 --> 00:14:49,538
and the real-life celebrity
walks in behind them.

311
00:14:49,572 --> 00:14:52,741
Boy, they're really
socking it to this celebrity.

312
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:55,877
Yeah, can you imagine
how mad the celebrity would be?

313
00:14:55,912 --> 00:14:58,046
I mean, wherever they are
at this particular moment,

314
00:14:58,081 --> 00:14:59,715
if they're watching, they must be...

315
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:02,050
Oh.

316
00:15:02,085 --> 00:15:03,619
That's the actual celebrity

317
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,153
walking up right behind 'em.

318
00:15:05,188 --> 00:15:07,155
He-he's catching 'em right in the act.

319
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,057
The-The <i>SNL actor doesn't know.</i>

320
00:15:09,092 --> 00:15:10,559
Aw, he's gonna get in trouble.

321
00:15:10,593 --> 00:15:12,894
Look how mad the actual celebrity is.

322
00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:14,596
He's folding his arms and frowning.

323
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:17,099
He tapped the <i>SNL</i> actor on the shoulder.

324
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:19,735
Look how surprised the <i>SNL</i> actor is!

325
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:21,737
Oh! He's completely busted!

326
00:15:21,771 --> 00:15:24,806
How is this happening?!

327
00:15:26,943 --> 00:15:28,276
Oh, my God!

328
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:30,912
I can't believe it!

329
00:15:30,947 --> 00:15:33,415
I was watching upstairs on Hulu!

330
00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:35,684
I saw it on my phone!

331
00:15:35,718 --> 00:15:37,786
My plane has Wi-Fi!

332
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:45,293
Stewie? Stewie?

333
00:15:46,829 --> 00:15:49,598
"Quahog Family Fun Zone"?

334
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:53,468
Uh-oh.

335
00:15:54,971 --> 00:15:57,105
Stewie's dug up all his weapons.

336
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,274
Oh, my God, I've got to stop him.

337
00:15:59,308 --> 00:16:01,476
Go get 'em, tiger.

338
00:16:01,511 --> 00:16:02,644
Hey.

339
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:04,913
Shut your (BLEEP) mouth.

340
00:16:08,651 --> 00:16:10,285
Tony! You're not gonna believe it.

341
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:12,454
I demanded a raise
just like you told me to

342
00:16:12,488 --> 00:16:13,955
and they gave it to me.

343
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,088
Tony?

344
00:16:15,124 --> 00:16:16,792
Tony? You in there?

345
00:16:16,826 --> 00:16:18,160
Guess who, Peter.

346
00:16:18,194 --> 00:16:19,394
Geena Davis?

347
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:21,296
No, it's me, Peter. Turn around.

348
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,832
Tony? You're alive?

349
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:25,300
But... how?

350
00:16:25,334 --> 00:16:27,135
I saw you get struck by lightning.

351
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,037
I was created by lightning, Peter,

352
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,739
in a lab, like Frankenstein.

353
00:16:30,773 --> 00:16:32,307
And what do you think about fire?

354
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,744
Anyway, after the lightning strike,

355
00:16:35,778 --> 00:16:37,245
I climbed into your trunk

356
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,047
and that's where I've been
living the past week.

357
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:42,517
So, whenever I heard your voice,
that was just you in the trunk?

358
00:16:42,552 --> 00:16:43,819
That's right.

359
00:16:43,853 --> 00:16:45,320
Why would you go to all that trouble?

360
00:16:45,354 --> 00:16:46,922
Peter, I told you,

361
00:16:46,956 --> 00:16:50,025
I wasn't going to let you be
my first failure.

362
00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:54,329
Wow, Tony, I don't know how
I can possibly thank you.

363
00:16:54,363 --> 00:16:55,997
You don't need to thank me, Peter.

364
00:16:56,032 --> 00:16:58,166
I have hundreds of millions of dollars.

365
00:16:58,201 --> 00:16:59,668
I keep it in my forehead.

366
00:16:59,702 --> 00:17:01,169
Well, I better be going.

367
00:17:01,204 --> 00:17:03,338
You have a Smart car?

368
00:17:03,372 --> 00:17:04,973
I have two.

369
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:12,547
I'm coming, broken people!

370
00:17:18,554 --> 00:17:19,855
Hey, everybody,

371
00:17:19,889 --> 00:17:21,523
we want to give a special shout-out

372
00:17:21,557 --> 00:17:23,692
to little Hudson on his birthday.

373
00:17:36,906 --> 00:17:38,540
Oh, no. Soda!

374
00:17:38,574 --> 00:17:39,875
Sticky balls!

375
00:18:06,936 --> 00:18:08,770
Damn you all.

376
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:30,926
Stewie?

377
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,928
That's my name, don't wear it out.

378
00:18:32,962 --> 00:18:34,930
Yeah, let that wash over you.

379
00:18:34,964 --> 00:18:36,965
Learned that from a third grader.

380
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:38,099
Any last words?

381
00:18:38,134 --> 00:18:39,134
Yeah.

382
00:18:39,168 --> 00:18:40,602
I'm glad to see you.

383
00:18:40,636 --> 00:18:43,271
You never RSVP to the invite
my mom sent.

384
00:18:43,306 --> 00:18:46,107
You... You invited me?

385
00:18:46,142 --> 00:18:48,109
Yes. He did.

386
00:18:48,144 --> 00:18:50,312
Brian? What are you doing here?

387
00:18:50,346 --> 00:18:51,780
And how do you know I was invited?

388
00:18:51,814 --> 00:18:53,281
Because...

389
00:18:53,316 --> 00:18:55,116
I threw your invitation away.

390
00:18:55,151 --> 00:18:56,451
You what?

391
00:18:56,485 --> 00:18:57,786
I know. I'm sorry.

392
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,622
I-I just... I saw how you were
connecting with Hudson

393
00:19:00,656 --> 00:19:03,325
and I-I was afraid
of losing our friendship.

394
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,826
Friendship?

395
00:19:04,861 --> 00:19:07,128
Brian, you and I
have never been friends.

396
00:19:07,163 --> 00:19:08,964
We... We haven't?

397
00:19:08,998 --> 00:19:10,632
No. Friends are people

398
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,234
who come in and out of our lives.

399
00:19:12,268 --> 00:19:14,302
But you and I are family.

400
00:19:14,337 --> 00:19:15,670
That's forever.

401
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:24,479
Sorry I caused all this trouble.

402
00:19:24,513 --> 00:19:26,047
I hope you can forgive me.

403
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:29,084
Ah, that's okay, nothing could
ever come between us.

404
00:19:29,118 --> 00:19:31,853
I'm even going to
make a speech at your wedding.

405
00:19:31,888 --> 00:19:33,989
So Brian and I are down in Mexico,

406
00:19:34,023 --> 00:19:36,324
and, as usual, he doesn't have
any cash on him.

407
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:37,726
That's probably why your parents

408
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,527
are paying for all this, right, Evan?

409
00:19:39,562 --> 00:19:41,162
<i>Wait, hold on. Evan?</i>

410
00:19:41,197 --> 00:19:42,430
<i>Why am I gay in this?</i>

411
00:19:42,465 --> 00:19:43,765
<i>Ah, it's the end of the show.</i>

412
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,267
<i>We sometimes do something silly here.</i>

413
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,973
So, now that you got me back
as a friend,

414
00:19:52,008 --> 00:19:54,809
what are all the great things
you have planned for us?

415
00:19:54,844 --> 00:19:57,712
Uh... we could... go see a movie.

416
00:19:57,747 --> 00:20:00,482
Oh, a movie. That's a great idea.

417
00:20:00,516 --> 00:20:01,983
You know what'll get me out
of this funk?

418
00:20:02,018 --> 00:20:03,652
<i>The Equalizer 2.</i>

419
00:20:03,686 --> 00:20:05,553
Okay. All right, fine.

420
00:20:05,588 --> 00:20:06,721
I got... I got nothing.

421
00:20:06,756 --> 00:20:07,989
Exactly.

422
00:20:08,024 --> 00:20:09,324
And you were such a jealous little bitch

423
00:20:09,358 --> 00:20:12,027
that you had to ruin the one
friendship I really cared about.

424
00:20:12,061 --> 00:20:14,195
You're just a big jerk and I hate you,

425
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,331
and there's nothing you can do
to make up for it.

426
00:20:16,365 --> 00:20:17,599
Fine.

427
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,501
Maybe I'll just go out
and get some ice cream.

428
00:20:19,535 --> 00:20:20,902
Ice cream?

429
00:20:20,937 --> 00:20:22,170
I like ice cream.

430
00:20:22,204 --> 00:20:25,106
Yeah, I don't know.
I think it's more of a bigger kid thing.

431
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,509
No, no, no! No. I've had
ice cream, like, six times.

432
00:20:27,543 --> 00:20:29,144
All right, come on, let's go.

433
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,014
You know, Brian, I'm starting to think

434
00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:36,017
we're going to get through
our... Rocky Road.

435
00:20:41,223 --> 00:20:42,857
We had a lot of laughs tonight,

436
00:20:42,892 --> 00:20:44,693
but let's remember the important thing:

437
00:20:44,727 --> 00:20:46,861
you can't put a price on your happiness,

438
00:20:46,896 --> 00:20:49,364
which is why I have: it's $6,000.

439
00:20:49,398 --> 00:20:52,300
See you in Fort Myers, probably.

440
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:55,851
