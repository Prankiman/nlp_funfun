ANNOUNCER: <i>Do you want an excuse</i>
<i>to not go home this Christmas?</i>

13
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:42,424
<i>Then fly Northwest Airlines.</i>

14
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:45,193
<i>At Northwest Airlines,</i>
<i>thousands of employees</i>

15
00:00:45,228 --> 00:00:47,763
<i>are dedicated to delaying</i>
<i>and cancelling flights</i>

16
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,831
<i>so you won't get home</i>
<i>for the holidays.</i>

17
00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:52,784
No way I'm getting you
on your connecting flight.

18
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:55,053
No way we're taking off on time.

19
00:00:55,071 --> 00:00:58,023
Don't worry, I'm taking
this flight back to the gate.

20
00:00:58,025 --> 00:01:00,742
Do you think Jeff will
make it home this year?

21
00:01:00,777 --> 00:01:03,178
<i>No way--</i>
<i>because Jeff flew Northwest.</i>

22
00:01:03,212 --> 00:01:04,312
Thanks, Northwest.

23
00:01:04,347 --> 00:01:05,831
I hate my family.

24
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:08,133
Ah, that looks great.

25
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:11,169
You know, I think this is gonna
be our best Christmas ever.

26
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:12,704
Yeah, but don't get
your hopes up, Lois.

27
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,123
I couldn't afford to get you
what I got you last year.

28
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,541
I know how you
like that song,

29
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,377
so I got you two
turtledoves.

30
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,696
Where did you get these?

31
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,348
I went to a scientist and had
them genetically engineered.

32
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,883
Fly, beautiful turtledoves.

33
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:26,852
Bring Christmas cheer to all.

34
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:29,321
(turtlesdoves screeching,
all yelling)

35
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:31,423
Everybody outside-- we'll do
the rest of Christmas outside!

36
00:01:31,457 --> 00:01:32,991
Go, go, go!

37
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:37,262
Look, Stewie, I'm hanging the
ornament you made at preschool.

38
00:01:37,296 --> 00:01:38,463
Just hang it up.

39
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:40,048
Why do you have to narrate
everything you do?

40
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:42,100
Peter, you want to put
the star on top of the...

41
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:44,236
Hang on, hang on, Lois,
I always wanted to do this.

42
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,155
Wait a second.

43
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,291
It's coming.

44
00:01:49,325 --> 00:01:51,326
There it is!

45
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:54,713
Huh?

46
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:55,881
Eh, it's something,

47
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,816
but you still
got a leftover "R."

48
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,067
This was hard.

49
00:01:59,102 --> 00:02:00,736
I did this for you!

50
00:02:01,971 --> 00:02:03,538
This one's my favorite ornament.

51
00:02:03,573 --> 00:02:06,174
I can only imagine what it
must have been like for them

52
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,110
on that very first Christmas.

53
00:02:08,144 --> 00:02:09,694
Yeah, it was probably
very moving...

54
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:10,729
and fictional.

55
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:12,497
Jesus lived with us
for, like, a week.

56
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:13,932
What else do you need?

57
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:16,351
It's the greatest
story ever told, Meg.

58
00:02:16,385 --> 00:02:19,020
A story that goes back
over a hundred years.

59
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,540
Yay, <i>Star Wars!</i>
No, Chris.

60
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:24,960
It's the story of Christmas
and the Immaculate Conception.

61
00:02:24,994 --> 00:02:26,495
You guys were born
the dirty way.

62
00:02:26,529 --> 00:02:29,831
Now, gather around, everybody,
and hear the awe-inspiring tale

63
00:02:29,866 --> 00:02:32,951
that's caused millions
and millions of deaths.

64
00:02:32,985 --> 00:02:35,087
Many years ago
there was a hardworking

65
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,888
<i>young carpenter named Joseph,</i>

66
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:39,591
<i>and one day, Joseph and his</i>
<i>friend Robby were hanging...</i>

67
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,543
CHRIS:
<i>Guy's name was Robby back then?</i>

68
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,228
PETER:
<i>The Bible is fuzzy on that.</i>

69
00:02:43,262 --> 00:02:44,679
<i>Anyway, Joseph and Robby</i>
<i>were hanging out</i>

70
00:02:44,714 --> 00:02:46,431
<i>one day when this happened...</i>

71
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,717
So, I went to see that new
<i>Oedipus</i> play last week.

72
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:51,353
Took my mother-- talk
about an awkward ride home.

73
00:02:51,387 --> 00:02:52,771
Barely got a good-night kiss.

74
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:54,806
Hey, Joseph,
check it out.

75
00:02:58,194 --> 00:03:00,762
Oh, my God,
look at that body.

76
00:03:00,797 --> 00:03:03,665
Can't you just imagine her
standing on people's front lawns

77
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:05,267
inside a cut-in-half bathtub?

78
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:08,353
You should go talk to her
and see if she can talk.

79
00:03:08,387 --> 00:03:11,289
Uh, hi.
I'm... I'm Joseph.

80
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,391
Oh, hello. I'm Mary.

81
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:17,028
Listen, um, I was wondering if
you'd like to go out sometime.

82
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,964
Well, sure.
That sounds nice.

83
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:21,199
You know, there's
a beautiful spot outside of town

84
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:23,068
where they dump
all the foreskins.

85
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:25,537
You can sit on top
and watch the sunset.

86
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:27,072
Oh, great, and maybe
we could slaughter a lamb

87
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,040
and light it on fire
so that it rains.

88
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:30,976
Well, let's not
go too fast.

89
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,878
Listen, I'll see
you later, okay?

90
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,713
I've got to go sit in a
circle with the other women

91
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:37,132
and stare off
into the fields.

92
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,716
All right,
you got a date.

93
00:03:38,734 --> 00:03:40,836
Yeah, I just hope it goes
better than my last one.

94
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,338
Wow, Joseph,
that was great.

95
00:03:43,372 --> 00:03:45,457
Yeah, I got to say
I'm a little disappointed.

96
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,092
When you said I could do you
in your "mudhut,"

97
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:48,893
I thought you meant
something else.

98
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:52,247
PETER: <i>And so Mary and Joseph</i>
<i>began their courtship.</i>

99
00:03:52,281 --> 00:03:54,749
<i>But even after several dates,</i>

100
00:03:54,784 --> 00:03:56,735
<i>Joseph couldn't get</i>
<i>to first base.</i>

101
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,286
<i>Not just because</i>
<i>Mary was a virgin,</i>

102
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:01,189
<i>but because baseball would not</i>
<i>be invented for 1,800 years</i>

103
00:04:01,224 --> 00:04:03,258
<i>and nobody knew what the hell</i>
<i>he was talking about.</i>

104
00:04:03,292 --> 00:04:06,578
You know this is the same picnic
basket we drowned my sister in.

105
00:04:06,596 --> 00:04:08,180
It was back when they were like,
"Drown all the girls,"

106
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:10,248
and then they were like,
"Don't drown all the girls,"

107
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:13,552
but she was born on a
drowning week, so, you know.

108
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,020
(sneezes)

109
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:17,956
Oh, look at that--
there's hardly any blood.

110
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,324
You're very healthy.

111
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,376
Well, I try
to take care of myself.

112
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,112
Joseph, this is the most
fun I've had in a while.

113
00:04:24,146 --> 00:04:25,647
That's good, that's good.

114
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:27,415
Pull your pants down.
What?

115
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,217
Come on, this is
our seventh date.

116
00:04:29,252 --> 00:04:30,552
It's completely natural.

117
00:04:30,586 --> 00:04:32,220
Birds do it, bees do it,

118
00:04:32,255 --> 00:04:34,222
dinosaurs whom we live
alongside do it.

119
00:04:34,257 --> 00:04:35,490
Joseph, I can't.

120
00:04:35,524 --> 00:04:36,925
People will talk.

121
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,460
So, what?
They'll talk in Aramaic.

122
00:04:38,494 --> 00:04:39,995
Do you understand that?
I don't.

123
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:43,248
Look, you're very sweet,
but I have to save myself.

124
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:45,850
For who? There's only
30 people in the whole world

125
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:47,752
and you're related
to half of them.

126
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,721
I can't believe how hard
you're making me work.

127
00:04:49,755 --> 00:04:52,624
Well, I do have
a very good virginity coach.

128
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:55,060
No, no, no.

129
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,162
Okay, I think I got it.
How's this?

130
00:04:57,196 --> 00:05:00,966
(imitating):
No, no, no.

131
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,636
No, no, no.

132
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,104
Look, I can't explain it,

133
00:05:06,138 --> 00:05:08,273
but something is
telling me to wait.

134
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:10,642
Something deep,
deep inside of me.

135
00:05:10,676 --> 00:05:12,344
Stop talking like that
or I swear to God

136
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:14,079
I'm gonna Pompeii
all over this blanket.

137
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:15,680
(laughing):
Oh, you're silly.

138
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,916
Come on, let's
just watch the show.

139
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,069
(all shouting angrily)

140
00:05:21,103 --> 00:05:22,470
Wow, she's really getting it.

141
00:05:22,505 --> 00:05:24,839
Yeah, I know that girl--
that's Donna Magdalene,

142
00:05:24,874 --> 00:05:27,959
and her sister's a
bigger slut than she is.

143
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:34,866
You know, we Jews got it right,
working with our hands.

144
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,535
Yeah, let those eggheads
in Rome do the brain work,

145
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,504
we Jews will do the brawn work.

146
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:41,690
Hey, Italians, put a book
down once in a while.

147
00:05:41,724 --> 00:05:43,141
Yeah, yeah, right.
Definitely, yeah.

148
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:44,592
Put a book down.

149
00:05:44,627 --> 00:05:46,161
Hey, so, uh,
you've been seeing

150
00:05:46,195 --> 00:05:47,862
that girl Mary
for some time now.

151
00:05:47,897 --> 00:05:49,064
She's pretty smoking.

152
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,515
Aw, man, she is so hot.

153
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:53,101
She's gonna go down in history
as "Hot Bitch Mary."

154
00:05:53,135 --> 00:05:54,803
You know, I'm thinking
of popping the question.

155
00:05:54,837 --> 00:05:56,705
Really?
Yeah, I figure I'm 14 now,

156
00:05:56,739 --> 00:05:58,356
I'm not getting
any younger.

157
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,125
Hey, look,
it's the burning bush!

158
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,876
Hail Mary,
full of guys.

159
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:04,012
Oh come all
ye face-full.

160
00:06:04,046 --> 00:06:05,981
Come on, guys,
that's really dirty.

161
00:06:06,015 --> 00:06:07,015
Hi, Joseph.

162
00:06:07,049 --> 00:06:08,583
Hey, Mary,
what's going on?

163
00:06:08,617 --> 00:06:10,185
Oh, I just thought
I'd take a break

164
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:12,420
from pooping in the open
street to come see you.

165
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,688
That's nice.

166
00:06:13,723 --> 00:06:15,623
Listen, can you
come by my house later?

167
00:06:15,658 --> 00:06:18,026
There's something important
I have to share with you.

168
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,060
Okay, sure.

169
00:06:19,095 --> 00:06:20,195
I'll come by
around that part

170
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:21,563
of the day when
the sun goes away

171
00:06:21,597 --> 00:06:23,198
and we're all terrified
it will never come back.

172
00:06:23,232 --> 00:06:25,317
Okay, bye.

173
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,018
Wow, you're a
lucky man, Joseph.

174
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,052
I know.

175
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,771
So, what have you
got going on later?

176
00:06:29,805 --> 00:06:31,890
I think I might hang
out in the town square.

177
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,192
I hear an oracle from Greece
is sending a funny message

178
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:36,161
and I want to be
there when it arrives.

179
00:06:44,587 --> 00:06:46,604
(panting)

180
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,510
Penis.
Ha.

181
00:06:56,515 --> 00:06:57,816
Hey, Mary.

182
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,300
Oh, hi, Joseph.
Come on in.

183
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,052
Thanks, hey, listen
I just got tickets

184
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,237
to see Cher in Bethlehem.

185
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:03,405
You want to go?

186
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,707
I guess-- how close
are the seats?

187
00:07:05,741 --> 00:07:06,975
Row L-X-V-I.

188
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,376
That sounds great.

189
00:07:08,411 --> 00:07:11,546
But, look, Joseph, there's
something I have to tell you.

190
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,981
I'm pregnant.

191
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,115
From my finger?

192
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,583
No, you don't understand.

193
00:07:15,618 --> 00:07:18,219
God has blessed me
with his child.

194
00:07:18,254 --> 00:07:20,789
You banged Kevin God
from South Nazareth?

195
00:07:20,823 --> 00:07:23,491
No, no, Joseph,
I mean God.

196
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,660
I'm carrying God's baby.

197
00:07:25,694 --> 00:07:27,929
He-he sent down an angel.

198
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:36,020
(gasps)

199
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:37,155
Fear not, pretty lady

200
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:39,324
who ain't never
had no relations.

201
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:42,093
I's been sent to bring you
the message that tonight

202
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,996
you's gonna be getting
pregnant with the Son of God.

203
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,981
It's a miracle, yay!

204
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:48,183
I am?

205
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,135
Yeah, and it's gonna
be here soon,

206
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:51,736
so you might want
to spruce yourself up.

207
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,671
Maybe walk in the
creek a little bit.

208
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:56,207
Oh, and he probably don't
want me to tell you this,

209
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,976
but be ready 'cause
he might give you

210
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,044
a little bit of
a donkey punch.

211
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,946
So you're saying God
got you pregnant?

212
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:05,083
Yes, Joseph.
Glory in the highest!

213
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:07,318
Well, if it his will,
then his will be done,

214
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:09,120
and I am but his
humble servant.

215
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,288
But I do have one question.

216
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:11,489
Was he bigger than me?

217
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,158
Joseph,
it wasn't like that.

218
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:15,226
I felt nothing.

219
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,911
Oh, little guy.

220
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:24,977
ANNOUNCER: <i>We now return</i>

00:08:27,097 --> 00:08:30,015
I am the Ghost
of Christmas Past.

223
00:08:30,049 --> 00:08:31,684
Oh, hello.

224
00:08:31,718 --> 00:08:34,737
I am here to show you
how you lost your way.

225
00:08:34,771 --> 00:08:36,572
Um, oh, okay.

226
00:08:36,606 --> 00:08:38,407
How long is this gonna take?

227
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:40,993
I don't know,
maybe eight minutes?

228
00:08:41,027 --> 00:08:44,447
Okay, hang on, I just
got to use the bathroom.

229
00:08:45,782 --> 00:08:47,783
(urinating)

230
00:08:57,461 --> 00:08:59,478

I am the Ghost

235
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,926
Wait, you haven't gone yet?
No.

236
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,361
(urinating stops)
Okay, here we go.

237
00:09:49,396 --> 00:09:52,798
(farts) Sorry this is turning
into something else.

238
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,800
All right, kids,
gather around.

239
00:09:54,835 --> 00:09:57,720
Time to make our yearly terrible
call to Great Aunt Helen.

240
00:09:57,754 --> 00:10:00,222
(buttons beep)

241
00:10:00,257 --> 00:10:01,390
(phone rings)

242
00:10:01,424 --> 00:10:03,292
HELEN:
Hello?

243
00:10:03,326 --> 00:10:07,029
Hi, Aunt Helen, it's Peter,
Lois and the whole family.

244
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,900
Peter's lowest what?
We're calling to say Merry Christmas...

245
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,738
Are you there, dear?
We-we were just calling to...

246
00:10:17,274 --> 00:10:19,458
We had quite a cold snap here.
I hope you got our card.

247
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:21,493
Okay, nobody talk-- we'll
just wait for her to talk.

248
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:28,000
Are you still there, dear?
Well, we just wanted to...

249
00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:29,969
Damn it!

250
00:10:30,003 --> 00:10:32,104
So, how was the...
It's been rather cold.

251
00:10:32,138 --> 00:10:34,874
The pond froze over
a family of raccoons.

252
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,911
Are you there, dear?
All right, well, Merry Christmas.

253
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:42,581
Dad, can we hear more of that
story about the baby Jesus?

254
00:10:42,616 --> 00:10:44,750
Ah, right. Now
everybody listen up

255
00:10:44,784 --> 00:10:47,620
while I stuff the rest of this
rhetoric down your throats.

256
00:10:47,654 --> 00:10:48,854
Now, if you remember,

257
00:10:48,872 --> 00:10:52,408
Mary and Joseph were on
their way to Bethlehem.

258
00:10:54,494 --> 00:10:56,528
Uch, look at that.

259
00:10:56,546 --> 00:10:57,997
I remember when this
was all desert.

260
00:10:58,031 --> 00:10:59,364
You know, when
the baby comes,

261
00:10:59,382 --> 00:11:01,083
we could probably
homeschool him.

262
00:11:01,134 --> 00:11:03,302
I can count up to nine.

263
00:11:03,336 --> 00:11:05,370
Yeah, hey, so tell me
one more time how it is

264
00:11:05,388 --> 00:11:06,639
that God got you pregnant.

265
00:11:06,673 --> 00:11:07,973
'Cause when <i>you</i> tell me
the story,

266
00:11:08,008 --> 00:11:09,258
it sorta makes sense.

267
00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:10,709
But then when I tell
the guys at work,

268
00:11:10,727 --> 00:11:12,394
they poke all kinds
of holes in it.

269
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:14,880
So, you guys are going
to Bethlehem, huh?

270
00:11:14,898 --> 00:11:17,266
I went there one time on
a donkeys' night out.

271
00:11:17,317 --> 00:11:20,569
Oh, my God,
I got <i>so</i> hammered!

275
00:11:31,414 --> 00:11:32,448
<i>Chris, did you get a haircut?</i>

276
00:11:32,499 --> 00:11:33,899
CHRIS:
<i>I did.</i>

277
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:35,701
PETER: <i>I'm just noticing.</i>
<i>It looks nice.</i>

278
00:11:36,937 --> 00:11:38,437
Hey, what's this?

279
00:11:40,373 --> 00:11:42,474
Hey, you guys, this says
a King of Kings

280
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:43,676
will be born
in Bethlehem,

Hey, let me see that.

283
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,148
This says,
"Three Magi or Resident."

284
00:11:49,182 --> 00:11:51,317
I don't think th
really care if it's us.

285
00:11:51,351 --> 00:11:52,551
Yeah, I don't want
to go, either.

286
00:11:52,585 --> 00:11:55,521
Hey, isn't your mother-in-law
visiting tomorrow?

00:12:52,128 --> 00:12:54,563
<i>Even Noah wouldn't put</i>
<i>these two together!</i>

313
00:12:54,597 --> 00:12:56,532
Cover your privates!

314
00:12:56,566 --> 00:12:58,450
Everyone can coli-see-um!

315
00:13:01,755 --> 00:13:03,505
PETER:
<i>Meanwhile, the three wise men</i>

316
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,708
<i>were making their way</i>
<i>across the desert.</i>

317
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:07,259
Hey, did you hear
they're coming out

318
00:13:07,293 --> 00:13:08,827
with four more
Commandments?

319
00:13:08,845 --> 00:13:11,180
Uch, all that stuff does is
interfere with small business.

320
00:13:11,214 --> 00:13:13,932
Oh, no, we're
out of water.

321
00:13:13,967 --> 00:13:15,333
We gotta
stop somewhere.

322
00:13:15,351 --> 00:13:17,302
Look. That's
King Herod's palace.

323
00:13:17,336 --> 00:13:19,171
Maybe we can get
water over there.

324
00:13:19,205 --> 00:13:21,707
QUAGMIRE: Wow, look at that classy,
Middle Eastern house

325
00:13:21,741 --> 00:13:23,341
with gold and marble.

326
00:13:23,359 --> 00:13:25,010
People will always want
to live next

327
00:13:25,028 --> 00:13:27,730
to big Middle Eastern houses
with gold and marble.

328
00:13:27,764 --> 00:13:30,466
Uch, I'm so bored.

329
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,600
How's the TV coming?

330
00:13:31,634 --> 00:13:33,936
We are a long way off.

331
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,471
Excuse me.

332
00:13:35,505 --> 00:13:38,607
We are three wise men
on a long journey.

333
00:13:38,641 --> 00:13:40,292
Could we trouble you
for some water?

334
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:43,212
Sure. Not quite wise enough
to pack any, huh?

335
00:13:43,246 --> 00:13:44,747
So, what brings you to Judea?

336
00:13:44,781 --> 00:13:47,249
We're on our way to Bethlehem
to see a magic baby.

337
00:13:47,283 --> 00:13:48,684
Magic baby?
What's he do,

338
00:13:48,718 --> 00:13:50,185
card tricks,
rabbit in the hat?

339
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,537
Would he let someone
in the audience

340
00:13:51,571 --> 00:13:52,805
punch him in
the stomach?

341
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:54,790
I'd like to punch a
baby in the stomach.

342
00:13:54,824 --> 00:13:56,024
You can't punch
this baby.

343
00:13:56,059 --> 00:13:57,426
He's the Messiah.

344
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,461
Yes, they're even calling him
the King of Kings.

345
00:13:59,496 --> 00:14:01,363
Yuck.
He already sounds like a dick.

346
00:14:01,397 --> 00:14:02,781
Okay, then how about this?

347
00:14:02,816 --> 00:14:04,483
I'm the King of King
of Kings.

348
00:14:04,517 --> 00:14:05,818
Ha! New name! Called it!

349
00:14:05,852 --> 00:14:08,120
Sounds like somebody's
a little threatened.

350
00:14:08,154 --> 00:14:10,589
No, I'm not. Would a guy who
feels threatened make sure

351
00:14:10,623 --> 00:14:12,224
all his advisors
are shorter than him?

352
00:14:12,258 --> 00:14:13,776
Ha! You said
it, King!

353
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:14,910
That's telling him!

354
00:14:14,944 --> 00:14:15,944
Big guy!

355
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:18,130
You know what?
Still, just to be safe,

356
00:14:18,164 --> 00:14:19,932
I should probably kill
that baby.

357
00:14:19,966 --> 00:14:22,534
Then Jodie Foster will love me.

358
00:14:25,738 --> 00:14:27,139
Welcome to the
Motel Shiksa.

359
00:14:27,173 --> 00:14:29,108
We won't leave the
light on for you,

360
00:14:29,142 --> 00:14:31,343
because what, do I work
for the electric company?

361
00:14:31,377 --> 00:14:33,645
Yes, we were wondering
if you had a room available?

362
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,881
Sorry, we're all booked up--
Cher's in town.

363
00:14:35,915 --> 00:14:37,883
You won't find a room
in the city.

364
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:40,269
No room? Joseph,
what are we gonna do?

365
00:14:40,303 --> 00:14:42,404
Don't worry.
I got this covered.

366
00:14:42,438 --> 00:14:43,972
No rooms, eh?

367
00:14:44,007 --> 00:14:46,842
Well, perhaps you have a room
for my good friend

368
00:14:46,876 --> 00:14:48,510
fistful of sand.

369
00:14:48,545 --> 00:14:49,611
Where's your money?

370
00:14:49,646 --> 00:14:50,929
I spent it on sand.

371
00:14:50,964 --> 00:14:52,581
I'm sorry,
I can't help you.

372
00:14:52,615 --> 00:14:53,782
But, sir, please,

373
00:14:53,817 --> 00:14:56,451
my wife is with child
and about to give birth.

374
00:14:56,486 --> 00:14:59,004
And I am with burrito
and about to do the same.

375
00:14:59,038 --> 00:15:03,008
Sir, if you don't leave now,
I'm gonna have to call IX-I-I.

376
00:15:03,042 --> 00:15:05,010
Yeah, we, we did one
of those earlier.

377
00:15:05,044 --> 00:15:06,211
Yours is better, though.

378
00:15:06,246 --> 00:15:07,913
We probably should've waited
for yours.

379
00:15:07,947 --> 00:15:10,015
(groaning)

380
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:11,283
Joseph, my water
just broke!

381
00:15:11,317 --> 00:15:12,501
It's time!

382
00:15:12,535 --> 00:15:13,735
Oh, my God!

383
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:16,171
Please, you've gotta
have <i>some</i> place for us!

384
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,272
We're desperate!

385
00:15:17,307 --> 00:15:19,675
Well, there's
a manger out back.

386
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:21,510
You can stay there.

387
00:15:21,544 --> 00:15:23,178
That's fine, that's fine!
We'll take it!

388
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,780
CHER (in distance):
Bethlehem!

389
00:15:24,814 --> 00:15:26,915
I have one question for you!

390
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,250
(pop song plays)

391
00:15:28,284 --> 00:15:32,187
♪ Do you believe in life
after love? ♪

392
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:34,923
Dah... See?
I told you she'd open with that.

393
00:15:40,598 --> 00:15:43,934
So, Joseph and Mary
were turned away from the inn.

394
00:15:43,968 --> 00:15:45,436
But, Dad, I still
don't understand

395
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,937
the whole Immaculate
Conception thing.

396
00:15:46,971 --> 00:15:49,606
How can anyone get pregnant
without having sex?

397
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:51,442
Oh, there's lots of
stories of that, Meg.

398
00:15:51,476 --> 00:15:52,810
Cleveland's got
a cousin who had

399
00:15:52,844 --> 00:15:54,144
eight girlfriends
get pregnant,

400
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:56,613
and he says he's not
responsible for a single one.

401
00:15:56,648 --> 00:15:58,182
Good guy.
You shake his hand,

402
00:15:58,216 --> 00:16:00,250
it feels like you're
touching a nice briefcase.

403
00:16:00,285 --> 00:16:02,369
But back to our story.

404
00:16:05,907 --> 00:16:07,891
All right, here we are.

405
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:09,293
This seems pretty gross.

406
00:16:09,327 --> 00:16:12,079
I can't believe my baby's
gonna be the Son of God.

407
00:16:12,113 --> 00:16:14,281
Looks like all those
years fighting off

408
00:16:14,315 --> 00:16:16,950
my own father's advances
have finally paid off.

409
00:16:16,985 --> 00:16:18,585
What shall we name him?

410
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,404
Well, this is kinda
like a barn.

411
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:21,872
We could call
him Barney.

412
00:16:21,906 --> 00:16:22,873
Yeah, maybe.

413
00:16:22,907 --> 00:16:24,508
Or I kinda always
liked Tristan.

414
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:25,776
Oh, my God, you want him

415
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,411
to get the crap
beat out of him?

416
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,313
They will crucify him
with a name like that.

417
00:16:29,347 --> 00:16:31,215
No, no, no.

418
00:16:31,249 --> 00:16:33,167
What are you doing?
How long you been there?

419
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:35,119
Those names is no good.

420
00:16:35,153 --> 00:16:37,254
Look, why don't y'all
just give me a list,

421
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,857
I'll run 'em up to God,
and see if he picks one.

422
00:16:39,891 --> 00:16:41,959
No... no...

423
00:16:41,993 --> 00:16:44,027
That's the name
of a champagne.

424
00:16:44,062 --> 00:16:45,329
No... no...

425
00:16:45,363 --> 00:16:46,497
Terrible!

426
00:16:46,531 --> 00:16:47,698
These are all
just terrible!

427
00:16:47,732 --> 00:16:48,899
Relax, God.

428
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:51,418
You want me to get y'all
some wine and cheeses?

429
00:16:51,453 --> 00:16:53,053
Wait, what'd you
just say?

430
00:16:53,087 --> 00:16:56,807
Cheeses.
You want some cheeses?

431
00:16:56,841 --> 00:16:58,475
And that's why you're
allowed to eat

432
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:03,079
as much mozzarella as
you want in any church.

433
00:17:03,097 --> 00:17:06,133
<i>So the three wise men set off</i>
<i>again on their journey.</i>

434
00:17:06,184 --> 00:17:07,551
You sure this is
the right way?

435
00:17:07,585 --> 00:17:10,437
Yes, I'm sure.
We follow the star.

436
00:17:10,472 --> 00:17:12,306
Are you sure
that's a star?

437
00:17:12,357 --> 00:17:13,724
We've had this
conversation!

438
00:17:13,758 --> 00:17:15,392
Yes, it's a star!

439
00:17:15,426 --> 00:17:16,894
It's got flashing
red lights!

440
00:17:16,928 --> 00:17:19,196
Oh, my God!
It <i>is</i> a (bleep) plane!

441
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,565
And I said that yesterday,
you stupid idiot!

442
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,836
Hey, thanks for coming out
on such late notice, Doc.

443
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,472
Oh, you don't have to thank me.
This is a big deal.

444
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:31,058
It's not every day that God
bestows a woman with his son.

445
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:33,043
Has it ever happened before?
Yeah, once.

446
00:17:33,077 --> 00:17:34,878
But the woman drank
during her pregnancy.

447
00:17:34,913 --> 00:17:36,713
The kid came out
a real lemon.

448
00:17:36,748 --> 00:17:39,516
I turned this
water into poo!

449
00:17:39,551 --> 00:17:40,951
Uh-huh.

450
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:43,420
I also turned this
fish into poo!

451
00:17:43,454 --> 00:17:44,855
Ah...

452
00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:46,757
Do you want your
birthday present?

453
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,343
I think I know
what it is.

454
00:17:49,394 --> 00:17:51,945
(laughs) It's a
cashmere sweater.

455
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,146
Oh, wow!

456
00:17:53,181 --> 00:17:56,967
That's actually
really nice.

457
00:17:56,985 --> 00:17:57,968
And now it's poo!

458
00:17:57,986 --> 00:17:59,403
(shrieks)

459
00:18:01,973 --> 00:18:03,707
Well, here we are.

460
00:18:03,741 --> 00:18:04,975
Okay, guys,
squeeze in.

461
00:18:05,009 --> 00:18:06,610
Bible photographer.

462
00:18:06,644 --> 00:18:08,378
Okay, we're smiling,

463
00:18:08,413 --> 00:18:10,614
we're happy to
see Jesus.

464
00:18:10,648 --> 00:18:12,616
There we go.

465
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,351
Hey, guys,
watch your step in there.

466
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:17,120
That floor's gonna be dripping
in virgin olive oil.

467
00:18:17,155 --> 00:18:18,722
That's kinda hot.
Gross.

468
00:18:18,756 --> 00:18:22,209
Hello, we are
the three wise men.

469
00:18:22,243 --> 00:18:24,511
We came here
following a star.

470
00:18:24,546 --> 00:18:26,580
Those two statements
contradict each other.

471
00:18:26,614 --> 00:18:28,382
We also come
bearing gifts.

472
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,733
I brought frankincense.

473
00:18:29,767 --> 00:18:30,784
I brought myrrh.

474
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,619
And I brought you
a breast pump,

475
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:34,788
which in these times
is just a guy.

476
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,123
When do I start?

477
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,191
Oh he's coming!

478
00:18:38,226 --> 00:18:40,244
Oh, it hurts so bad!

479
00:18:40,278 --> 00:18:41,962
God, I hate working
on Christmas.

480
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,764
Oh, here he comes.

481
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:49,786
And... BC turns to AD!

482
00:18:49,821 --> 00:18:51,588
How's everybody doing?

483
00:18:51,623 --> 00:18:53,173
Oh, he's a miracle!

484
00:18:53,207 --> 00:18:55,776
Hey, if you're a virgin, how
come I shot out of there

485
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,911
like a greased-up
cannonball?

486
00:18:57,946 --> 00:18:59,947
Greetings!
I have come to see

487
00:18:59,981 --> 00:19:03,717
the newborn king, but sadly,
I bring no gift.

488
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:05,519
Well, what do you got
in your hand there?

489
00:19:05,553 --> 00:19:07,020
Uh, my drum.

490
00:19:07,055 --> 00:19:08,722
Well, then it looks like
you got him a drum.

491
00:19:08,756 --> 00:19:11,875
Pretty good gift.
But this is all I own.

492
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,044
It's what makes me
the "Little Drummer Boy."

493
00:19:14,078 --> 00:19:17,014
Yeah, the baby
wants the drum.

494
00:19:17,048 --> 00:19:19,232
Yeah! Drum!

495
00:19:19,267 --> 00:19:21,818
Okay, nobody touch my hair.
I'm growing it out.

496
00:19:21,853 --> 00:19:23,704
Also, I'm gonna start dieting
and working out

497
00:19:23,738 --> 00:19:25,138
so I'm like crazy lean

498
00:19:25,173 --> 00:19:27,074
for the, you know, for, for,
for the thing.

499
00:19:27,108 --> 00:19:28,275
(hoofbeats approaching)

500
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:29,610
What the deuce?

501
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:34,298
Bring out the Christ Child!
We want him!

502
00:19:34,332 --> 00:19:35,415
Uh-oh.

503
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,917
(whirring)

504
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:45,926
I may have a virgin mom,
but I am one bad mother.

505
00:19:49,547 --> 00:19:51,264
(horse whinnies)

506
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,941
Ah! Ah! You guys get him!
You guys get him!

507
00:20:00,975 --> 00:20:02,442
I forgot something
at the palace!

508
00:20:04,896 --> 00:20:07,614
Pa-choo! Pa-choo!
(makes explosion sound)

509
00:20:07,649 --> 00:20:09,916
And that is the
story of Jesus.

510
00:20:09,951 --> 00:20:11,685
That was awesome, Dad!

511
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:13,036
Oh, my God! I
just realized

512
00:20:13,071 --> 00:20:15,605
that's the same Jesus as
the Jesus from church!

513
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,374
That's a beautiful story,
Peter,

514
00:20:17,408 --> 00:20:18,775
about people coming together

515
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,911
to form something
greater than themselves.

516
00:20:20,945 --> 00:20:22,479
(knocking on door)

517
00:20:23,331 --> 00:20:24,431
Yes, can I help you?

518
00:20:24,465 --> 00:20:25,749
Hi. We're from out of town

519
00:20:25,783 --> 00:20:27,217
and our car
just broke down!

520
00:20:27,251 --> 00:20:29,152
My wife's in labor.
Can we use your phone?

521
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:30,153
What?! No!

522
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:31,421
LOIS:
Peter, who is it?

523
00:20:31,456 --> 00:20:33,240
Couple of freaking scumbags
working some scam,

524
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:35,142
saying how they want
to use our phone.

525
00:20:35,176 --> 00:20:37,844
What?! Do they want all the
presents under the tree, too?!

526
00:20:37,879 --> 00:20:38,979
Get rid of 'em!

527
00:20:39,013 --> 00:20:41,081
They're not gonna
do that, are they?

528
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,849
Dad, shut the door,
it's freezing!

529
00:20:42,884 --> 00:20:44,151
Please, you've
gotta help us!

530
00:20:44,185 --> 00:20:45,519
You're lucky
it's Christmas

531
00:20:45,553 --> 00:20:47,387
or I'd call the cops on
you dirty grifters!

532
00:20:47,422 --> 00:20:50,457
Now you and your whore
wife get out of here!

533
00:20:50,491 --> 00:20:54,244
Peter, you handled
that perfectly.

534
00:20:54,278 --> 00:20:56,079
Merry Christmas,
Lois.

535
00:20:56,114 --> 00:20:58,515
MAN: Please!
We're begging you!

536
00:20:58,549 --> 00:20:59,933
I'm getting
the baseball bat.
