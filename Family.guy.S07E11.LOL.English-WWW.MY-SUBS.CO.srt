4
00:00:41,461 --> 00:00:44,156
The annual Quahog Star Trek convention.

5
00:00:44,256 --> 00:00:49,919
Where once a year sci-fi buffs take their lips off the barrel of the loaded gun
and spend half a day adjusting their eyes to sunlight

6
00:00:50,064 --> 00:00:52,687
This sucks mum, why are we even here?

7
00:00:52,787 --> 00:00:55,310
Honey, your father's been waiting all year for this

8
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,710
Especially since he's got kicked out off the last one

9
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,389
Yes, I have a question for captain Kirk.

10
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,077
In an episode where you drown your wife, why are you so fat?

11
00:01:06,752 --> 00:01:11,217
Brian look, I purchased authentic blueprints to build a Star Trek transporter.

12
00:01:11,317 --> 00:01:14,007
That's great Stewie, you should get William Shatner to sign them for you.

13
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:16,327
No way, I'm getting Patrick Stewart to sign it

14
00:01:16,328 --> 00:01:18,000
Picard has it all over Kirk

15
00:01:18,289 --> 00:01:21,013
He's poised and measured and doesn't wear a chip rug

16
00:01:21,113 --> 00:01:24,608
Rather he excepts even boldness with a quiet cool that says:

17
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:27,332
I am in command, you are safe with me.

18
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,419
I will cradle you in my arms though any crisis in any galaxy.

19
00:01:32,018 --> 00:01:33,870
- Are you queer?
- Probably

20
00:01:34,034 --> 00:01:36,867
Dad, this is stupid! I'm so bored!

21
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:39,373
How can you be bored? This convention has everything!

22
00:01:39,473 --> 00:01:41,879
You can even try on LeVar Burton's visor!

23
00:01:46,455 --> 00:01:50,650
Why would he wear this? Who would invent this for him?

24
00:01:53,265 --> 00:01:54,464
And in conclusion.

25
00:01:54,564 --> 00:01:59,858
Whether your dreams are earthbound or set in the stars - follow your heart.

26
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,982
And.. make it so.

27
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:06,123
Exactly like he says on TV!

28
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:09,937
Now the cast and I would be happy to answer a few questions.

29
00:02:10,155 --> 00:02:12,334
Oh, yes, so many questions. Me, me!

30
00:02:12,434 --> 00:02:15,439
Mr. Stewart! Mr. Stewart! Mr. Stewart! Mr. Stewart!

31
00:02:20,342 --> 00:02:21,596
Yes, you there.

32
00:02:22,358 --> 00:02:23,358
Yes, I have a question.

33
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:27,915
Um, often times my household's sponges accumulate
an awful amount of buildup.

34
00:02:28,242 --> 00:02:31,075
- What can I do to prevent this?
- That's an exellent question.

35
00:02:31,293 --> 00:02:35,706
It's very important to thoroughly wrign out your sponges after every usage.

36
00:02:35,978 --> 00:02:39,138
This will prevent the accumulation of grime and bacteria

37
00:02:39,238 --> 00:02:41,318
A dry sponge is a happy sponge.

38
00:02:41,418 --> 00:02:43,115
That not a Star Trek question!

39
00:02:43,215 --> 00:02:45,186
I have a question for Jonathan Frakes

40
00:02:45,286 --> 00:02:49,871
I have this itch on the back of my leg.
And I cant figure out if it's a bug bite or a dry skin?

41
00:02:50,035 --> 00:02:51,669
- Do you take hot showers?
- Yes.

42
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:53,031
- Dry skin.
- Thanks.

43
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,210
It aren't Star Trek questions, what the hell?

44
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,063
I have a question for Gates McFadden

45
00:02:57,163 --> 00:03:00,767
I've got an artesian well on my property and the water pressure is lousy.

46
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:04,690
- Any suggestions?
- I would check the point first, before ... it

47
00:03:04,953 --> 00:03:09,975
But remember that the summer months take a particular
... any regions aqua... depending on a local climate.

48
00:03:10,075 --> 00:03:12,590
- This is all s***
- And that's a last question

49
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,641
Thank you for coming you've been wonderful.

50
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,178
You bastards. I'll get my question answer one way or another

51
00:03:23,322 --> 00:03:25,774
Oh my God, what a great costume!

52
00:03:25,874 --> 00:03:28,498
Meg, Meg! Come take here a picture with space alien guy!

53
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:31,495
- No dad, I don't want to!
- Come on, it'll be funny.

54
00:03:34,491 --> 00:03:37,270
What a wonderful novelty photo this will make.

55
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,103
Thank you so much buddy. Hey, how did you make that awesome mask?

56
00:03:40,212 --> 00:03:42,500
It's not a mask, I have the mumps.

57
00:03:42,718 --> 00:03:45,605
What? You came to the Star Trek convention with the mumps,

58
00:03:45,705 --> 00:03:47,784
you could be infecting people with a desease!

59
00:03:47,884 --> 00:03:51,326
Yeah, like the old gipsy did the Britney Spears in that Stephen King book.

60
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:53,450
Thiker

61
00:03:57,024 --> 00:03:58,714
Well, Meg has the mumps allright.

62
00:03:58,921 --> 00:04:00,487
How is it? She was never immunised.

63
00:04:00,749 --> 00:04:05,064
Well, it was 1992 and I couldn't be bothered with
anything that didn't involved Dan Cortese

64
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,142
- Besides, what's a big deal? I never got a momps shot.
- Really?

65
00:04:08,242 --> 00:04:12,327
Well, I caution you, that getting the mumps
as an adult could result a serious complications.

66
00:04:12,484 --> 00:04:15,496
And some cases the symptoms could spread to the testicular glands

67
00:04:15,596 --> 00:04:16,826
Big deal, so I wear socks.

68
00:04:16,926 --> 00:04:19,133
Mr. Griffin, your testicles are not on your feet.

69
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:21,128
- Oh, where are they?
- Under your penis.

70
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:25,861
Are you kidding? I was thought thouse were two
little sandbags to keep floadwaters from floating into my bum

71
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:29,890
No, no. I'm just poking at your funny bone. I am quite alarmed.

72
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,806
I don't think you realize the danger

73
00:04:32,002 --> 00:04:34,857
Like the people who think it's OK to bring shampoo on the airplane.

74
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:36,209
So I told Branda:

75
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:39,316
I work hard, I like a clean house when I come home.

76
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,037
And now I'm the bad guy.

77
00:04:41,137 --> 00:04:44,558
-Oh, I know exacltly what you...
- Oh, It's in my eyes!

78
00:04:51,012 --> 00:04:53,828
See, Chris, come here, come here, look. Check it out.

79
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,578
- Holy crap, no way!
- I know, classic!

80
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,277
I gotta forward this to my bud.

81
00:05:08,613 --> 00:05:11,508
Meg, I know you hate having to be in bed all day, but

82
00:05:11,608 --> 00:05:14,480
father's bringing in the old TV.
- Hey Meg!

83
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,844
- Piter, what the hell?
- I don't wanna catch the mumps, Lois.

84
00:05:17,845 --> 00:05:23,500
Here is your TV, Meg. It's a little old and there is no remote
and only gets one channel and it's not on that channel right now.

85
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:27,036
Chris, check it out. Jackass number two.

86
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:44,911
This whole day is been one big laugh riot

87
00:05:50,153 --> 00:05:52,656
- Finally!
- Up next Kirk Cameron.

88
00:05:53,243 --> 00:05:55,394
- To talk about God.
- Aww.

89
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:58,484
Hi, welcome to the Religion channel number one show.

90
00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:01,965
"Kirk and a Lord" just hanging. With me, Kirk Cameron.

91
00:06:02,357 --> 00:06:06,033
Today, I'm gonna tell you why God will always be there for you.

92
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,810
- Even in the worst of times.
- No thanks.

93
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,096
But first, are you lonely, unappreciated?

94
00:06:12,196 --> 00:06:15,773
Not totally happy with your physical appearance?
- Go on.

95
00:06:15,873 --> 00:06:19,450
Are you unloved? Do you feel like no one cares about you?

96
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,031
Meg, your mother made soup for you

97
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,131
Here you go honey.

98
00:06:25,864 --> 00:06:28,524
Do you know who loves you? The Lord.

99
00:06:29,424 --> 00:06:30,988
Here's your milk!

100
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,481
Rupert, my transporter is complete.

101
00:06:37,716 --> 00:06:43,466
If my calculations are correct the cast of "Star Trek: The Next Generation"
will soon be here to anwser all my questions!

102
00:06:45,813 --> 00:06:46,986
Wait a minute, something's wrong.

103
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,702
Allright, you girls ready?

104
00:06:52,032 --> 00:06:55,474
What's goin on? Don't you laugh at it?

105
00:07:01,732 --> 00:07:02,984
Good morning mom and dad!

106
00:07:03,084 --> 00:07:06,426
Wow, look who's finally out of room after five days.

107
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:09,125
- So you feel better Meg?
- All better mom.

108
00:07:09,225 --> 00:07:11,315
I was made well by the hand of God.

109
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:15,970
This is a day that the Lord hath made.
Let us rejoice and be glad in it.

110
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:21,172
- Meg, what are you talking about?
- I'm talking about God mom, I've been reborn.

111
00:07:21,272 --> 00:07:24,732
That's right folks, it's gonna be a Meg episode. Stick around for the fun.

112
00:07:26,609 --> 00:07:29,425
Here's the clicker. No one will blame you.

113
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:39,321
- What do you mean you found the Lord?
- I've been washed in a blood of the lamb

114
00:07:39,421 --> 00:07:43,507
Kirk Cameron explained it all to me. The Lord is my saviour.

115
00:07:43,607 --> 00:07:47,223
Is that damn religion channel? She was watching it all day while she was bedridden.

116
00:07:47,323 --> 00:07:51,095
I want to share the word of God with everyone I know.
Starting with my family.

117
00:07:51,195 --> 00:07:55,124
Now, everyone hold hands because we are gonna say grace before we eat.

118
00:07:55,437 --> 00:07:57,471
Dad, would you like to do the honors?

119
00:07:57,571 --> 00:07:59,935
Are you kidding? I'd love a chance to shine.

120
00:08:00,287 --> 00:08:01,969
All right Piter, this is it.

121
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,271
Dear Lod, please give me the cheat codes from "Mike Tyson's Punch-Out"

122
00:08:06,371 --> 00:08:09,166
I have been stuck on "Bold Ball" for four years.

123
00:08:09,266 --> 00:08:13,234
I tried Left-Left-Up-B-dodge-uppercut, but it still knocks me out.

124
00:08:13,468 --> 00:08:17,067
And you know, they say you suppose to go
Right-B-Up-dodge-Left-uppercu...

125
00:08:17,615 --> 00:08:19,492
Listen to me, telling you how to play a game.

126
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:26,259
All right, let's try this again.

127
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,152
It's them. I did it!

128
00:08:33,155 --> 00:08:36,300
The cast of "Star Trek: The Next Generation"
is here to answer my questions!

129
00:08:36,568 --> 00:08:39,167
- What the hell, where am I?
- What's goin on?

130
00:08:39,267 --> 00:08:41,866
Greeting everyone, my name is Stewie Griffin.

131
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:44,291
I've transported you all here against you will.

132
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:47,303
I'm a huge fan. And you are going to answer all my questions.

133
00:08:47,498 --> 00:08:50,784
- But.. you are baby.
- Yes, that's right Denise Crosby.

134
00:08:52,505 --> 00:08:55,829
That was a warning. Please,
do not speak unless you are spoken to.

135
00:08:55,929 --> 00:08:57,394
Now. Question number one.

136
00:08:57,824 --> 00:08:59,350
What's it like on the set?

137
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,345
The show's been off the air for fifteen years

138
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,692
Although I will say it was an awful lot of fun.

139
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:06,195
You know what Patrick wasn't(?) hugging the limelight.

140
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:09,989
Oh fuck you Michael! Fifteen years later you still got that attitude.

141
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:13,079
Oh my God! I'm already having a fantastic time.

142
00:09:13,822 --> 00:09:16,521
- Let's spend a day together!
- Hey, that sounds like fun!

143
00:09:17,225 --> 00:09:19,337
- Shut up Wil.
- Stop it Patrick!

144
00:09:19,437 --> 00:09:23,171
- You know, I think you should all be nicer to Hwil Hwheaton
- The way I treat my...

145
00:09:23,366 --> 00:09:25,987
- Wait, what?
- I said you ought to be nicer to Hwil Hwheaton

146
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:27,786
- You mean Wil Wheaton?
- Yes, Hwil Hwheaton.

147
00:09:27,886 --> 00:09:28,960
Why are you saing it like that?

148
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,167
What? I'm just saying, you should be nicer to Hwil Hwheaton.
Hwil Hwheaton seems like a nice guy.

149
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:33,692
- Say "wheet"
- Wheet.

150
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:35,922
- Now, say Wil Wheaton
- Hwil Hwheaton

151
00:09:36,022 --> 00:09:39,800
- Wil Wheaton
- Hwil Hwheaton

152
00:09:39,801 --> 00:09:42,868
- Wil Wheaton
- Hey, did you hook up with Whoopi Goldberg on the show?

153
00:09:42,869 --> 00:09:43,627
All the time.

154
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,422
- Meg, what the hell? I was watching that.

155
00:09:47,522 --> 00:09:49,025
It's time for Kirk Cameron!

156
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:53,602
And I think it's important for all of you to hear his
inspiring message about the word of God.

157
00:09:53,702 --> 00:09:55,088
Oh, again Meg?

158
00:09:55,188 --> 00:09:59,782
You know I think it's wonderful you found something to have
faith in but this is such a thing as moderation.

159
00:09:59,882 --> 00:10:02,402
Mum, you sound like a nonbeliever.

160
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,632
Brian, you're a thoughtful person.

161
00:10:04,732 --> 00:10:07,448
Are you willing to open yourself up to God's truth?

162
00:10:07,548 --> 00:10:10,108
Oh, you here barking up the wrong tree, Meg, I'm an atheist.

163
00:10:11,047 --> 00:10:13,941
- What's that?
- I.. don't believe in God.

164
00:10:14,411 --> 00:10:16,171
What? Brian?

165
00:10:16,271 --> 00:10:18,987
- How can you say that?
- Why? I just thought

166
00:10:19,087 --> 00:10:20,825
you knew. I mean, I never go to church.

167
00:10:20,925 --> 00:10:22,312
You know how I feel about that.

168
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,676
Brian, it's one thing to bash organized religion, but

169
00:10:25,776 --> 00:10:27,710
we believe in God in this house,

170
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:32,012
I mean an atheist... that's just about the worst thing a person can be!

171
00:10:32,112 --> 00:10:34,985
You're not gonna get anything for Christmas, Brian!

172
00:10:35,085 --> 00:10:37,293
- Guys, I'm just trying to say..
- Shut up beast!

173
00:10:37,393 --> 00:10:40,656
I have dominion over you and I command you to believe in God!

174
00:10:40,756 --> 00:10:43,121
I'm sorry, I just don't see any evidence.

175
00:10:43,221 --> 00:10:44,881
I mean, look at the Hubble telescope

176
00:10:44,981 --> 00:10:48,558
It's discovered untold wonders of the vast unexplored universe

177
00:10:48,658 --> 00:10:51,961
But not one picture of a guy with a beer sitting around on a cloud.

178
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,369
I mean what's he doing up there?

179
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:03,499
You know, you keep talking like that God's gonna get you, Brian

180
00:11:03,734 --> 00:11:05,494
He's gonna get you with a Kodak disc.

181
00:11:05,594 --> 00:11:08,115
Oh God's gonna get you with the Kodak disc!

182
00:11:09,093 --> 00:11:10,579
I'm sorry. What were we talking about?

183
00:11:15,351 --> 00:11:17,385
Hey! Where the hell is my van?

184
00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:23,370
Stewie, I'm not really much of a fast food eater.

185
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,817
Yeah? Can you read my mind?

186
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:27,555
Can you tell what I'm thinking right now?
I'm thinking "Shut up and get a salad"

187
00:11:27,655 --> 00:11:30,019
- I want some McNuggets!
- We'll get to you, Brant.

188
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:32,718
I'm wanna hamburger. No, a cheeseburger.

189
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:36,512
- I wanna hotdog, I wanna milk shake
- You'll get nothing and like it!

190
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,446
- Hello?
- Yes, welcome to MacDonald's. Can I help you?

191
00:11:39,546 --> 00:11:40,893
- Oh, hailing frequencies open, huh?

192
00:11:42,144 --> 00:11:46,369
Oh yeah, we gonna get two MacChicken
sandwiches and a diet coke and..

193
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:48,755
- What do you want Michael?
- A McDeal tea

194
00:11:48,855 --> 00:11:51,063
No, I already told you they don't make those anymore!

195
00:11:51,163 --> 00:11:53,136
You know, sometimes it's a regional thing.

196
00:11:53,236 --> 00:11:56,656
- You could ask.
- No MacDonald's anywhere makes a McDeal tea anymore!

197
00:11:56,756 --> 00:12:00,059
- I'd love a shamrock shake if they got any of those.
- It's september Johnathan!

198
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:02,562
Stewie, can I take this fucking headband off?

199
00:12:02,662 --> 00:12:04,870
No LeVar, you're blind, that's the only way you can see.

200
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,569
Just saying they have all the ingredients for a McDeal.

201
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:11,911
Just hand on, allright? There's a lot of us, it, there's a lot of.. It's a big order!

202
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:14,805
- What time do they stop serving breakfast?
- It's 3 o'clock!

203
00:12:14,905 --> 00:12:17,895
- Some of them serve breakfast all day.
- NO ONE SERVE BREAKFAST ALL DAY!

204
00:12:17,995 --> 00:12:18,995
Do they have beer?

205
00:12:22,198 --> 00:12:25,053
Hey Brian! In hopes that you'll open your heart to God

206
00:12:25,153 --> 00:12:26,618
I wanted to give you this cross.

207
00:12:26,718 --> 00:12:30,725
- No, I don't want a cross.
- Would you want it if I throw it over there?

208
00:12:30,825 --> 00:12:32,759
- No, please don't do that.
- You gonna get it boy!

209
00:12:32,859 --> 00:12:34,754
- No, please, no.
- Go get it boy!

210
00:12:38,743 --> 00:12:40,777
Okay, give it back now!

211
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:06,788
Brian, Kirk Cameron is the one who converted me

212
00:13:07,062 --> 00:13:09,370
But unfortunately he's not available

213
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,756
So, I got his younger brother from "Growing Pains"

214
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:14,298
Would you guys buy me a case of Sudafed?

215
00:13:14,398 --> 00:13:16,371
Don't you wanna tell Brian about Jesus?

216
00:13:16,471 --> 00:13:20,205
They got my picture up at the drug store
and they won't sell me any Sudafed.

217
00:13:20,635 --> 00:13:22,356
I'll make it worth your while.

218
00:13:25,155 --> 00:13:29,201
What have I told you about any sexual favors for Sudafed?

219
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,252
Look, Meg. I've had enough of this. You're not gonna convert me.

220
00:13:32,352 --> 00:13:35,694
But Brian! I just want you to feel the joy that I feel

221
00:13:35,794 --> 00:13:38,393
I mean the Church makes me feel accepted and safe

222
00:13:38,628 --> 00:13:40,583
And part of something bigger than myself.

223
00:13:40,683 --> 00:13:45,081
But Meg, you don't need an outside voice to feel those feelings,
they're inside you.

224
00:13:45,277 --> 00:13:47,976
What you call "God" is inside you, all of us.

225
00:13:48,076 --> 00:13:53,765
And I just hate to see people hating and killing each other
over their own interpretation of what they're not smart enough to understand.

226
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,425
- You see what I'm saying?
- Oh I do Brian

227
00:13:56,659 --> 00:13:58,615
And I think I know just what to do.

228
00:13:59,084 --> 00:14:01,470
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker. Our top story tonight.

229
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,013
Just when you thought the world couldn't be anymore dangerous

230
00:14:04,113 --> 00:14:07,807
Channel 5 News has discovered that there is an atheist among us.

231
00:14:07,907 --> 00:14:10,897
Local church goer and junior christian soldier Meg Griffin

232
00:14:10,997 --> 00:14:14,339
has identified the atheist as Brian Griffin of Spooner Street

233
00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:16,178
Here's the reaction from City Hall.

234
00:14:16,842 --> 00:14:18,446
Shocking to say the least.

235
00:14:18,798 --> 00:14:21,536
I'd rather have a terrorist living in our midst.

236
00:14:21,636 --> 00:14:26,347
At least they believe in a God. Even if it's a smelly brown God.

237
00:14:26,543 --> 00:14:29,085
Meg, how the hell could you do something like this?

238
00:14:29,185 --> 00:14:31,628
If a man hath ears, let him hear, Brian!

239
00:14:31,862 --> 00:14:35,969
Allright, what's the worst that can happen,
this is 21st century, people are tolerant

240
00:14:37,612 --> 00:14:40,976
Well, this is nothing, probably just a random act of violence.

241
00:14:42,932 --> 00:14:45,905
I thought only he without sin could cast the first Prius

242
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,639
Huh, my God. That was a close one.

243
00:14:57,795 --> 00:14:59,086
Brian, what happened?

244
00:14:59,186 --> 00:15:00,533
I'm a pariah, Lois.

245
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:04,367
Ever since Meg told everyone I'm an atheist
I'm the most hated person in town.

246
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,591
I try to rent a movie and they throw me out.
I try to buy a pack of cigarettes and they throw me out.

247
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:11,681
The most serious part of it is, no bar would serve me a drink!

248
00:15:11,781 --> 00:15:15,123
Well if you ask me, I think laying off the souse could do you some good Brian.

249
00:15:15,223 --> 00:15:17,509
Yeah, right. If you need me I'll be in the kitchen.

250
00:15:19,504 --> 00:15:21,694
I hope he finds faith of some kind.

251
00:15:21,794 --> 00:15:24,119
You know, (who?) doesn't have all this problems? Marmaduke.

252
00:15:24,393 --> 00:15:26,662
All he does is eat pies off the high counter.

253
00:15:26,762 --> 00:15:30,104
Next time around we gonna get ourselves a big tall pie-eating dog, Lois

254
00:15:30,204 --> 00:15:33,233
- Okay Peter.
- Oh, Howard Hughes, let's get Howard Hughes!

255
00:15:33,546 --> 00:15:35,306
Great, we have a game plan.

256
00:15:45,437 --> 00:15:47,784
Hold it together, Brian, hold it together.

257
00:15:47,884 --> 00:15:49,857
Come on! You know you want to drink.

258
00:15:49,957 --> 00:15:52,282
Yeah, come on, Brian, drink us!

259
00:15:52,382 --> 00:15:55,489
Come on, drink me! What are you waiting for?

260
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:59,831
Yeah you big silly ass. Just wrap your lips around me and take a big gulp.

261
00:15:59,988 --> 00:16:01,591
Get to the chopper!

262
00:16:08,906 --> 00:16:11,683
Allright, everybody got your bowling shoes, everybody got your balls.

263
00:16:11,783 --> 00:16:12,783
I don't have my shoes.

264
00:16:12,883 --> 00:16:16,768
- Johnathan, we were just up in the counter, why didn't you get the shoes?
- I don't have my shoes either.

265
00:16:16,868 --> 00:16:21,070
- What the hell? You need your shoes to bowl.
- Now, why exactly can I not wear my loafers?

266
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:24,864
- What is the danger there?
- Because, Patrick, because, Patrick!

267
00:16:24,964 --> 00:16:29,363
- Those are the rules.
- Well I think it's just because they want another dollar fifty from me.

268
00:16:29,715 --> 00:16:31,201
Allright, I'm putting our names in.

269
00:16:31,396 --> 00:16:33,587
- Brant..
- No-no don't put Brant

270
00:16:34,174 --> 00:16:37,577
- Put Rock Kickass
- I don't know how to change it, I already typed it in!

271
00:16:37,677 --> 00:16:38,677
For mine put Dirt Tickler

272
00:16:38,777 --> 00:16:40,667
I'm not gonna put everyone with a fake name!

273
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:41,918
How do you wanna do the teams?

274
00:16:42,018 --> 00:16:45,204
- How about the white guys against the black guys?
- Patrick, don't be an instigator.

275
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,785
- I have to pee.
- Brant, take Michael to the bathroom, please.

276
00:16:47,885 --> 00:16:49,003
Okay.

277
00:16:51,228 --> 00:16:53,614
Look at me! I've got girl boobs!

278
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,096
Hey Meg! Guess what?

279
00:17:04,196 --> 00:17:05,583
I've seen the light.

280
00:17:05,683 --> 00:17:10,081
- Really?
- Yes, hallelujah I believe in God. Lordy-lordy, I believe.

281
00:17:10,181 --> 00:17:13,053
Brian, that's fantastic news!

282
00:17:13,153 --> 00:17:16,613
I know, I know. Hey, you might spreading the news around town, say

283
00:17:16,713 --> 00:17:19,390
maybe down at the liquor store, maybe down at the Clam

284
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:22,402
of course Brian, but first we have work to do

285
00:17:22,502 --> 00:17:25,577
God's work. And God will be happy that you're joining me.

286
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:28,218
Then I say let's celebrate the way they did in the bible.

287
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:31,195
With wine. Red wine. You know, like Jesus drank.

288
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,730
- Do you like the wine?
- Very much, what is it?

289
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,957
Take a guess

290
00:17:36,702 --> 00:17:37,702
I have to leave.

291
00:17:38,785 --> 00:17:40,980
Naaah, sit down.

292
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,780
Thanks for setting everyone straight, Meg.

293
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,654
I feel the warm healing liquid presence of God's genuine cold filtered grace.

294
00:17:50,754 --> 00:17:52,403
It was my pleasure Brian.

295
00:17:52,503 --> 00:17:55,044
And now, we get to do the work of the Lord.

296
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:57,574
- Come on!
- What? What are we doing?

297
00:17:57,686 --> 00:17:59,286
God's will Brian.

298
00:18:02,969 --> 00:18:05,871
- A book burning?
- Come on! Grab an armful!

299
00:18:05,971 --> 00:18:08,699
We have to destroy everything that's harmful to God!

300
00:18:14,913 --> 00:18:17,405
Meg, I can't be a part of this. And neither should you.

301
00:18:17,505 --> 00:18:20,456
What are you talking about? I thought you'd seen the light, Brian!

302
00:18:20,556 --> 00:18:23,507
Well, to be honest I lied for boose, but Meg, you're a smart girl

303
00:18:23,607 --> 00:18:26,000
You ought to be able see that what's going on here is wrong!

304
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,679
You are not gonna turn me from my faith, Brian!

305
00:18:30,465 --> 00:18:32,846
Ok, fine. Then let me just ask you this.

306
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:37,720
If there were a God, would he have put you here on
Earth with a flat chest and a fat ass?

307
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:41,404
-I'm made in his image?
- Really?

308
00:18:41,664 --> 00:18:45,608
Would he give you a smoking hot mom like Lois
and then have you grow up looking like Peter?

309
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:46,708
Well..

310
00:18:46,808 --> 00:18:50,780
And what kind of God would put you in a house where
no one respects or cares about you?

311
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,198
Not even enough to get you a damn momps shot!

312
00:18:54,203 --> 00:18:55,203
Oh, no!

313
00:18:56,584 --> 00:18:59,337
You're right, Brian! You're right!

314
00:18:59,437 --> 00:19:00,437
I'm sorry Meg.

315
00:19:00,825 --> 00:19:03,112
But what is there to believe in without God?

316
00:19:03,113 --> 00:19:05,000
Where do the answers come from?

317
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,011
Oh that's all part of the human experience. It's what we're here to find out.

318
00:19:09,271 --> 00:19:12,322
And I bet you that the real answer to the nature of our existence

319
00:19:12,422 --> 00:19:16,378
is gonna be more unimaginably amazing than we can possibly conceive.

320
00:20:18,629 --> 00:20:19,629
Rob?

321
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,233
Did you hear that?

322
00:20:23,391 --> 00:20:24,391
Hear what?

323
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:26,438
I swear I heard something.

324
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:32,539
Oh, we've been over and over this.
There is nothing under your bed.

325
00:20:32,726 --> 00:20:34,474
There is nothing in the closet.

326
00:20:34,772 --> 00:20:37,897
There are no such things as monsters.

327
00:20:37,997 --> 00:20:38,997
Alright?

328
00:20:40,985 --> 00:20:43,367
- Alright I guess.
- Good.

329
00:20:43,962 --> 00:20:47,794
Now, try to go to sleep, cause we gotta get up in the morning and make movies.

330
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:49,989
We're big Hollywood actors.

331
00:20:51,966 --> 00:20:53,338
Yeah we are!

332
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:09,337
This was exhausting.

333
00:21:09,437 --> 00:21:12,834
This whole experience was absolutely exhausting.

334
00:21:12,934 --> 00:21:15,736
You people have ruined "Star Trek: The Next Generation" for me

335
00:21:15,836 --> 00:21:19,420
You are absolutely the most insufferable group of jackasses I've

336
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,433
ever had the misfortune of spending an extended period of time with

337
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:24,331
I hope you all *** die.

338
00:21:24,431 --> 00:21:26,563
I still have five prize tickets from the carnaval.

339
00:21:26,663 --> 00:21:29,465
There was nothing for five tickets, we've been over this!

340
00:21:29,466 --> 00:21:33,471
Well, but LeVar and I were going to pull eyes for the Fuzzy Troll pencil topper

341
00:21:33,472 --> 00:21:36,088
- Oh yeah? You gonna share that?
- Yeah, we were gonna share it!

342
00:21:36,188 --> 00:21:40,900
- Really? How that gonna work?
- Three days in my house, three days in LeVar's and alternating sundays.

343
00:21:40,975 --> 00:21:42,500
For a pencil topper?

344
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,129
- I have to pee again.
- That's it. Goodbye.
