<i>Family Guy
It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One</i>

2
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,001
Mom, are we there yet?

3
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:37,151
Almost, Chris.

4
00:00:37,152 --> 00:00:40,640
Now remember, kids, when we get to
Mr. Quagmire's cabin, don't touch anything

5
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:42,708
before I have a chance to disinfect it.

6
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,382
Boy, it was nice of Quagmire
to let us use his place.

7
00:00:45,383 --> 00:00:48,932
This'll be much better than that vacation
we took with the Price Is Right yodeler.

8
00:00:50,307 --> 00:00:51,500
Okay, you can stop here.

9
00:00:51,503 --> 00:00:53,996
There's no way that microwave
cost more than 300 bucks.

10
00:00:54,044 --> 00:00:56,153
Stop here. Don't listen
to that fat tourist.

11
00:00:56,158 --> 00:00:57,973
She doesn't know how
much a microwave costs. Stop!

12
00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:03,823
Ah, we should have gone
to Plinko like Cleveland.

13
00:01:17,765 --> 00:01:20,600
Oh... Wow, Quagmire's got
a nice place.

14
00:01:21,265 --> 00:01:24,212
Ah... This is gonna be
a relaxing weekend.

15
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,093
Hey, did you hear
something?

16
00:01:39,097 --> 00:01:40,693
I think it came
from upstairs.

17
00:01:53,755 --> 00:01:54,563
Oh...

18
00:01:54,757 --> 00:01:55,760
Hey.

19
00:01:55,946 --> 00:01:56,701
Uh...

20
00:01:56,846 --> 00:01:58,640
This the week
you guys were coming up?

21
00:02:01,017 --> 00:02:02,801
Beautiful country,
isn't it, Chris?

22
00:02:02,808 --> 00:02:05,853
God, it is peaceful,
no question, Dad.

23
00:02:05,865 --> 00:02:09,502
Just be careful 'cause they got a lot
of big ol' wilderness bugs out here.

24
00:02:10,555 --> 00:02:11,540
Oh, hey.

25
00:02:11,606 --> 00:02:14,871
Y'all best be careful or I'm gonna
sting you with my stinger.

26
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:16,262
Oh, no!

27
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:18,770
But then I's gonna die
if I sting you.

28
00:02:18,786 --> 00:02:21,850
You know what?
I'm not gonna sting y'all after all.

29
00:02:21,857 --> 00:02:24,430
And that's my choice.
Y'all ain't worth it.

30
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,440
I'm just gonna head on over
to that flower

31
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:29,822
and suck on that stamen
like there's no tomorrow.

32
00:02:30,157 --> 00:02:33,673
Brian, how many years have I been saying
you and I should go berry-picking?

33
00:02:33,677 --> 00:02:35,000
A lot of years, Stewie.

34
00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:37,481
Wait a minute.
Do you know where we are, Brian?

35
00:02:37,486 --> 00:02:39,291
This is a very special place.

36
00:02:39,297 --> 00:02:42,222
They say once every
hundred years in this spot,

37
00:02:42,257 --> 00:02:44,381
Donny Most rises from the mist.

38
00:02:44,388 --> 00:02:45,761
I think that's just a legend.

39
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:47,061
That's because you're...

40
00:02:47,156 --> 00:02:48,250
Look!

41
00:02:49,066 --> 00:02:55,523
<i>Donny Most, Donny Most</i>

42
00:02:56,065 --> 00:03:03,660
<i>He was Ralph on Happy Days.</i>

43
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:11,673
<i>Donny Most, Donny Most</i>

44
00:03:12,098 --> 00:03:20,113
<i>Now he rises from the haze.</i>

45
00:03:20,507 --> 00:03:23,073
Actually,it's Don Most now.

46
00:03:23,195 --> 00:03:30,013
<i>Donny Most, Donny Most</i>

47
00:03:30,288 --> 00:03:36,940
<i>Sunday, Monday
Happy...</i>

48
00:03:36,946 --> 00:03:40,123
<i>Days.</i>

49
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,902
All right,here's a little
tune inspired by

50
00:03:45,908 --> 00:03:48,701
one of the great legends
of the Old West.

51
00:03:52,995 --> 00:03:57,773
Well, there once were two cowboys
all alone out on the trail.

52
00:03:57,865 --> 00:04:02,080
And they discovered they could
sleep with another male.

53
00:04:02,088 --> 00:04:03,831
Now they're having gay sex.

54
00:04:06,977 --> 00:04:08,642
Cowboy gay sex.

55
00:04:11,386 --> 00:04:15,290
Sodomy-ee...

56
00:04:15,346 --> 00:04:16,522
Come on, everybody.

57
00:04:16,528 --> 00:04:20,873
Sodomy-ee...

58
00:04:20,975 --> 00:04:25,401
Sodomy-ee.

59
00:04:27,778 --> 00:04:28,671
Sodomy.

60
00:04:31,787 --> 00:04:35,351
And when he woke up in the morning,
she was still in his bed!

61
00:04:37,438 --> 00:04:39,310
- That's it?
- Yeah.

62
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,193
And then she wanted to make him eggs.

63
00:04:42,796 --> 00:04:45,503
And he said, "Oh,I don't have time."
I've got a meeting at 12:30."

64
00:04:45,508 --> 00:04:47,453
And she said, "I'll drive you there."

65
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:50,000
And he said, "No, no,it's at my office.

66
00:04:50,008 --> 00:04:51,700
It's, like,a half-hour commute."
And she said,

67
00:04:51,706 --> 00:04:54,310
"I don't mind.
It's on the way to my kid's preschool."

68
00:05:02,326 --> 00:05:05,171
Hey, hey, Lois,look at me.
I got post partum depression.

69
00:05:05,176 --> 00:05:08,973
Wah! I'm sad about stuff! Wah!

70
00:05:09,345 --> 00:05:11,861
You son of a bitch,
don't even joke about that!

71
00:05:11,927 --> 00:05:13,761
This water feels kind of funny.

72
00:05:13,766 --> 00:05:15,602
Yeah, and it smells bad.

73
00:05:16,536 --> 00:05:17,752
Dad, look!

74
00:05:17,757 --> 00:05:19,011
Holy crap!

75
00:05:23,128 --> 00:05:25,813
Oh, my God, what the hell is
wrong with this lake?!

76
00:05:25,816 --> 00:05:28,462
I think it's a safe bet
that that's responsible.

77
00:05:32,985 --> 00:05:35,300
So they can just dump
their waste into the lake?

78
00:05:35,308 --> 00:05:36,751
This can't be legal.

79
00:05:36,756 --> 00:05:41,043
What kind of world is this where you can't
even trust the oil companies anymore.

80
00:05:41,096 --> 00:05:43,071
- Hey, you've got a tattoo.
- No, I don't.

81
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,591
- Is that Ziggy?
- No.

82
00:05:44,596 --> 00:05:46,802
- You have a Ziggy tattoo?
- Aw, geez.

83
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:50,573
- Why do you have a Ziggy tattoo?
- I just used to think...

84
00:05:50,807 --> 00:05:53,861
he was kind of funny. We should,
uh, we should get to the hospital.

85
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,652
Mom, how long do we have
to wear these wigs?

86
00:06:01,655 --> 00:06:03,511
Until our hair grows back, Chris.

87
00:06:03,516 --> 00:06:06,132
Dad, you couldn't have gotten us
anything more stylish?

88
00:06:06,136 --> 00:06:09,013
Oh, I don't think it's so bad.
I feel rather like Mozart.

89
00:06:09,016 --> 00:06:10,233
Hey, Stewie, play Haydn.

90
00:06:14,967 --> 00:06:16,202
Now play Handel.

91
00:06:22,165 --> 00:06:23,410
Play Peter Griffin.

92
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,390
Ah, now that is a challenge.

93
00:06:38,476 --> 00:06:40,160
Go ahead, mock me.

94
00:06:40,176 --> 00:06:42,653
But it wasn't Stewie
who was laughing at me.

95
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,262
It was God.

96
00:06:50,216 --> 00:06:52,233
What can I do for you, Mrs. Griffin?

97
00:06:52,237 --> 00:06:55,152
Mayor West, I'm here as
an outraged citizen.

98
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:59,651
The Quahog Oil Refinery is emptying
all their toxic waste into the lake.

99
00:06:59,698 --> 00:07:01,691
I mean, you couldn't
possibly have sanctioned

100
00:07:01,705 --> 00:07:04,310
that kind of blatant industrial
pollution, could you?

101
00:07:04,315 --> 00:07:05,862
Yeah, I told 'em it was fine.

102
00:07:05,866 --> 00:07:06,613
What?

103
00:07:06,617 --> 00:07:09,713
And in return, I get free oil
for my hair.

104
00:07:09,937 --> 00:07:13,910
Hey, baby, want to take a gander
at some Adam West penis?

105
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,892
This is unbelievable!

106
00:07:15,896 --> 00:07:20,263
Well, I am not gonna stand by while you
let this town be destroyed by corruption.

107
00:07:20,267 --> 00:07:22,553
Mr. Mayor, I promise you this:

108
00:07:22,558 --> 00:07:25,001
Next election,I'm gonna run against you

109
00:07:25,006 --> 00:07:26,301
and I'm gonna win.

110
00:07:26,348 --> 00:07:29,633
All right ,Mrs. Griffin,
you want to take me on? Fine.

111
00:07:29,636 --> 00:07:31,701
But if you plan to beat me,
you'll have to...

112
00:07:32,045 --> 00:07:32,962
What is it?

113
00:07:32,968 --> 00:07:35,061
A bee just flew in through the window.

114
00:07:35,066 --> 00:07:36,583
Don't move.

115
00:07:37,715 --> 00:07:39,911
Hmm, now look who's mayor.

116
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,570
First order of business,
free honey for everyone.

117
00:07:43,578 --> 00:07:47,273
Yay, Mayor Bee, Mayor Bee! Mayor Bee! Ow!

118
00:07:47,446 --> 00:07:49,293
Oh, done stung myself.

119
00:07:49,295 --> 00:07:51,002
Bye, world.

120
00:07:55,006 --> 00:07:58,190
- Good evening, Quahog. I'm Tom Tucker.
- And I'm Diane Simmons.

121
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,181
The Quahog mayoral race is heating up.

122
00:08:00,195 --> 00:08:04,110
With incumbent Adam West squaring off
against challenger Lois Griffin.

123
00:08:04,115 --> 00:08:06,662
Which leads many political analysts
to ask the question,

124
00:08:06,675 --> 00:08:08,471
"Can a woman really be mayor,

125
00:08:08,477 --> 00:08:11,491
or will she just menstruate all over the city?"
Stay with us.

126
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:18,261
Oh, you guys,I can't tell you how much
I appreciate all your hard work.

127
00:08:18,335 --> 00:08:20,852
It's really gonna make a difference
with my campaign.

128
00:08:20,858 --> 00:08:24,192
Hey, Lois, take a look.
I just made 500 T-shirts that say...

129
00:08:24,206 --> 00:08:26,582
Vote for Lois, unless you're queer.

130
00:08:26,586 --> 00:08:28,111
No, wait,
even if you're queer.

131
00:08:28,187 --> 00:08:29,600
No Jews, though.

132
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:30,971
Okay, Jews.

133
00:08:31,036 --> 00:08:34,770
Oh... These are wonderful, sweetie.

134
00:08:34,798 --> 00:08:38,613
Chris, why don't you put these upstairs
in your closet so we don't lose them?

135
00:08:38,646 --> 00:08:41,011
But the evil monkey lives in my closet.

136
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,472
Of course, he hasn't been as evil
since he became a Jehovah's Witness.

137
00:08:55,408 --> 00:08:59,261
Hi, I'm going door-to-door
to campaign on behalf of Lois Griffin

138
00:08:59,268 --> 00:09:01,860
who's offering real change
for the city of Quahog.

139
00:09:01,867 --> 00:09:04,131
May we count on your vote next Tuesday?

140
00:09:04,258 --> 00:09:06,340
Chris, this is our house.

141
00:09:06,357 --> 00:09:08,850
Ah, then what is for dinner?

142
00:09:08,853 --> 00:09:10,656
- Pork chops.
- Excellent.

143
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:13,863
- Chris, have you been to any other houses?
- I have not.

144
00:09:13,918 --> 00:09:16,133
- Would you like to come in?
- Please.

145
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:20,780
This is Tom Tucker with
some breaking election coverage.

146
00:09:20,786 --> 00:09:24,322
Mayor Adam West has widened his lead
over challenger Lois Griffin.

147
00:09:24,327 --> 00:09:28,061
I'm confident that the people of Quahog
will make the right choice.

148
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:32,471
And here to help me secure
the Latino vote is actor Jimmy Smits.

149
00:09:32,475 --> 00:09:35,440
Adam West likes to eat food
that's grilled in foil.

150
00:09:36,895 --> 00:09:38,120
That's our guy.

151
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:44,091
Boy, this election's
gonna be a tight one.

152
00:09:44,096 --> 00:09:46,441
It's probably gonna be decided
by just a couple of votes.

153
00:09:46,446 --> 00:09:50,150
And here we are sitting here
like a bunch of lazy, paraplegic cops.

154
00:09:50,205 --> 00:09:52,593
- Huh?
- I'm sorry, Joe. It's just an expression.

155
00:09:52,597 --> 00:09:55,351
- Ah.
- We got to give Lois a last-minute edge.

156
00:09:55,365 --> 00:09:57,863
Guys, I need you to help out
on the campaign.

157
00:09:57,865 --> 00:10:02,293
Oh, man, that's like making all, like,
signs, and walking around or what?

158
00:10:02,296 --> 00:10:04,463
You know, you bastards
got a stake in this, too.

159
00:10:04,467 --> 00:10:06,862
I mean, Lois is my wife,
and if she's the mayor

160
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:08,963
we can pretty much do
whatever the hell we want.

161
00:10:08,965 --> 00:10:11,133
I could do cocaine if I wanted to.

162
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,750
- Peter, you want some potatoes?
- Yeah, how you doin'?

163
00:10:13,755 --> 00:10:15,542
I was just asking if you wanted...

164
00:10:15,547 --> 00:10:17,531
We got enough napkins?
Yeah, we got enough napkins.

165
00:10:17,536 --> 00:10:18,922
That's enough.
That's enough right there.

166
00:10:20,297 --> 00:10:21,530
What time is it?

167
00:10:22,235 --> 00:10:24,061
Is this-Is this straight?
Is this straight right there?

168
00:10:24,067 --> 00:10:26,222
Look, wait, see... I'll fix it.

169
00:10:26,237 --> 00:10:28,331
No, no... Is this straight?
I can't tell...

170
00:10:29,626 --> 00:10:32,250
Meg, sweep that up.
Get-Get a broom, sweep that up.

171
00:10:32,255 --> 00:10:34,260
Sweep that up. Put it in your room,
but sweep it up first.

172
00:10:37,707 --> 00:10:41,160
Suspect number two,
he's the one who raped me.

173
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:44,511
All right, all but number two
are free to leave.

174
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:47,720
Ma'am, I know that you're going through
a difficult time right now,

175
00:10:47,726 --> 00:10:49,613
but I just have a few more questions.

176
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:52,183
- Are you planning to vote tomorrow?
- What?

177
00:10:52,186 --> 00:10:54,411
Are you aware that
Lois Griffin has a plan

178
00:10:54,418 --> 00:10:57,321
to cut property tax in half
over the next three years?

179
00:10:57,325 --> 00:10:59,430
What does that have to do
with what happened to me?

180
00:10:59,438 --> 00:11:01,363
Well, you say number two did it,

181
00:11:01,368 --> 00:11:04,553
maybe I say I smell alcohol
on your breath.

182
00:11:04,557 --> 00:11:05,933
You can't do that!

183
00:11:05,937 --> 00:11:08,730
Sounds like Lois Griffin can
count on your vote.

184
00:11:09,926 --> 00:11:13,911
Hi. When you go to vote for mayor
tomorrow, please vote for Lois Griffin.

185
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:17,623
That's right. I work at a deli
and I know baloney.

186
00:11:17,626 --> 00:11:21,123
And that's exactly what you'll get
with Mayor Adam West.

187
00:11:21,127 --> 00:11:23,962
Ooh, sa-nap!

188
00:11:27,307 --> 00:11:30,400
Boy, you guys,I really appreciate
all the help you've been giving us.

189
00:11:30,406 --> 00:11:32,592
Except for you, Quagmire,
you ain't done nothing.

190
00:11:32,598 --> 00:11:33,783
What the hell are you talking about?

191
00:11:33,788 --> 00:11:36,390
Lois is gonna get the entire
female vote 'cause of me.

192
00:11:36,398 --> 00:11:40,620
I've been having sex with every woman
in town nonstop for the past two days.

193
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,820
You know how many sperm I got left?
One.

194
00:11:42,825 --> 00:11:44,943
He's all alone in there and
he's scared, all right?

195
00:11:44,975 --> 00:11:46,743
- He's scared.
- Ah.

196
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:52,732
Welcome, Quahog, to the town hall
mayoral debate

197
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:56,592
between incumbent Adam West
and challenger Lois Griffin.

198
00:11:56,598 --> 00:12:01,212
We will now open up the floor to
questions from a community at large.

199
00:12:01,277 --> 00:12:05,533
Yes, Mrs. Griffin, how do you feel
about those computer websites

200
00:12:05,538 --> 00:12:09,150
that put a blue square
on the home of a sex offender?

201
00:12:09,487 --> 00:12:13,532
Well, the safety of our children is a
very important part of my plan for Quahog.

202
00:12:13,568 --> 00:12:16,790
I have a 12-point program
for the security of...

203
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,771
I'm sorry, your time is up.

204
00:12:22,238 --> 00:12:24,733
No, no, no, no,I'm not impressed.
I'm not impressed, not yet.

205
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,592
Mayor West, if reelected,

206
00:12:26,597 --> 00:12:29,043
would you increase the frequency
of garbage pickup?

207
00:12:29,127 --> 00:12:32,541
Well, citizen, that's an excellent
question and I thank you for it.

208
00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:36,481
I think it's great we live in a town
where you can ask questions.

209
00:12:36,487 --> 00:12:40,151
Because without questions,
we'd just have answers.

210
00:12:40,156 --> 00:12:42,793
And an answer without
a question is a statement.

211
00:12:43,787 --> 00:12:46,521
Oh, I like him.
He looks me in the eye.

212
00:12:48,407 --> 00:12:50,292
I'd like to have a beer with him.
I'm voting for him.

213
00:12:51,936 --> 00:12:54,070
I don't understand these people.

214
00:12:54,075 --> 00:12:56,492
He didn't even say anything
and they're eating it up.

215
00:12:56,536 --> 00:12:59,473
Lois, undecided voters
are the biggest idiots on the planet.

216
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,402
Try giving short, simple answers.

217
00:13:01,646 --> 00:13:03,442
Sir, your question, please?

218
00:13:03,445 --> 00:13:06,902
Mrs. Griffin, what do you plan to
do about crime in our city?

219
00:13:07,827 --> 00:13:10,303
- A lot.
- She's got my vote.

220
00:13:12,896 --> 00:13:15,492
Because that's what Jesus wants.

221
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:20,323
9/11 was bad.

222
00:13:22,516 --> 00:13:23,251
I agree with that.

223
00:13:23,466 --> 00:13:25,452
God, I can't believe how easy this is.

224
00:13:25,546 --> 00:13:28,622
Mrs. Griffin, what are your plans
for cleaning up our environment?

225
00:13:29,286 --> 00:13:30,390
9/11.

226
00:13:33,985 --> 00:13:36,681
Mrs. Griffin, what about
our traffic problem?

227
00:13:36,717 --> 00:13:37,513
Nine...

228
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:39,760
Eleven.

229
00:13:50,357 --> 00:13:54,263
Well, the election results are poring in
and it looks like it's gonna be a tight one.

230
00:13:54,385 --> 00:13:57,023
Which reminds me, Diane, when's
the last time you... aw, forget it.

231
00:13:57,048 --> 00:13:59,100
Oh, my God,I'm an absolute wreck.

232
00:13:59,108 --> 00:14:00,692
Well, folks, this is it.

233
00:14:00,698 --> 00:14:04,280
The last of the votes have been tallied
and we're getting the final results in now.

234
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,540
Quahog's new mayor is...

235
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,140
Lois Griffin.

236
00:14:12,516 --> 00:14:15,650
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, God!

237
00:14:17,407 --> 00:14:19,641
Oh. Were we done cheering?

238
00:14:24,427 --> 00:14:26,711
Well, Mrs. Mayor,
how do you feel?

239
00:14:26,786 --> 00:14:28,733
Oh, I'm a little nervous, Brian,

240
00:14:28,736 --> 00:14:31,912
but mostly I'm excited
about all the good I'm gonna get to do.

241
00:14:31,936 --> 00:14:33,232
Wow, look at you.

242
00:14:33,237 --> 00:14:35,741
All that power and you've
still got that body.

243
00:14:35,747 --> 00:14:39,040
And the first thing I'm going to do as
mayor is clean up Lake Quahog.

244
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:42,391
Well, I know the people will support you,
Lois, because you connect with them.

245
00:14:42,408 --> 00:14:44,420
Like Disney connects with it's audience.

246
00:14:44,427 --> 00:14:47,420
- You da cow!
- No, you da cow!

247
00:14:47,497 --> 00:14:49,212
Wow, Disney gets us.

248
00:14:49,448 --> 00:14:50,652
<i>Quahog Town Hall.</i>

249
00:14:52,245 --> 00:14:54,952
And I think we all realize
the importance of stopping

250
00:14:54,968 --> 00:14:57,440
the environmental damage
being done to Lake Quahog,

251
00:14:57,508 --> 00:15:01,773
which is why I'm proposing a very modest
tax increase that will help us to...

252
00:15:03,918 --> 00:15:06,223
No, no, no, that's awful.
No, no, no, I'm not okay with that.

253
00:15:06,236 --> 00:15:07,740
No new taxes!

254
00:15:07,766 --> 00:15:09,363
<i>No new taxes!</i>

255
00:15:09,418 --> 00:15:10,910
<i>No new taxes!</i>

256
00:15:11,017 --> 00:15:12,481
<i>No new taxes!</i>

257
00:15:12,588 --> 00:15:15,220
But what about the terrorists?

258
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:18,852
That's right, terrorists.

259
00:15:19,256 --> 00:15:22,081
We have intelligence
that suggests that...

260
00:15:22,848 --> 00:15:25,793
Hitler is plotting with...

261
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,383
with the Legion of Doom...

262
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:31,102
to assassinate Jesus...

263
00:15:32,146 --> 00:15:33,813
using the lake as a base.

264
00:15:35,775 --> 00:15:37,990
<i>Meanwhile, at the Legion of Doom...</i>

265
00:15:39,215 --> 00:15:41,381
How did she discover our plan?

266
00:15:41,478 --> 00:15:45,070
Me, Solomon Grundy, kind of dropped
the ball on that one.

267
00:15:45,435 --> 00:15:47,850
And we alsohave evidence that...

268
00:15:48,335 --> 00:15:52,302
Darth Vader tried to buy
yellowcake uranium...

269
00:15:52,428 --> 00:15:55,311
from unwed teenage mothers.

270
00:15:55,365 --> 00:15:57,150
Those things all sound scary.

271
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,380
How much money before it can feel safe again?

272
00:16:01,255 --> 00:16:03,081
Um...
a hundred thousand?

273
00:16:05,305 --> 00:16:07,400
I threw a ten.
See that ten there? I threw that.

274
00:16:13,165 --> 00:16:16,080
At the top of the news,
Lake Quahog is once again clean,

275
00:16:16,096 --> 00:16:19,120
thanks to the efforts of newly
elected mayor, Lois Griffin.

276
00:16:19,165 --> 00:16:23,143
We now go to Asian reporter, Tricia
Takanawa, for her slant on the story.

277
00:16:23,236 --> 00:16:24,392
Thanks, Tom.

278
00:16:24,397 --> 00:16:28,522
Once again, happy locals are frolicking
in the waters of Lake Quahog.

279
00:16:28,528 --> 00:16:30,723
And we're here with their reactions.

280
00:16:30,726 --> 00:16:33,412
Sir, how does it feel
to have the lake back?

281
00:16:33,415 --> 00:16:35,521
Well, I'll tell you, Tricia, as a local resident,

282
00:16:35,525 --> 00:16:38,031
I feel like I can once again
take pride in my community.

283
00:16:38,046 --> 00:16:40,672
I think this is really gonna
revitalize tourism.

284
00:16:41,486 --> 00:16:44,731
And if you look around, I think even
the wildlife is starting to come back.

285
00:16:44,747 --> 00:16:46,540
And, you know, that's something
we haven't seen in a while.

286
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,051
I think we're going to be seeing
a lot more of that.

287
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,532
Hey, you guys.

288
00:16:49,535 --> 00:16:53,161
Mom, everyone on TV says
you're running the town great.

289
00:16:53,468 --> 00:16:55,821
Maybe you can do some damn
laundry once in a while.

290
00:16:55,856 --> 00:16:56,701
- What?
- What?

291
00:16:56,828 --> 00:16:59,041
Wow, Mom, is that a new purse?

292
00:16:59,056 --> 00:17:00,751
Yeah, that looks pretty expensive.

293
00:17:01,127 --> 00:17:04,840
Well, don't tell anybody, Brian,
but I was a little naughty.

294
00:17:05,007 --> 00:17:07,080
I may have dipped into
the tax surplus.

295
00:17:07,115 --> 00:17:10,580
Wait a minute, you used taxpayer money
to buy yourself a handbag?

296
00:17:10,587 --> 00:17:12,471
It's no big deal, Brian.

297
00:17:12,475 --> 00:17:15,340
Besides, there was a lot left over
after the lake cleanup

298
00:17:15,345 --> 00:17:18,871
and I figured maybe
I earned a little treat, huh?

299
00:17:18,886 --> 00:17:22,881
Lois, spending even one penny of that
money on yourself is incredibly unethical.

300
00:17:22,885 --> 00:17:25,312
Oh, come on, it was only $600.

301
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:28,963
My God, that's more than I spent
to go see that prizefight in Vegas.

302
00:17:29,035 --> 00:17:31,903
I thought you said we was going
to see Hairspray.

303
00:17:31,906 --> 00:17:34,800
Bitch, I thought I said just shut up
and be lookin' fine.

304
00:17:40,358 --> 00:17:42,610
What the hell's up with
these rolling blackouts?

305
00:17:42,615 --> 00:17:44,141
Well, since Lois is the mayor,

306
00:17:44,155 --> 00:17:46,411
I'm allowed to reroute
all the town's electricity.

307
00:17:46,428 --> 00:17:47,360
What'd you do that for?

308
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,873
So I could reanimate
the corpse of Jim Varney.

309
00:17:49,888 --> 00:17:50,952
Howdy, Vern.

310
00:17:50,977 --> 00:17:53,813
This is some dad-gum nicehouse
you got here, Vern.

311
00:17:53,826 --> 00:17:55,712
That's Vern, V-Vern,Vern, Vern.

312
00:17:55,817 --> 00:17:59,051
Oh, wait, wait, it was John Belushi,
that's who I wanted.

313
00:17:59,057 --> 00:17:59,993
Peter, how could you...?

314
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,722
Way ahead of you, Brian.
My mistake, I'll take care of this.

315
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:08,220
- Hey, Jim, come out in the yard, will ya?
- Sure thing, Vern.

316
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:15,322
He got the shotgun, Brian!

317
00:18:15,336 --> 00:18:17,703
Don't ask me how he did it,
but Jim Varney got the shotgun!

318
00:18:17,707 --> 00:18:18,893
- Run for your life!
- What?!

319
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:19,580
<i>Run!</i>

320
00:18:27,025 --> 00:18:29,213
Excuse me, how much is this coat?

321
00:18:29,226 --> 00:18:30,423
It's $4,300.

322
00:18:30,455 --> 00:18:31,272
Oh.

323
00:18:31,676 --> 00:18:34,852
Do you think you can give me
a little mayoral discount?

324
00:18:34,858 --> 00:18:38,901
Well, I think you're doing a great job,
Mrs. Griffin, but my boss would kill me.

325
00:18:38,997 --> 00:18:41,281
- How's everything going out here?
- Fine, Mr. Voorhees.

326
00:18:41,285 --> 00:18:43,083
Good. 'Cause if you screw up,
I'll kill ya.

327
00:18:43,816 --> 00:18:46,151
Hi. Bob Grossbeard, Quahog Oil.

328
00:18:46,197 --> 00:18:48,480
I'd like to buy you that coat.

329
00:18:48,485 --> 00:18:49,271
Really?

330
00:18:49,275 --> 00:18:52,323
All I ask in return is that
you let my company do

331
00:18:52,326 --> 00:18:54,383
just a little bit of dumping
in your lake.

332
00:18:54,397 --> 00:18:57,170
This guy don't sit right with me, Lois.
He don't sit right with me.

333
00:18:57,187 --> 00:18:59,973
But I just cleaned up Quahog Lake.

334
00:19:00,016 --> 00:19:01,703
Do you want the coat or not?

335
00:19:06,415 --> 00:19:07,970
- I want the coat.
- Excellent.

336
00:19:07,986 --> 00:19:09,773
Then we have a deal.

337
00:19:10,035 --> 00:19:13,452
Ugh, Brian's gonna be really
upset when he finds out.

338
00:19:13,536 --> 00:19:16,573
Eh, I'll just take him for a ride in the car,
he'll forget all about it.

339
00:19:19,448 --> 00:19:22,252
Wait a minute, I know where we are.
The park is near here.

340
00:19:22,256 --> 00:19:25,100
We're near the park, Lois.
Oh, that's the tree. I peed on that.

341
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:29,043
Hey. Hey, Lois. Lois.
There's another dog in that car.

342
00:19:29,055 --> 00:19:31,731
H-Hey, hey, hey!
There's another dog in that car. Hey!

343
00:19:31,736 --> 00:19:33,611
Are you seeing that?! Hey! Hey! Hey!

344
00:19:33,656 --> 00:19:35,110
Other dog, fuck you!

345
00:19:38,506 --> 00:19:42,013
Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf
of the Quahog Oil Refinery,

346
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:46,583
we would like to thank Mayor Lois Griffin
for our newest waste pipe.

347
00:19:51,195 --> 00:19:53,591
Let the dumping resume.

348
00:20:00,517 --> 00:20:02,842
Hey, Jake, how long can you hold
your breath under water?

349
00:20:02,845 --> 00:20:04,762
Longer than you. Check it out.

350
00:20:09,318 --> 00:20:10,853
Aah! My face!

351
00:20:18,215 --> 00:20:19,913
Lois, what the hell are you doing?

352
00:20:19,915 --> 00:20:22,742
Remembering who I am, you crook.

353
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:24,631
Oh, I'm a crook, am I?

354
00:20:24,636 --> 00:20:26,352
What about all the money
you embezzled?

355
00:20:26,395 --> 00:20:28,340
You want people to find out about that?

356
00:20:28,586 --> 00:20:31,840
You better play ball, or we'll find
someone else who will.

357
00:20:31,988 --> 00:20:33,590
I'll play ball.

358
00:20:33,595 --> 00:20:36,371
You know what, West?
You can have your job back.

359
00:20:36,426 --> 00:20:39,530
Politics does terrible things
to good people.

360
00:20:39,535 --> 00:20:42,172
Good for you, Lois.
You wised up before it was too late.

361
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:44,722
I was so consumed by power and money,

362
00:20:44,725 --> 00:20:47,501
I became the very thing
I set out to destroy.

363
00:20:47,575 --> 00:20:50,200
Hooray! I'm mayor again!

364
00:20:50,335 --> 00:20:52,210
Don't we need to have
a whole new election?

365
00:20:54,936 --> 00:20:57,903
There. Now no one will have
heard him say that.

366
00:20:57,928 --> 00:20:59,242
We all heard him say it.

367
00:21:01,225 --> 00:21:03,123
Anybody else hear anything?

368
00:21:04,008 --> 00:21:05,153
My wife did.
