Do you know how much
talking it took

114
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,744
to get her out of the house
because of her no-hair?

115

I didn't know.

I'm so... I'm so sorry.

117

Oh, you're sorry?
For... For what?

118
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,535
That waiting in line is
such a catastrophe for you

119
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,070
that you'd rather
destroy the confidence

120
00:06:37,138 --> 00:06:38,672

cancer patient?

121

Oh, come on.
I... I didn't know she was dying.

122
00:06:41,142 --> 00:06:42,409
Who said anything about dying?!

123
00:06:42,477 --> 00:06:44,511
Uncle Glenn, am I dying?

124
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:46,079
No, sweetheart,
you're not dying.

125
00:06:46,147 --> 00:06:47,347
'Cause we're gonna see Santa,

126
00:06:47,415 --> 00:06:49,249
and he's gonna bring
you a new brain.

127
00:06:49,317 --> 00:06:50,484
Get out of here, Brian.

128
00:06:50,551 --> 00:06:52,369
Just get out of here.

129
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,372
Should have gone
into politics, Bri.

130
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,874
Now we got to go to
the back of the line.

131
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,426
What the hell!
Why isn't it moving?

132
00:06:59,493 --> 00:07:01,178
I don't know.
It's always the same thing.

that's half chinchilla
and half mink,

139
00:07:15,576 --> 00:07:16,910
'cause it'd be really soft,

140
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,212
and I could call it chink,
and that's okay.

141
00:07:26,687 --> 00:07:27,988
Geez, doesn't the
mall close soon?

142

Hello, Santa.

146
00:07:36,097 --> 00:07:38,231
Now, um,
we've got a slight problem here,

147

because I have been
rather naughty.

151
00:07:52,213 --> 00:07:53,680
Santa?
You can't leave now!

152
00:07:53,748 --> 00:07:55,015
Hey, wait...
Wait, buddy, buddy,

153
00:07:55,066 --> 00:07:56,416
we've been in line for,
like, two hours.

Sorry.
I'm done.

155
00:07:57,752 --> 00:07:59,819
You want your kid
to sit on my lap,

156
00:07:59,887 --> 00:08:01,888
meet me at the bar
at Applebee's.

157
00:08:01,956 --> 00:08:03,223
Aw, that sucks.

158
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,491
Sorry, Stewie.

159
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:05,992
That son of a bitch.

160
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,694
He just turned his back on me.

161
00:08:07,762 --> 00:08:10,197
The way reality turned
its back on Gary Busey.

162
00:08:10,264 --> 00:08:12,499
How am I doing today,
Gary Busey?

163
00:08:12,567 --> 00:08:13,867
You're doing great!

164
00:08:13,935 --> 00:08:16,069
Good!
Then I'll keep it up!

165
00:08:23,094 --> 00:08:24,995
Hey, give me your keys.

166
00:08:25,062 --> 00:08:26,446
I need your car.

167
00:08:26,514 --> 00:08:27,847
What?
You're not taking my car.

168
00:08:27,915 --> 00:08:29,749
Very well, then.
You're driving me. Let's go.

169
00:08:29,817 --> 00:08:30,967
Dri... Driving you where?

170
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,019
To the North Pole
to see Santa Claus.

171
00:08:33,087 --> 00:08:34,521
If that beslubbering,
onion-eyed maggot-pie thinks

172
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:36,456
he can just blow me off
like that,

173
00:08:36,524 --> 00:08:37,757
he's got another thing coming.

174
00:08:37,825 --> 00:08:39,159
Look, Stewie, I know
you're disappointed

175
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,827
that you didn't
get to see Santa,

176
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,896
but I... I'm not driving
you to the North Pole.

177
00:08:42,964 --> 00:08:46,800
Everyone,
Quagmire's niece is in the ICU.

178
00:08:46,867 --> 00:08:49,302
Now, I think we should go
down there to support him.

179
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,004
- Wh... What?
- Yeah, apparently,

180
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,339
something happened at the mall,

181
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,274
and she took a turn
for the worse.

182
00:08:54,342 --> 00:08:56,343
They don't know how much time
she has left.

183
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,510
Quagmire just called.

184
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,012
He's really upset.

185
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,914
It doesn't sound
like he wants us there

186
00:09:00,982 --> 00:09:02,983
for some reason, but...
But we should go anyway.

187
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,619
All right,
let's go to the North Pole.

188
00:09:05,686 --> 00:09:11,491
And so Brian and Stewie set off
on the road to the North Pole.

189
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:14,261
Hey, you want
to hear a real live-action fart

190
00:09:14,328 --> 00:09:17,464
instead of one
of those fake cartoony ones?

191
00:09:17,531 --> 00:09:19,799
(breaking wind)

192
00:09:21,469 --> 00:09:23,486
We're gonna need another pair
of pants...

193
00:09:23,571 --> 00:09:25,405
And another chair.

194
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,117
Hey, Stewie, wake up.

195
00:09:37,184 --> 00:09:39,085
We're here.
We're at the North Pole.

196
00:09:39,153 --> 00:09:42,122
Oh, uh. What? What? What?
Uh, North Pole?

197
00:09:46,193 --> 00:09:47,827
North Pole! North Pole!

198
00:09:47,895 --> 00:09:49,129
There it is!

199
00:09:49,196 --> 00:09:51,097
My word, I really
must have been asleep!

200
00:09:54,568 --> 00:09:55,735
Ah, look at this.

201
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,337
The tip of the Earth, Brian.

202
00:09:57,405 --> 00:09:58,938
Okay, let's go see Santa Claus.

203
00:09:59,006 --> 00:10:00,840
All right, let's go.

204
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,512
Well, this is rather festive,
isn't it?

205
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:10,400
Small.

206
00:10:12,686 --> 00:10:15,872
Well, it has to be small
because of all the tiny elves.

207
00:10:15,956 --> 00:10:17,040
Ah, that's right.

208
00:10:17,124 --> 00:10:18,291
Good. Good point.
Elves.

209
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:19,859
MAN:
Yo, yo, what's up, y'alls?

210
00:10:19,927 --> 00:10:23,363
Y'alls ready to kick it
in some fine North Pole gear?

211
00:10:23,431 --> 00:10:27,167
Brian, why does the North Pole
have black teenagers?

212
00:10:27,218 --> 00:10:29,836
Uh... 'cause...
From, uh, Katrina?

213
00:10:29,887 --> 00:10:31,237
Ah, of course. All right.

214
00:10:31,305 --> 00:10:33,640
Well, uh, I just have
one more question, then.

215
00:10:33,707 --> 00:10:36,059
(yelling): Do you think I'm an idiot?!
Huh? Do you?

216
00:10:36,143 --> 00:10:38,478
Look, Stewie, the North Pole
is a long and dangerous...

217
00:10:38,545 --> 00:10:41,547
You can't jerk me around when
it comes to Santa Claus, Brian!

218
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,317
There is a Ferris wheel here,
and a guy hosing vomit!

219
00:10:44,385 --> 00:10:46,052
Nobody vomits
at the North Pole!

220
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,462
Except for Santa's wife

221
00:10:48,486 --> 00:10:50,059
- because she has an eating disorder!
- What?

222
00:10:50,074 --> 00:10:52,892
Yeah, 'cause he can have
anyone he wants, and she knows that!

223
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,361
Stewie, just pull
yourself together.

224
00:10:54,428 --> 00:10:55,895
I won't, Brian!

225
00:10:55,963 --> 00:10:57,947
Now you get your ass back
into that hippie car of yours

226
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,399
and take me
to the North Pole now!

227
00:10:59,467 --> 00:11:00,600
Look, I know you're upset,

228
00:11:00,668 --> 00:11:02,035
but why...
Why don't you just sit down,

229
00:11:02,103 --> 00:11:03,286
write out your Christmas list,

230
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,121
and I promise I will
mail it to Santa Claus?

231
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,423
Screw that.

232
00:11:06,507 --> 00:11:09,008
This was never about
Christmas presents, Brian.

233
00:11:09,076 --> 00:11:11,578
Well, then why do you want to go
all the way to the North Pole?

234
00:11:11,645 --> 00:11:15,715
Because...
I'm going to kill Santa Claus!

235
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:24,840
RON: So it turned out Stewie was
determined to kill Santa Claus.

236
00:11:25,542 --> 00:11:27,030
Would he succeed?

237
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,281
Well, let's find out.

238
00:11:29,349 --> 00:11:31,717
Wait a minute, why the hell
do you want to kill Santa?

239
00:11:31,785 --> 00:11:34,086
Because that fat bastard
blew me off at the mall,

240
00:11:34,154 --> 00:11:35,554
and he shall not go unpunished.

241
00:11:35,622 --> 00:11:37,656
Now, let's go.
I've got it all planned out.

242
00:11:37,724 --> 00:11:39,658
I'm gonna see the workshop,
pet a few reindeer,

243
00:11:39,726 --> 00:11:41,560
take a few pictures
of me and Santa,

244
00:11:41,628 --> 00:11:43,429
and then I'm gonna
blow his brains out,

245
00:11:43,496 --> 00:11:44,930
hopefully with his
bitch wife watching.

246
00:11:44,998 --> 00:11:47,332
This is ridiculous...
We are not going to the North Pole.

247
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,235
Trust me, it's a waste of time...
You're not gonna find Santa.

248
00:11:50,303 --> 00:11:52,371
- Why not?
- Because there's no such...

249
00:11:54,107 --> 00:11:56,642
Because when you get there,
you may find out

250
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,544
it isn't what
you thought it was,

251
00:11:58,611 --> 00:12:01,046
and I wouldn't want you
to be disappointed.

252
00:12:01,114 --> 00:12:02,915
That's it?
That's your reason?

253
00:12:02,982 --> 00:12:05,718
Well, you know, you know why
nothing works out for you, Brian?

254
00:12:05,785 --> 00:12:07,119
Because you've got
a negative attitude.

255
00:12:07,187 --> 00:12:08,754
Like Eeyore.

256
00:12:08,822 --> 00:12:10,689
Come on, Eeyore, let's go play.

257
00:12:10,757 --> 00:12:12,491
I don't feel like it.

258
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:15,828
Why are you always
in such a bad mood?

259
00:12:15,895 --> 00:12:18,530
- I have a nail in my anus.
- Oh.

260
00:12:18,598 --> 00:12:20,365
That's not fair.
I don't think I have

261
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:21,533
a negative attitude.
I just...

262
00:12:21,601 --> 00:12:23,469
I... I don't think
it's a good idea for us

263
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:26,038
to embark on a potentially
dangerous journey whe...

264
00:12:26,106 --> 00:12:27,172
Stewie?

265
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,407
(truck horn blows)

266
00:12:28,474 --> 00:12:30,409
STEWIE:
Say yes to life, Brian!

267
00:12:30,477 --> 00:12:31,944
I'll be home for Christmas.

268
00:12:34,097 --> 00:12:35,664
Son of a bitch!

269
00:12:36,883 --> 00:12:38,784
(tires squealing)

270
00:12:42,922 --> 00:12:44,623
So, what are we hauling,
good buddy?

271
00:12:44,691 --> 00:12:46,425
Oh, I got a flock of birds

272
00:12:46,492 --> 00:12:48,360
that were too tired
to fly back north.

273
00:12:48,428 --> 00:12:50,596
Boy, this is the way
to do it, huh, Jerry?

274
00:12:50,663 --> 00:12:52,931
Sure is.
Think this makes us lazy?

275
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:56,135
Nah, we're still
in the V-shape.

276
00:13:26,332 --> 00:13:27,666
(wind whistling softly)

277
00:13:37,243 --> 00:13:39,478
What is this?
This is a weird gun.

278
00:13:39,546 --> 00:13:40,813
Yeah. Don't touch that.

279
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,281
Oh, it's a flare gun.

280
00:13:42,348 --> 00:13:43,882
Maybe you should put that back.

281
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,901
I'm just holding it.
Is this the trigger?

282
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:51,073
(screaming)

283
00:14:12,712 --> 00:14:14,246
(tires screeching)

284
00:14:24,991 --> 00:14:27,292
Oh, my God, Stewie,
you all right?

285
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,594
What the hell happened?

286
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:31,330
Eh, just some stupid
stuff went down.

287
00:14:31,397 --> 00:14:32,698
You could have been killed!

288
00:14:32,765 --> 00:14:33,899
I could have been killed!

289
00:14:33,967 --> 00:14:35,167
Look at my car!

290
00:14:35,235 --> 00:14:37,135
Well, you know,
if you had just taken me

291
00:14:37,203 --> 00:14:38,837
to the real North Pole
to see Santa,

292
00:14:38,905 --> 00:14:41,073
none of this
would have happened!

293
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,608
Wh... Wh... What is this?
What are you doing?

294
00:14:42,675 --> 00:14:43,876
Hitching a ride.

295
00:14:43,943 --> 00:14:45,978
I'm gonna keep heading
north until I find Santa.

296
00:14:46,045 --> 00:14:47,312
Stewie, you're not
gonna find him.

297
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,680
You do what you want, Brian,

298
00:14:48,748 --> 00:14:50,515
but I am going
to the North Pole

299
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,050
and I'm gonna kill
that bastard!

300
00:14:52,118 --> 00:14:54,353
Stewie, you're putting me
in a hell of a position here,

301
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,888
but I have no choice.

302
00:14:55,955 --> 00:14:57,322
You're not gonna
kill Santa Claus,

303
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,757
because he doesn't exist.

304
00:15:00,026 --> 00:15:02,661
(chuckling):
R... R... Really, Brian?

305
00:15:02,729 --> 00:15:04,129
He doesn't exist?

306
00:15:04,197 --> 00:15:05,631
That's right, he's not real.

307
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:07,266
Oh, interesting.
Interesting theory, Brian.

308
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,134
Um, who else isn't real, hmm?

309
00:15:09,202 --> 00:15:11,403
You gonna tell me
that Elmo isn't real?

310
00:15:11,471 --> 00:15:14,373
Huh? SpongeBob?
Is he not real, Brian?

311
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,376
Is... Is SpongeBob not there
at the bottom of the ocean

312
00:15:17,443 --> 00:15:19,378
giving Squidward the business?
Hmm?

313
00:15:19,445 --> 00:15:21,313
And what about Curious George?

314
00:15:21,381 --> 00:15:23,949
Huh?
Does he not really exist? Hmm?

315
00:15:24,017 --> 00:15:25,884
Is Curious George
not really out there

316
00:15:25,952 --> 00:15:27,619
making little boats
out of newspapers

317
00:15:27,687 --> 00:15:29,621
that he should be delivering?
Huh?

318
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:31,623
Educate yourself, you fool.

319
00:15:31,691 --> 00:15:33,458
Look, Stewie,
if you'd just listen for a sec...

320
00:15:33,526 --> 00:15:34,760
No, you listen, Brian!

321
00:15:34,827 --> 00:15:37,562
I'll tell you what,
you take me to the North Pole,

322
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,732
and if Santa isn't there,
I'll do something for you.

323
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,467
- What?
- When Lois does that

324
00:15:42,535 --> 00:15:43,869
middle-of-the-night feeding

325
00:15:43,937 --> 00:15:46,471
where she doesn't even open
her eyes or really wake up,

326
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:48,807
I'll let you take that
one for me, Brian.

327
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,877
- Are you serious?
- Quite.

328
00:15:51,945 --> 00:15:53,545
Okay, you got a deal.

329
00:15:55,782 --> 00:15:59,384
Damn it, it won't turn over.

330
00:15:59,452 --> 00:16:02,621
Great! Not even halfway through
Canada, and we're stuck.

331
00:16:05,825 --> 00:16:07,059
Oh, hey there.

332
00:16:07,126 --> 00:16:08,794
You having some
car troubles, eh?

333
00:16:08,861 --> 00:16:10,929
Yeah, we're trying to get
to the North Pole.

334
00:16:10,997 --> 00:16:13,065
- I don't suppose you're from Triple A, are you?
- Who?

335
00:16:13,132 --> 00:16:14,866
Triple A, you know?
AAA.

336
00:16:14,934 --> 00:16:17,135
Oh, AA, eh?
Yeah, I just came from AA.

337
00:16:17,203 --> 00:16:18,603
No, not AA.
AAA.

338
00:16:18,671 --> 00:16:20,105
Yeah, that's what I said...
AA, eh?

339
00:16:20,173 --> 00:16:21,573
Oh, so you are with Triple A?

340
00:16:21,641 --> 00:16:23,809
Oh, no, that's AAA.
I just came from AA, eh?

341
00:16:23,876 --> 00:16:25,377
- Huh?
- Stewie, I think he's just a drunk.

342
00:16:25,445 --> 00:16:27,112
Well, drunk or not,
can you help us?

343
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,981
I can if you want
to join AA, eh?

344
00:16:29,048 --> 00:16:30,515
No, I'm already
a member of AAA.

345
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:31,917
I need help with the car.

346
00:16:31,985 --> 00:16:34,319
Oh, I see. Yeah, looks like
you got some water leakage.

347
00:16:34,387 --> 00:16:35,921
You might need a hose, eh?

348
00:16:35,989 --> 00:16:37,856
Jose, Roberto, whatever...
If you've got some Latinos up here

349
00:16:37,924 --> 00:16:39,358
that can fix cars,
that'd be great.

350
00:16:39,425 --> 00:16:41,626
No, I mean, it looks
like you need a part, eh?

351
00:16:41,694 --> 00:16:43,195
Well, yeah, when it's fixed,
we can celebrate,

352
00:16:43,262 --> 00:16:44,696
but let's deal with
first things first.

353
00:16:44,764 --> 00:16:46,999
Well, I can probably take
you to a gas station, eh?

354
00:16:47,066 --> 00:16:49,601
- You have cash, eh?
- I don't know, my name carries a little weight,

355
00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:51,269
but I don't see how
that matters here.

356
00:16:51,337 --> 00:16:53,472
Look, we don't have enough cash
to fix the car,

357
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:55,841
and we're kind of on our way
to the North Pole.

358
00:16:55,908 --> 00:16:58,076
Oh, a car won't take
you there, anyway.

359
00:16:58,144 --> 00:17:01,213
But if you like,
you can take my snowmobile.

360
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,782
Really? You'd just...
give it to us?

361
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,385
Oh, sure, that's what Canadian
hospitality's all about.

362
00:17:06,452 --> 00:17:09,855
If you like, you can have
all my money and my leg.

363
00:17:09,922 --> 00:17:10,989
Okay.

364
00:17:15,595 --> 00:17:19,264
(snowmobile rumbling)

365
00:17:22,485 --> 00:17:23,735
Why'd we take his leg?

366
00:17:23,786 --> 00:17:25,203
Well, we're in their
country, Brian...

367
00:17:25,271 --> 00:17:26,671
We have to observe
their customs.

368
00:17:26,739 --> 00:17:27,772
Oh! Oh, dear.

369
00:17:29,275 --> 00:17:30,625
Well, at least we're done

370
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,744
with the first leg
of our journey, Brian.

371
00:17:32,795 --> 00:17:34,946
Ha!
Damn right, ha.

372
00:18:05,411 --> 00:18:07,913
Brian, how long do you
think we've been driving?

373
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,748
I don't know, I've lost track.

374
00:18:09,815 --> 00:18:11,983
Besides, dogs don't have
a good sense of time.

375
00:18:12,034 --> 00:18:13,869
Could be three hours,
could be three years,

376
00:18:13,953 --> 00:18:15,120
I don't (bleep) know.

377
00:18:15,171 --> 00:18:17,589
Well, we must be
pretty far north by now.

378
00:18:17,657 --> 00:18:19,925
Yeah, you're right. Look...
There's the aurora borealis.

379
00:18:22,328 --> 00:18:24,546
Yes, and there's
the aurora Boreanaz.

380
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,014
Hi there.

381
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:28,500
Things are kind of
beautiful up north, huh?

382
00:18:32,438 --> 00:18:33,805
Oh, no!

383
00:18:33,873 --> 00:18:35,607
- What's the matter?
- We're out of gas.

384
00:18:35,675 --> 00:18:39,044
Out of gas? But, Brian, it's freezing out here!
What are we gonna do?

385
00:18:39,112 --> 00:18:41,079
I don't know.
We'd better think of something.

386
00:18:41,147 --> 00:18:42,981
DAVID:
Maybe I can help.

387
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:47,085
There's an old, abandoned hunting
cabin about two miles north of here.

388
00:18:47,153 --> 00:18:48,854
You could spend the night there

389
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:51,289
and then resume your
journey in the morning.

390
00:18:51,357 --> 00:18:52,757
Thanks, David.

391
00:18:52,825 --> 00:18:55,694
Guess there are a few stars
in the sky tonight.

392
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:57,863
(chuckling)

393
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,030
Come on.

394
00:18:59,098 --> 00:19:00,198
Come on, now.

395
00:19:00,266 --> 00:19:02,467
Okay, we'll leave you alone.

396
00:19:08,112 --> 00:19:11,114
(wind howling)

397
00:19:51,016 --> 00:19:52,770
All right,
this should do for the night.

398
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,125
Look, Stewie,
now that we have a moment,

399
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:57,661
I think we should really try to
call Lois and tell her where we are.

400
00:19:57,752 --> 00:19:59,152
Oh, don't worry...
I've got that covered.

401
00:20:00,688 --> 00:20:02,789
<i>Hey, Lois, would you make
an appointment for me</i>

402
00:20:02,857 --> 00:20:04,424
<i>to be neutered in two days?</i>

403
00:20:04,492 --> 00:20:06,727
- Well, are you sure, Brian?
<i>- Yes, I'm sure.</i>

404
00:20:06,794 --> 00:20:08,629
<i>And whatever I say in two days,</i>

405
00:20:08,696 --> 00:20:11,665
<i>do not let me convince you
that I've changed my mind.</i>

406
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:14,167
<i>Wow, you sound pretty serious
about this, Brian.</i>

407
00:20:14,235 --> 00:20:16,837
<i>Oh, I am. In fact,
I have this document</i>

408
00:20:16,904 --> 00:20:18,639
<i>that legally binds me to same.</i>

409
00:20:18,706 --> 00:20:20,273
<i>Have you had it notarized?</i>

410
00:20:20,341 --> 00:20:23,060
<i>No. But a notary should
be here any minute.</i>

411
00:20:23,144 --> 00:20:25,712
<i>I received a call about
notarizing a document,</i>

412
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,248
<i>but I am spending
the day with my family,</i>

413
00:20:28,316 --> 00:20:29,683
<i>so they are here, too.</i>

414
00:20:29,751 --> 00:20:31,451
<i>This is my wife, Janice,</i>

415
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:33,520
<i>my daughters, Lisa and Jane,</i>

416
00:20:33,588 --> 00:20:36,089
<i>and this is Rosalyn,
a friend of our daughter Jane's.</i>

417
00:20:36,157 --> 00:20:37,457
<i>Her family life is rough,</i>

418
00:20:37,525 --> 00:20:39,726
<i>so we are kind of like
a second home.</i>

419
00:20:39,794 --> 00:20:41,795
<i>- Robert!
- Well, it's true.</i>

420
00:20:41,863 --> 00:20:43,697
<i>Well, thank you
for taking the time</i>

421
00:20:43,765 --> 00:20:45,532
<i>to notarize this
important document.</i>

422
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,434
<i>I'm sure you are quite busy.</i>

423
00:20:47,502 --> 00:20:49,236
<i>Yes. We only have a moment,</i>

424
00:20:49,303 --> 00:20:52,773
<i>for we are taking a bus tour
of Providence and other places.</i>

425
00:20:59,847 --> 00:21:03,066
The next morning,
Stewie and Brian set out on foot

426
00:21:03,151 --> 00:21:04,718
for the North Pole.

427
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:08,438
They were cold and tired,
but Stewie was determined

428
00:21:08,523 --> 00:21:12,359
to carry out his plan
to kill Santa Claus.

429
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:15,228
As long as I've got
all you people watching,

430
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:18,065
does anyone want
to buy some pot?

431
00:21:18,132 --> 00:21:20,000
(wind howling)

432
00:21:55,269 --> 00:21:56,470
My God!

433
00:21:56,537 --> 00:21:57,838
We made it, Brian!

434
00:21:57,905 --> 00:21:59,172
The North Pole!

435
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,841
See? Boom!
Right there!

436
00:22:00,908 --> 00:22:02,042
I told you!

437
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,543
This is where
Santa Claus lives!

438
00:22:03,611 --> 00:22:05,011
In your face!

439
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:06,413
I don't believe it.

440
00:22:06,481 --> 00:22:07,614
It's here.

441
00:22:07,682 --> 00:22:08,982
Damn right, it's here!

442
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,751
Now, while you think
about the fact

443
00:22:10,818 --> 00:22:12,319
that you're never
going to enjoy

444
00:22:12,386 --> 00:22:13,854
a nocturnal breast-feeding from Lois,

445
00:22:13,921 --> 00:22:16,223
I shall open the gate.

446
00:22:20,762 --> 00:22:22,596
(metallic clank)

447
00:22:35,042 --> 00:22:37,077
This can't be it.

448
00:22:37,145 --> 00:22:38,912
This can't be Santa's workshop.

449
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,847
This looks like
Bridgeport, Connecticut.

450
00:22:40,915 --> 00:22:42,883
Oh, boy,
get ready for the letters.

451
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,985
Dear <i>Family Guy</i> bastards,

452
00:22:45,052 --> 00:22:47,621
who the hell
do you think you are?

453
00:22:47,688 --> 00:22:49,623
I'll have you know
that Bridgeport

454
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:52,325
is among the world leaders
in abandoned buildings,

455
00:22:52,393 --> 00:22:54,528
shattered glass,
boarded-up windows,

456
00:22:54,595 --> 00:22:57,397
wild dogs and gas stations
without pumps.

457
00:22:57,465 --> 00:23:00,233
So eat my (bleep), Jew writers.

458
00:23:05,473 --> 00:23:07,006
Well, whatever sort
of trick this is,

459
00:23:07,058 --> 00:23:08,525
I will not be deterred.

460
00:23:08,609 --> 00:23:11,695
I'm not leaving until
Santa Claus is dead by my hand!

461
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:12,612
(knocking)

462
00:23:13,748 --> 00:23:15,615
(door creaking)

463
00:23:21,689 --> 00:23:22,856
Oh, my God!

464
00:23:22,924 --> 00:23:25,559
You're...
You're Santa Claus!

465
00:23:25,626 --> 00:23:27,761
Yeah.
Who are you?

466
00:23:27,829 --> 00:23:30,964
I'm Stewie Griffin,
and I'm going to kill you!

467
00:23:31,032 --> 00:23:33,934
(sighs)
Ah... Thank God!

468
00:23:34,001 --> 00:23:36,002
- What?
- Do it! Please!

469
00:23:36,053 --> 00:23:37,771
Put me out of my misery!

470
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:40,140
You... want me
to kill you?

471
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:42,242
(muffled): Come on!
What are you waiting for?!

472
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,743
Pull the trigger!

473
00:23:43,811 --> 00:23:46,196
Well, there isn't
a great deal of sport in that.

474
00:23:46,264 --> 00:23:49,282
(coughing, wheezing)

475
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,318
Oh, my God, are...
Are you all right?

476
00:23:51,385 --> 00:23:52,552
(hacking)

477
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,787
I'm okay.

478
00:23:53,855 --> 00:23:54,855
(hoarsely):
I'm okay.

479
00:23:54,922 --> 00:23:56,056
(hacking)

480
00:23:56,123 --> 00:23:57,824
I just need to catch my breath.

481
00:23:57,892 --> 00:23:59,192
I... I don't understand.

482
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:02,128
I thought you were supposed
to be jolly and happy.

483
00:24:02,196 --> 00:24:04,531
I used to be, a long time ago.

484
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:06,800
I made toys
for little boys and girls.

485
00:24:06,868 --> 00:24:09,035
I loved my work,
and they loved me.

486
00:24:09,103 --> 00:24:11,104
But it just got out of hand.

487
00:24:11,172 --> 00:24:14,174
The world's population
kept growing and growing.

488
00:24:14,242 --> 00:24:17,444
Kids wanted more toys,
fancier toys!

489
00:24:17,511 --> 00:24:20,313
We used to make wooden
choo-choos and rag dolls.

490
00:24:20,381 --> 00:24:22,382
You ever try to make an iPod?

491
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:24,284
I've got orders
for millions of 'em!

492
00:24:24,352 --> 00:24:26,653
Oh, that reminds me...
I need a new version of Quicken.

493
00:24:26,721 --> 00:24:29,222
Look at the toxic
waste we're producing.

494
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:32,142
(liquid splashing, gas hissing)

495
00:24:36,764 --> 00:24:38,798
In fact, I think the
toxins are taking

496
00:24:38,866 --> 00:24:40,934
even more of a toll
than the inbreeding.

497
00:24:41,002 --> 00:24:42,903
- Inbreeding?
- Take a look!

498
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:47,440
I started with one family
of magic elves,

499
00:24:47,491 --> 00:24:51,745
and every year I needed
more and more to keep up.

500
00:24:51,796 --> 00:24:55,582
Now they're just a sickly race
of mutated genetic disasters.

501
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:58,485
At least 60% of them
are born blind.

502
00:25:00,988 --> 00:25:02,305
(shrieking)

503
00:25:03,557 --> 00:25:05,091
The workload destroys them,

504
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:07,360
but they don't know
anything else.

505
00:25:07,428 --> 00:25:09,963
It's gotten so their instincts take over,
and near the end,

506
00:25:10,031 --> 00:25:14,067
they just walk out
into the snow and die.

507
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,704
(deep growl)

508
00:25:17,772 --> 00:25:19,439
Then the reindeer eat them,

509
00:25:19,507 --> 00:25:22,409
which has turned the reindeer
into wild, feral creatures

510
00:25:22,476 --> 00:25:24,144
with a blood-lust for elf flesh.

511
00:25:25,329 --> 00:25:27,163
(growling)

512
00:25:28,783 --> 00:25:30,817
I don't even pray
for them anymore.

513
00:25:30,885 --> 00:25:32,118
Seems pointless.

514
00:25:32,186 --> 00:25:34,387
What God would allow this?

515
00:25:34,455 --> 00:25:36,723
This is in none
of the songs or poetry.

516
00:25:36,791 --> 00:25:38,658
It's a horror show up here!

517
00:25:38,726 --> 00:25:40,360
How could you let this happen?

518
00:25:40,428 --> 00:25:42,295
Me?
I didn't do this.

519
00:25:42,363 --> 00:25:43,964

(coughs)

559
00:28:15,468 --> 00:28:17,769
So Brian and Stewie
found Santa Claus,

560
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,665
but he sure wasn't
what they expected.

561
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:23,568
It turned the increasing
demands of Christmas

562
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:26,304
had all but destroyed
the poor old man.

563
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,872
Okay, look at this.

564
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:30,458
Somebody gave me a little
remote control helicopter.

565
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,376
Pretty cool, huh?

566
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:33,678
(rattling, thud)

567
00:28:33,746 --> 00:28:36,147
Oh, it's broken.

568
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:47,058
I don't know, boys,
he's in rough shape.

569
00:28:47,126 --> 00:28:48,793
Doctor, you've got to
do something for him.

570
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:50,128
It's Christmas Eve.

571
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:51,462
Christmas is the problem.

572
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,197
He can't keep this pace up
anymore.

573
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:55,299
If he goes out tonight,
he'll die.

574
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:57,568
Well, then who's gonna
deliver all the presents?

575
00:28:57,636 --> 00:28:59,170
We will.

576
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:00,338
- What?
- What?

577
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,073
Stewie, look, you were right.

578
00:29:02,141 --> 00:29:03,641
Santa is real.

579
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:05,109
And he needs our help.

580
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:06,511
Don't worry, Santa.

581
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,412
We'll make sure
there's a Christmas this year.

582
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,881
Thank you, Brian.

583
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:12,049
That brings me peace
in this hour.

584
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:13,384
I'll be with Allah soon.

585
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:15,186
What?

586
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,522
Uh, ye... He doesn't know what
he's saying, he's delirious.

587
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,856
Look, you'd better get moving.

588
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,625
All right, Stewie,
let's go get the sleigh ready.

589
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,827
Is anyone else a little freaked
out by that Allah thing?

590
00:29:22,895 --> 00:29:24,328
Never mind that,
let's just get going.

591
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:29,734
(engines rumbling)

592
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:35,506
All right, Brian.
Let's do this.

593
00:29:35,557 --> 00:29:37,558
(reins snap)

594
00:29:37,626 --> 00:29:40,611
Go on.
(reins snap)

595
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:42,113
Giddy-up.
(reins snap)

596
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,632
Come on, you dumb deer.

597
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,784
(reins snapping)

598
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:48,085
It's not working.

599
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:49,520
I think they need to be coaxed.

600
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:51,289
Santa said they eat elf flesh.

601
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,157
Uh, oh, oh, excuse me?

602
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:54,225
Uh, sir?

603
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:56,394
Mr. Elf, sir?

604
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,330
Hello? Young man?

605
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:04,268
I... I don't think
he even knows where he is.

606
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:06,003
Do...
Do you want to just...

607
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:10,374
Yeah, I mean, uh, I'll just...
try and do it, I guess.

608
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:14,712
Hey.

609
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,080
Hey, fella?

610
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:40,838
Um...
Okay.

611
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:42,506
Bye.

612
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,286
(snarling)

613
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:12,069
(sleigh grazes smokestack)

614
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,105
Hey, Brian, look.

615
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:15,873
That one reindeer
just kind of pooped

616
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:17,775
in the other reindeer's face, and...

617
00:31:17,826 --> 00:31:20,077
And the other reindeer
just kind of ate it.

618
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:22,213
Isn't Christmas magical?

619
00:31:34,157 --> 00:31:35,508
All right,
according to this map,

620
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:37,245
we're approaching the
northeast coast of the U. S.

621
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:39,414
Get ready to land.

622
00:31:56,815 --> 00:31:59,267
All right, Bri,
this is it, our first town.

623
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:00,852
I'm gonna head for that roof.

624
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:05,440
Why are we tilting?

625
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:07,608
Look, I've never landed one
of these things before, okay?

626
00:32:09,328 --> 00:32:11,462
BRIAN: You're coming in too fast!
Look out!

627
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:19,804
(both screaming)

628
00:32:21,707 --> 00:32:23,641
All right, this is good.

629
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:26,411
In and out of this house
and onto the next one.

630
00:32:26,478 --> 00:32:27,412
What about the reindeer?

631
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:30,848
Yeah, we'll cut them down
afterwards.

632
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:32,116
Now let's get down the chimney.

633
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,526
Ow!
You bitch!

634
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:43,528
Okay, let's get the presents
under the tree.

635
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:44,762
All right, you have 'em?

636
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,230
I thought you had them.

637
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,666
Oh, for the love of God,
they're still in the sleigh.

638
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:50,101
Aw, crap.
On the roof?

639
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:52,036
(loud metallic scraping)

640
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:58,309
No, it's...
It's in the yard.

641
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,650
Oh, my God.

642
00:33:05,718 --> 00:33:07,585
Didn't you unlock
the door when we left?

643
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,120
No, you were the last one out!

644
00:33:09,188 --> 00:33:11,389
Well, how the hell
are we gonna get back inside?

645
00:33:11,457 --> 00:33:12,490
All right, find a rock.

646
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,734
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

647
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:23,835
I'm putting out the presents.

648
00:33:23,902 --> 00:33:25,069
Not like that you're not.

649
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:26,604
Tall in the back,
short in the front.

650
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:28,639
And show some care,
for God's sake.

651
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:30,441
You know, those...
Those aren't socks and underwear

652
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,076
donated by the fire department

653
00:33:32,144 --> 00:33:33,361
to some battered
women's shelter.

654
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:35,113
Those are Santa gifts, Brian.

655
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,414
You know, you...
You have to...

656
00:33:36,482 --> 00:33:37,782
Wait. What...
What are you doing?

657
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,284
Did you just eat that
whole cookie off the mantel?

658
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,353
What? They left it out for Santa.
We're Santa.

659
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:44,689
Yeah, but you're not supposed
to eat all of it.

660
00:33:44,757 --> 00:33:46,591
You take a bite
and a sip of milk.

661
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:48,459
That's how the kids know
Santa was here!

662
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,661
- Don't yell at me.
- I'm not yelling at you. I'm just...

663
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:52,130
I'm telling you how it's done.

664
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,632
They... They need some kind of
indication that Santa was here.

665
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,234
Oh, okay, how about this?
Look.

666
00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:58,503
- Hey, now they know he was here. See?
- Stop it!

667
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,104
Look, I'm here giving
out free presents!

668
00:34:00,172 --> 00:34:02,373
All right, I'll eat the
damn cookies if I want!

669
00:34:02,441 --> 00:34:05,343
You know what?
I might even make a sandwich!

670
00:34:05,394 --> 00:34:06,677
Wait.
Where are you going?

671
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:08,212
I'm going into the kitchen.

672
00:34:08,263 --> 00:34:09,981
I'm gonna make a sandwich,
get some chips or something.

673
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:14,218
Brian, knock it off!

674
00:34:14,269 --> 00:34:15,486
Aw, man.

675
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:16,821
You jackass!

676
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,723
Hey, who the hell are you?

677
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:21,092
Uh... Hello?

678
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,460
What are you doing in my house?

679
00:34:22,528 --> 00:34:25,930
We're Santa Claus... ses.

680
00:34:25,998 --> 00:34:27,198
Yeah, you're Santa Claus.

681
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:28,432
That's why you broke in
through the window.

682
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,667
I'm calling the cops.

683
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,402
No, no, no.
I... I can explain.

684
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:35,239
We... We came down the chimney,
but we... We forgot the presents.

685
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:36,941
It's... It's actually...

686
00:34:37,009 --> 00:34:39,944
It's kind of a funny story...

687
00:34:40,012 --> 00:34:41,412
What the hell did you do?!

688
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,114
He was gonna call
the cops, man!

689
00:34:43,182 --> 00:34:44,882
You can't call the cops
on Santa.

690
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,217
Now help me move
this guy's body!

691
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:01,098
Ugh! He's still alive.

692
00:35:01,149 --> 00:35:02,867
All right, tie him up.

693
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:04,702
I'm gonna make it
look like a burglary.

694
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:07,672
All right, look, let...
Let's just go.

695
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:08,973
Right, right. We'll go.

696
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:11,676
I'm gonna rewrap this bat for,
um, Johnny.

697
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:14,378
Let me just clean his father's
blood and hair off it.

698
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,814
GIRL:
Daddy, I want a drink of water.

699
00:35:16,882 --> 00:35:18,783
(bleep)

700
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:21,586
Hey, there.

701
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:22,787
How you doing?

702
00:35:22,855 --> 00:35:24,021
Who are you?

703
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:25,223
I'm Santa.

704
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,791
You're Santa?!

705
00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:28,059
(gasps):
Who are you?

706
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,994
Where's Dan?

707
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:33,998
(gasps)
Oh, my God!

708
00:35:34,066 --> 00:35:35,132
(crying)
Oh, crap!

709
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,568
(grunting)

710
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,103
Quick, Stewie!
Get the bat!

711
00:35:39,154 --> 00:35:41,239
Help! Help!

712
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:42,406
(groans)

713
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,041
Mommy!

714
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:45,343
(sobbing)
It's okay. It's okay.

715
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,328
Brian, see if you can
find some duct tape.

716
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:48,979
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

717
00:35:49,031 --> 00:35:50,581
- GIRL: Mommy!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

718
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:51,816
Mama!

719
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:55,319
All right, let's get
this place cleaned up.

720
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:00,992
All right,
that's the last of the blood.

721
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:02,593
Go check on the other kid.

722
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:03,828
What other kid?

723
00:36:03,896 --> 00:36:06,230
Johnny, the one
who's getting the bat.

724
00:36:06,298 --> 00:36:08,332
Stewie, there's only
one bedroom up here.

725
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,533
What?

726
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:11,035
Do you have a brother?

727
00:36:11,103 --> 00:36:12,937
Well, then who the
hell is John...?

728
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:15,206
Oh, my God,
we're in the wrong house.

729
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:16,807
(sirens blaring)

730
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:18,175
Damn it, we tripped the alarm.

731
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:19,844
Brian, the cops are coming.
Let's go!

732
00:36:19,912 --> 00:36:21,212
What?
We're just leaving like this?

733
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,813
What about not wanting
to ruin Christmas?!

734
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:23,981
It's already ruined!

735
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:25,516
This was one house.

736
00:36:25,584 --> 00:36:28,286
We've been here for an hour
and a half! An hour and...

737
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:29,954
First of all,
we're not even Santa anymore.

738
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:31,322
This has been a home invasion.

739
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:33,024
But an hour and a half, Brian!

740
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:34,558
It's gonna be light
in six hours,

741
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:37,128
and we have to deliver
to the whole rest of the world!

742
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,630
There's two apartment buildings
on this block alone!

743
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,098
No wonder Santa lost his mind.

744
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:42,733
This is ridiculous!
We can't do this!

745
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:44,602
Nobody can. It's inhuman!

746
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,670
All right, come on,
let's get out of here!

747
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:49,640
Aw, damn,
what about the reindeer?

748
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:50,891
The hell with the reindeer!

749
00:36:50,976 --> 00:36:52,176
Look, they're all eating
each other, anyway!

750
00:36:52,227 --> 00:36:55,646
(growling)

751
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:56,914
Besides, we don't need 'em.

752
00:36:56,982 --> 00:36:58,149
I made a few modifications.

753
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,317
Hang on.

754
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:01,218
(whirring)

755
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:04,905
(sirens blaring)

756
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,734
That was a disaster.

757
00:37:16,785 --> 00:37:18,119
I can't believe it.

758
00:37:18,203 --> 00:37:19,737
We were supposed
to save Christmas,

759
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:21,172
and we completely blew it.

760
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,240
We failed Santa.

761
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:25,743
No.
No, we didn't fail Santa.

762
00:37:25,811 --> 00:37:27,645
The world failed Santa.

763
00:37:27,713 --> 00:37:29,797
He gives and gives and gives,

764
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:31,816
and everyone just takes him
for granted.

765
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:34,685
Hell, I... I didn't even think
he existed until last night.

766
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,637
Well, what are we
supposed to do now?

767
00:37:36,722 --> 00:37:38,422
Christmas is doomed.

768
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:41,492
Maybe, but there is one thing
we can do.

769
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,860
Move over.

770
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:47,732
(whirring and whooshing)

771
00:38:01,939 --> 00:38:03,806
(silly giggling)

772
00:38:07,482 --> 00:38:08,816
(gasps)

773
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:11,415
Lois!

774
00:38:11,515 --> 00:38:13,516
There's no presents
under the tree!

775
00:38:13,584 --> 00:38:14,650
What?

776
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:17,954
Oh, my God.

777
00:38:18,021 --> 00:38:19,956
Joe, did you get
any Christmas presents?!

778
00:38:20,023 --> 00:38:21,691
- JOE: No!
- QUAGMIRE: Me, neither!

779
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:24,026
MORT:
I got eight mediocre things.

780
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:25,461
<i>Good morning, Quahog.</i>

781
00:38:25,529 --> 00:38:28,197
<i>Our top story today...
Santa Claus skips Christmas.</i>

782
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:29,599
<i>Hopeful citizens worldwide
woke up</i>

783
00:38:29,666 --> 00:38:31,267
<i>to disappointment this morning</i>

784
00:38:31,335 --> 00:38:33,169
<i>when they discovered no gifts
from Santa</i>

785
00:38:33,236 --> 00:38:34,737
<i>under their Christmas trees.</i>

786
00:38:34,805 --> 00:38:36,505
<i>Local officials are going
with the theory</i>

787
00:38:36,573 --> 00:38:38,441
<i>that everyone was bad this year.</i>

788
00:38:38,508 --> 00:38:40,710
<i>The investigation continues
into this mysterious...</i>

789
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:43,312
<i>Wait! I know what happened
to Christmas!</i>

790
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,547
Brian?!

791
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:54,256
(gasps)
Santa Claus!

792
00:38:54,324 --> 00:38:56,692
That's right!
It's Santa Claus.

793
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,561
And you've got to listen to me.

794
00:38:58,629 --> 00:39:00,630
The reason there was
no Christmas this year

795
00:39:00,697 --> 00:39:02,248
is that this man is sick.

796
00:39:02,332 --> 00:39:04,634
Very sick.
And he needs our help.

797
00:39:04,701 --> 00:39:08,304
He's been bludgeoned by years
of greed and avarice.

798
00:39:08,371 --> 00:39:10,406
<i>The workload
of filling our Christmas lists</i>

799
00:39:10,474 --> 00:39:11,941
<i>has overwhelmed him.</i>

800
00:39:12,009 --> 00:39:15,378
<i>And at the rate he's going,
he may not make it another year.</i>

801
00:39:15,445 --> 00:39:17,413
<i>But there's a way
for us to help him.</i>

802
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:20,716
<i>If all of us everywhere
can just cut back our demands</i>

803
00:39:20,784 --> 00:39:23,319
<i>and ask for only one
Christmas present every year,</i>

804
00:39:23,387 --> 00:39:25,688
<i>there may still be hope.</i>

805
00:39:25,756 --> 00:39:28,758
I know it's in our nature
to resist sacrifice,

806
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:31,193
even in hard times,
but if we don't,

807
00:39:31,261 --> 00:39:34,430
we may have to give up
Christmas altogether.

808
00:39:36,733 --> 00:39:40,236
<i>Well, folks, you heard it here
first on Channel Five News.</i>

809
00:39:40,303 --> 00:39:42,138
<i>Looks like we have a choice.</i>

810
00:39:42,205 --> 00:39:44,774
<i>One Christmas gift a year
for each one of us.</i>

811
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:47,009
<i>Can we live with that?</i>

812
00:39:47,077 --> 00:39:49,178
I can.

813
00:39:49,246 --> 00:39:50,379
So can I.

814
00:39:50,447 --> 00:39:51,580
Me, too.

815
00:39:51,648 --> 00:39:52,748
I can, too.

816
00:39:52,816 --> 00:39:54,016
I can live with that.

817
00:39:54,084 --> 00:39:55,317
Count me in.

818
00:39:55,385 --> 00:39:56,752
One is enough.

819
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:57,887
Aye.

820
00:39:57,954 --> 00:39:59,255
I can.

821
00:39:59,322 --> 00:40:01,390
One gift is okay.

822
00:40:01,458 --> 00:40:02,758
I can live with it.

823
00:40:02,826 --> 00:40:04,593
Okay, just one.

824
00:40:04,661 --> 00:40:06,262
But if it's a gym membership,

825
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:08,998
somebody's getting punched
in the (bleep) face.
