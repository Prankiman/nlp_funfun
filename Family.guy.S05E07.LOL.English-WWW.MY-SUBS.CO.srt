1
00:00:33,911 --> 00:00:37,589
Coming up, a New Orleans man
says his socks are finally dry.

2
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,969
But first, the big news
in entertainment this week

3
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,432
is the lovable child actress,
Olivia Fuller.

4
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:45,709
Oh, my God, Brian, that's Olivia
from the performing arts school.

5
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,321
What sort of overblown contract
has that dreadful bitch landed now?

6
00:00:49,322 --> 00:00:53,297
Most of you know Olivia as the adorable
little girl in the Tasty Juice ads.

7
00:00:53,332 --> 00:00:55,270
Hey, Mom, can I have some soda?

8
00:00:55,273 --> 00:01:00,134
No, but you can have some Tasty Juice.
It has only one-third the sugar of soda.

9
00:01:00,931 --> 00:01:03,041
Delicious. Thanks, Mom.

10
00:01:07,628 --> 00:01:10,987
But little Olivia's career
may be over just as it begins

11
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:12,802
with today's announcement
that Tasty Juice

12
00:01:12,808 --> 00:01:14,872
will be dropping her as
their spokesperson

13
00:01:14,878 --> 00:01:17,191
and replacing her with a new ad campaign

14
00:01:17,195 --> 00:01:19,580
featuring rock'n'roll legend Chuck Berry.

15
00:01:19,588 --> 00:01:22,682
Open your mouth, baby. Here it comes.

16
00:01:22,685 --> 00:01:25,263
But there is a silver lining
for local Quahogians,

17
00:01:25,265 --> 00:01:28,201
as Miss Fuller will be appearing
at the Quahog mall this weekend

18
00:01:28,205 --> 00:01:31,802
to mark the grand opening of the
new Brat Wraps Kids Clothing store.

19
00:01:31,806 --> 00:01:33,083
Oh, that's perfect.

20
00:01:33,086 --> 00:01:36,522
Brian, we have to go down there
this weekend and heckle her roundly.

21
00:01:36,526 --> 00:01:40,422
I'll humiliate her worse than
Luke Skywalker did to that Rebel pilot.

22
00:01:42,096 --> 00:01:44,381
The exhaust shaft is only
two meters wide,

23
00:01:44,385 --> 00:01:46,513
so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.

24
00:01:46,517 --> 00:01:48,453
That's impossible. Even for a computer.

25
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:52,011
It's not impossible. I used to bull's-eye
wamprats in my T-16 back home.

26
00:01:52,017 --> 00:01:53,783
They're not much bigger than two meters.

27
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,763
Hey, uh, can-can I talk to
you privately for a second?

28
00:01:58,047 --> 00:01:58,893
Sure.

29
00:01:59,997 --> 00:02:02,860
Th-that, that, uh, that
was, that was unnecessary.

30
00:02:02,867 --> 00:02:04,082
What's the problem?

31
00:02:04,087 --> 00:02:06,870
Well, you just kind of called me
out in front of everybody back there...

32
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:10,150
- I was just making a point.
- I know, I know, but you like just...

33
00:02:10,156 --> 00:02:13,042
- kind of sandbagged me.
- I sandbagged you?

34
00:02:13,045 --> 00:02:14,270
In front of all of our friends, yeah,

35
00:02:14,276 --> 00:02:15,753
- you sandbagged me.
- I sandbagged you.

36
00:02:15,755 --> 00:02:16,822
You sandbagged me, yes.

37
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:18,662
Well, here I am trying
to help you with something...

38
00:02:18,668 --> 00:02:20,751
You know what, I don't need
your kind of help, all right?

39
00:02:20,967 --> 00:02:23,163
Have a great assault. Jerk.

40
00:02:33,617 --> 00:02:36,771
Lois, I don't understand why
I got to sit through a chick flick.

41
00:02:36,788 --> 00:02:39,802
Peter, you promised you'd come
with me to see Autumn's Piano.

42
00:02:39,807 --> 00:02:43,891
Besides, you owe me big after the way
you embarrassed me in front of Sandra Oh.

43
00:02:44,676 --> 00:02:49,330
Oh, my God, Sandra Oh.
We loved you in Sideways.

44
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,153
Thank you.

45
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:52,983
We see you in many movies.

46
00:02:52,986 --> 00:02:57,021
I think about you while
having sex with my wife.

47
00:02:57,027 --> 00:03:00,912
I thank you with one dollar.
That's a lot of money to them.

48
00:03:00,925 --> 00:03:02,362
Lois, I'm just warning you,

49
00:03:02,366 --> 00:03:05,472
if this movie turns me gay, I'm going
to start bringing gay guys home.

50
00:03:05,487 --> 00:03:08,243
And I don't mean the classy "maybe
they are, maybe they're not" gay guys.

51
00:03:08,246 --> 00:03:09,620
I mean those big, "Oh, my God,"

52
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,983
"here they come, floatin' around,
making noise" gay guys,

53
00:03:11,987 --> 00:03:13,561
not the "fix up your house" gay guys.

54
00:03:13,566 --> 00:03:15,242
Peter, shh, it's starting.

55
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:22,310
- You must be Autumn Daniels.
- Welcome to Barncliffe school for girls.

56
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,472
We're your roommates: I'm Sassy,
that's Pouty, and this is Suicidy.

57
00:03:26,477 --> 00:03:29,331
I got a bad feeling about Suicidy.

58
00:03:29,336 --> 00:03:32,503
<i>Ain't no mountain high enough.</i>

59
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:36,702
Yeah! You can tell all the girls
care about each other,

60
00:03:36,715 --> 00:03:39,251
'cause they have so much
fun cleaning the dishes.

61
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:43,132
<i>I have to leave,
and I'm taking my piano with me.</i>

62
00:03:43,297 --> 00:03:46,711
No...! Why?

63
00:03:46,716 --> 00:03:50,970
Why? She chose the piano
over her insulin.

64
00:03:50,977 --> 00:03:53,461
You could've had both.

65
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,761
See? That wasn't so bad.

66
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:07,940
Oh, you know, Lois, this movie has
helped me understand a lot of things.

67
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:11,601
Like that foreign guy at work
who helped me understand sarcasm.

68
00:04:11,606 --> 00:04:15,261
- Huh, nice day we're having.
- Oh, ho-ho! Yes!

69
00:04:15,268 --> 00:04:17,173
- What?
- He say "Nice day,"

70
00:04:17,177 --> 00:04:19,210
- but he covered with rain.
- So?

71
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:23,611
So, he say this when your brain
know is not really nice day.

72
00:04:23,628 --> 00:04:24,960
Oh, yeah!

73
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:28,022
Yes. He say the opposite. He's funny.

74
00:04:28,027 --> 00:04:30,251
Oh, yeah, I get it. "Nice day. "

75
00:04:31,228 --> 00:04:33,852
Now you funny, too. Oh...

76
00:04:39,256 --> 00:04:40,523
There she is, Brian.

77
00:04:40,526 --> 00:04:43,682
Oh, boy, I am going to take her
down right in front of everybody.

78
00:04:43,685 --> 00:04:45,692
All right, Olivia, get ready to...

79
00:04:45,698 --> 00:04:47,591
- Good Lord.
- What is it?

80
00:04:47,598 --> 00:04:50,852
Brian, she looks... she looks fantastic.

81
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:54,403
And now TV's Olivia Fuller
will cut the ceremonial ribbon.

82
00:04:54,406 --> 00:04:58,282
I hope I'm allowed to do this.
My mommy says, "Don't run with scissors. "

83
00:04:58,985 --> 00:05:01,531
She's so cute.
I love children. Look at my kids.

84
00:05:03,477 --> 00:05:07,052
So everyone feel free to browse
and purchase from our fine selection.

85
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:10,061
Hey, Mom, now would be a good
time to raise my allowance.

86
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,990
Oh, this one's kind of nice.
Wha...?

87
00:05:18,036 --> 00:05:20,852
Olivia! Hey...!

88
00:05:20,968 --> 00:05:25,490
Stewie? Oh, my God.
Wow, this is... it's been a while.

89
00:05:25,497 --> 00:05:28,903
Yeah, no, it has.
Uh, what, so you back in town?

90
00:05:28,907 --> 00:05:32,350
Yeah, we're, um,
we're moving back into the old house.

91
00:05:32,357 --> 00:05:37,122
Oh, that's... God, you look great,
I mean, you're all, you're all in shape.

92
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,570
My God, California's been good to you.

93
00:05:39,578 --> 00:05:41,650
I mean, I guess, I guess
you should be looking good

94
00:05:41,657 --> 00:05:44,071
'cause everybody's a health
nut out there, right?

95
00:05:45,438 --> 00:05:46,563
Yeah.

96
00:05:47,607 --> 00:05:50,581
Well, anyway, it was
nice seeing you again, so...

97
00:05:50,588 --> 00:05:55,591
Hey, listen, maybe you want to come over
on Friday, it's my "Bernie Mac" night.

98
00:05:55,598 --> 00:05:58,201
Um, i-it's a fun show
if you haven't seen it.

99
00:05:58,218 --> 00:06:00,782
I can't understand what
the devil he's saying, but you know,

100
00:06:00,798 --> 00:06:04,412
there's a lot of movement, and it's bright
and colorful, it keeps my attention.

101
00:06:04,418 --> 00:06:06,442
Look, Stewie, you're sweet,

102
00:06:06,448 --> 00:06:09,551
but since I moved to Hollywood,
I've done a lot of growing up.

103
00:06:09,568 --> 00:06:13,812
I'm dating more sophisticated men now.
But it was good to see you.

104
00:06:15,585 --> 00:06:18,451
- What happened?
- She shot me down, Brian.

105
00:06:18,457 --> 00:06:21,961
What do you care? You came here to gloat
about her contract cancellation anyway.

106
00:06:21,967 --> 00:06:24,930
Yes, but that was before
I got a look at her face. I mean,

107
00:06:24,936 --> 00:06:28,493
she's a woman now, Brian.
So sophisticated, so grown up,

108
00:06:28,495 --> 00:06:31,153
and she says she wants a grown-up man.
But...

109
00:06:31,206 --> 00:06:34,510
- apparently, that's not me.
- Ya think so?

110
00:06:37,177 --> 00:06:38,822
Who could forget that one?

111
00:06:38,825 --> 00:06:42,883

But don't take my word for it.

123
00:07:22,868 --> 00:07:26,080
Hear what '80s mainstay Howard
Hesseman has to say about it.

124
00:07:26,095 --> 00:07:27,003
I love it.

125
00:07:27,007 --> 00:07:31,650
Would Howard Hesseman lie for weed?
We don't think so. Order now.

126
00:07:36,028 --> 00:07:39,140
There we go.
You are ready for your date.

127
00:07:39,237 --> 00:07:41,552
Yeah, that's a bed head.

128
00:07:41,888 --> 00:07:44,542
Yeah, hey, look at you,
you just got out of bed.

129
00:07:44,605 --> 00:07:47,781
You're the underachiever every
woman wants to sleep with.

130
00:07:47,846 --> 00:07:50,352
- Hey, big date tonight?
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

131
00:07:50,398 --> 00:07:53,501
Hey, listen, I'm, uh,
sorry about Olivia rejecting you.

132
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,292
Oh, I haven't given up yet, Brian.

133
00:07:55,295 --> 00:07:57,763
She says she wants a more
mature, grown-up man,

134
00:07:57,808 --> 00:07:59,580
so all I've got to do is be more grown-up.

135
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:02,142
- What are you doing?
- Just cleanin' out your brush, man.

136
00:08:08,017 --> 00:08:09,113
Hi, Jillian.

137
00:08:09,116 --> 00:08:11,072
Hi, Brian, ready to go?

138
00:08:11,168 --> 00:08:14,412
- Hey, baby.
- Hi, Stewie.

139
00:08:14,418 --> 00:08:15,600
What the hell are you doing?

140
00:08:15,605 --> 00:08:17,860
Eh, not much, really.
Just me and my pubes,

141
00:08:18,023 --> 00:08:19,467
ha... ngin' out.

142
00:08:19,502 --> 00:08:20,911
Oh, dear God.

143
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:24,037
Boy, I am so beat from doing
adult stuff all day.

144
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:25,330
So am I.

145
00:08:25,335 --> 00:08:27,881
I, just kind of feel like
kickin' it tonight.

146
00:08:27,885 --> 00:08:29,853
Oh, look at that.
I'm growing all the time.

147
00:08:29,857 --> 00:08:31,803
Hey, uh, Jillian,
can you give me a minute?

148
00:08:32,516 --> 00:08:35,542
You ever just let your balls
hang out, B-Ri?

149
00:08:36,076 --> 00:08:38,152
You ever do that, B-Roney?

150
00:08:38,665 --> 00:08:41,633
Drove my Chevy to the levee,
but the levee was Bri?

151
00:08:41,637 --> 00:08:44,013
- Give me my hair back.
- Ow! What the hell, man.

152
00:08:44,018 --> 00:08:45,763
Stewie, this is not going
to convince Olivia

153
00:08:45,768 --> 00:08:47,252
that you're grown-up enough for her.

154
00:08:47,257 --> 00:08:50,131
- Yeah, what do you know about women?
- You want to know how to get women?

155
00:08:50,137 --> 00:08:52,773
There's only one place
in town you need to observe.

156
00:08:53,376 --> 00:08:54,451
Just watch.

157
00:08:54,457 --> 00:08:56,450
I am not doing that, Glenn.

158
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,272
Come on, beautiful, keep an open mind.

159
00:08:58,277 --> 00:09:00,672
- You're a sick man.
- Hey, keep it down.

160
00:09:00,695 --> 00:09:03,030
I don't want my neighbors seeing
a fat, old, dirty whore

161
00:09:03,038 --> 00:09:04,512
screaming at me on my front lawn.

162
00:09:04,528 --> 00:09:05,533
Whore?

163
00:09:05,948 --> 00:09:08,751
- Well, maybe I should come inside.
- Well, maybe you should.

164
00:09:09,318 --> 00:09:10,442
What the deuce?

165
00:09:10,456 --> 00:09:13,870
Why the hell would she respond
positively to such a negative comment?

166
00:09:13,947 --> 00:09:14,953
Unless...

167
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:18,723
Brian, do women like it
when you treat them like crap?

168
00:09:18,727 --> 00:09:21,091
Well, I don't know if you want
to be that black and white about it.

169
00:09:21,108 --> 00:09:24,882
That's it, isn't it? Women respond
when you treat them like crap.

170
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:29,170
Well, Olivia, prepare to meet
a much darker Stewie Griffin.

171
00:09:34,488 --> 00:09:37,333
Hey, babe. What do you say,
we going out Saturday night?

172
00:09:37,338 --> 00:09:39,122
Stewie, what are you doing here?

173
00:09:39,128 --> 00:09:41,603
I told you, I'm just into a
different type of guy.

174
00:09:41,607 --> 00:09:44,370
Oh, yeah? I'll tell you what
you're into. Being ugly.

175
00:09:44,377 --> 00:09:46,101
Stewie, you're being mean.

176
00:09:46,105 --> 00:09:48,883
No. If I was being mean, when you
opened the door I would have said,

177
00:09:48,885 --> 00:09:53,040
"Oh, hey, Ray Liotta, is Olivia home?
Oh, wait, you're Olivia. "

178
00:09:53,047 --> 00:09:55,391
You see, I thought you were
Ray Liotta because your skin

179
00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:58,130
has the texture of a decorative
autumn squash.

180
00:10:00,428 --> 00:10:02,142
So, I'll pick you up at 7:00?

181
00:10:02,798 --> 00:10:04,873
That sounds wonderful.

182
00:10:05,478 --> 00:10:06,732
She said yes.

183
00:10:06,737 --> 00:10:09,550
My God, I'm cooler than that
cheetah from the commercials.

184
00:10:16,275 --> 00:10:20,431
Oh, God, there is no
drummer better than Neil Peart!

185
00:10:21,798 --> 00:10:24,792
It ain't easy bein' cheesy.

186
00:10:27,556 --> 00:10:32,962
Oh, Smilla, your sense of snow
is equaled only by your sense of love.

187
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:35,763
Peter, have you been up all night
watching chick movies?

188
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:39,950
Lois, before I found these movies,
women only made me cry through my penis.

189
00:10:39,957 --> 00:10:42,031
Now they make me cry through my eyes.

190
00:10:42,038 --> 00:10:45,170
I've decided.
I'm making my own chick flick.

191
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:48,052
What? You don't know anything
about making movies.

192
00:10:48,058 --> 00:10:50,900
Are you kidding? I got lots of
experience in the film industry.

193
00:10:50,906 --> 00:10:52,613
I was the original "Pretty Woman. "

194
00:10:52,615 --> 00:10:55,360
You look beautiful,
but there's something missing.

195
00:11:00,405 --> 00:11:02,563
This is a beautiful spot, Stewie.

196
00:11:02,568 --> 00:11:05,851
I know. I love coming here because you
can just sit here and people-watch,

197
00:11:05,868 --> 00:11:06,523
you know?

198
00:11:06,526 --> 00:11:08,190
Oh, oh, look at this. Look at this guy.

199
00:11:08,198 --> 00:11:09,970
Look at this. What is that?
What is he doing?

200
00:11:09,975 --> 00:11:12,101
Just standing there smelling his hand?

201
00:11:12,108 --> 00:11:15,600
"What is that? What is that on my hand?"

202
00:11:15,606 --> 00:11:20,012
"Is that... is that barbecue sauce?
When was I near barbecue sauce?"

203
00:11:20,998 --> 00:11:24,182
Oh, look, look!
Jewish cowboy! Jewish cowboy!

204
00:11:24,186 --> 00:11:27,822
Yeah. Not gonna be so tough
when the sun goes down, are you?

205
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:32,363
Better go rassle up some
Chinese food, Hopalong Nussbaum.

206
00:11:34,106 --> 00:11:37,310
You know, Stewie, I'm really glad
I gave you another chance.

207
00:11:37,315 --> 00:11:38,941
You're a really special guy.

208
00:11:38,945 --> 00:11:40,073
I know.

209
00:11:41,005 --> 00:11:44,750
No, no, I'm kidding. I'm not really that
self-centered, but, you know, Olivia,

210
00:11:44,758 --> 00:11:49,591
I can't think of anyplace I'd rather be
than right here right now with you.

211
00:11:51,036 --> 00:11:54,172
Oh, look at this guy. Now,
there's someone who cuts his own hair.

212
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,170
Yeah, no kidding. Oh, my God.

213
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:59,053
Oh, oh, oh, oh, check out this
uptight Asian guy, look at that.

214
00:11:59,056 --> 00:12:01,753
I work really hard, 'cause I'm no fun.

215
00:12:07,655 --> 00:12:11,361
Boy, this is a great city.
I don't care what anybody says.

216
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:14,382
I know.
Look at that sunset against the skyline.

217
00:12:14,388 --> 00:12:18,090
- I know. Wow, look at that.
- A perfect end to a perfect day.

218
00:12:18,096 --> 00:12:22,860
Yeah. Well, we should probably get home.
This area gets really dangerous at night.

219
00:12:32,348 --> 00:12:36,313
Okay, everyone, welcome to the first
day of shooting for Steel Vaginas.

220
00:12:36,315 --> 00:12:38,921
Peter, this movie doesn't seem
to make any sense.

221
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:43,110
It makes perfect sense, Lois. This the
scene where our heroine, Vageena Hertz,

222
00:12:43,116 --> 00:12:46,920
is told by Dr. McNugget here
that she has uncurable chick cancer.

223
00:12:46,927 --> 00:12:49,501
All right, Joe, let's lose
the wheelchair and shoot this thing.

224
00:12:49,505 --> 00:12:52,303
Peter, I can't lose the wheelchair.
I need it to move.

225
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:54,231
Okay, yeah, but your character can walk.

226
00:12:54,238 --> 00:12:56,640
Peter, I'm handicapped.
I can't walk.

227
00:12:56,648 --> 00:12:58,451
Okay, Chris, roll film.

228
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,033
And... action!

229
00:13:00,978 --> 00:13:04,331
Joe, get out of the damn chair.
Chris, get the cattle prod.

230
00:13:05,748 --> 00:13:09,213
Okay, now give him some peanut butter
so we can make it look like he's talking.

231
00:13:12,855 --> 00:13:14,541
God, I hate these things.

232
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:16,362
Sweetie, can't you just have a good time?

233
00:13:16,365 --> 00:13:18,623
I don't know anybody.
These are all your friends.

234
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:21,031
Just relax. Have some cake or something.

235
00:13:21,036 --> 00:13:23,783
Hey, hey, who do we have here?

236
00:13:23,785 --> 00:13:28,091
- Oh, my God! Victor?
- Hey, kiddo, how are you?

237
00:13:28,096 --> 00:13:30,052
Great! Great! Wow!

238
00:13:30,055 --> 00:13:34,111
Stewie, this is Victor. We did a
Flintstones vitamins commercial together.

239
00:13:34,115 --> 00:13:36,443
<i>Ten million strong and growing!</i>

240
00:13:37,575 --> 00:13:40,321
Oh, yeah, good to meet you.
How are you?

241
00:13:40,325 --> 00:13:44,150
Victor's such a good actor.
He played a dead baby on CSI: Miami.

242
00:13:44,155 --> 00:13:45,943
Yeah, I'm more into writing now.

243
00:13:45,946 --> 00:13:48,540
Oh, hang on a sec.
Uh, idea for a short story:

244
00:13:48,548 --> 00:13:50,453
guy picks his nose, then eats it.

245
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:54,200
Yeah, good luck with that. Hey, Olivia,
why don't you and I go get some punch?

246
00:13:54,207 --> 00:13:57,943
Oh, actually, would you mind getting
some for Victor and me while we catch up?

247
00:13:57,947 --> 00:14:00,210
Or-or a third option.

248
00:14:00,217 --> 00:14:02,711
Why doesn't Victor go get some
punch for you and me?

249
00:14:02,715 --> 00:14:05,561
Or maybe you and I could go away
from Victor and go get the punch?

250
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,623
Or-or none of us could have punch.
But still Victor could go away.

251
00:14:08,627 --> 00:14:10,653
Victor, would you excuse us for a second?

252
00:14:10,668 --> 00:14:12,800
Uh, sure.
Idea for a novel:

253
00:14:12,805 --> 00:14:16,363
guy loses his favorite blankie, goes
looking for it and finds it in the kitchen.

254
00:14:16,368 --> 00:14:19,142
Is that... I amaze myself.
Is that... It's genius.

255
00:14:19,148 --> 00:14:21,301
It's unbelievable.
I don't know where I get it from.

256
00:14:21,316 --> 00:14:24,072
What the hell is wrong with you?
You're acting like a jerk.

257
00:14:24,077 --> 00:14:27,513
Oh, I'm acting like a jerk?
What about Phony Curtis over there?

258
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:30,893
He happens to be a very intelligent,
successful actor.

259
00:14:30,896 --> 00:14:33,300
And, you know, he's done
three national diaper commercials.

260
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:36,201
Yeah, let's put a diaper on his face.
That's where the crap is coming out.

261
00:14:36,207 --> 00:14:38,981
You don't own me.
I can talk to whoever I want.

262
00:14:38,985 --> 00:14:40,890
I don't see a ring on my finger.

263
00:14:43,046 --> 00:14:46,780
I, Stewie, take you, Olivia,
to be my lawfully wedded wife.

264
00:14:46,787 --> 00:14:49,501
Uh, what's that, Rupert?
Oh, oh, kiss the bride. Yes.

265
00:14:56,716 --> 00:14:59,892
- Hi, honey! I'm home!
- Hi, sweetie, how was your day?

266
00:14:59,897 --> 00:15:02,680
Well, I was an astronaut
for a while, then I was a cowboy,

267
00:15:02,687 --> 00:15:07,012
and then all afternoon I was a fireman,
so it's been, uh... it's been a long one.

268
00:15:07,017 --> 00:15:09,442
- Uh, what's for dinner?
- Playdoh spaghetti.

269
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,591
- Oh.
- What?

270
00:15:11,727 --> 00:15:15,600
No. No, it's nothing.
Just had Playdoh spaghetti last night.

271
00:15:15,808 --> 00:15:19,182
- And that's all we had last night.
- What does that mean?

272
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:22,791
Oh, I don't know, Olivia.
Maybe that we are in a sexless marriage.

273
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:24,531
We have yet to have sex.

274
00:15:24,547 --> 00:15:26,411
Do you even know what sex is?

275
00:15:26,427 --> 00:15:29,043
That's not the poi... Don't change the...
It's a kind of cake?

276
00:15:29,047 --> 00:15:31,663
Look, can we just drop this
and have a normal pretend dinner?

277
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:32,743
Fine, fine!

278
00:15:32,746 --> 00:15:35,801
Uch, some days I think it was easier
being Q-Bert's roommate.

279
00:15:37,426 --> 00:15:39,481
God, it's all night with this guy.

280
00:15:39,487 --> 00:15:43,061
If you're gonna leave all those lights on,
I'm not gonna split the electric bill.

281
00:15:48,917 --> 00:15:53,291
Sorry we're late, everyone, but JonBenet
here took forever with her makeup.

282
00:15:53,297 --> 00:15:56,821
Uh, yes, and we probably would've
shaved a few minutes off our trip,

283
00:15:56,828 --> 00:16:00,003
but Mr. Cheapo here refused
to let the valet touch his Big Wheel,

284
00:16:00,008 --> 00:16:03,183
so we had to drive around the block
six times till we could find a spot.

285
00:16:03,186 --> 00:16:05,611
But to his credit, it is a great spot
to get mugged.

286
00:16:05,615 --> 00:16:09,251
Wouldn't that be a shame, if they took
all my money out of both our wallets.

287
00:16:09,258 --> 00:16:11,200
Well, it's just good to have
you guys here.

288
00:16:11,206 --> 00:16:12,642
Can I get you folks something to drink?

289
00:16:12,647 --> 00:16:16,802
- Uh, yes, I'll just have flat water.
- Um, do you have Hi-C Tropical Punch?

290
00:16:16,807 --> 00:16:18,681
And it begins...

291
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:20,561
What? I can't have a drink with dinner?

292
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:22,991
So dinner started at 2:00
this afternoon, did it?

293
00:16:22,997 --> 00:16:25,950
Yes, about the same time you
decided to hole up in the bathroom

294
00:16:25,957 --> 00:16:29,050
- for three hours waxing your eyebrows.
- You swore you would never...

295
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:32,482
I have a prominent brow,
and I do what I can to get by.

296
00:16:32,487 --> 00:16:34,761
Well, hey, what's important
is that you're here now.

297
00:16:34,768 --> 00:16:38,030
- Let's just enjoy dinner.
- Yeah, can't we just have a good time?

298
00:16:38,036 --> 00:16:38,910
Ask Olivia.

299
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,311
Olivia, the three of us are having
a great time. What's your problem?

300
00:16:41,316 --> 00:16:44,292
My problem is you.
You're acting like a baby.

301
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:47,710
And we come to the center of
the shrubbery maze.

302
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:51,562
That's what it all comes down to, isn't it?
I'm not grown up enough for you.

303
00:16:51,565 --> 00:16:54,673
- Well, you are a baby, aren't you?
- Stay out of it. Stay out of it.

304
00:16:54,677 --> 00:16:57,751
Well, if you think I'm a baby,
then perhaps I should act like a baby.

305
00:17:00,647 --> 00:17:02,563
<i>Hey, could you keep that kid quiet?</i>

306
00:17:02,568 --> 00:17:03,901
Oh, oh, oh, what's that?

307
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:07,363
What's that, sir? What's that?
I'm sorry, am I being too loud for you?

308
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:09,321
You wanna come over here
and quiet me down?

309
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:12,041
- Oh, let's do this.
- Oh, God. Stewie, come on.

310
00:17:12,045 --> 00:17:13,573
- I'm scared.
- No, it's okay. It's okay.

311
00:17:13,576 --> 00:17:16,020
Sir? You feel strong?
You wanna come over here?

312
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,181
<i>No, I want to stay here
and have my steak.</i>

313
00:17:18,185 --> 00:17:19,151
<i>- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

314
00:17:19,155 --> 00:17:20,893
<i>- What is that, the porterhouse?
- Yeah.</i>

315
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,323
<i>- How is it?
- What do you care?</i>

316
00:17:22,328 --> 00:17:24,143
If we weren't fighting,
would you recommend it?

317
00:17:24,145 --> 00:17:25,073
<i>Yeah, I would.</i>

318
00:17:25,075 --> 00:17:27,471
Well, I know what I'm getting.

319
00:17:31,836 --> 00:17:35,912
Hello, everyone.
Well, here we are... opening night.

320
00:17:35,917 --> 00:17:38,873
You know, somebody once told me
that making movies was easy.

321
00:17:38,876 --> 00:17:41,741
Yeah. Yeah, you know what else is easy?
Open heart surgery.

322
00:17:41,746 --> 00:17:44,760
<i>- Oh-ho-ho! Yes!
- Yeah, thanks for coming, Fuad.</i>

323
00:17:44,768 --> 00:17:48,160
<i>Oh! Is funny because open
heart surgery not easy at all.</i>

324
00:17:48,165 --> 00:17:50,143
Yeah, yeah. Calm down, Fuad.

325
00:17:50,895 --> 00:17:54,512
So, without further dudes, ah,
let's, uh, watch this thing.

326
00:17:56,977 --> 00:18:00,180
<i>At first I didn't believe
in women and unicorns,</i>

327
00:18:00,186 --> 00:18:03,760
<i>but that was before I knew
about the power of chick stuff,</i>

328
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:06,871
<i>and before I knew Vageena Hertz.</i>

329
00:18:07,225 --> 00:18:08,401
Sorry.

330
00:18:08,407 --> 00:18:13,161
<i>When Vageena was first born,
I had a small heart and a lot to learn.</i>

331
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:16,790
Push, honey!
Hurry up and give me my baby boy!

332
00:18:18,437 --> 00:18:20,543
Cleveland, more SpaghettiO's.

333
00:18:21,345 --> 00:18:25,333
Oh, good, a baby. Oh, no, it's a girl.

334
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:26,910
And I hate girls.

335
00:18:26,918 --> 00:18:31,313
<i>But one day, Vageena went swimming
too soon after eating a sandwich...</i>

336
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,801
<i>and this happened.</i>

337
00:18:32,805 --> 00:18:35,392
Help! Help! I'm drowning!

338
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:37,100
Help!

339
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:41,563
We gotta get this woman to surgery time.
Right stat now!

340
00:18:41,655 --> 00:18:45,961
<i>But it was too late.
And she died from an angry hymen.</i>

341
00:18:45,997 --> 00:18:47,103
<i>Fin.</i>

342
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:50,662
Wow, that was the worst piece
of crap I ever seen.

343
00:18:50,678 --> 00:18:53,210
Oh, my God, that was an abomination.

344
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:56,600
- That was awful. Awful. Awful, awful.
- My ass is actually sore.

345
00:18:56,617 --> 00:18:58,901
My ass is actually sore.

346
00:19:02,646 --> 00:19:05,763
- Hey, where's Olivia?
- Oh, she's probably up at the house.

347
00:19:05,825 --> 00:19:07,421
- Stewie?
- Yeah?

348
00:19:07,576 --> 00:19:09,832
- It's not your fault.
- What?

349
00:19:09,927 --> 00:19:15,032
- It's not your fault.
- I know.

350
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:17,800
No, Stewie, Stewie. It's not your fault.

351
00:19:17,818 --> 00:19:20,220
Don't do this to me, man. Not you, man.

352
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:22,813
- It's not your fault.
- Screw you! Cut it out, man.

353
00:19:22,818 --> 00:19:26,712
- It's not your fault.
- Why is it so hard?

354
00:19:26,717 --> 00:19:29,470
I didn't know it was gonna be so hard.

355
00:19:30,955 --> 00:19:34,311
Look, Stewie, you stood up
before God and all your toys

356
00:19:34,316 --> 00:19:37,072
and you took an oath to stick it out
when things got tough.

357
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:40,022
You want her to see you as an adult?
Well, this is adulthood.

358
00:19:40,028 --> 00:19:43,062
You're right, Brian.
I can't hide from this relationship.

359
00:19:43,076 --> 00:19:45,410
It's my responsability to deal with it.

360
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:48,823
I mean, what kind of a man
would I be If I ran off now?

361
00:19:48,826 --> 00:19:50,472
Well, you'd be a black man.

362
00:19:51,955 --> 00:19:54,733
- Whoa, what was that?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

363
00:19:54,738 --> 00:19:56,310
That was my father talking.

364
00:19:56,316 --> 00:19:57,433
You, uh...

365
00:19:57,727 --> 00:19:59,401
you gotta work on that, man.

366
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:00,942
Bad dog.

367
00:20:02,965 --> 00:20:04,891
Sweetie, listen, I'm sorry, I...

368
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:08,961
Oh, Stewie! I thought you were
at Chuck E. Cheese's with your mom.

369
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:13,360
No. A four-year-old died in the ball pit.
We had to cancel.

370
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,583
Is that the Silly Putty
I bought you this weekend?

371
00:20:15,586 --> 00:20:17,490
Stewie, this isn't what it looks like.

372
00:20:17,497 --> 00:20:19,621
Uh-uh, yeah, Stewie,
I just dropped by to...

373
00:20:19,626 --> 00:20:21,560
Uh, uh, uh, ain't nobody talking to you.

374
00:20:22,007 --> 00:20:25,493
Is... that... the Silly Putty...

375
00:20:25,616 --> 00:20:27,010
I bought you...

376
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,200
this weekend?

377
00:20:28,207 --> 00:20:31,051
You know, I'm really sensing something here...

378
00:20:31,056 --> 00:20:32,220
I should be go.

379
00:20:32,225 --> 00:20:35,421
No, about you stay here and I leave
and never come back again?

380
00:20:35,427 --> 00:20:38,041
Stewie, this isn't how I wanted
it to end.

381
00:20:38,047 --> 00:20:42,131
But you did want it to end.
You've made that perfectly clear.

382
00:20:43,365 --> 00:20:47,592
- Listen, are you gonna be all right?
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

383
00:20:47,597 --> 00:20:49,101
Is that smoke?

384
00:20:50,887 --> 00:20:54,740
Idea for a farce: cheating wife
and pompous ass burned alive.

385
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:06,121
So what happened?

386
00:21:06,136 --> 00:21:09,901
Well, you wanna know what I learned
this week? Being a grown-up sucks.

387
00:21:09,905 --> 00:21:13,503
Women, Brian. What a royal
pain in the ass. It's like, it's like,

388
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:15,812
why can't you just hang out
with guys, you know?

389
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:19,703
Just live with someone of your own sex.
Just do what you would do with women,

390
00:21:19,707 --> 00:21:22,401
but with your buddy, you know,
why don't guys just do that?

391
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:24,282
They do, it's called being gay.

392
00:21:24,285 --> 00:21:27,453
Oh, that's what gay is?
Yeah, I could totally get into that.
