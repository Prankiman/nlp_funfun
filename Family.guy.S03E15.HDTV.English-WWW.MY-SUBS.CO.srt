00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,790
"It seems today that all you see

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,250
"Is violence in movies and sex on TV

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,080
"But where are those
good old-fashioned values

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,290
"On which we used to rely?

00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,250
"Lucky there's a family guy

"Lucky there's a man who positively
can do all the things that make us

00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,920
"Laugh and cry

"He's a family guy

10
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:36,540
"Alan Adler, David Preslack, Julie Axlerod,
Shep Sutton, Scott McCormack. "

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,920
Those were the people who were mean to me
in junior high. Tomorrow, high school.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,090
Finally we go to Asian reporter
Tricia Takanawa for 60 seconds of filler.

13
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:50,710
I'm here on Spooner Street where several
Quahog families are holding a car wash

14
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:54,670
to raise money for an organ transplant
for young Paul Lewis.

15
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,920
- What do you call this device, Paul?
- An iron lung. It keeps me from dying.

16
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,210
I wanna play baseball!

17
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,550
With me is one of Paul's
classmates, Chris Griffin,

18
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:09,460
who helped organise this charity event.
You're a very thoughtful young man, Chris.

19
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,840
- Can I say hello to my mom?
- Sure.

20
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,670
- Hi, Mom!
- Hi, sweetheart.

21
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,970
So you want the full wash... Oh, you've got a
nick there. I can probably get that out for you.

22
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:25,180
If you want to go with a scent, I've got
PB and J, Sugar Cereal, and New Toy.

23
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,260
What the deuce?

24
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,840
- Hey! Somebody dropped a money clip.
- Wow! $26.

25
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:35,930
- I've never seen so much money at one time.
- What should we do with it?

26
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:39,890
I say we buy 26 dollars' worth
of ice cream and just pig out.

27
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:44,050
We can dish, talk about who's getting fat.
We'll be great big bitches.

28
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,550
Hold on, kids. That's not your money yet.

29
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,100
You gotta put up signs and wait
two weeks for someone to claim it.

30
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,180
If no one does, it's yours.

31
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,350
Ah, lunch is here!

32
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,060
Everyone, we've reached our goal.

33
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,890
It looks like somebody's
gonna live to see puberty.

34
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:05,930
- Oh, my God! That man took our money!
- What man?

35
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,770
He wore a Jimmy Carter mask,
like the robber in that Keanu Reeves movie.

36
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:13,430
- The Matrix?
- No. They were jumping out of a plane.

37
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,720
- Executive Decision.
- That was Kurt Russell.

38
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,430
The other guy in this movie
looks like Kurt Russell.

39
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,390
- He's getting away!
- Don't worry. He won't get far.

40
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,180
Stop! Police!

41
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,520
- Joe, what happened?
- I got the money.

42
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,650
- All right, Joe!
- But I lost the perp.

43
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:05,190
Well, the money's the important thing.
Now Paul can get his...

44
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,270
Point Break! That was the movie.

45
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:13,230
Here's to Joe, who helped
little Paul get a new liver

46
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,820
and, barring a massive infection,
a new lease on life.

47
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,820
Don't you understand? I lost the perp.

48
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,240
I lost the perp!

49
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,000
So, um... the 26 dollars
would probably be safe in my room.

50
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:33,750
Right. Probably get lost among the pin-ups
of Justin Timberlake and Tom Cruise and...

51
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,250
Blast! Who the devil do the teenagers like?
Morgan Freeman.

52
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:43,670
We can't keep it in my room cos there's
an evil monkey that lives in my closet.

53
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,080
The sad part is, he wasn't always evil.

54
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,330
Honey, good news! I made partner!

55
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:05,750
Peter, Bonnie says Joe's really
depressed about that robbery.

56
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,290
- Why don't you go talk to him?
- I don't know. There's a game on.

57
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,130
Shame on you. You march over there
and cheer your old friend up.

58
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,250
Don't listen to that sissy.
Grab a beer and watch the game.

59
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,250
That sounds good.

60
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,170
- Oh, my God!
- Get your fat ass over to Joe's.

61
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,300
- Buddy...
- Move!

62
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,340
All right. Take it easy, man. Everything's cool.

63
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,880
- Hey, buddy.
- Close the door. I don't wanna see the light.

64
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:36,800
Come on, Joe. Cheer up.
What do you say you and me go roller-ska...

65
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,800
bike-ri... jump ro...
go lay on the grass?

66
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,420
Peter, the other day was
the first time I've ever lost a perp.

67
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,550
It was also the first time
I've really felt handicapped.

68
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,090
I've made up my mind about this.
I'm quitting the force.

69
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,720
Come on, Joe.
You don't have to quit the force.

70
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,470
You could get a desk job. Huh?

71
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,300
- You could be a desk.
- Forget it. I'm washed up.

72
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:06,800
In local news, Quahog will soon play
proud host to the Special People's Games.

73
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,890
If you and/or a friend are disabled and would
like to challenge yourself, sign up today.

74
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,550
Joe, that's it! You gotta compete
in the Special People's Games.

75
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,350
Gosh, I don't know, Peter.
You really think I can?

76
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,430
Hey, I believed you could be a desk.
Come on! I'll even be your coach.

77
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,810
All right. Let's do it!

78
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:30,220
Coming up, our exposé on conveniently
placed news reports in television shows.

79
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,470
- But first, Peter, look out for that skateboard.
- Agh!

80
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,230
- Had a row with a fellow in the steam room.
- You don't say!

81
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,640
- Gave him a cauliflower ear.
- Bully!

82
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,060
- Come on. Two more.
- Peter, you're pushing me too hard.

83
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,560
Trust me, Joe. I know physical fitness.

84
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:56,390
I was in Richard Simmons'
Sweatin' to Books on Tape.

85
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,520
"The Red Sox were in town, but I didn't care,

86
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,480
because it was Tuesday and
I was on my way to see Maury. "

87
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,850
"He couldn't go to the bathroom by himself
any more, but his indomitable spirit... "

88
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,900
How does he check out, Doc?
Is my boy ready to compete?

89
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,650
Um... I don't quite know
how to tell you this, Mr Swanson.

90
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,190
- You're paralysed from the waist down.
- I know.

91
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,190
Oh, thank God!

92
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:28,980
God, I was standing out there
for like 10 minutes!

93
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,610
Whoo, boy! Is that a load off!

94
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:36,820
Mort, Joe's gonna compete
in the Special People's Games.

95
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,610
You got anything to give him
a little extra juice?

96
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:45,360
You mean steroids? Peter, haven't you seen
what happens to those ladies on ESPN2?

97
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,320
They get big hair faces and
their breasts become like flapjacks.

98
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,320
- I was thinkin' more like a protein shake.
- Oh, God, I'm sorry.

99
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,490
Aisle three next to the creams.
Oh, I don't like saying that word.

100
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,660
We now return to "Touched by an Angel".

101
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,030
- Where exactly did the angel touch you?
- Here.

102
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,950
Who are ya gonna believe?
I got a freakin' halo!

103
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,610
Sh, sh!

104
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:15,030
- Bye. I'm goin' to the mall.
- What for?

105
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,740
Don't worry. The $26 is safe.

106
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,870
Safe, huh? The skirt's trying to pull a fast one.

107
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,280
- Knuckles, get the handbag.
- Right, boss.

108
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,370
Give me my purse, you psycho!

109
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:29,410
Let's see. Make-up, chewing gum,
a picture of Meg in a two-piece swimsuit.

110
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:33,370
Oh, God! I pray this is not my first memory.

111
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,830
Cool it. I am not gonna put up
with this racket for two weeks.

112
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:40,370
I'll hold on to the money.
I'm a neutral party, so it'll be safe.

113
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,660
- OK.
- I suppose we can trust you.

114
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,250
- Now, where is it?
- What the...?

115
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:49,410
Very clever. Take another reach.
You forgot your change.

116
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,910
Hello and welcome to the Quahog
Special People's Games. I'm Tom Tucker.

117
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,080
I'm Diane Simmons. It's a great day
to be alive, Tom, able-bodied or not.

118
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:05,670
It sure is. Today we'll see some of
our finest athletes struggle valiantly

119
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:10,370
against God's twisted designs. You'll cheer,
you'll cry. You might get a cheap laugh.

120
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:16,000
I know I will, Tom. In fact, by the end
of the day, we may all be going to hell.

121
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,750
I'll see you there, Diane.

122
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,380
It sounds like the opening
ceremonies have begun.

123
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,080
There are the paraplegics,

124
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,090
followed by the blind team.

125
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,210
Still no sign of the deaf team.

126
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,420
- You're gonna be late.
- Maybe they're not there.

127
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,210
And now we turn our attention
to the lighting of the flame.

128
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,550
And these games are under way.

129
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:49,210
We begin with the 100-metre dash
for people afraid of yellow tape.

130
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,510
It's anybody's race now, Tom.

131
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,340
And it's Odai Mutambo of Kenya!

132
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:03,920
The decathlon.
That's quite a mountain to climb, Peter.

133
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,010
Joe, look at me. Look at me!

134
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,380
- Do I have food in my teeth?
- No.

135
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,050
Great. Thank God!

136
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:14,010
Listen, Joe. You and I both know
you have what it takes to win this thing.

137
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,220
So get out there and do it!

138
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,680
That gold medal is mine,
pretty boy. You don't have a chance.

139
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,300
- He may be right, Peter.
- Joe, he's an android.

140
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,430
Don't let him push you around.
You can do this.

141
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,100
Yeah. Yeah!

142
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,220
You think you're so hot, fella?
Well, I can do this.

143
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,470
Oh, crap.

144
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,600
Let's do it!

145
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,510
Now the first decathlon event,
the pole vault,

146
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,850
where Joe Swanson
takes his starting position.

147
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,640
- Way to go, Joe!
- Yeah!

148
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,770
- How do you like that, buddy?
- A stinker says "what".

149
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:58,100
- What?
- Ha, ha, ha, ha. You stupid bastard.

150
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:07,060
Good to see your new fiscal responsibilities
haven't interfered with your reading.

151
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:11,100
Ah! Dostoevsky, the mad Russian.

152
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,100
Good stuff. Good stuff.

153
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,440
You're not gonna get the $26,
and you're despicable for trying.

154
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,730
What? Oh, you thought...

155
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,650
I wasn't trying to get the $26.

156
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:25,900
I thought we were just having
an innocent conversation about literature.

157
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,690
Oh, you're silly.

158
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,520
I love that you'd go there.
You're silly. Goodbye.

159
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,190
We'll go to bulimic pie-eating in a moment,

160
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:40,060
but first, decathlon frontrunner
Joe Swanson will attempt the long jump.

161
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:44,980
- Come on, Joe. Break a wheel!
- I'm ready. Let's get it on!

162
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,940
That'll knock him out of the lead.
Tough break.

163
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,360
- Tough break, Tom.
- Good contribution, Diane.

164
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:59,860
For Swanson to take the gold, he'll have
to win the final event, the 100-metre dash.

165
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,740
- That's OK, Joe. You can still win this thing.
- That was pathetic.

166
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:09,570
Tell your wife to come over to my place if she
wants a little boom-lacka-lacka-lacka-lacka.

167
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:14,570
Boom-lacka-lacka-lacka-lacka.
Boom-lacka-lacka-lacka-lacka. Boom.

168
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,320
- Peter, it's over.
- What are you talkin' about?

169
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,860
If I couldn't catch a two-bit criminal,
how can I win a race?

170
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,030
Hey, what kinda talk is that?

171
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,990
It's un-American. Did George W Bush quit
even after losing the popular vote? No.

172
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:35,620
Did he quit after losing millions of his father's
friends' money in failed oil companies? No.

173
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,740
Did he quit after knockin' that girl up? No.

174
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,950
Did he quit after he got that DUl? No.

175
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:47,160
Did he quit after gettin' arrested for drunk and
disorderly conduct at a football game? No.

176
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,830
I get the message, Peter.

177
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,290
Gee, Peter, this water tastes kinda funny.

178
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:21,540
Uh... You mean ha-ha Jerry Seinfeld funny, or
Elayne Boosler bless-her-she's-trying funny?

179
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,370
- Racers, on your mark.
- Go get 'em, Joe.

180
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,330
Get set.

181
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:47,380
- Yeah!
- Joe Swanson wins the gold medal.

182
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,040
- You did it, Joe
- We did it, Peter.

183
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,670
Mommy, look at the ladyb... Agh!

184
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,970
- Hey, speedy.
- Do I know you?

185
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,470
- Jim Kaplan, sports agent. Like my car?
- Yeah.

186
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,340
- It's yours. Like my pants?
- Sure.

187
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,340
- You know what a merkin is?
- No.

188
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,430
- Pubic wig. I got one. You want it?
- No.

189
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,010
- Of course you don't. You wanna be rich?
- Yes.

190
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,050
Sign here.

191
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,680
What the hell...?

192
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,760
I don't understand why he did that without
me. We were gonna do everything together.

193
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:00,510
It was one cereal ad, Peter.
Besides, he won the medal.

194
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,890
Yeah, I guess.

195
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,850
Coming to ABC, the simple story
of a man and his chair:

196
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,600
What is this?!

197
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,180
Starring Tony Danza as Joe Swanson.

198
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,680
Once a man at his physical peak,

199
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,310
brought down by a cruel twist of fate.

200
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:23,140
Whyyyyyy?

201
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:27,390
- With Valerie Bertinelli as Bonnie.
- Joe, you must accept your limitations.

202
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,310
Why don't you just ask me
to lay down and die?

203
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,350
I can't live like this any more!

204
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,350
That's it!

205
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,940
- That's not how it happened. It was my idea.
- With Bea Arthur as Peter Griffin.

206
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,690
You'll never make it, Joe.
Why don't you just give up right now?

207
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,980
No. I've got to try.

208
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,770
- Even if it's by myself.
- You're a fool, Joe. A fool.

209
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:59,190
Friday on ABC, followed by "Dharma
and Greg", but you don't have to watch that.

210
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:03,770
Joe wouldn't be famous if it wasn't for me.
How come he's gettin' all the glory?

211
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,770
He's handicapped.
That makes his story inspirational.

212
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,610
Handicapped... Hm...

213
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,820
Agh! How did these get up here?

214
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,690
What the hell is this, Brian?

215
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,610
It's my new passport.
Why are you opening my mail?

216
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,070
You weren't planning on going somewhere
with our $26, were you?

217
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:29,610
For God's sake, I just had
the damn thing renewed.

218
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:32,400
You're obviously taking us for saps,
but we're not.

219
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:35,740
Fess up or I'll do to you
what I did to John Lennon.

220
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,030
John, have you met Yoko? Yoko, John.

221
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:42,110
You want your money? Fine.
I hope you all kill each other.

222
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:47,410
All right, I know how to settle this.
Whoever wants the money, raise your hand.

223
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:52,320
Ho-ho. You're smarter than I thought.
Give yourselves a round of applause.

224
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,240
Damn!

225
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,870
Honey, I'm gonna be late tonight.
I've got a hooker coming over.

226
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,780
I know it's late notice,
but what about the pool guy?

227
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,910
- Mr Tucker, Mr Griffin's here to see you.
- I gotta go.

228
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:08,370
Mr Tucker, I have just become
handicapped like Joe Swanson.

229
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:11,910
I demand commercial endorsements
and a TV movie based on me

230
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,490
- starring Valerie Bertinernie.
- Mr Griffin...

231
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:20,240
I even got the first piece you're gonna run.
Exclusive footage of my tragic accident.

232
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,910
Oh, no! A car going too fast
to stop in time! Aieee!

233
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,200
Agh! Agh!

234
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:32,540
I'm handicapped now. Agh!

235
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:38,250
Mr Griffin, you can't expect me to believe this.
That was clearly a scarecrow in your clothes.

236
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,540
- Come on!
- And when I freeze-frame,

237
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,460
you're driving the car.

238
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,250
- There's your hook.
- Get out.

239
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,420
Today we're here to honour Joe Swanson

240
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:55,330
for pulling my one-eyed cat Bootsie out of
the old stovepipe of my grandmother's cabin.

241
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:01,380
Joe Swanson won the Special People's
decathlon and we're here to honour him.

242
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,540
- Backstabber.
- Peter, I'm sure Joe will acknowledge you.

243
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:09,710
Don't forget our deal, Lois.
I sit through this and later tonight I get anal.

244
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,750
No matter how neat I want the house,
you clean it.

245
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,500
Thank you, thank you.

246
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:17,420
You know, no one can win
a gold medal by himself.

247
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:22,210
It takes friends. I want to acknowledge
a special friend in the audience today.

248
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,210
My friend Peter.

249
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:29,090
Peter Yarrow, of Peter, Paul and Mary.
Let's give him a hand, folks.

250
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:33,380
That's nothing compared to
what this next man did.

251
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:38,050
He challenged me to go that extra mile.
And that man is Mr Griffin.

252
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:41,300
Comedian Eddie Griffin, get up here!

253
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:47,760
Your acerbic anti-white humour was
a constant inspiration. Thank you, sir.

254
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,590
And last but not least,
who could forget the fat guy?

255
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,340
Chef Paul Prudhomme,
you get your Cajun ass up here!

256
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,340
I didn't even do anything.

257
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:00,680
That's it.
There's someone else he didn't thank.

258
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,510
- Mr Steroid. That's how he won.
- That's not true.

259
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,390
Yes, it is. I put steroids in your water bottle
before the last race.

260
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,890
I'm sorry, everybody. I've let you all down.

261
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,930
Yes. You suck. I rule.

262
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:20,050
Who da man? Who da man? Who da man?

263
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:27,140
All right. If anyone tries to lift the glass,
the bell will ring.

264
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,890
- Well, let's all go to bed.
- Off we go, then.

265
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,810
- Did you find the place OK?
- No problem.

266
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,900
Hey, kids.

267
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,440
I only had soup. I don't see why
we should split the bill evenly.

268
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,110
Wake up! This is Mr Taylor.
He's here to claim the money clip.

269
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,770
- Oh!
- Oh!

270
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,060
Uuuuuuugh!

271
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:27,150
Peter, go talk to him. After all,
you set out to make him feel better.

272
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,860
- Now he's worse than ever.
- I don't know, Lois.

273
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:35,570
He's probably waitin' to be interviewed
by Dan Rather or that dreadful Gene Shalit.

274
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,820
I think those days are over now, Peter.

275
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,150
- Hey there.
- Hi, Peter.

276
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:49,650
- Listen, Joe, about this whole mess...
- Hold it, Peter.

277
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,650
That's the car-wash thief.

278
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,240
- Ha, ha! Tough luck, wheelie!
- Yeah. For you.

279
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:17,240
I'm Joe, your waiter. Today's special
is justice, served cold with a side of jail.

280
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:22,240
Order the soufflé now,
cos it takes 10 to 15 years.

281
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,870
Peter, I really appreciate
what you did for me.

282
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:31,330
- What do you mean?
- That slimy agent had me believing the hype.

283
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:34,870
I forgot it was really you who got me
to believe in myself again.

284
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:39,660
- By the way, I'm goin' back to the force.
- Good for you.

285
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,160
What happened to the car-wash thief?

286
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,160
Ironically, I severed his spine
when I landed on him.

287
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:48,410
Looks like you got more competition
at next year's games.

288
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,000
No. He's dead.
