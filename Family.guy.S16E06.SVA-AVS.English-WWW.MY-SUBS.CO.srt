11
00:00:34,118 --> 00:00:37,371
Thanks for driving me to the
library for story time, Brian.

12
00:00:37,372 --> 00:00:39,830
Today we're reading<i> The
Very Hungry Caterpillar</i>

13
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,403
<i>vs. The Human Centipede.</i>

14
00:00:41,404 --> 00:00:43,357
I heard it's like<i> Alien vs. Predator.</i>

15
00:00:43,358 --> 00:00:44,855
With a little bit more butt eating.

16
00:00:44,856 --> 00:00:47,084
That does sound fun,
but what if I took you

17
00:00:47,085 --> 00:00:49,345
- to a different library today?
- What?

18
00:00:49,346 --> 00:00:52,363
But I like my library. I
met Curious George there.

19
00:00:52,364 --> 00:00:54,687
Mom said he was a puppet,
but she's stupid.

20
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:56,304
I'm just saying we
should go to the library

21
00:00:56,305 --> 00:00:57,618
at Quahog University

22
00:00:57,619 --> 00:00:59,555
and take your education
to a higher level.

23
00:00:59,556 --> 00:01:02,217
I guess I can try it. I mean,
I do want to get ahead.

24
00:01:02,218 --> 00:01:05,874
I don't want to end up like
Meg, doing sad one-woman shows.

Whose fault is this?

30
00:01:24,137 --> 00:01:25,972
You're wearing a garbage bag as a cape.

31
00:01:25,973 --> 00:01:27,007
Who do you think?

32
00:01:27,008 --> 00:01:29,723
- Him?
- Shh. She's crushing it!

33
00:01:38,451 --> 00:01:41,003
Oh, yeah. That's good library.

34
00:01:41,004 --> 00:01:43,722
Aw, you didn't come here for
me; you came to be a creep.

35
00:01:43,723 --> 00:01:45,192
Whatever. You go do your thing.

36
00:01:45,193 --> 00:01:47,726
I'm gonna go watch that young
hotshot attorney over there

37
00:01:47,727 --> 00:01:49,996
who's clearly in the
middle of a movie montage.

38
00:02:01,358 --> 00:02:04,228
Oh! He found it.
He's gonna win the case.

39
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,249
Oh, no. It was a '70s movie.

40
00:02:20,211 --> 00:02:22,243
- So, who you reading?
- George Eliot.

41
00:02:22,244 --> 00:02:23,740
Ah, Georgie.

42
00:02:23,741 --> 00:02:24,933
I'm a big fan.

43
00:02:24,934 --> 00:02:26,133
- I think he, uh...
- She.

44
00:02:26,134 --> 00:02:28,268
She said it best when she said...

45
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:31,004
"Bantam Press, 1851."

46
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,207
- Lumineers?
- What?

47
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:35,225
Hmm?

48
00:02:35,226 --> 00:02:37,471
You just said "Lumineers"
with no context.

49
00:02:37,472 --> 00:02:39,179
Did I do that?

50
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,532
Ugh!

51
00:02:41,698 --> 00:02:42,815
Tumblr?

52
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,689
Wow, I've never seen someone go
oh for six in 15 minutes before.

53
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,714
Just hard rejection
after hard rejection.

54
00:02:55,229 --> 00:02:57,830
- What's going on over there?
- Looks like a student rally.

55
00:02:57,831 --> 00:02:59,615
They probably forgot
to study for an exam,

56
00:02:59,616 --> 00:03:01,277
so they organized a protest.

57
00:03:01,278 --> 00:03:03,180
In the '90s, you'd just
pull a fire alarm...

58
00:03:03,181 --> 00:03:04,412
Now you hold a protest.

59
00:03:04,413 --> 00:03:07,536
That is, when they're not
looking down at their phones.

60
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,740
Hey, what's going on?

61
00:03:12,741 --> 00:03:14,924
Someone wrote "weird" on
the transgender bathroom,

62
00:03:14,925 --> 00:03:16,926
and the school president
didn't overreact,

63
00:03:16,927 --> 00:03:18,462
so we want him fired!

64
00:03:18,463 --> 00:03:19,797
Seems reasonable.

65
00:03:19,798 --> 00:03:20,864
Exactly!

66
00:03:20,865 --> 00:03:22,366
Oh, I see news cameras.

67
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:25,756
I'm gonna yell "Viva la Stool"
like a young, white drunkard.

68
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,319
And last week, a professor told
his class to have a nice day,

69
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,420
which is microaggression,

70
00:03:30,421 --> 00:03:32,542
because in our systemic rape culture

71
00:03:32,543 --> 00:03:33,823
no day is a nice day.

72
00:03:33,824 --> 00:03:35,862
So we want him fired, too.

73
00:03:35,863 --> 00:03:37,527
Hey, if you
don't want to get fired,

74
00:03:37,528 --> 00:03:39,295
- don't become a teacher, right?
- Totally.

75
00:03:39,296 --> 00:03:41,884
You should tweet that. #FireEveryone.

76
00:03:41,885 --> 00:03:43,132
Viva la Stool!

77
00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:46,035
Well, I guess I could
fire up my account again.

78
00:03:46,036 --> 00:03:47,437
All right, open app.

79
00:03:47,438 --> 00:03:49,205
Got a bunch of those. No biggie.

80
00:03:49,206 --> 00:03:50,606
Typing tweet.

81
00:03:50,607 --> 00:03:52,108
Blast off in three,

82
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:53,676
two, one,

83
00:03:53,677 --> 00:03:55,445
and tweeted.

84
00:03:55,446 --> 00:03:58,014
I am back in the game. See?

85
00:03:58,015 --> 00:03:59,615
Oop, you're gone.

86
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,317
And the crowd is gone.

87
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:02,868
And the animators are gone.

88
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,149
Hey, Stewie, what do you
think about this tweet?

89
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,650
Oh, don't be that guy.

90
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,669
"Kelly Ripa no-shows at work."

91
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,440
Who does she think she is,
a Republican senator?

92
00:04:16,441 --> 00:04:18,799
#G-O-P-U.

93
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,428
Three references in one
tweet. I'm sweating.

94
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:23,187
I'll just add it to my notes for later.

95
00:04:23,188 --> 00:04:24,815
Why are you getting into Twitter<i> now?</i>

96
00:04:24,816 --> 00:04:27,717
Unless you're an athlete or
a celebrity, no one cares.

97
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:29,374
A lot of people like my stuff.

98
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:32,022
Oh, yeah? Someone needs
to tell Donald Trump

99
00:04:32,023 --> 00:04:33,227
it's not fashionable

100
00:04:33,228 --> 00:04:35,426
to wear orange on your
face after Labor Day.

101
00:04:35,427 --> 00:04:37,400
#OompaTrumpa.

102
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:39,379
Zero retweets. Zero likes.

103
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,888
- Yeah, viral.
- You know, I don't care.

104
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:42,515
You can't stop me. Just like people

105
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:44,968
can't stop Peter from
ordering shepherd's pie.

106
00:04:44,969 --> 00:04:46,870
And what can I get for you, sir?

107
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:48,105
I'll have the shepherd's pie.

108
00:04:48,106 --> 00:04:50,039
I'm sorry, but that's not on the menu.

109
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,875
- Well, do you have potatoes?
- Yes.

110
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:52,945
- Butter?
- Yes.

111
00:04:52,946 --> 00:04:54,046

00:04:59,218 --> 00:05:00,318
- Carrots?

118
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,387
- Eggs?
- Yes.

119
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:02,455
- Flour?
- Yes.

120
00:05:02,456 --> 00:05:03,556
- Rosemary?
- Yes.

121
00:05:03,557 --> 00:05:04,590
- Thyme?
- Yes.

122
00:05:04,591 --> 00:05:05,658
- Chicken broth?
- Yes.

123
00:05:05,659 --> 00:05:06,726
- Corn?
- Yes.

124
00:05:06,727 --> 00:05:07,792
- Peas?
- Yes.

125
00:05:07,793 --> 00:05:08,793
Lightsaber?

126
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:12,716
Remember when we did<i> Star Wars?</i>

127
00:05:18,653 --> 00:05:21,841
Better get a tweet out before
I go dark for a few hours.

128
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,677
About to see the new Kevin Hart movie.

129
00:05:25,678 --> 00:05:28,481
Just kidding. I'm white
and went to college.

130
00:05:28,482 --> 00:05:30,768
#BaywatchMovie.

131
00:06:29,826 --> 00:06:31,766
Wow, I haven't seen that much camel toe

132
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,179
since the Arab Spring.

133
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,949
#ThinkingInTweets.

134
00:06:37,718 --> 00:06:39,152
Nah.

135
00:06:39,153 --> 00:06:42,171
Hey, are you @dogbackwards from Twitter?

136
00:06:42,172 --> 00:06:43,792
I am. Are-are you a fan?

137
00:06:43,793 --> 00:06:45,386
You racist jerk!

138
00:06:45,387 --> 00:06:47,739
I hope you get foot-and-mouth disease!

139
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,246
What the hell was that?

140
00:06:50,313 --> 00:06:52,217
Uh-oh.

141
00:06:56,154 --> 00:06:58,472
<i> Wow,
you are blowing up!</i>

142
00:06:58,473 --> 00:07:00,041
<i>Blowing up</i> bad.

143
00:07:00,042 --> 00:07:02,542
<i>Ah, look at that...</i> Huffington
Post<i> just picked it up.</i>

144
00:07:02,543 --> 00:07:03,743
<i>Buckle up, buddy.</i>

145
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,702
- There he is!
- Where? I'm in the back.

146
00:07:20,109 --> 00:07:22,662
Hey, how was<i> Baywatch?</i> I
want to see that bad.

147
00:07:22,663 --> 00:07:24,364
What were you thinking,
writing that tweet?

148
00:07:24,365 --> 00:07:25,865
What? It was just a joke.

149
00:07:25,866 --> 00:07:29,241
Brian, it's not 2005...
You can't just go online

150
00:07:29,242 --> 00:07:30,496
and say whatever you want.

151
00:07:30,497 --> 00:07:32,956
Yeah, remember how mad people
got when DiGiorno tweeted

152
00:07:32,957 --> 00:07:34,241
about domestic violence?

153
00:07:34,242 --> 00:07:36,443
And they're not even a
guy. They're pizza.

154
00:07:36,444 --> 00:07:38,411
All right, all right,
I'll delete the tweet.

155
00:07:38,412 --> 00:07:40,113
You haven't deleted it yet?

156
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:42,200
What a train wreck!

157
00:07:44,534 --> 00:07:45,553
There. Done. Done.

158
00:07:45,554 --> 00:07:47,020
See? It's done. It's gone.

159
00:07:47,021 --> 00:07:49,259
What about all those people outside?

160
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,457
They'll see that I deleted it,

161
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,032
and it'll all blow over. Trust me.

162
00:07:52,033 --> 00:07:53,594
I hope so, but you never know.

163
00:07:53,595 --> 00:07:57,031
They're still pretty mad at me
down at Dick's Sporting Goods.

164
00:07:57,032 --> 00:07:58,799
Um, what's the name of this place?

165
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,200
Dick's.

166
00:08:00,201 --> 00:08:02,536
A-And what's that say on your shirt?

167
00:08:02,537 --> 00:08:04,404
Dick's.

168
00:08:04,405 --> 00:08:07,196
Can I have two balls... and a helmet?

169
00:08:07,197 --> 00:08:09,109
Hey, you're the guy from the phone.

170
00:08:10,211 --> 00:08:11,711
Start the car, Chris!

171
00:08:11,712 --> 00:08:13,877
- Did you get him, Dad?
- We got him!

172
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:20,320
Hey, Sid. Happy Mango Monday.

173
00:08:20,321 --> 00:08:21,622
Hmm.

174
00:08:21,623 --> 00:08:24,124
Hmm. Those nighttime
information technology classes

175
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,292
must really be getting to Sid.

176
00:08:26,293 --> 00:08:27,393
Hey, Curt.

177
00:08:27,394 --> 00:08:28,394
Hmm.

178
00:08:28,395 --> 00:08:30,230
Curt? Come on, it's me,

179
00:08:30,231 --> 00:08:32,065
Lunchtime Lois.

180
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:33,600
Gil, help me out here.

181
00:08:33,601 --> 00:08:34,756
Hmm!

182
00:08:34,757 --> 00:08:37,670
Gil, no! Uh, what about
Barbara? Is she back there?

183
00:08:37,671 --> 00:08:39,380
She can clear this up.

184
00:08:39,381 --> 00:08:40,925
Let me talk to Barbara.

185
00:08:40,926 --> 00:08:42,642
She doesn't want to talk to you, either.

186
00:08:42,643 --> 00:08:43,658
Nobody does...

187
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,813
Not as long as you're living
with that racist dog.

188
00:08:45,814 --> 00:08:47,273
Oh, come on!

189
00:08:47,274 --> 00:08:49,032
It was just a bad joke.

190
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:50,345
Where's Stanley?

191
00:08:50,346 --> 00:08:52,185
He'll vouch for me. Let
me talk to Stanley.

192
00:08:52,186 --> 00:08:54,921
Or Henry. Somebody help me out here.

193
00:08:54,922 --> 00:08:56,589
- Chip?
- Hmm!

194
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,191
- Karen?
- Hmm!

195
00:08:58,192 --> 00:08:59,692
- JJ?
- Hmm.

196
00:08:59,693 --> 00:09:01,361
- Angela?
- Hmm.

197
00:09:01,362 --> 00:09:02,595
- Tito?
- Hmm!

198
00:09:02,596 --> 00:09:04,430
- Larry?
- Hmm!

199
00:09:04,431 --> 00:09:06,333
You can't freeze me out like this.

200
00:09:06,334 --> 00:09:08,301
We're on a first-name basis!

201
00:09:08,302 --> 00:09:10,304
They're on our name tags, Lois.

202
00:09:10,305 --> 00:09:12,940
But I don't even have
to look!

203
00:09:12,941 --> 00:09:16,227
I don't even have to look!

204
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,517
Hey, how come no one told me
we were going to the Clam?

205
00:09:24,518 --> 00:09:25,985
Hey, Jerome, give me a beer.

206
00:09:25,986 --> 00:09:28,188
Oh, why? 'Cause I'm, like, your slave?

207
00:09:28,189 --> 00:09:31,025
Man, you're no better
than your racist dog.

208
00:09:31,026 --> 00:09:32,026
Come on, man.

209
00:09:32,027 --> 00:09:33,960
B-Brian was just making a joke.

210
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:36,718
I told you about Brian. I told you.

211
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:38,331
Come on, he deleted his tweet.

212
00:09:38,332 --> 00:09:41,613
But the hurt has been
RT'd in our hearts.

213
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:42,802
Peter, you better get out of here

214
00:09:42,803 --> 00:09:45,138
before I start saying "sir" like a cop.

215
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:47,074
- Come on, Joe, I...
- Sir? Sir?

216
00:09:47,075 --> 00:09:48,242
You've been asked to leave.

217
00:09:48,243 --> 00:09:49,977
- Joe, it's me, Peter. I...
- Sir.

218
00:09:49,978 --> 00:09:52,146
I don't want to have to ask you again.

219
00:09:52,147 --> 00:09:53,980
- Please leave.
- All right, fine.

220
00:09:53,981 --> 00:09:55,248
- Sir!
- No, Joe, Joe.

221
00:09:55,249 --> 00:09:56,316
- He's leaving.
- Sir!

222
00:09:56,317 --> 00:09:57,417
- Joe, Joe...
- Sir!

223
00:09:57,418 --> 00:09:58,702
- He's gone.
- Sir.

224
00:09:58,703 --> 00:10:00,204
- It's okay.
- Sir.

225
00:10:00,205 --> 00:10:01,205
He's gone.

226
00:10:09,746 --> 00:10:12,057
Your dog wrote an insensitive tweet.

227
00:10:12,058 --> 00:10:13,366
You can't eat here.

228
00:10:13,367 --> 00:10:15,536
Uh-oh, Meg. It's a sensitivity mob.

229
00:10:15,537 --> 00:10:17,103
It was just a joke.

230
00:10:17,104 --> 00:10:19,205
There's no such thing as jokes anymore.

231
00:10:19,206 --> 00:10:21,274
Yeah, we live in a post-joke world.

232
00:10:21,275 --> 00:10:23,344
Chris, maybe we should just eat outside.

233
00:10:23,345 --> 00:10:25,579
No, Meg, we're eating here.

234
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,899
I'd like to see you try.

235
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:54,689
It was... a joke.

236
00:12:02,477 --> 00:12:04,478
Can you put on the Canucks game?

237
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,812
No, go away.

238
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,837
Loser.

239
00:12:07,838 --> 00:12:09,555
This is getting out of control.

240
00:12:09,556 --> 00:12:11,618
We can't leave the house
without getting harassed.

241
00:12:11,619 --> 00:12:13,686
Yeah, yesterday I went outside
to try to get the mail

242
00:12:13,687 --> 00:12:14,954
and I had a seizure.

243
00:12:14,955 --> 00:12:16,956
That may not be protester-related,

244
00:12:16,957 --> 00:12:19,203
but still, you got to
do something, Brian.

245
00:12:19,204 --> 00:12:20,303
What do you want me to do?

246
00:12:20,304 --> 00:12:22,396
I-I deleted my Twitter
account, my Instagram,

247
00:12:22,397 --> 00:12:23,564
Facebook, everything.

248
00:12:23,565 --> 00:12:25,465
People still won't leave me alone.

249
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:27,066
You have to apologize.

250
00:12:27,067 --> 00:12:28,801
Go outside, do it now.

251
00:12:28,802 --> 00:12:31,529
Tell them that it was a
mistake and how sorry you are

252
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:32,899
and maybe they'll get off our backs.

253
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,568
Maybe you're right.

254
00:12:34,569 --> 00:12:36,870
I got to face them and
hope they'll forgive me.

255
00:12:41,017 --> 00:12:42,285
Hello.

256
00:12:42,286 --> 00:12:44,877
As you all know, I'm Brian Griffin.

257
00:12:44,878 --> 00:12:46,213
Boo.

258
00:12:46,214 --> 00:12:48,781
Boo, Brian Griffin. Boo.

259
00:12:48,782 --> 00:12:50,150
I want to read a few words...

260
00:12:50,151 --> 00:12:51,584
Boo. Liar.

261
00:12:51,585 --> 00:12:54,655
Boo, Brian Griffin, boo.

262
00:12:54,656 --> 00:12:56,182
Anyway, I-I want to...

263
00:12:56,183 --> 00:12:57,790
Boo. Apologize somewhere else.

264
00:12:57,791 --> 00:13:01,727
Boo. Boo, Brian, boo.

265
00:13:01,728 --> 00:13:04,563
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm
here today to apologize...

266
00:13:04,564 --> 00:13:06,505
Why did you say "ladies" first?

267
00:13:06,506 --> 00:13:07,633
That's sexist.

268
00:13:07,634 --> 00:13:09,502
It's just, it's just
a-a standard greeting.

269
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:12,238
Let-let me start over.
Gentlemen and ladies...

270
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:13,786
Ooh, says the man.

271
00:13:13,787 --> 00:13:16,819
Okay, sorry, I-I... Um,
humans in the audience...

272
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,911
I identify as a basketball.

273
00:13:18,912 --> 00:13:20,313
Humans and basketballs...

274
00:13:20,314 --> 00:13:21,847
I'm a parrot who mimics words

275
00:13:21,848 --> 00:13:23,183
but doesn't comprehend them.

276
00:13:23,184 --> 00:13:25,584
Humans, basketballs, talking parrots,

277
00:13:25,585 --> 00:13:27,470
and-and whatever else is out there...

278
00:13:27,471 --> 00:13:29,522
"Whatever"? It's whoever.

279
00:13:29,523 --> 00:13:31,157
Actually, it's whomever.

280
00:13:31,158 --> 00:13:32,958
No one likes you, Mary.

281
00:13:33,976 --> 00:13:35,529
All right, all right,
just-just calm down, okay?

282
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,192
Now you're tone policing us!

283
00:13:37,193 --> 00:13:38,765
That makes me uncomfortable.

284
00:13:38,766 --> 00:13:41,601
Anything that makes me
uncomfortable in 2017

285
00:13:41,602 --> 00:13:42,769
should be illegal.

286
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:45,604
You know what? (BLEEP) you.

287
00:13:45,605 --> 00:13:48,149
I'm not a racist, all right?
I just told a bad joke.

288
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,488
There's a huge difference.

289
00:13:49,489 --> 00:13:51,110
But nobody on the Internet
ever takes the time

290
00:13:51,111 --> 00:13:53,479
to ask themselves, "Is this
worth freaking out over?"

291
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,515
Or, "Are there bigger problems
in the world than this tweet?"

292
00:13:56,516 --> 00:13:57,983
Well, I assure you, there are.

293
00:13:57,984 --> 00:14:00,453
And just for the record,
I love black people.

294
00:14:00,454 --> 00:14:02,188
I watch tons of black porn.

295
00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:04,056
So, what do you all want from me, huh?

296
00:14:04,057 --> 00:14:05,330
You-you want to ruin my life?

297
00:14:05,331 --> 00:14:07,101
Then congratulations. You did it.

298
00:14:07,102 --> 00:14:08,194
Everybody hates me.

299
00:14:08,195 --> 00:14:10,197
I can't leave the house
without getting harassed.

300
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:11,464
No one will hire me.

301
00:14:11,465 --> 00:14:12,799
That was a problem before.

302
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,068
I can't turn on my phone
without strangers telling me

303
00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:17,525
to kill myself or that they're
gonna kill my family.

304
00:14:17,526 --> 00:14:18,637
Leave me alone!

305
00:14:18,638 --> 00:14:21,474
I'm the self-righteous,
liberal douchebag, not you!

306
00:14:21,475 --> 00:14:23,576
I've kissed a transsexual before!

307
00:14:23,577 --> 00:14:24,810
How many of you can say that?!

308
00:14:24,811 --> 00:14:26,150
Where's my (BLEEP) medal?!

309
00:14:26,151 --> 00:14:27,546
I am so far left,

310
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:29,849
I'm spinning in circles, you (BLEEP).

311
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,518
Instead of killing myself,
I should kill all of you!

312
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,253
I'd like to see you try.

313
00:14:44,547 --> 00:14:47,517
Ow! Jeez.

314
00:14:51,522 --> 00:14:53,173
Well, we started the dialogue.

315
00:14:53,174 --> 00:14:55,708
You screamed "black porn"
at the top of your lungs

316
00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:57,276
in front of women and children.

317
00:14:57,277 --> 00:14:59,845
I am not the person those
people out there say I am.

318
00:14:59,846 --> 00:15:02,114
I know that, but you
also haven't done much

319
00:15:02,115 --> 00:15:03,349
to prove that you aren't.

320
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,084
I know, I know.

321
00:15:05,085 --> 00:15:06,780
All I have left is you guys.

322
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:08,688
Thank God you have my back.

323
00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:10,790
- We think you should move out.
- What?!

324
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,693
Oh! Brian, listen, we love you,

325
00:15:13,694 --> 00:15:15,728
but they're throwing
things at our house.

326
00:15:15,729 --> 00:15:18,004
We've got to keep our family safe.

327
00:15:18,005 --> 00:15:20,281
I'm sorry. It's for the best.

328
00:15:20,282 --> 00:15:22,468
Are you serious?!
You're okay with this?!

329
00:15:22,469 --> 00:15:24,938
Does this slow pan across
our disapproving faces

330
00:15:24,939 --> 00:15:26,224
answer your question?

331
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:38,260
I saw<i> Baywatch.</i>

332
00:15:38,261 --> 00:15:39,894
That thing was frickin' rad.

333
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,122
I still think this is a drastic measure.

334
00:15:47,123 --> 00:15:48,332
Yeah, I messed up,

335
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,332
but what about all the
stupid things Peter's done?

336
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,293
He's never been kicked
out and his life...

337
00:15:52,294 --> 00:15:53,890
My life is not the issue here.

338
00:15:53,891 --> 00:15:55,145
Peter, calm down.

339
00:15:55,146 --> 00:15:56,481
Did you eat breakfast this morning?

340
00:15:56,482 --> 00:15:58,116
I had a banana and a coffee.

341
00:15:58,117 --> 00:15:59,942
Why am I so fat?

342
00:15:59,943 --> 00:16:03,121
I'm sorry, Brian, but this
is the way it has to be.

343
00:16:03,122 --> 00:16:04,338
All right, then.

344
00:16:04,968 --> 00:16:06,621
I guess this is good-bye.

345
00:16:14,983 --> 00:16:16,567
Brian, wait.

346
00:16:17,921 --> 00:16:19,280
This collar is ours.

347
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:20,704
It has our address on it.

348
00:16:20,705 --> 00:16:22,053
Peace, dude.

349
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:33,866
All right, radio, time for you

Hey. Are you here for the<i> Time</i> magazines

366
00:17:30,775 --> 00:17:32,142
with some of the letters cut out?

367

Uh, no, I... no, I saw that you
have an apartment for rent.

Okay.

Oh, okay.

371
00:17:39,818 --> 00:17:43,120
I just have one rule here:
no kissing the mailman.

372
00:17:43,121 --> 00:17:44,821
I don't think that's gonna be a problem.

00:17:44,822 --> 00:17:47,324
You haven't seen him,
so don't say that yet.

Hang on, I'm
picking out sunscreen.

Hey, did you knock over a
few bottles in aisle seven?

Where's the big nail clipper?

396
00:19:46,711 --> 00:19:47,778
I don't know.

397
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:49,079
Did you get rid of it?

398
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,247
Why would I get rid
of the big nail clipper?

400
00:19:54,118 --> 00:19:56,286
Nice. Yeah, now I'm
gonna tell you where it is.

401
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,388
I knew you knew
where it was, you liar.

402
00:19:58,389 --> 00:19:59,556
Tell me where it is!

403
00:19:59,557 --> 00:20:01,058
No. Find it yourself.

404
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:02,592
Oh, okay. Fine.

405
00:20:02,593 --> 00:20:04,728
How about I hide something
of yours?! Huh?!

406
00:20:04,729 --> 00:20:06,129
Put that back!

407
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:09,050
No, tell me where
the big nail clipper is!

408

Damn it.

410
00:20:21,746 --> 00:20:24,114
Why can't you
use the little nail clipper?

411
00:20:24,115 --> 00:20:25,750
I want
the big one, okay?!
