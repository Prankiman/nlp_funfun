Oh, I am so excited
for Stewie's first play.

12
00:00:39,184 --> 00:00:40,585
Don't you think
it's a little soon

13
00:00:40,652 --> 00:00:42,453
for a musical
about Terri Schiavo?

- How's my wife doing?
- She's a vegetable.

00:01:11,883 --> 00:01:15,186
I hate vegetables.

18

Don't worry about her,
Mr. Schiavo.

Oh, my God,
here comes Jared.

37
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:06,370
Wow, he's in kindergarten.

38
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:08,072
Hey, so you're the
plug this year?

39
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,073
Hey, Jared.

40
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:10,374
Yeah, I'm the plug.

41
00:02:10,442 --> 00:02:12,243
Yeah, I was the plug
three years in a row.

42
00:02:12,311 --> 00:02:13,344
Like I don't know that?

43
00:02:13,412 --> 00:02:15,012
Everybody knows that, Jared.

44
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,815
Well, listen, don't you try
to be a Jared plug, all right?

45
00:02:17,883 --> 00:02:20,718
You just go out there, you be
the best Stewie plug you can.

46
00:02:20,786 --> 00:02:22,086
I sure will, Jared.

47
00:02:22,154 --> 00:02:23,654
Hey, you got any
gummi bears on you?

48
00:02:23,722 --> 00:02:24,822
No.

49
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,724
It'd be a lot
cooler if you did.

50
00:02:29,628 --> 00:02:31,595
You know, they say
don't meet your heroes,

but they can eat my ass,
because that was awesome!

00:02:33,865 --> 00:02:35,266
I don't know, don't you think

53
00:02:35,334 --> 00:02:37,034
it's kind of weird
that he's in kindergarten

54
00:02:37,102 --> 00:02:39,270
and he's still hanging
around kids our age?

55
00:02:39,338 --> 00:02:42,640
Hey, we are very lucky.

56

Quick, Peter,
grab the video camera.

62
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,121
All right, all right.

63
00:03:06,765 --> 00:03:08,065
What's wrong with Stewie?

64
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:09,400
I think he has stage fright.

65
00:03:09,468 --> 00:03:10,868
I think he has stage fright, Peter.

That's what I just said, I said that.

67
00:03:20,812 --> 00:03:22,680
Look at Stewie.

68
00:03:22,748 --> 00:03:23,914
What a baby.

69
00:03:23,982 --> 00:03:25,182
Aw, no way.

70
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,618
Hey, Chris, look,
is that Richard Dreyfuss?

71
00:03:27,686 --> 00:03:29,653
Oh, for crying out loud.

72
00:03:29,721 --> 00:03:30,721
Hey, Dreyfuss,
where you going?

73
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:31,922
Get back here.

74
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,657
Dreyfuss, what are you
doing here in Quahog?

75
00:03:33,725 --> 00:03:35,059
My nephew's in the play.

76
00:03:35,127 --> 00:03:36,627
God, can't you go
anywhere these days

77
00:03:36,695 --> 00:03:37,728
without these damn paparazzi?

78
00:03:38,797 --> 00:03:39,797
Where you going?

79
00:03:39,865 --> 00:03:41,165
Oh, you going
to the bathroom?

80
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:43,401
You going to have a close
encounter of the turd kind?

81
00:03:44,736 --> 00:03:46,470
Hey, I think you're going
to need a bigger boat.

82
00:03:47,606 --> 00:03:49,073
These jokes are
for you, Peter,

83
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:51,041
when you watch this tape
in the future.

84
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:52,410
Hi, future Peter.

85
00:03:52,477 --> 00:03:54,879
I'm going to plant a tree
for you when I get home.

86
00:03:54,946 --> 00:03:57,848
Look outside and you'll see
a grown tree.

87
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:00,351
I'm going to plant a tree
for you when I get home.

88
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:03,187
Look outside
and you'll see a grown tree.

89
00:04:04,723 --> 00:04:06,190
Eeeeeee!

90
00:04:06,258 --> 00:04:07,958
Now look at your hand.

91
00:04:08,026 --> 00:04:10,528
It's just a nub, 'cause I'm
gonna cut off all the fingers.

92
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:12,096
Oh, yeah, past Peter?

93
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:14,131
Well, two can play that game.

94
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,132
Take that.

95
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:17,268
Uh, wait a minute.

96
00:04:20,972 --> 00:04:22,873
How was your bowel movement,
Peter?

97
00:04:22,941 --> 00:04:25,009
Eh, I got some, but I didn't
get the troublemaker.

98
00:04:25,076 --> 00:04:27,244
Wait, what time is it?
I got to turn on <i>TMZ</i>.

99
00:04:27,312 --> 00:04:31,282
<i>Today on TMZ:</i>

100
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:33,451
<i>Rene Russo got a little hot
under the collar</i>

101
00:04:33,518 --> 00:04:36,053
<i>when we caught up with her
outside her home in the hills.</i>

102
00:04:36,121 --> 00:04:38,389
Rene, what was it like working
with Douglas Fairbanks?

103
00:04:38,457 --> 00:04:41,859
Is it true you
were born in 1880?

104
00:04:41,927 --> 00:04:45,830
This is my rassinfrackin' land,
and I don't care what no man

105
00:04:45,897 --> 00:04:49,366
from no Tennessee Valley
Authority says, consarnit!

106
00:04:49,434 --> 00:04:50,568
Why are we watching <i>TMZ</i>?

107
00:04:50,635 --> 00:04:51,702
I hate this show.

108
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,003
Keep watching.

109
00:04:53,071 --> 00:04:54,338
So what do you got?

110
00:04:54,406 --> 00:04:56,407
I got Richard Dreyfuss
coming out of the bathroom

111
00:04:56,475 --> 00:04:58,476
at his nephew's play
in Rhode Island.

112
00:04:58,543 --> 00:05:00,411
Peter:
Richard, hey, Richard.

113
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,779
Hey, can I get
your autograph?

114
00:05:01,847 --> 00:05:02,780
Fine.

115
00:05:02,848 --> 00:05:04,248
Do you have a pen and paper?

116
00:05:04,316 --> 00:05:05,416
What do I look like,
a Staples?

117
00:05:05,484 --> 00:05:06,750
I don't carry
that stuff around.

118
00:05:06,818 --> 00:05:08,118
Look, I'm sorry,
I can't help you.

119
00:05:08,186 --> 00:05:09,954
Oh, what, you too big
and famous to walk over

120
00:05:10,021 --> 00:05:12,323
to that corner drugstore
and pick up a pen and paper

121
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,225
and possibly
some other groceries I need

122
00:05:14,292 --> 00:05:16,293
and come back and sign
several things for me?

123
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:17,595
You're a jerk.

124
00:05:17,662 --> 00:05:19,396
That was my tape,
everybody.

125
00:05:19,464 --> 00:05:21,465
I sent that in and
they put it on TV,

126
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:23,667
which makes me a
famous journalist.

127
00:05:23,735 --> 00:05:25,402
Journalist?
You're badgering a celebrity

128
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,004
and passing it off as news.

129
00:05:27,072 --> 00:05:28,105
Yeah, journalist.

130
00:05:28,173 --> 00:05:29,573
And I got a hundred bucks for it,

131
00:05:29,641 --> 00:05:32,510
which I used to buy
this $4,000 video camera.

132
00:05:32,577 --> 00:05:35,246
Meet Peter Griffin,
video paparazzi.

133
00:05:35,313 --> 00:05:37,481
From now on I'm gonna be
right where the action is,

134
00:05:37,549 --> 00:05:39,950
like my uncle,
"The Guy in the White Hat" Griffin.

135
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:56,033
Stewie... Stewie,
how's that oatmeal?

136
00:05:56,101 --> 00:05:58,102
Is it true you're having
an affair with that oatmeal?

137
00:05:58,169 --> 00:05:59,169
What do you say
about the rumors

138
00:05:59,237 --> 00:06:00,271
that you have a full diaper?

139
00:06:00,338 --> 00:06:01,539
I'm just trying to eat here.

140
00:06:01,606 --> 00:06:03,040
What did you do
to your mother's vagina?

141
00:06:03,108 --> 00:06:04,108
Leave me alone!

142
00:06:04,175 --> 00:06:05,509
How come your feet
are so small?

143
00:06:05,577 --> 00:06:07,111
Is it true you can't say
"spaghetti"?

144
00:06:07,178 --> 00:06:08,746
What about the rumors
that you have cooties?

145
00:06:08,813 --> 00:06:10,548
Is it true you doubled your
weight in the last six months?

146
00:06:14,386 --> 00:06:16,120
Daddy, help me, Daddy!

147
00:06:16,187 --> 00:06:18,155
I can't get involved
'cause of journalism.

148
00:06:18,223 --> 00:06:20,591
Tom, Tom Tucker, Tom!

149
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:21,759
The news isn't funny.

150
00:06:21,826 --> 00:06:22,993
It's not supposed
to be funny.

151
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:24,461
Tom, who were you having
dinner with in there?

152
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:25,896
Was it a guy?
Are you gay?

153
00:06:25,964 --> 00:06:26,897
Someone said
you were gay.

154
00:06:26,965 --> 00:06:27,965
It was me.

155
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:29,500
Are the rumors
I'm making up true?

156
00:06:29,568 --> 00:06:31,969
Ignore me if you're gay.

157
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:34,538
Mayor West, over here.

158
00:06:34,606 --> 00:06:36,674
What hot spot are you going
to this Friday night?

159
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:39,009
Oh, I've got
some pretty nifty plans,

160
00:06:39,077 --> 00:06:40,778
my camera-wielding friend.

161
00:06:40,845 --> 00:06:42,246
- Yeah?
- That's right.

162
00:06:42,314 --> 00:06:45,883
Every Friday night,
I'm a clearance sale area rug.

163
00:06:49,054 --> 00:06:51,188
Boy, I hope somebody buys me.

164
00:06:51,256 --> 00:06:53,791
I'd look swell in their den.

165
00:06:59,731 --> 00:07:01,198
Aw.

166
00:07:01,266 --> 00:07:03,334
Ollie Williams, why do you
look so much like Will Smith?

167
00:07:03,401 --> 00:07:04,635
Hey, Will Smith,

168
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,503
what was it like to punch
that alien in the face?

169
00:07:06,571 --> 00:07:07,705
Eddie Murphy,
what was that whole thing

170
00:07:07,772 --> 00:07:09,340
with you and that
transvestite hooker?

171
00:07:09,407 --> 00:07:10,874
Bernie Mac,
how come you died?

172
00:07:10,942 --> 00:07:12,443
Oprah, why are you so fat,
Don Cheadle?

173
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:19,516
You almost done
in there, Peter?

174
00:07:19,584 --> 00:07:22,086
Hang on, Lois... stupid
Ollie Williams broke my glasses.

175
00:07:22,153 --> 00:07:23,420
I got to put in my contacts.

176
00:07:23,488 --> 00:07:25,155
By the way,
the repair shop called.

177
00:07:25,223 --> 00:07:27,124
They said
they can't fix your camera.

178
00:07:27,192 --> 00:07:28,592
Well, that's just great,
Lois, that's great.

179
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,361
And here I was going
to use the money

180
00:07:30,428 --> 00:07:32,062
to take you to
"can-cun" this winter.

181
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,497
Cancún, Peter.

182
00:07:33,565 --> 00:07:35,966
Whoa, whoa, I don't like
Ollie any more than you do,

183
00:07:36,034 --> 00:07:37,501
but we are a
21st-century family,

184
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:39,503
and I will not have
that kind of talk here.

185
00:07:39,571 --> 00:07:40,638
Whatever.

186
00:07:44,776 --> 00:07:46,210
Griffin, did you call
the distributor

187
00:07:46,277 --> 00:07:48,679
about the...?

188
00:07:48,747 --> 00:07:50,247
What, what's the problem?

189
00:07:50,315 --> 00:07:52,216
Okay, look,
I know I was watching TV,

190
00:07:52,283 --> 00:07:53,550
but I'll... I'll stay late.

191
00:07:53,618 --> 00:07:55,452
No, that's not it, Griffin.

192
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,555
There's... there's something
different about you.

193
00:07:58,623 --> 00:08:00,324
You're not wearing glasses.

194
00:08:00,392 --> 00:08:02,192
Yeah, they got busted;
I'm wearing contacts.

195
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,862
I can see your eyes and,
and your eyelashes...

196
00:08:04,929 --> 00:08:07,064
they're beautiful.

197
00:08:07,132 --> 00:08:09,099
Who cares? What gives?

198
00:08:55,947 --> 00:08:58,415
Griffin, I never
noticed you before.

199
00:08:58,483 --> 00:09:00,417
I like what I see.

200
00:09:00,485 --> 00:09:02,920
Uh, okay.

201
00:09:04,322 --> 00:09:06,657
Oh, no, I dropped
my pencil.

202
00:09:06,725 --> 00:09:07,891
Oh, I'll get it for you.

203
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,627
Yeah, this is gonna

204
00:09:10,695 --> 00:09:12,896
work out just fine.

205
00:09:14,532 --> 00:09:15,833
Excuse me.

206
00:09:19,822 --> 00:09:22,323
Family,
we need to talk.

207
00:09:22,391 --> 00:09:25,927
Your father was sexually
harassed at work today.

208
00:09:25,995 --> 00:09:26,895
What?

209
00:09:26,962 --> 00:09:27,896
That's right.

210
00:09:27,963 --> 00:09:29,530
Angela grabbed my ass.

211
00:09:29,598 --> 00:09:30,932
So what?

212
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,901
Peter, a woman can't
sexually harass a man.

213
00:09:32,968 --> 00:09:34,335
Why not?

214
00:09:34,403 --> 00:09:36,704
I don't know, it just
doesn't make any sense.

215
00:09:36,772 --> 00:09:39,007
I mean, guys like
being touched by women.

216
00:09:39,074 --> 00:09:41,009
It's not harassment
if you like it.

217
00:09:41,076 --> 00:09:42,477
But I didn't like it.

218
00:09:42,544 --> 00:09:44,245
I got sexually
harassed at school.

219
00:09:44,313 --> 00:09:46,714
My chemistry teacher,
Mr. Taylor, rubbed my shoulders

220
00:09:46,782 --> 00:09:49,918
for thirty-five minutes in class the
one day I didn't wear a bra.

221
00:09:49,985 --> 00:09:52,086
See, Peter,
that's harassment.

222
00:09:52,154 --> 00:09:54,389
An older man,
a weak, younger woman.

223
00:09:54,456 --> 00:09:55,823
He could have
taken advantage of her,

224
00:09:55,891 --> 00:09:57,625
forced her to do
things to him.

225
00:09:57,693 --> 00:09:59,527
He did... awful things.

226
00:09:59,595 --> 00:10:00,695
See?

227
00:10:00,763 --> 00:10:03,331
But you, it just can't happen.

228
00:10:06,502 --> 00:10:08,503
Griffin, get in here,

229
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:11,406
and make sure you have on
your new uniform.

230
00:10:11,473 --> 00:10:14,442
Why am I the only one who
has to wear denim shorts?

231
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:17,078
Because you're the only one
who looks this good in them.

232
00:10:17,146 --> 00:10:20,581
Damn, Griffin,
you fill those out nicely.

233
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:22,216
Why is there a
dusty gas station

234
00:10:22,284 --> 00:10:26,354
and a Diet Pepsi
machine in your office?

235
00:10:26,422 --> 00:10:28,256
'Cause your car broke down,
and you need

236
00:10:28,324 --> 00:10:31,459
to wipe a cold soda
on your neck to cool off.

237
00:10:31,527 --> 00:10:33,461
Well, may... maybe I don't
need to cool off.

238
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:35,830
Maybe you don't need
to be employed.

239
00:10:43,105 --> 00:10:44,572
It's hot in here, isn't it?

240
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,640
Yes.

241
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,675
You need to cool off,
don't you?

242
00:10:47,743 --> 00:10:49,010
I need to cool off.

243
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:52,280
You need to wipe your
neck with the soda can.

244
00:10:52,348 --> 00:10:54,615
I need to wipe my neck
with the soda can.

245
00:10:54,683 --> 00:10:55,683
Do it!

246
00:11:01,156 --> 00:11:03,191
Now, get out of here, you slut.

247
00:11:03,258 --> 00:11:05,226
Okay. Can I keep the soda?

248
00:11:05,294 --> 00:11:06,761
Oh, all right.

249
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:08,062
Yeah!

250
00:11:20,109 --> 00:11:21,909
Ohhh...

251
00:11:21,977 --> 00:11:23,978
Oh, God.

252
00:11:24,046 --> 00:11:26,914
I really hope there's a
hungry horse back there.

253
00:11:30,452 --> 00:11:32,086
Hello?

254
00:11:32,154 --> 00:11:33,721
Oh, hi, Angela, hang on.

255
00:11:33,789 --> 00:11:35,156
Peter, it's your boss.

256
00:11:35,224 --> 00:11:36,424
I don't want to
talk to her.

257
00:11:36,492 --> 00:11:37,692
She's gonna harass me.

258
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,794
Oh, don't be such a baby.

259
00:11:39,862 --> 00:11:42,196
I'm sorry, Angela,
Peter can't talk.

260
00:11:42,264 --> 00:11:43,731
He's upstairs in the shower

261
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:45,333
touching himself
to your picture.

262
00:11:45,401 --> 00:11:48,269
Gimme that.
Why are you calling me at home?

263
00:11:48,337 --> 00:11:50,271
<i>I want to hear you breathe.</i>

264
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:52,306
<i>- Breathe into the phone for me, Griffin.</i>
- What?

265
00:11:52,374 --> 00:11:54,675
<i>Shh, shh, shh.
Don't talk, just breathe.</i>

266
00:11:54,743 --> 00:11:58,579
<i>It turns me on.</i>

267
00:12:03,786 --> 00:12:05,019
<i>That's it, Griffin.</i>

268
00:12:05,087 --> 00:12:08,689
<i>Keep breathing.
God, I'm almost there.</i>

269
00:12:08,757 --> 00:12:12,727
<i>Your breath is filling me up.</i>

270
00:12:12,795 --> 00:12:15,463
I like kangaroos.

271
00:12:15,531 --> 00:12:17,365
<i>Oh, sure you do.</i>

272
00:12:17,433 --> 00:12:21,335
<i>Well, tomorrow,
I'm getting you a kangaroo t-shirt.</i>

273
00:12:24,573 --> 00:12:26,774
And she wants me to come over
to her house tonight

274
00:12:26,842 --> 00:12:28,409
to work on a "special project."

275
00:12:28,477 --> 00:12:30,611
I know she's gonna make me
have sex with her.

276
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:32,880
- What the hell am I gonna do?
- I don't know, Peter.

277
00:12:32,948 --> 00:12:34,982
If you have sex with her,
you give her all the power.

278
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,617
If you don't have sex with her,
you're gay.

279
00:12:36,685 --> 00:12:37,618
You can't win.

280
00:12:37,686 --> 00:12:39,153
I don't want to get fired

281
00:12:39,221 --> 00:12:40,521
and have to look
for another job.

282
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:41,889
What the hell do I do?

283
00:12:41,957 --> 00:12:43,491
I might be able to
help you, Peter.

284
00:12:46,462 --> 00:12:48,362
All right, hurry up,
let's get this over with.

285
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,231
All right, unbutton your shirt
and your pants.

286
00:12:53,936 --> 00:12:55,703
That oughta do it.
Okay, close up.

287
00:12:57,339 --> 00:12:59,107
All right, let me get
lined up right,

288
00:12:59,174 --> 00:13:01,275
so she'll think it's you
she's having sex with.

289
00:13:01,343 --> 00:13:02,877
- Wow, that's really clever.
- Thanks.

290
00:13:02,945 --> 00:13:04,812
And if you don't feel
like doing Lois later,

291
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,581
I can stick around.

292
00:13:06,648 --> 00:13:09,016
Let's... let's just
see how this goes.

293
00:13:11,302 --> 00:13:15,022
- Hello, Griffin.
- Hello, Angela.

294
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,859
You know, Angela,
I've been thinking about it,

295
00:13:17,926 --> 00:13:19,927
and I want to have
sex with you now.

296
00:13:19,995 --> 00:13:21,262
- Really?
- Giggity.

297
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,864
Yeah, but...
but I want to just do it

298
00:13:22,931 --> 00:13:24,198
through my zipper,
all right?

299
00:13:24,266 --> 00:13:25,967
I... I... I don't want to have
to take off all my clothes,

300
00:13:26,034 --> 00:13:27,135
'cause I'm self-conscious

301
00:13:27,202 --> 00:13:29,170
about my Congressman
Barney Frank body.

302
00:13:29,238 --> 00:13:31,339
Well, I suppose I can
work with that.

303
00:13:33,142 --> 00:13:34,509
Oh, yuck.

304
00:13:34,576 --> 00:13:39,113
- What do you say we go Into the bedroom?
- Uh, yeah, sure.

305
00:13:39,181 --> 00:13:42,083
Aw, she's so ugly.
I don't want to get in that.

306
00:13:42,151 --> 00:13:44,051
Peter, I'm... I'm not gonna do it.
Deal's off. Deal's off.

307
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:45,653
- No, it isn't!
- Yes, it is.

308
00:13:45,721 --> 00:13:47,855
I'm gonna spread my legs,
and it'll be you doing it, not me.

309
00:13:47,923 --> 00:13:49,423
- You better not.
- I am.

310
00:13:49,491 --> 00:13:50,825
I'm re-jiggering my position
right now.

311
00:13:50,893 --> 00:13:54,462
Oh, no, you don't!

312
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,631
What the hell is
going on here?

313
00:13:58,287 --> 00:13:59,367
Oh...

314
00:14:00,102 --> 00:14:02,436
Hi, Angela, I'm Peter's friend,
Glenn Quagmire.

315
00:14:02,504 --> 00:14:05,106
Uh, thank you so much
for having me in your home.

316
00:14:05,174 --> 00:14:06,874
And, um, I would have
had sex with you,

317
00:14:06,942 --> 00:14:08,276
but Peter neglected to tell me

318
00:14:08,343 --> 00:14:10,344
that you are a
complete dumpster fire.

319
00:14:10,412 --> 00:14:11,812
Some friend, huh?

320
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,749
Okay, all right,
take it easy.

321
00:14:14,816 --> 00:14:16,751
I am tired of
playing games, Griffin.

322
00:14:16,818 --> 00:14:18,753
I mean, let's go.
I have waited long enough.

323
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,455
I'm having sex with you
right now.

324
00:14:21,523 --> 00:14:22,990
No! I don't wanna!

325
00:14:23,058 --> 00:14:26,260
Griffin, you have sex with me,
or you're fired.

326
00:14:26,328 --> 00:14:27,528
Fine! Fire me!

327
00:14:27,596 --> 00:14:29,297
I'm through bein'
harassed by you!

328
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,534
You know,
this is awful timing,

329
00:14:33,602 --> 00:14:35,970
but I... I remembered part of
the reason I came over was

330
00:14:36,038 --> 00:14:39,574
'cause my cousin is lookin'
for a job at the brewery.

331
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:41,809
I'll... I'll just put his
résumé under the door.

332
00:14:47,347 --> 00:14:50,549
- Gimme another one, Horace.
- All right, but slow down, Peter.

333
00:14:50,617 --> 00:14:52,718
Or else I'm gonna have to get
that lady boss of yours

334
00:14:52,786 --> 00:14:55,320
to come in here and give you
a good shoe to the gift bag.

335
00:14:55,388 --> 00:14:56,522
You know,
keep you in line.

336
00:14:56,589 --> 00:14:59,491
I'm just kiddin' ya, Peter.

337
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:01,527
You'll find yourself a new job.

338
00:15:01,594 --> 00:15:05,664
We now return to Robert Mitchum
in <i>A Backhand For Sally.</i>

339
00:15:05,732 --> 00:15:07,633
You're getting
on that train with me.

340
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,402
I can't go with you. I just can't.

341
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:14,506
Okay, I'll go.
Ow! I said I'd go.

342
00:15:14,574 --> 00:15:16,041
Why'd you give me the
back of your hand?

343
00:15:16,109 --> 00:15:17,976
Because I love you.

344
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,815
Wow, I thought
you had to be in the NBA

345
00:15:22,882 --> 00:15:24,283
to hit a girl in the face.

346
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,751
But I guess anyone can.

347
00:15:25,819 --> 00:15:28,153
Of course you can hit a girl
in the face.

348
00:15:28,221 --> 00:15:29,888
They have faces, don't they?

349
00:15:29,956 --> 00:15:32,124
Are... are you talkin' to me,
Robert Mitchum?

350
00:15:32,192 --> 00:15:35,928
You bet your ass I am.
Look at you, you're pathetic.

351
00:15:35,995 --> 00:15:38,397
What kind of a man gets fired
by a broad?

352
00:15:38,465 --> 00:15:41,233
- A man with a female boss?
- Don't crack wise.

353
00:15:41,301 --> 00:15:44,303
Listen, Peter, somewhere along the line,
you got turned around.

354
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,604
You're a man.

355
00:15:45,672 --> 00:15:47,573
And whaddaya think it means
to be a man?

356
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,242
Um, it means not gettin'
pushed around.

357
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,111
- Exactly.
- It means drinkin'

358
00:15:52,178 --> 00:15:54,546
not because I want to,
but because I need to.

359
00:15:54,614 --> 00:15:56,381
- Right!
- It means standing up to fart,

360
00:15:56,449 --> 00:15:58,050
not hidin' it in a pillow,

361
00:15:58,118 --> 00:15:59,585
or holdin' it in
till your stomach goes...

362
00:15:59,652 --> 00:16:03,489
Now you've got it!

363
00:16:03,556 --> 00:16:05,190
Gimme my keys, Horace!

364
00:16:05,258 --> 00:16:06,992
I'm going to see my boss!

365
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,027
But, Peter, you're drunk!

366
00:16:09,095 --> 00:16:11,096
Horace?

367
00:16:11,164 --> 00:16:13,098
You're right.
This is more important.

368
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:18,704
Angela!

369
00:16:18,771 --> 00:16:22,007
Open up in there!

370
00:16:26,846 --> 00:16:28,680
Oh, my God!

371
00:16:35,388 --> 00:16:36,522
Angela!

372
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:41,793
- Angela, wake up!
- What the... Griffin?

373
00:16:41,861 --> 00:16:44,396
Angela, what the hell are you
doin' tryin' to kill yourself?

374
00:16:44,464 --> 00:16:47,232
Oh, why the hell did you
pull me out of there?

375
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,201
You shoulda just
left me alone!

376
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:51,270
That's how I'm gonna
end up, anyway.

377
00:16:51,337 --> 00:16:53,906
- What are you talkin' about?
- I'm talking about the fact

378
00:16:53,973 --> 00:16:55,674
that I have nothing
to live for.

379
00:16:55,742 --> 00:16:57,276
Sure, you do.

380
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:00,112
Someday, a white man's gonna
be elected president again.

381
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,615
Griffin, I haven't been with
anyone in ten years.

382
00:17:03,683 --> 00:17:05,517
And when you spurned
my advances,

383
00:17:05,585 --> 00:17:07,186
it was a wakeup call.

384
00:17:07,253 --> 00:17:09,421
No one's ever gonna
love me again.

385
00:17:09,489 --> 00:17:11,056
Wait a minute.

386
00:17:11,124 --> 00:17:13,759
So that's why you been actin'
like such a wacky ass around me?

387
00:17:13,826 --> 00:17:16,595
It's been so long since
I've been with a man,

388
00:17:16,663 --> 00:17:18,897
I don't even remember
what it feels like.

389
00:17:18,965 --> 00:17:20,899
I always imagined
it felt very painful.

390
00:17:20,967 --> 00:17:23,302
You just sorta grit your teeth
and let us do what we want.

391
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:27,039
I just wish one person was able
to find me attractive.

392
00:17:27,106 --> 00:17:32,044
- That's not too much to ask, is it?
- No...

393
00:17:32,111 --> 00:17:34,880
Look, Angela, I came
over here to punch you

394
00:17:34,948 --> 00:17:36,548
and maybe kick you
in the boob.

395
00:17:36,616 --> 00:17:38,183
But now I'm all
turned around.

396
00:17:38,251 --> 00:17:39,551
Angela?

397
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:40,485
- Angela?!
- Right here.

398
00:17:41,688 --> 00:17:43,855
Oh. But now all I want to do
is help you out.

399
00:17:43,923 --> 00:17:45,857
I'll tell you what,
you know that ritzy,

400
00:17:45,925 --> 00:17:47,492
upscale place over on Third?

401
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,094
- The Stuffy Fella?
- That's it.

402
00:17:49,162 --> 00:17:52,097
You be at the Stuffy Fella
tonight around 9:00.

403
00:17:52,165 --> 00:17:55,434
I think I know someone
who might be perfect for you.

404
00:18:03,743 --> 00:18:06,345
Mmm, well, hello.

405
00:18:06,412 --> 00:18:07,646
Good evening, sir.

406
00:18:07,714 --> 00:18:10,549
I am Reginald New York
Knickerbocker, millionaire.

407
00:18:11,718 --> 00:18:13,452
Are you serving fish
this evening?

408
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:14,653
No, sir.

409
00:18:14,721 --> 00:18:16,688
Then I believe
my guest has arrived.

410
00:18:16,756 --> 00:18:21,593
There she is!
You must be Angela.

411
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:23,729
Hi, are you Peter's friend,
Reginald?

412
00:18:23,796 --> 00:18:25,664
Mmm, indeed I am.

413
00:18:28,167 --> 00:18:31,803
Mmm, what a beautiful shade
of lipstick on those teeth.

414
00:18:31,871 --> 00:18:34,239
Oh, thank you, but that's
just my gums bleeding

415
00:18:34,307 --> 00:18:36,308
from aggressive gingivitis.

416
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:38,910
Mmm, well,
your mouth is too sweet

417
00:18:38,978 --> 00:18:40,679
for your teeth
to want to stay in.

418
00:18:40,747 --> 00:18:42,681
- Oh.
- Yes.

419
00:18:42,749 --> 00:18:44,549
Well, I... I'm just gonna
go to the powder room

420
00:18:44,617 --> 00:18:46,518
and freshen up.

421
00:18:46,586 --> 00:18:48,220
She's eatin' it up.

422
00:18:48,288 --> 00:18:51,189
This is easier than an American
finding his brother in China.

423
00:18:51,257 --> 00:18:52,858
Ron?

424
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:54,526
Ron, where are you?

425
00:18:54,594 --> 00:18:55,761
Over here, Paul!

426
00:18:55,828 --> 00:18:57,062
Oh, good, there you are.

427
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,363
It's pretty here.

428
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,564
Yes, it is.

429
00:19:05,071 --> 00:19:07,306
Mmm, what a
wonderful dinner.

430
00:19:07,373 --> 00:19:08,907
Would you like
some dessert?

431
00:19:08,975 --> 00:19:11,910
- Did you bake a pie?
- Well, there is a pie.

432
00:19:11,978 --> 00:19:14,212
It's been baking
since I met you.

433
00:19:14,332 --> 00:19:15,993
Mmm, gross.

434
00:19:16,016 --> 00:19:17,049
- What?
- Nothing.

435
00:19:17,116 --> 00:19:19,851
You know, Angela, there's
something I need to tell you.

436
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,721
My doctor has given me
twenty-four hours to live.

437
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:24,122
Oh, my God!

438
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,524
No, no, it's quite all right.

439
00:19:25,591 --> 00:19:29,394
Because I vowed to myself
that I would spend the last night of my life

440
00:19:29,462 --> 00:19:32,397
in the company of the most
beautiful woman in the world.

441
00:19:32,465 --> 00:19:34,766
And that's just what
I have done.

442
00:19:34,834 --> 00:19:38,270
- Oh, Reginald.
- No, no, no.

443
00:19:38,338 --> 00:19:40,739
This is already a perfect
end to a perfect evening.

444
00:19:40,807 --> 00:19:43,542
- Good night, my dear.
- Reginald...

445
00:19:43,609 --> 00:19:45,744
I want you
to make love to me.

446
00:19:45,812 --> 00:19:47,446
Oh, if only I could,

447
00:19:47,513 --> 00:19:50,315
but I must to a Jew to put
my affairs in order.

448
00:19:50,383 --> 00:19:52,651
I know what's
going on here.

449
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:54,252
You don't want to be with me.

450
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,654
You're just like everybody else.

451
00:19:55,722 --> 00:19:57,055
So... so go, then.

452
00:19:57,123 --> 00:19:59,791
I'm just gonna stay here
and kill myself.

453
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:02,094
But you can't kill yourself

454
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:03,695
every time somebody
won't sleep with you.

455
00:20:03,763 --> 00:20:04,930
I won't.

456
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:06,765
Just sleep with me just this once,

457
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,700
and it'll give me everything I need.

458
00:20:08,768 --> 00:20:10,202
Sleep with me tonight.

459
00:20:10,269 --> 00:20:12,137
Save my life.

460
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:19,678
Oh, that was fantastic!

461
00:20:19,746 --> 00:20:21,713
It was exactly
what I needed.

462
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:24,983
Mmm, well, hopefully there'll
be no more talk of suicide.

463
00:20:25,051 --> 00:20:28,387
Oh, no. I feel better
than I've felt in years.

464
00:20:28,454 --> 00:20:30,489
I have my confidence again.

465
00:20:30,556 --> 00:20:33,525
I'm ready to go back out there
and meet someone.

466
00:20:33,593 --> 00:20:35,527
Well, I'm glad to be of service.

467
00:20:35,595 --> 00:20:37,929
Oh, just one more thing
before you go.

468
00:20:37,997 --> 00:20:39,398
What's that, my dear?

469
00:20:39,465 --> 00:20:41,700
See you at work on
Monday, Griffin.

470
00:20:41,768 --> 00:20:43,869
Huh? Oh, I'm gonna
have to have a word

471
00:20:43,936 --> 00:20:46,505
with Rite-Aid about
this fake moustache.

472
00:20:49,509 --> 00:20:52,043
Well, I got my job back,
Angela's happy again,

473
00:20:52,111 --> 00:20:54,079
and she's not gonna
harass me anymore.

474
00:20:54,147 --> 00:20:55,547
Everything worked out perfect.

475
00:20:55,615 --> 00:20:56,782
Not really, Peter.

476
00:20:56,849 --> 00:20:58,250
Yeah, you cheated
on your wife.

477
00:20:58,317 --> 00:21:00,152
No, I didn't.
I used Mort.

478
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:02,020
Oh, my God,
I forgot about Mort!

479
00:21:03,256 --> 00:21:05,123
I want my two dollars!

480
00:21:05,186 --> 00:21:08,286
