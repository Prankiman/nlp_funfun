1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,000
Oh, my! Tomatoes are 3.99 a pound.
That's so high!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,700
Isn't that high? It seems so high.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,600
This is interminable! I demand to know why
you insist on taking me everywhere you go!

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,000
I mean, what could possibly happen
if you left me home by myself?

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,200
- Great party, Griff.
- Girls, you know Jimmy Caan.

6
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,700
- Jimmy, make yourself at home.
- Hey, thanks.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,700
I meant have a Cheez Doodle, but whatever.

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,400
Hm. Instant stuffing or instant
mashed potatoes? The choices are...

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,700
- Cleanup on aisle three! I got it!
- Peter, where's Chris?

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,700
I love you, She-Hulk.

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,300
Son, I'm gonna need those two hams back.

12
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,000
- I don't have any hams.
- Lift up your shirt, son.

13
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,400
I need an adult! I need an adult!

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,600
You're not a shoplifter. You're just a fat kid.
Sorry about that, fatty-fat-fatty.

15
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,100
Hey, Tom, he's just a fat kid! Aren't you,
fatty? You're just a big old fat kid.

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,200
- Here's some chocolate, fatso.
- Thanks!

17
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,700
- Hey, Brian, flea collars are on sale.
- Too many chemicals.

18
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,900
I'm gonna try a more natural alternative.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,800
Agh! Sorry, Dr Ling, I guess I'm nervous.
This whole thing is a little weird.

20
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,300
Never ye fear.
I've been doin' this all me life.

21
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,700
See, the reason your fleas are drawn to you
is your kidney energy is bein' blocked

22
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,700
by a dark chi, or what we call
in my country "wee-fung-chow-hu".

23
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,500
You have to keep those two boxes
right next to each other?

24
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,900
- Why? What do they say?
- I think we're through here.

25
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,700
It seems today that all you see

26
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,100
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

27
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,700
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

28
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,800
On which we used to rely?

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,100
Lucky there's a family guy

30
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,100
Lucky there's a man who positively
can do all the things that make us

31
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,700
Laugh and cry

32
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:05,000
He's a family guy

33
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,600
Attention, world leaders.
I have 137 nuclear warheads

34
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,400
trained on every capital city
around the globe.

35
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,900
The world is now under my control.
But oh, no! I'm naked!

36
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,300
What the deuce...? Agh! Fleas! Agh!

37
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,300
Damn you, Mop N' Glo.

38
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,400
Wake up, Leona! This decrepit Hooverville
is infested with something besides idiots!

39
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,600
Oh, my God! Stewie, you've got bugs
on your jammies! Peter, wake up.

40
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,100
- Wha-wha...?
- Stewie's covered with fleas!

41
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,500
Oh, that's nothin'. When I was a kid
I was covered with ticks.

42
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:57,000
- Peter, it's not a contest.
- Well, it was back then.

43
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,000
Oh, no. Brian!

44
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,600
Time for doggie to go the way of Old Yeller.

45
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,700
- Old Yeller, did I get a call from Tony?
- Oh, yeah.

46
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,800
He left a message. I forgot to tell you.

47
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,700
- Is it on the machine?
- I erased it.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,800
- All right, out back.
- No, Ma.

49
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,400
Yeller's my dog. I'll do it.

50
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,700
Oh, come on. He'll call back.

51
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,300
Ngh! Nngh!

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,400
- Brian, are you OK?
- OK? Ha-ha!

53
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,600
OK? I'm covered in fleas, lady.
I'm losin' it here.

54
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,700
- Get a hold of yourself!
- Ow! Peter, you're supposed to hit Brian!

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,200
- Dad, I'm itchy! I'm itchy!
- Out of my way, wide load!

56
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,400
Mom, there's fleas all over the house!

57
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,900
There's only one thing to do-learn the
language of the fleas, earn their trust,

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,900
then breed with their women.
In time our differences will be forgotten.

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,500
Call the damn exterminator!

60
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,400
We got a 602 at 31 Spooner Street!

61
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,700
- Logan, let's go.
- I can't.

62
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,200
I... I just can't.

63
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,200
- What's with you, Logan? You look like hell.
- He just watched his wife and kid

64
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,700
get carried away by seven million fire ants.

65
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,700
I don't wanna meet the man
who looks good after that.

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,100
My God. They're everywhere.

67
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,900
Yaaaagh!

68
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,400
- They're in the carpet!
- Got one over here!

69
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,200
It's no good! There's too many of 'em!

70
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,200
What do we do now?
What the hell do we do now?!

71
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,900
We pray.

72
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,900
- Logan! You son of a bitch!
- You think I'd miss this party?

73
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,900
I feel terrible about this. Why don't I put us
up in a nice hotel for a couple of days?

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,300
That's a great idea, Brian.
It'll be like a little vacation.

75
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,500
Well, you might wanna bring some cash,
cos some places don't take credit cards.

76
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,200
But mister, I need real money.
I can't take a credit card.

77
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,600
Oh, I see. Cash only, huh? No paper trail.
What are you sellin'? Reefer? Crack?

78
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,800
Smack? Horse? X? Shrooms? Dust? Meth?
In my neighbourhood? I don't think so!

79
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,500
Oh, my. What a lovely room.
Oh, and it's so clean.

80
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,800
The ultraviolet scanning light
will be the judge of that.

81
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,100
I picked this up on Dateline from
that yummy exoskeleton Maria Shriver.

82
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,800
Mm-hm. Just as I thought. Oatmeal.

83
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,200
Spittle. Semen!

84
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,600
This must be where Wilford Brimley
was strangled by Bob Crane.

85
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,300
Cannonball!

86
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,200
Jump in, honey. Don't be afraid.
The turtle will keep you safe.

87
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:30,700
Oh, for God's sake! I'm to entrust my life
to a turtle, nature's D student? Agh!

88
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,700
This is marvellous!
I feel like a young Johnny Weissmuller!

89
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,100
- Hey, Chris, aren't you comin' in?
- Can I swim with my shirt on?

90
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,800
No, you can't swim with your shirt on.
Wait a second. What are you hidin'?

91
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,800
Do you have bruises? Did somebody hit
you? Lois, what did you do to my son?

92
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,800
Will you keep your voice down?
You're embarrassin' him.

93
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,000
If I wanted to embarrass him,
I'd do somethin' like this.

94
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,500
Hey! Hey, everybody! Hey, look what
Chris Griffin's father Peter Griffin's doin'!

95
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,500
Ugh!

96
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,100
Stop it! Chris, why don't you
want to take your shirt off?

97
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,200
- Cos I'm fat.
- Oh, honey, no one thinks you're fat.

98
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,200
Sir, you can't park your van
on the diving board.

99
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,900
- This is my son.
- Oh. My apologies.

100
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,200
Hey, Tom! He's not a van! He's just a fat kid!

101
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,900
Don't listen to him, Chris.
I'm gonna go get you a soda. You wait here.

102
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,000
I say, hello! You there!
I'm ready to get out! Somebody!

103
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,100
Oh, my. What was that?

104
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,400
Well, hello, Mr Water Jet.

105
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,500
- Are you ready to...
- Go away!

106
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,100
You're not fat, Chris, you just
come from a long line of husky Griffins,

107
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,800
like your great-great-great-uncle
Jabba the Griffin.

108
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,900
Raja naba doua gola wookie nipple pinchie.

109
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,300
Honey, if you wanna lose weight,
I'll put you on a diet

110
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,700
and your father can help you exercise.

111
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,300
- Really?
- Why don't you do what supermodels do?

112
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,700
Stick your finger down your throat
and throw up till you're skinny.

113
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,600
Don't listen to your sister. Stickin' your finger
down your throat doesn't make you throw up.

114
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Peter, are you OK?

115
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,800
Meat loaf for us, and a very special, very
delicious steamed vegetable dish for Chris.

116
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,500
Oh, I hate vegetables!

117
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,000
- Honey, they're good for you.
- Oh!

118
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:47,000
It tastes like a monkey.
A monkey that's past its prime.

119
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,900
Mm! This meat loaf
is a symphony of flavour.

120
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,800
It's too bad you can't have some -
it's practically orgasmic!

121
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,500
Oh, yes! Yes!

122
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,500
Oh! Oh!

123
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,400
- Yes! Yes!
- I'll have what he's having.

124
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,100
OK, Chris, time for some good old-fashioned
exercise-like those guys are doin'.

125
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,700
I say, Phineas, great day
to be doing squat thrusts

126
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,200
and lifting our huge
triangular iron weights.

127
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,400
- Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup!
- Hup! Hup-hup! Hup! Hup!

128
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:22,700
Dad, I don't like running. The sound of
my thighs scraping together hurts my ears.

129
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:29,700
Hey, a Twinkie! A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
A-ha-ha! I'm gonna get you!

130
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,600
Come on! You can do it.
Feel the burn, Chris. Feel the burn.

131
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,500
Agh!

132
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,600
Attaboy. All the way upstream, buddy.

133
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,300
Agh! Agh! Aagh! Aagh! Agh!

134
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,100
OK, just relax.
Try to soil yourself, like we practised.

135
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,900
Dad, this says I gained weight.

136
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,500
That's impossible. Take off your shirt.

137
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,000
What the hell is that?

138
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,500
Bovine lummox! Oh!

139
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,400
Oh, God!

140
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,200
I tell ya, he's been workin' out
all week and he hasn't lost a pound.

141
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:23,700
Peter, if you're this desperate about Chris's
weight, why don't you just suck the fat out?

142
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,600
If you can find a hole on the boy that
you wanna put your lips on, be my guest.

143
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:33,400
I'm talkin' about liposuction.
My brother Broderick's a cosmetic surgeon.

144
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,900
Is he good?

145
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,500
Well, Nell Carter used to be twice as big
before Broderick got through with her.

146
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,300
FYI, he used the fat he took out of her
to make the two kids from Good Burger. 

147
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,700
This is a very safe procedure, son.
You won't feel a thing.

148
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm like a Green Beret, you know.
I sneak inside you and I skulk around

149
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,000
like it's Vietnam or somethin', and
I'm sneakin' through the bush, you know.

150
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,400
And I get all that fat, like the fat's my buddies
stuck behind enemy lines, you know.

151
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,500
And when I got all my buddies,
I sneak out again.

152
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,400
I'm very mysterious when I'm inside you,
you know, like a... like the wind, you know.

153
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,300
Oh, good boy, Stewie. Clean plate.
Although I think you got...

154
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,400
Yes, yes, I got more of it on me than in me.
Yes, that one never gets old, Lois.

155
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,700
Here's your dessert, sweetie. Dig in.

156
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,100
- I'll eat it when I'm ready.
- Hi!

157
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:33,200
I'm ready. Well, time for dessert, isn't it?
Let's see, big chocolate cake for Stewie,

158
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,600
and we have something very tasty
for big fat you. Bon appétit! 

159
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,200
Oh, and feel free to use my fork,
I shan't be needing it. Watch me.

160
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,400
That's it. Watch this.

161
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,800
Oh, Stewie! Stop eatin' like a little piggy!

162
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:52,700
We should cut down on your sweets-you're
gettin' a belly. Chris, where have you been?

163
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,600
Dad took me to a doctor to get
the fat vacuumed out of my belly.

164
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,300
- What?
- I didn't do it.

165
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,800
I'm just gonna stay on my diet and exercise.

166
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,000
Good for you. That was
a very grown-up decision.

167
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,300
I mean, what kinda lazy, narcissistic,
irresponsible moron would even consider

168
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:13,400
doing something as unbelievably foolish as
getting liposuction? Who, I ask you? Who?

169
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,100
Hello!

170
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,200
I... How... Wha...

171
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,500
My God, it's finally happened.

172
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,600
He's become so massive he's collapsed
into himself like a neutron star.

173
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,900
- Mom, can I get lipo too?
- Forget it, Meg.

174
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,400
Peter, you can't just suck 200Ibs of fat
out of yourself. It's not natural.

175
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,900
Come on. Lois, I feel great
droppin' that kind of weight all at once.

176
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,200
Like you felt after you had Chris.

177
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,100
And they're off!

178
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,600
Well, then, giddy-up.

179
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,200
A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

180
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,400
- Great to be thin.
- Yup.

181
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,500
You know, there's somethin'
I always wanted to do, Brian,

182
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,600
but, uh... I-I could never do it
cos I was so heavy.

183
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,500
But, you know, now that I don't
weigh so much, I think I can.

184
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,400
- Could you... could you help me do it, Brian?
- Sure. I'd be honoured.

185
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:23,000
I was wonderin' if I could put a little saddle
on your back and ride you like a horsy.

186
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,400
Oh, OK. No, I understand.
It's too much. It's OK.

187
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,600
I like Hillary Clinton, I don't care
what anyone says. Argh!

188
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
- Hyah! Hyah! Come on, Old Paint!
- I can feel the bones in your ass!

189
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,100
I see you!

190
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,400
But, Mom, it could change my life!

191
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,400
Meg, you're not gettin' plastic surgery.

192
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,800
Why not? It's totally safe.
A lot of famous people have done it.

193
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:05,000
Your place is here in the ice village. You
know nothing of Hollywood and its ways.

194
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,500
But, Father, I have dreams and courage and
the name of an excellent cosmetic surgeon.

195
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,100
Fear not, some day word will reach you
about the success of me,

196
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,200
the great Eskimo actor Jennifer Love Hewitt.

197
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,900
- Bring pride to our village!
- Send firewood!

198
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Plastic surgery is great! I was thinkin' about
havin' Broderick take a look at my nose.

199
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,400
It doesn't matter if your nose
is a little bulbousy,

200
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:34,600
or your eyes are too close together,
or your chest is flabby. You are who you are.

201
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,500
Huh. I think I know what you're gettin' at.

202
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,400
Knock, knock!

203
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,900
Hey, pal, you can't just walk in here...
Holy crap, it's Peter.

204
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,700
- Dad, you're pretty! Like a girl!
- You look like a totally different person.

205
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,900
Oh, this is crazy. You walk in here
with your chiselled jaw and your...

206
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Oh, my! I...

207
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,800
I liked you the way you were.
You're not even real any more. You're...

208
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:05,500
- Peter, did you get a new buttocks?
- I had to. My old one had a crack in it.

209
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,200
Well, I couldn't be more angry with you.

210
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,000
Ahhhhh!

211
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:15,500
You... you've really let this family down. We
should be embracin' the things God gave us,

212
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,200
not tellin' our kids a person's not as good as
someone else because of the way they look.

213
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,900
Agh! Holy crap!

214
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,500
Ow!

215
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,800
- There's a baby in that refuse bin.
- Not too close, Barnaby.

216
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,600
- If you touch it, the mother won't take it back.
- Allez-oop!

217
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,100
Excuse me, sir, what is a handsome man
like you doing waiting in line?

218
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,400
I need an adult! I need an adult!

219
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,000
Warren Fredericks, Quahog Beautiful
People's Club. Come on in front.

220
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,400
But all those people were in front of me.

221
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,800
You haven't been beautiful long, have you?

222
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,100
Gorgeous guys like us don't have to wait.
Haven't you noticed?

223
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,700
People will do anything
for a beautiful person.

224
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,200
Yeah. You know, come to think of it...

225
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,700
Hi. I'm on a scavenger hunt,
and I need a human foot.

226
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,600
Well, as a rule, I would say no,
but OK, come in.

227
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,200
So this is, what, for, like, a school project?

228
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,300
Argh! Argh! Agh! Agh!

229
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,200
Raul, please take this
handsome gentleman's bags to his car.

230
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,000
Thank you.

231
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,200
Hey, when you're beautiful,
doors magically open for you.

232
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,500
It opened because you stepped on
that black rubber square.

233
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,100
If that wasn't there, it would've
opened anyway cos you're beautiful.

234
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,700
Wow.

235
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,000
There's a lot of good-Iookin' people here.

236
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,500
This is the Beautiful People's Club,
and you're our newest member.

237
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,500
Here's your introductory basket.
It's got lotions, Ferrari sunglasses,

238
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:00,700
and pills to make your bowel movements
smell like bakery-fresh cinnamon rolls.

239
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,600
Argh! Dammit!

240
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,000
Oh, what happened? Orson fall down?

241
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,500
Shut up! Just... I don't want to hear it!

242
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,200
Serves you right. You tried to make Chris
jealous, now you have an eating disorder.

243
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,500
Just help me up.

244
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,900
I would, but my doctor
advised me against heavy lifting. 

245
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,200
Oh, ha-de-ha-ha!

246
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
What the... What the devil are you doing?
Stop it! Stop it, I'm getting dizzy!

247
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,100
Argh! Blast!

248
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,600
Did you paste a new picture of yourself
on our wedding portrait?

249
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,600
- Yeah. I think it looks better.
- You pasted it over me.

250
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,600
- Yeah. I think it looks better.
- Have you lost your mind?

251
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,200
- Well, somebody's jealous.
- Have you forgotten about Chris?

252
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,400
- He needs you to help him exercise.
- He figured out how to catch the Twinkie.

253
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,400
Ha-ha! I'm turnin' you into poo.

254
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,000
I'm goin' to the Beautiful People's
Club. I can take him with me.

255
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,100
Seein' us all might give him
somethin' to shoot for.

256
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,000
The Beautiful People's Club?
How come I never heard of it?

257
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:21,100
Lois, I can't say any more. I'm probably
already in trouble for mentioning it to a, uh...

258
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,800
Well, we call you "normies".

259
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,900
OK, bye.

260
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,400
Are you gonna take that?

261
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,700
- Lois!
- What? Oh. Brian. I was...

262
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,100
I was seeing if the, uh, driveway.

263
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,800
That wasn't a sentence.
You were ogling Peter like a horny schoolgirl.

264
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:47,800
Oh, I can't help it! I know, I know,
he's become a superficial, egomaniacal jerk.

265
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:53,700
But I've never been more attracted to him.
Does that make me a bad person?

266
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,900
Yes. Yes, it does make you a bad person.

267
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:03,700
Peter, good to see you. I've got a lot of tall,
statuesque people I want you to meet.

268
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,500
- What's that?
- Oh, that's my son Chris.

269
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,000
He can't come in. He's fat.

270
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:14,200
Well, let me tell you somethin', buddy.
If my son can't come in, then I'll just come in.

271
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,500
- See you at home.
- But Dad...

272
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,400
Trust me, Chris, sometimes
it's better not to fit in.

273
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,700
You're all stupid.
They're gonna be lookin' for army guys.

274
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,500
Don't look at me! I'm hideous!

275
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:37,500
How could you treat Chris that way? You
know he's self-conscious about his weight.

276
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,800
What you gettin' mad at me for?
He gets his fat from your genes.

277
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:45,000
- Which, by the way, I'm wearing.
- Oh, I hate what you've become!

278
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,400
Why don't you have that doctor
suck the fat outta your head?!

279
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,800
Maybe I will. Then I'll put it on my feet

280
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,200
and skate on Paul Bunyan's
giant skillet to cook his flapjacks!

281
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,600
- That doesn't make any sense.
- It doesn't have to. I'm beautiful!

282
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,500
You're not welcome here. Go away!

283
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,000
Wow, Chris, did you lose weight?

284
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,400
Maybe. I've been workin' out.

285
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,500
Well, you look wicked skinny.
I'm, like, jealous.

286
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,700
Thanks, Meg. I'm jealous of your moustache.

287
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,400
I don't have a moustache. Do I?

288
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,500
Oh, honey, it's fine.
It makes you look distinguished.

289
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,600
- But Mom...
- Meg, I think all my children are beautiful.

290
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:30,100
Damn you, ice cream. Come to my mouth.
How dare you disobey me?

291
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:36,200
What are you looking at,
you... you infantile, stupid...

292
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,700
That's right. Damn you and such.

293
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,200
You can... burn in hell.

294
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:50,700
She is so jealous. Of course - I'm beautiful.
I mean, look at me.

295
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,400
Oh... How strange...

296
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,500
Should... watch... road,
but... can't... look... away.

297
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,600
Too beautiful.

298
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,000
Well, Mr Griffin, the bandages
are ready to come off.

299
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,100
But I should tell you
it's a miracle you're alive at all.

300
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,800
We did all we can,
but medical science has come just so far.

301
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,700
And now I will take off
this protective Potato Head mask.

302
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,000
Oh, Peter, you look like you!

303
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:45,400
I can't believe you're all still standin'
by my side after what a jerk I was.

304
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,500
- Especially to you. I'm sorry, Chris.
- That's OK, Dad.

305
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,700
Well, Peter, I guess
you learned a pretty valuable lesson.

306
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,200
Nope.

307
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,700
