1
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,450
Attention, everyone,
mail call!

2
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,907
Meg, <i>Teen People</i>.
Chris, <i>Amazing Spiderman</i>.

3
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:19,942
Lois, <i>Redbook</i>.

4
00:00:19,952 --> 00:00:22,346
World War II Army Guy,
a letter from your gal.

5
00:00:22,934 --> 00:00:25,468
(Laughter, catcalls)
Open that one up, buddy.

6
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,308
All right,
at ease, at ease.

7
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:28,642
"Dear Willy,
it's been awful lonesome

8
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,277
since you've been away."

9
00:00:30,345 --> 00:00:31,612
Hey, you hear that, fellas?
She misses me!

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,281
(Good-natured ribbing)
Stewie: You're all wet.

11
00:00:35,684 --> 00:00:36,750
Hey, check this out.

12
00:00:36,818 --> 00:00:38,585
We got invited to a party.

13
00:00:38,653 --> 00:00:41,956
"Peter Griffin, you and your
family are cordially invited

14
00:00:42,023 --> 00:00:45,025
to a gala dinner in your honor
at Rocky Point Manor."

15
00:00:45,093 --> 00:00:47,061
What? What are they
honoring you for?

16
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:49,063
Who cares? It says here
it's for the whole weekend.

17
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,230
And it's free.

18
00:00:50,298 --> 00:00:51,632
Well, who's
the invitation from?

19
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,000
I don't know,
it doesn't say.

20
00:00:53,068 --> 00:00:54,335
Wait, you're not
gonna go, are you?

21
00:00:54,402 --> 00:00:55,836
It's clearly
some kind of scam.

22
00:00:55,904 --> 00:00:58,172
Oh, well, then maybe we just go,
and you go to the kennel.

23
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,640
Oh, not the kennel.

24
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:01,709
Last time you left me
there for an hour.

25
00:01:01,776 --> 00:01:03,777
Or ten years, I don't know...
There's no clock there!

26
00:01:03,845 --> 00:01:05,446
You stink when
you come out of there.

27
00:01:06,948 --> 00:01:08,682
(Engine starts)

28
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,660

30
00:02:57,459 --> 00:02:59,693
Dad, are we almost there?

31
00:02:59,761 --> 00:03:01,462
Yeah. According to the map,
we're pretty close.

32
00:03:03,665 --> 00:03:06,200
(Gasps)
Peter, look!

33
00:03:51,846 --> 00:03:53,680
(Waves crashing)

34
00:04:00,321 --> 00:04:04,525
My God, this is
absolutely beautiful.

35
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:07,361
I bet Jeff Probst
has a house like this.

36
00:04:10,465 --> 00:04:12,499
- Joe?
- Peter?

37
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:14,134
What the hell are
you guys doing here?

38
00:04:14,202 --> 00:04:17,171
Well, we got an invitation
to a dinner in my honor.

39
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:20,240
I assumed it was for all
those arrests I made last month.

40
00:04:20,308 --> 00:04:22,743
That's weird. My invitation
said it was in <i>my</i> honor.

41
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,978
I assumed it was for being
able to fart the alphabet,

42
00:04:25,046 --> 00:04:27,314
which I almost did
till I pooped on the "S."

43
00:04:27,382 --> 00:04:29,216
Oh, well. Everybody
on the bus was upset

44
00:04:29,284 --> 00:04:30,684
long before
that anyway.

45
00:04:32,687 --> 00:04:33,487
What the...

46
00:04:36,558 --> 00:04:37,958
Derek and Jillian?

47
00:04:38,026 --> 00:04:39,860
Wow!
Hi, Brian!

48
00:04:39,928 --> 00:04:40,994
Hey, kiddo.

49
00:04:41,062 --> 00:04:42,462
What... What are
you guys doing here?

50
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,831
I got a card that says
they're throwing a dinner

51
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:46,400
in my "honer."

52
00:04:46,467 --> 00:04:47,668
Wait a minute, what the
hell's going on here?

53
00:04:47,735 --> 00:04:49,403
Everybody got the
same invitation?

54
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,739
Muriel, if you're not gonna eat
your half of the cheeseburger,

55
00:04:52,807 --> 00:04:55,275
I'll see if they have a freezer,
so I can keep it nice.

56
00:04:55,343 --> 00:04:58,145
I'm gonna walk around.
I think my vagina's asleep.

57
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:08,589
Oh. Hey.
Uh...

58
00:05:08,656 --> 00:05:10,524
Didn't think I'd see
anyone I knew here.

59
00:05:10,592 --> 00:05:13,060
This, uh,
this is Stephanie.

60
00:05:13,127 --> 00:05:15,229
Hi, everybody!
Oh, my gosh!

61
00:05:15,296 --> 00:05:17,898
I never thought I'd
meet Glenn's friends!

62
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:19,733
Yeah, I figured,
why not?

63
00:05:19,801 --> 00:05:22,703
You know, you... we... You and I
see each other from time to time.

64
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,740
Oh, my God, we, like,
never see each other! This guy!

65
00:05:26,808 --> 00:05:29,243
You, like, disappear for a month,
and then you call me?!

66
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,444
So silly!

67
00:05:30,511 --> 00:05:33,447
You're lucky
I like you so much.

68
00:05:33,514 --> 00:05:36,149
Okay, why don't you go
ahead and take the bags in.

69
00:05:36,217 --> 00:05:39,152
Wow, it... It looks like
the whole town got invited.

70
00:05:47,695 --> 00:05:49,396
(Ice cream truck music plays)

71
00:06:12,186 --> 00:06:14,021
(With thick accent):
Mr. Peter.

72
00:06:14,088 --> 00:06:15,689
Mr. Joe.

73
00:06:15,757 --> 00:06:17,024
Mr. Bonnie.

74
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:18,992
She doesn't know
what "Mr." means.

75
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,494
Mr. Mort.

76
00:06:20,561 --> 00:06:22,429
Mr. Muriel.

77
00:06:22,497 --> 00:06:24,064
Mayor West Mr.

78
00:06:24,132 --> 00:06:25,766
Oh, my God, seriously.

79
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:28,869
If you will all please
follow me to third floor,

80
00:06:28,936 --> 00:06:30,837
I show you
to your rooms.

81
00:06:30,905 --> 00:06:34,107
You are all expected
for dinner at 8:00.

82
00:06:34,175 --> 00:06:35,609
Stephanie:
Oh, good! I'm starved!

83
00:06:35,677 --> 00:06:37,411
Quagmire:
Settle down, will ya?

84
00:06:57,865 --> 00:06:59,399
None of this makes any sense.

85
00:06:59,467 --> 00:07:02,336
Everyone got invitations
from an anonymous source

86
00:07:02,403 --> 00:07:03,770
for a dinner in their honor,

87
00:07:03,838 --> 00:07:05,272
when that's clearly
not the case.

88
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,186
Now we're here,
where the hell's our host?

89
00:07:07,196 --> 00:07:09,716
Well, at least you all had
eveningwear provided for you.

90
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,511
I thought this was
going to be a lawn party.

91
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:13,813
I don't have
one pair of long pants.

92
00:07:13,881 --> 00:07:16,850
Boy, it's kinda awkward seeing
Jillian here with Derek.

93
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:18,117
I wonder if she's
thinking about me.

94
00:07:18,185 --> 00:07:20,420
I don't know, are you
a pony or the color blue?

95
00:07:20,488 --> 00:07:22,422
(Laughs)

96
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,756
Derek, look!

97
00:07:23,824 --> 00:07:25,525
Ha, how do you
like that?

98
00:07:25,593 --> 00:07:28,394
Have you guys ever seen
Jim Henson's <i>Labyrinth</i>?

99
00:07:28,462 --> 00:07:30,096
No. Have you ever seen
the Channel Five News?

100
00:07:30,164 --> 00:07:31,631
No.

101
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:33,933
Uh, <i>Labyrinth</i> has teenage
Jennifer Connelly.

102
00:07:34,001 --> 00:07:37,136
Channel Five News has file
footage of pills being sorted.

103
00:07:37,204 --> 00:07:39,472
Some people think
Jennifer Connelly's old now,

104
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,841
and that her hands look
like two bags of snakes.

105
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:43,009
I think that's bogus.

106
00:07:43,077 --> 00:07:44,611
I don't think we
have much in common.

107
00:07:44,678 --> 00:07:47,380
Good heavens, Meg,
you're sprouting up like a weed!

108
00:07:47,448 --> 00:07:49,249
I know,
she's growing every day.

109
00:07:49,316 --> 00:07:51,150
Meg, you remember Dr. Hartman.

110
00:07:51,218 --> 00:07:54,354
Of course she does! I performed
her very first pelvic exam!

111
00:07:54,421 --> 00:07:57,624
Unless I'm confusing you
with someone else.

112
00:07:57,691 --> 00:08:00,193
Nope. That was...
That was you.

113
00:08:00,261 --> 00:08:02,328
(Footsteps descending staircase)

114
00:08:10,971 --> 00:08:12,372
Good evening, everyone.

115
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:14,741
(Gasps)
James Woods!

116
00:08:14,808 --> 00:08:16,342
(Growls)

117
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,845
Thank you for joining me
at my humble manor.

118
00:08:18,913 --> 00:08:22,181
I'd like to introduce you to
my lovely companion, Pricilla.

119
00:08:22,249 --> 00:08:23,349
Nice to meet you all.

120
00:08:23,417 --> 00:08:24,551
Who's he?

121
00:08:24,618 --> 00:08:25,685
James Woods.

122
00:08:25,753 --> 00:08:27,487
Oh, I thought
he was a shark.

123
00:08:27,555 --> 00:08:29,322
No, he was a on a
show called <i>Shark.</i>

124
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,990
But he's made of wood?

125
00:08:31,058 --> 00:08:33,760
No, his last name is Woods,
but he's not made of wood.

126
00:08:33,827 --> 00:08:34,661
Nobody is.

127
00:08:36,397 --> 00:08:41,167
This truly is a night to celebrate,
especially for me.

128
00:08:41,235 --> 00:08:42,869
Hey, what's
going on here, Woods?

129
00:08:42,937 --> 00:08:45,171
The invitation said this
was a dinner in my honor.

130
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:46,539
That's what mine said, too.

131
00:08:46,607 --> 00:08:48,374
- Yeah, me, too!
- Mine, too.
- Same here!

132
00:08:48,442 --> 00:08:49,709
Stephanie:
Where's the food?

133
00:08:49,777 --> 00:08:52,245
Well, actually,
this dinner honors all of you.

134
00:08:52,313 --> 00:08:53,947
Where should I begin?

135
00:08:54,014 --> 00:08:57,383
You see, recently I've become
a born-again Christian.

136
00:08:57,451 --> 00:09:00,653
Thanks to this
beautiful little angel.

137
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:03,089
She came into my life
as if out of nowhere,

138
00:09:03,157 --> 00:09:05,592
enchanted me beyond
my wildest dreams,

139
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:08,361
and opened my eyes
to the cleansing truth

140
00:09:08,429 --> 00:09:10,330
of Jesus Christ's love.

141
00:09:10,397 --> 00:09:12,565
No, honey,
it was always within you.

142
00:09:12,633 --> 00:09:13,933
I just helped you find it.

143
00:09:14,001 --> 00:09:17,170
Um... What does all this gay
stuff have to do with us?

144
00:09:17,237 --> 00:09:19,572
Well, the fact of the matter is,
I have wronged

145
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,375
each and every
one of you in some way.

146
00:09:22,443 --> 00:09:26,346
And, since I am a man of God now,
I am truly repentant.

147
00:09:26,413 --> 00:09:29,148
Woods: So, I invited you all
here to make amends.

148
00:09:29,216 --> 00:09:30,984
And why the hell
should we trust you?

149
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:33,286
Yeah, you've been terrorizing
our family for years.

150
00:09:33,354 --> 00:09:36,723
I understand that there is
some healing to do here tonight,

151
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,958
and I am prepared to be patient.

152
00:09:39,026 --> 00:09:42,195
Please, won't you just
give me a chance?

153
00:09:42,262 --> 00:09:44,697
And I promise you
won't be disappointed.

154
00:09:44,765 --> 00:09:47,500
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'll just go check on dinner.

155
00:09:47,534 --> 00:09:48,801
Oh, I'll help you, sweetheart.

156
00:09:52,606 --> 00:09:54,340
This is all very strange.

157
00:09:54,408 --> 00:09:56,242
I agree.
Something's not right.

158
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,878
I don't know, maybe we
should give him a chance.

159
00:09:58,946 --> 00:10:00,713
Maybe he really is born again.

160
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:02,115
Well, he could be.

161
00:10:02,182 --> 00:10:04,484
It all depends on what
his astrological sign is.

162
00:10:04,551 --> 00:10:07,487
Shut up. Shut up.
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

163
00:10:07,554 --> 00:10:09,322
I'm very intuitive
with these things.

164
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,759
Maybe if I sit in his chair,
I can get a reading on his energy.

165
00:10:12,826 --> 00:10:15,728
I mean, if he's an Aquarius,
a rebirth would not be unexpected.

166
00:10:15,796 --> 00:10:17,296
That's enough, Stephanie.

167
00:10:17,364 --> 00:10:19,232
Stephanie: You know, it's like
when I did Glenn's star chart...

168
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,737
(All gasp)

169
00:10:24,805 --> 00:10:28,975
Did the...
Did the cork hit me?

170
00:10:29,043 --> 00:10:30,276
(All screaming)

171
00:10:32,112 --> 00:10:34,380
My God.
She's dead.

172
00:10:34,448 --> 00:10:35,982
She's been shot!

173
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,717
(All gasp)

174
00:10:37,785 --> 00:10:39,786
I can't help feeling
this would be sadder

175
00:10:39,853 --> 00:10:41,421
if she wasn't heavy.

176
00:10:46,845 --> 00:10:48,879
Oh, my God.
It was him!

177
00:10:48,947 --> 00:10:51,749
It was James Woods!
He killed Stephanie!

178
00:10:51,816 --> 00:10:54,618
Jeez, I knew he was crazy,
but I didn't think he was a murderer!

179
00:10:54,686 --> 00:10:57,121
Oh, he must've brought
us here to kill us all!

180
00:10:57,188 --> 00:10:58,856
Run! Run for your lives!

181
00:11:01,576 --> 00:11:03,032
Quick! We got to
get out of here!

182
00:11:07,065 --> 00:11:08,265
(Thunder cracks)

183
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,134
Come on,
get in the car!

184
00:11:17,742 --> 00:11:19,543
(Thunder rumbling)

185
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,013
(Yelling)

186
00:11:23,081 --> 00:11:24,815
(Brakes screeching)

187
00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:29,887
Oh, my God, Peter,
back it up!

188
00:11:29,954 --> 00:11:31,155
Oh, really, Lois?

189
00:11:31,222 --> 00:11:32,556
I thought I might
drive forward.

190
00:11:32,624 --> 00:11:34,358
I thought that... that might
be a fun thing to do.

191
00:11:34,425 --> 00:11:35,559
Stop fighting!

192
00:11:35,627 --> 00:11:36,927
(Metal creaking)

193
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,493
Oh, my God! Quick, Peter,
get in the back!

194
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,371
(Engine revving,
tires squealing)

195
00:11:47,438 --> 00:11:49,039
(Loud thudding)

196
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:54,901
Oh, thank God.
We made it.

197
00:11:54,913 --> 00:11:56,510
Oh! Aah!

198
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:58,142
Ow! My neck!

199
00:11:58,165 --> 00:12:00,690
You backed into me,
and... and now... Oh!

200
00:12:00,702 --> 00:12:01,747
Muriel:
And your back!

201
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:04,577
And my back!
My back, yes! Oh!

202
00:12:04,697 --> 00:12:07,457
(Thunder rumbling)

203
00:12:09,205 --> 00:12:11,373
All right, it looks like
we're stuck here.

204
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:14,243
Storm has flooded the causeway,
and the bridge is destroyed.

205
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,712
For the moment,
there's no way out.

206
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,013
<i>No Way Out.</i> Great film.

207
00:12:18,081 --> 00:12:19,648
Sean Young naked in the limo?

208
00:12:19,716 --> 00:12:20,849
What are we gonna do?

209
00:12:20,917 --> 00:12:22,184
We can't just stay here

210
00:12:22,252 --> 00:12:24,119
with James Woods lurking
somewhere in the house!

211
00:12:24,187 --> 00:12:25,921
All right, does anyone have
a cell phone?

212
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,991
I'm not getting
any reception!

213
00:12:29,058 --> 00:12:30,526
- Me neither!
- No bars!

214
00:12:30,593 --> 00:12:31,894
It's all right.

215
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:33,695
I'll put a message
in a bottle.

216
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,568
Now... we wait.

217
00:12:39,636 --> 00:12:41,670
Look, he's got a land line
we can use!

218
00:12:41,738 --> 00:12:44,306
Oh, no. You know,
I wouldn't feel right about that.

219
00:12:44,374 --> 00:12:46,275
We're guests,
and it's long distance.

220
00:12:46,342 --> 00:12:47,509
Doesn't matter.

221
00:12:47,577 --> 00:12:48,911
The line's dead.

222
00:12:48,978 --> 00:12:50,846
(Panicked, overlapping chatter)

223
00:12:52,115 --> 00:12:53,415
Whoa, whoa, whoa, all right.

224
00:12:53,483 --> 00:12:55,717
Look, everybody but Chris,
just keep your pants on

225
00:12:55,785 --> 00:12:57,820
and let's figure a way out of this.

226
00:12:57,887 --> 00:12:59,855
He's right.
We just got to stay calm.

227
00:12:59,923 --> 00:13:01,356
With a killer in the house?!

228
00:13:01,424 --> 00:13:02,891
Killer in the <i>house...!</i>

229
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,027
Hey, guys,
has anybody seen James?

230
00:13:05,094 --> 00:13:07,329
Sweetheart, you may want
to sit down for this.

231
00:13:07,397 --> 00:13:09,698
Who want little tiny tacos?

232
00:13:09,766 --> 00:13:12,267
Ooh, little taco.
I'll have one of those.

233
00:13:12,335 --> 00:13:13,602
(All gasping)
It's him!

234
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,837
Sorry I took so long.

235
00:13:14,904 --> 00:13:16,405
I was going to the bathroom,

236
00:13:16,473 --> 00:13:18,574
and I just couldn't stop
looking at my penis,

237
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:20,008
'cause it's, you know,
so fantastic.

238
00:13:20,076 --> 00:13:21,777
You're a monster...
Yeah, I heard it's fantastic.

239
00:13:21,845 --> 00:13:23,245
You're a monster, James Woods!

240
00:13:23,313 --> 00:13:25,781
You think you can just commit
murder and get away with it?!

241
00:13:25,849 --> 00:13:27,015
Quagmire loved that girl!

242
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,116
Quagmire:
Easy.

243
00:13:28,184 --> 00:13:29,418
Murder?

244
00:13:29,486 --> 00:13:30,686
Wha... What are you
talking about?

245
00:13:30,753 --> 00:13:33,021
You're going away
for a long time, pal.

246
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:34,323
Jimmy,
what does he mean?

247
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,358
Look, I honestly don't know
what's going on here.

248
00:13:36,426 --> 00:13:37,593
Oh, really?

249
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,428
Well, maybe that dead pile
of cookie dough

250
00:13:39,496 --> 00:13:41,196
in the next room
will refresh your memory.

251
00:13:41,264 --> 00:13:42,431
What do you mean?

252
00:13:42,499 --> 00:13:44,800
There's nothing
in the next room.

253
00:13:49,973 --> 00:13:51,707
(Gasps)
It's gone!

254
00:13:51,774 --> 00:13:53,876
Where is she, Woods?
What'd you do with the body?

255
00:13:53,943 --> 00:13:55,210
What body?

256
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:56,812
You know,
maybe she wasn't dead.

257
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,348
I'll admit it, I'm... I'm not great
with that stuff sometimes.

258
00:13:59,415 --> 00:14:01,316
All right, I don't know
what's happening here,

259
00:14:01,384 --> 00:14:02,985
but look,
I'm a lot of things.

260
00:14:03,052 --> 00:14:05,387
A member of Mensa,
a huge hit with the ladies,

261
00:14:05,455 --> 00:14:07,523
someone who, you know,
would have broken out bigger

262
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,358
if he weren't so impossible
to work with.

263
00:14:09,425 --> 00:14:10,592
Right. But a murderer?

264
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,694
I only just found God.

265
00:14:12,762 --> 00:14:15,063
Why would I jeopardize
my entrance into heaven?

266
00:14:15,131 --> 00:14:16,999
If I were you,
I'd keep your mouth shut

267
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:18,333
till you talk to a lawyer.

268
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:20,335
I didn't kill anybody!

269
00:14:20,403 --> 00:14:21,527
(Thunder rumbling,
electrical hiss)

270
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:22,384
(All gasping)

271
00:14:22,396 --> 00:14:24,052
Peter:
Oh my God.

272
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,588
Is this what black people see
all the time?

273
00:14:26,609 --> 00:14:28,610
(Stabbing, grunt, thud)

274
00:14:28,678 --> 00:14:30,312
(People screaming)

275
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,613
(Electrical hiss)

276
00:14:31,681 --> 00:14:33,170
(Gasps)
Look!

277
00:14:33,193 --> 00:14:35,551
(Screaming)

278
00:14:38,214 --> 00:14:39,154
He's dead.

279
00:14:39,222 --> 00:14:40,556
Oh, my God!

280
00:14:40,623 --> 00:14:41,823
Nice.

281
00:14:41,891 --> 00:14:43,258
Nobody touch the knife!

282
00:14:43,326 --> 00:14:45,127
There could be
fingerprints on it.

283
00:14:45,194 --> 00:14:47,429
So James Woods
murdered Stephanie,

284
00:14:47,497 --> 00:14:48,864
and then he
murdered himself.

285
00:14:48,932 --> 00:14:50,165
Criss-cross.

286
00:14:50,233 --> 00:14:51,633
No, Peter.
Don't you see?

287
00:14:51,701 --> 00:14:54,169
He didn't kill himself,
and he didn't kill Stephanie.

288
00:14:54,237 --> 00:14:55,571
What are you saying?

289
00:14:55,638 --> 00:14:58,373
I'm saying, James Woods
isn't the murderer.

290
00:14:58,441 --> 00:15:00,342
The murderer...

291
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,177
is one of us!

292
00:15:02,245 --> 00:15:03,612
(All gasping)

293
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,815
And someone ate the last
goat cheese tartlet.

294
00:15:06,883 --> 00:15:08,450
(All expressing outrage)

295
00:15:08,518 --> 00:15:10,252
Now I hope I die next.

296
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:15,198
(Thunder cracks)

297
00:15:18,803 --> 00:15:19,570
Okay, everyone,

298
00:15:19,617 --> 00:15:21,518
it's important that
we all stay calm.

299
00:15:21,586 --> 00:15:23,253
How are we supposed
to stay calm?!

300
00:15:23,321 --> 00:15:24,588
There's a killer
in the room!

301
00:15:24,655 --> 00:15:26,289
We all got to get out of here!

302
00:15:26,357 --> 00:15:27,390
We're all gonna die!

303
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,359
Mr. Mayor,
pull yourself together!

304
00:15:29,427 --> 00:15:30,627
(China breaking)

305
00:15:30,695 --> 00:15:32,829
Wait a minute.
Joe, look!

306
00:15:43,508 --> 00:15:44,875
Oh, my God.

307
00:15:44,942 --> 00:15:46,710
Stephanie was an accident.

308
00:15:46,777 --> 00:15:48,111
That's a way of putting it.

309
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:49,479
What do you mean, Joe?

310
00:15:49,547 --> 00:15:52,015
This gun was timed to fire
directly at that chair,

311
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,650
where James Woods
would have been sitting.

312
00:15:53,718 --> 00:15:54,985
But he left,

313
00:15:55,052 --> 00:15:56,887
and Stephanie was
in the wrong place

314
00:15:56,954 --> 00:15:58,154
at the wrong time.

315
00:15:58,222 --> 00:15:59,689
So whoever the murderer is,

316
00:15:59,757 --> 00:16:02,526
they were after James Woods,
not Stephanie.

317
00:16:02,593 --> 00:16:04,461
The question is,

318
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:06,997
who here wanted
James Woods dead?

319
00:16:13,337 --> 00:16:16,106
Let's look around and see
if we can find any more clues.

320
00:16:24,835 --> 00:16:27,537
Oh, my God.

321
00:16:29,136 --> 00:16:30,496
Brian, I feel like
everyone's wondering

322
00:16:30,563 --> 00:16:31,764
why I'm wearing shorts.

323
00:16:31,831 --> 00:16:33,093
Nobody's even
looking at you.

324
00:16:33,105 --> 00:16:33,832
That's what I mean.

325
00:16:33,843 --> 00:16:35,605
The fact that
no one has said anything

326
00:16:35,616 --> 00:16:37,798
makes it even more obvious
that everyone has noticed.

327
00:16:37,822 --> 00:16:39,243
Peter:
Brian, look what I found!

328
00:16:39,254 --> 00:16:40,264
Check it out!

329
00:16:40,288 --> 00:16:42,342
I'm a robot from outer space!

330
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,524
Hang on. I'm coming down.

331
00:16:43,592 --> 00:16:45,759
Go, go, gadget skis!

332
00:16:45,827 --> 00:16:47,661
(Metal clanking)

333
00:16:49,257 --> 00:16:50,698
(China breaking,
Joe groans)

334
00:16:51,123 --> 00:16:52,299
Uh-oh.

335
00:16:52,885 --> 00:16:55,469
All right, since it's my fault
that Joe got knocked out,

336
00:16:55,537 --> 00:16:58,739
it is now my responsibility
to take over the investigation.

337
00:16:58,807 --> 00:17:00,507
I... I don't know if
that actually follows.

338
00:17:00,575 --> 00:17:01,942
Oh, it does follow, Brian.

339
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:05,045
Because I'm the one
with the giant magnifying glass.

340
00:17:05,113 --> 00:17:06,714
- Is my eye big?
- Yeah.

341
00:17:06,781 --> 00:17:09,717
Good. Good.
That means progress.

342
00:17:09,784 --> 00:17:11,552
All right, let's... Let's figure out
what we know here.

343
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,821
The gun was clearly meant
to kill James Woods,

344
00:17:13,888 --> 00:17:15,689
but Stephanie got in the way.

345
00:17:15,757 --> 00:17:17,458
So the murderer had to improvise

346
00:17:17,525 --> 00:17:19,393
and finish the job
by stabbing him.

347
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:22,296
Now who here had a motive
for wanting James Woods dead?

348
00:17:22,364 --> 00:17:24,565
Well, according to
James Woods, we all did.

349
00:17:24,633 --> 00:17:26,967
He brought us here
to make amends with us.

350
00:17:27,035 --> 00:17:29,703
But he wronged one of us
enough to want revenge.

351
00:17:29,771 --> 00:17:31,972
The question is, who?

352
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,108
Well, I know one person
who could have.

353
00:17:34,175 --> 00:17:36,010
My partner Tom.

354
00:17:36,077 --> 00:17:37,211
(All gasp)

355
00:17:37,278 --> 00:17:38,512
All right, it's true.

356
00:17:38,632 --> 00:17:40,661
James Woods ruined my career!

357
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,410
I originally wanted
to be an actor.

358
00:17:42,422 --> 00:17:44,665
And I booked the lead role
in <i>Nightmare on Elm Street.</i>

359
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,654
But James Woods said,
"No, don't bother.

360
00:17:46,721 --> 00:17:48,088
Something else will come along."

361
00:17:48,156 --> 00:17:49,406
So I turned it down.

362
00:17:49,418 --> 00:17:52,072
And now this Robert Englund
is the talk of the town.

363
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,061
That should be me
everyone's talking about!

364
00:17:54,129 --> 00:17:55,766
Was I angry?
Yes, of course!

365
00:17:55,789 --> 00:17:56,697
But I didn't kill him!

366
00:17:57,146 --> 00:17:58,212
What about Seamus?

367
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,360
You hated James Woods.
You told me so!

368
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:04,435
Aye. He's the one
who made me what I am today.

369
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:05,507
(Sighs)

370
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:08,630
I wish you were a real,
live ornery sea captain.

371
00:18:08,783 --> 00:18:10,150
But he didn't
wish hard enough!

372
00:18:10,217 --> 00:18:11,651
It only worked
on me head!

373
00:18:11,719 --> 00:18:12,819
Oh, my God,
seriously?

374
00:18:12,887 --> 00:18:14,454
No. Actually,
I was a normal guy

375
00:18:14,522 --> 00:18:16,089
until one night,
we dropped acid together,

376
00:18:16,157 --> 00:18:17,724
and he thought
I was a steak.

377
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:19,359
Grilled me,
ate me arms and legs.

378
00:18:19,427 --> 00:18:21,761
It was a whole thing.
But I'm not the killer!

379
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:22,925
What about the mayor?

380
00:18:22,949 --> 00:18:25,265
He could have killed him
and got himself off scot-free!

381
00:18:25,332 --> 00:18:26,166
(Sighs)

382
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:28,501
He took the Twitter name
MayorWest,

383
00:18:28,569 --> 00:18:32,005
so now I have
to use Mayor_West.

384
00:18:32,073 --> 00:18:34,107
That rat-faced cracker!

385
00:18:34,175 --> 00:18:36,342
But you hated him, too,
Dr. Hartman.

386
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,378
Sure, I hated him,
but so did Mort.

387
00:18:38,446 --> 00:18:40,914
I didn't kill him!
Maybe it was Diane.

388
00:18:40,981 --> 00:18:41,927
(Sighs)

389
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,684
James Woods promised
to introduce me to Dan Rather.

390
00:18:44,752 --> 00:18:47,220
But instead, he introduced me
to Danny Bonaduce.

391
00:18:47,288 --> 00:18:50,123
I tell you, that guy looks
like a dog turning thirty.

392
00:18:50,191 --> 00:18:51,891
But what about the old guy?

393
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:54,494
I heard him complaining
about Woods in the dining room.

394
00:18:54,562 --> 00:18:55,425
That's true.

395
00:18:55,448 --> 00:18:58,698
He replaced my Cialis
with methamphetamines!

396
00:18:59,358 --> 00:19:02,218
- Pedal faster!
- I can't go any faster!

397
00:19:02,235 --> 00:19:03,250
Where you going, kids?

398
00:19:03,251 --> 00:19:04,648
Hey, I just want
to talk to you.

399
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,717
Why don't you come
over to my place

400
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,238
for a glass of wine and
a couple of fruit pies,

401
00:19:07,262 --> 00:19:08,213
and then we can go
in the back room

402
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:10,678
and play crazy snake.
Hee-hee-hee!

403
00:19:10,821 --> 00:19:12,622
And what about Quagmire?

404
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:15,058
Fine! So he stole
Cheryl Tiegs from me!

405
00:19:15,126 --> 00:19:16,493
He ruined your TV pilot!

406
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,595
Go to hell! I backed out
of that project willingly.

407
00:19:18,663 --> 00:19:19,896
Oh, yeah, that's what
every hack says.

408
00:19:19,964 --> 00:19:21,064
- You know, Brian...
- I'm telling you...

409
00:19:21,132 --> 00:19:24,034
(All yelling angrily
at each other)

410
00:19:31,642 --> 00:19:33,076
(All stop yelling)

411
00:19:35,646 --> 00:19:37,480
(All gasp)

412
00:19:39,116 --> 00:19:40,884
Stewie:
Eh. My secret room's bigger.

413
00:19:40,952 --> 00:19:42,719
Herbert:
Mine's smaller.

414
00:19:44,922 --> 00:19:46,122
All right, stand back.

415
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,024
This could be dangerous.

416
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:53,930
Peter: Oh, laundry room.
Laundry room, everybody.

417
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,468
Oh, see, here we go.

418
00:20:32,267 --> 00:20:35,493
Aha! James Woods made
a list of all his misdeeds

419
00:20:35,511 --> 00:20:36,812
so he could make amends.

420
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:38,647
Bonnie, he punched you
in the throat,

421
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:40,019
and that's why
you sound like that?

422
00:20:40,057 --> 00:20:43,821
No, he punched me in the throat
<i>because</i> I sound like this.

423
00:20:43,941 --> 00:20:45,230
And Consuela, he...

424
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,083
Actually, I can't read
his handwriting here.

425
00:20:47,095 --> 00:20:48,031
What... What happened?

426
00:20:48,034 --> 00:20:50,367
One day, I bring
my nephew to work,

427
00:20:50,434 --> 00:20:54,668
and he molest my nephew,
and my nephew... He only fourteen,

428
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,542
and he cry, and then,
he shoot himself in the face.

429
00:20:59,182 --> 00:21:00,644
What are all these?

430
00:21:00,955 --> 00:21:03,480
God, there are tons
of OxyContin bottles in here.

431
00:21:03,885 --> 00:21:05,916
All prescribed to James Woods.

432
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,984
And all from Goldman's Pharmacy.

433
00:21:08,052 --> 00:21:09,519
What's that all about,
Goldman?

434
00:21:09,587 --> 00:21:11,388
I don't know what
you're talking about.

435
00:21:11,455 --> 00:21:14,491
James Woods never bought
anything in my pharmacy. Ever.

436
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,992
Peter:
Yes, he did.

437
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,728
Says here he talked Muriel
into selling him OxyContin

438
00:21:18,796 --> 00:21:20,463
for him and his
nineteen-year-old girlfriend.

439
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:21,898
This went on for weeks,

440
00:21:21,966 --> 00:21:23,600
but then she started
to have misgivings

441
00:21:23,668 --> 00:21:24,970
and threatened to cut him off.

442
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:26,520
But he wouldn't let her.

443
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,739
He threatened to blackmail her
by turning her in to the Feds.

444
00:21:29,807 --> 00:21:31,775
Sounds like
a pretty good motive to me.

445
00:21:31,843 --> 00:21:33,476
No! No, it's not true!

446
00:21:33,544 --> 00:21:35,245
I would never kill anybody,
never!

447
00:21:35,313 --> 00:21:37,214
And I am not saying another word

448
00:21:37,281 --> 00:21:39,015
until I talk to my lawyer,
because...

449
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,417
Why is he wearing shorts?

450
00:21:40,484 --> 00:21:42,319
Oh, my God,
I told you!

451
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:44,521
Muriel, just surrender quietly.

452
00:21:44,589 --> 00:21:46,723
It'll be easier
for us all if you...

453
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,425
(Thunder cracking,
electrical hiss)

454
00:21:48,492 --> 00:21:50,126
(Meg screams)

455
00:21:50,194 --> 00:21:51,228
(Brief electrical hiss)

456
00:21:51,295 --> 00:21:52,796
(Gasps)
She's gone!

457
00:22:01,339 --> 00:22:02,439
We lost her.

458
00:22:02,506 --> 00:22:04,474
Well, as long as there's
a murderer on the loose,

459
00:22:04,542 --> 00:22:05,909
none of us are safe.

460
00:22:05,977 --> 00:22:07,777
All right, let's split up
and search the house.

461
00:22:07,845 --> 00:22:09,145
I'll go with Lois.

462
00:22:09,213 --> 00:22:10,947
Chris, you check the basement
with Herbert.

463
00:22:11,015 --> 00:22:12,115
(Spring bounces)

464
00:22:12,183 --> 00:22:13,683
Meg, you go
with Brian and Stewie.

465
00:22:13,751 --> 00:22:15,452
Uh, no,
she... She can't.

466
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:16,653
Yeah, uh, she can't.

467
00:22:16,721 --> 00:22:19,256
We... we... we were gonna
use this time, uh...

468
00:22:19,323 --> 00:22:21,558
to figure out what to get
you for your birthday.

469
00:22:21,626 --> 00:22:23,326
Ooh, ah, okay.
Oh, yeah, no, you guys go.

470
00:22:23,394 --> 00:22:24,527
You guys...
Ooh, now I'm excited.

471
00:22:24,595 --> 00:22:25,829
Um, okay, um, Meg,

472
00:22:25,897 --> 00:22:27,564
you go with Carl.
Sorry, Carl.

473
00:22:27,632 --> 00:22:28,832
Tom and Diane,
you're a team.

474
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,567
Quagmire and Bonnie,
you're a team.

475
00:22:30,635 --> 00:22:33,503
Um... Seamus and Dr. Hartman?
That... That could be funny.

476
00:22:33,571 --> 00:22:35,305
Don't usually see
the two of you together.

477
00:22:35,373 --> 00:22:37,407
Uh, Derek and Jillian,
you guys take the attic.

478
00:22:37,475 --> 00:22:39,209
Joe and Priscilla
are still passed out,

479
00:22:39,277 --> 00:22:40,644
so they'll be
the unconscious team.

480
00:22:40,711 --> 00:22:43,480
And that leaves
one three-person team

481
00:22:43,547 --> 00:22:45,749
of Mort, Consuela,
and Mayor West.

482
00:22:45,816 --> 00:22:47,951
All right.
Let's do this.

483
00:22:50,788 --> 00:22:53,123
So, uh...

484
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,591
You guys like to party?

485
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:55,759
(Gasps)
No!

486
00:22:55,826 --> 00:22:57,460
Oh, no.

487
00:22:57,528 --> 00:22:59,896
Oh, my God,
what a couple of squares.

488
00:22:59,964 --> 00:23:01,464
Squaresville,
I tell ya!

489
00:23:05,414 --> 00:23:07,715
(Thunder rumbling)

490
00:23:17,527 --> 00:23:18,994
What are we supposed
to be doing again?

491
00:23:19,062 --> 00:23:20,929
We're looking
for Muriel Goldman, honey.

492
00:23:20,997 --> 00:23:22,064
(Creaks)

493
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,707
Hello?

494
00:23:33,402 --> 00:23:34,846
Is anybody up here?

495
00:23:46,476 --> 00:23:47,943
(Screeches)

496
00:23:48,753 --> 00:23:51,959
Hey, maybe it was that cat
who was the murderer.

497
00:23:52,095 --> 00:23:53,262
Let me ask him.

498
00:23:53,329 --> 00:23:56,064
Meow, meow, meow?
Meow-meow-meow-meow?

499
00:23:56,132 --> 00:23:58,200
We don't all talk like that.

500
00:23:58,268 --> 00:23:59,801
I happen to be a professor.

501
00:23:59,869 --> 00:24:01,270
Our apologies, sir.

502
00:24:01,337 --> 00:24:03,005
I should imagine so.

503
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:05,240
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have papers to correct.

504
00:24:10,313 --> 00:24:13,488
Chris, I'm worried,
with this killer on the loose.

505
00:24:13,608 --> 00:24:17,010
If I should die, I...
I just want you to know

506
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,218
that they might
find some things.

507
00:24:19,338 --> 00:24:20,684
Strange things.

508
00:24:20,696 --> 00:24:22,880
Things that don't
make sense to you.

509
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,559
Um... okay.

510
00:24:24,627 --> 00:24:26,261
And there's gonna
be a lot of talk.

511
00:24:26,329 --> 00:24:27,729
Nasty talk.

512
00:24:27,797 --> 00:24:30,265
And I just want you
to know, from me,

513
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:32,901
it's all gonna be
out of context.

514
00:24:32,969 --> 00:24:34,770
I don't know
what that means.

515
00:24:34,837 --> 00:24:38,006
It means, if I die,
you got to burn my house down!

516
00:24:44,551 --> 00:24:46,081
(Echoing):
Muriel?

517
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:48,283
Oh, yeah, like she's going
to answer you, Tom.

518
00:24:48,351 --> 00:24:50,285
And here we go
with the attitude.

519
00:24:50,353 --> 00:24:51,553
This is why you're single.

520
00:24:51,621 --> 00:24:53,322
Oh, so I'm not
supposed to point out

521
00:24:53,389 --> 00:24:54,656
when you do something stupid?

522
00:24:54,724 --> 00:24:56,591
You hear that?
You hear that tone you're using?

523
00:24:56,659 --> 00:24:58,160
That's penis repellent right there.

524
00:25:04,691 --> 00:25:07,897
Careful. She could be hiding
behind any one of these statues.

525
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:12,441
Muriel, this is Tom Tucker
from the Channel Five News.

526
00:25:12,508 --> 00:25:13,975
Perhaps you'd like
an autograph.

527
00:25:14,043 --> 00:25:16,085
Oh, for God's sakes.
Do you hear yourself?

528
00:25:16,108 --> 00:25:18,083
There it is.
(Mimes spraying repellent)

529
00:25:18,365 --> 00:25:19,645
Knock it off!

530
00:25:19,669 --> 00:25:20,682
(Thud)

531
00:25:21,336 --> 00:25:22,117
Hey, wait a minute.

532
00:25:22,185 --> 00:25:23,952
Doesn't feel like
there's any wall here.

533
00:25:33,001 --> 00:25:34,496
What do you think's in there?

534
00:25:34,564 --> 00:25:36,365
I don't know.
Looks scary.

535
00:25:36,432 --> 00:25:38,166
What do you think, Ollie?

536
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:39,706
I miss Ollie.

537
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,679
(Sighs)
I better take a look.

538
00:25:41,702 --> 00:25:43,640
No.
I'll go first.

539
00:25:45,847 --> 00:25:47,309
Do you see anything?

540
00:25:47,377 --> 00:25:49,778
No, it's...
It's too dark.

541
00:25:52,148 --> 00:25:54,783
Tom?
Tom!

542
00:25:57,762 --> 00:25:59,454
Oh, sweet.
A pool table.

543
00:25:59,522 --> 00:26:01,323
Let's see if we can
find some cues.

544
00:26:09,098 --> 00:26:10,866
(Thunder crashes,
Carl screams)

545
00:26:10,933 --> 00:26:11,967
(Gasps)
What is it?!

546
00:26:12,034 --> 00:26:14,169
Whew. It's okay.

547
00:26:14,237 --> 00:26:16,538
It's just the stuffed bear
from <i>The Great Outdoors.</i>

548
00:26:16,606 --> 00:26:18,073
Did you see
<i>The Great Outdoors?</i>

549
00:26:18,141 --> 00:26:19,574
- No.
- You suck.

550
00:26:20,153 --> 00:26:21,750
Hey, I found the pool cues!

551
00:26:24,614 --> 00:26:26,448
(Screams)

552
00:26:28,284 --> 00:26:29,184
Meg?

553
00:26:31,154 --> 00:26:32,754
Looks like I'm all alone.

554
00:26:32,822 --> 00:26:34,256
Well, hey, that's all right.

555
00:26:34,323 --> 00:26:35,357
I watch a lot of movies.

556
00:26:35,425 --> 00:26:37,626
I can just use my imagination.

557
00:26:38,157 --> 00:26:40,095
- Hi, Carl.
- Hey, bear.

558
00:26:40,163 --> 00:26:41,763
So, um,
in the bear world,

559
00:26:41,831 --> 00:26:44,900
are, like, pandas your version
of interracial children?

560
00:26:44,967 --> 00:26:47,402
Yeah. Pandas aren't
something I agree with.

561
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:48,537
They're cute,
though, right?

562
00:26:48,604 --> 00:26:50,305
Just when they're babies.

563
00:26:50,373 --> 00:26:53,208
(Thunder crashes,
rain pours)

564
00:27:00,651 --> 00:27:02,031
(Thunder rumbles)

565
00:27:02,151 --> 00:27:03,919
Boy, it's really
raining hard.

566
00:27:03,986 --> 00:27:06,121
Yeah, well,
we needed it.

567
00:27:06,189 --> 00:27:07,422
What?

568
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,257
Peter, we've been
married a long time.

569
00:27:09,325 --> 00:27:11,526
Why do I still get
"guy in an elevator" small talk?

570
00:27:11,594 --> 00:27:13,795
I don't know. You're the one
talking about the weather.

571
00:27:14,224 --> 00:27:15,197
So...

572
00:27:15,264 --> 00:27:17,999
Looking forward
to the weekend?

573
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,373
(Screams)

574
00:27:25,441 --> 00:27:26,808
It's okay.
It's just us.

575
00:27:26,876 --> 00:27:29,578
Oh, Quagmire, Bonnie,
you scared us.

576
00:27:29,645 --> 00:27:31,713
Have you seen
any sign of Muriel?

577
00:27:31,781 --> 00:27:33,248
Oh, why didn't I
think of this before?

578
00:27:33,316 --> 00:27:35,784
I should just check the
"Find a Jew" app on my phone.

579
00:27:35,852 --> 00:27:38,987
Huh. There's just
two big clusters

580
00:27:39,055 --> 00:27:40,922
on each side of the country.

581
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:43,091
No, look.
There's one down south.

582
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:44,359
Ah, they got him.

583
00:27:44,427 --> 00:27:46,261
(Thunder rumbles)

584
00:27:52,735 --> 00:27:54,402

00:29:54,217 --> 00:29:55,350
And where's Tom Tucker?

634
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:56,518
Right here!

635
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,186
Oh, my God!
What happened?

636
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,554
I fell through a trapdoor

637
00:29:59,622 --> 00:30:01,022
that led to
an underground passageway.

638
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,657
So I followed it,
and it led me

639
00:30:02,725 --> 00:30:03,925
to a hatch over there
in the parlor.

640
00:30:03,993 --> 00:30:05,360
The same thing
happened to me.

641
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:06,494
But with a moustache.

642
00:30:06,562 --> 00:30:07,896
Hey, Peter,
look at this.

643
00:30:07,964 --> 00:30:10,298
I'm getting a faint signal
on my cell phone.

644
00:30:10,366 --> 00:30:11,521
Really?

645
00:30:11,641 --> 00:30:13,071
Oh, my God, is that...

646
00:30:13,191 --> 00:30:15,203
Are you holding up
the whole Hollywood sign?

647
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,304
(Chuckling):
No, no, no, no.

648
00:30:16,372 --> 00:30:18,173
The sign was way
in the background.

649
00:30:18,241 --> 00:30:20,275
I was standing in the
foreground going like this

650
00:30:20,343 --> 00:30:21,837
when Jillian took the picture,

651
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,144
so by forced perspective,

652
00:30:23,212 --> 00:30:25,013
it looks like I'm holding
up the whole sign.

653
00:30:25,081 --> 00:30:27,415
I don't believe you.
I think you are a God.

654
00:30:27,483 --> 00:30:29,684
And I will die for
you or kill others.

655
00:30:29,752 --> 00:30:31,086
Damn it.
The signal's gone.

656
00:30:31,153 --> 00:30:33,154
If I can get up
to the roof or something,

657
00:30:33,222 --> 00:30:35,657
maybe I can get a stronger
signal and call the police.

658
00:30:35,725 --> 00:30:38,326
Okay. And I will skin
this dog in your honor.

659
00:30:38,394 --> 00:30:39,694
- Please don't.
- As you wish.

660
00:30:39,762 --> 00:30:41,730
Do you really think
it could work, Derek?

661
00:30:41,797 --> 00:30:43,465
There's only one
way to find out.

662
00:30:43,532 --> 00:30:44,866
I'll be back.

663
00:30:46,802 --> 00:30:48,937
All right, nobody leaves
this room until he gets back.

664
00:30:49,005 --> 00:30:50,805
Wait a minute.

665
00:30:50,873 --> 00:30:52,841
Something's not right here.

666
00:30:52,909 --> 00:30:55,377
We're short one vagina
in this room.

667
00:30:55,444 --> 00:30:56,945
Oh, my God!

668
00:30:57,013 --> 00:30:58,280
Priscilla's gone!

669
00:30:58,347 --> 00:31:01,016
(Thunder crashes)

670
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:02,183
(All gasp)

671
00:31:02,251 --> 00:31:04,085
Th... That's impossible.

672
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:06,087
She was still passed out
on the couch when we left.

673
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,255
(Groans)

674
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:08,823
What the hell happened?

675
00:31:08,891 --> 00:31:10,492
Joe!
You're okay!

676
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,260
Yeah, I'm fine.
What's going on?

677
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:14,462
What's going on is,
Priscilla's the murderer!

678
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:15,730
Wait a second.
We don't know that.

679
00:31:15,798 --> 00:31:17,732
Well, she was by herself
this whole time!

680
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,100
Yes, but she was unconscious!

681
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,069
She could've come to
and killed Muriel!

682
00:31:21,137 --> 00:31:23,171
This is all speculation!
We don't know she's the killer!

683
00:31:23,239 --> 00:31:24,306
Yeah, besides, she's hot!

684
00:31:24,373 --> 00:31:25,640
Hot chicks are never crazy!

685
00:31:25,708 --> 00:31:27,175
Derek lifted
up the Hollywood sign.

686
00:31:27,243 --> 00:31:29,978
(Shouting at each other,
arguing frantically)

687
00:31:31,547 --> 00:31:33,882
Peter: He did, too!
I saw the picture!

688
00:32:12,855 --> 00:32:14,689
(Thunder crashes)

689
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,294
(Waves crashing)

690
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,849
Come on.

691
00:32:34,843 --> 00:32:35,777
Yes!

692
00:32:35,845 --> 00:32:37,712
(Keys beeping)

693
00:32:39,422 --> 00:32:40,248
Hey.

694
00:32:40,316 --> 00:32:41,883
What are you doing up here?

695
00:32:41,951 --> 00:32:43,151
Wait a minute.

696
00:32:43,219 --> 00:32:44,819
What the hell is this?

697
00:32:44,887 --> 00:32:47,222
Oh, my God!
It's you!

698
00:32:47,289 --> 00:32:49,958
The man or woman
who's been killing everybody!

699
00:32:50,026 --> 00:32:51,693
Stay back.
Stay back.

700
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:52,827
(Bone crunches)

701
00:32:53,963 --> 00:32:55,363
(Thuds)

702
00:33:02,038 --> 00:33:03,471
It came from over there!

703
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:06,641
(All gasp)

704
00:33:06,709 --> 00:33:08,209
Dear God!

705
00:33:10,746 --> 00:33:12,213
He's dead.

706
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:14,282
Do you think he
slipped off the roof?

707
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,684
Maybe. But he was dead
before the fall.

708
00:33:16,752 --> 00:33:19,954
Look at this... He's been hit
on the head by a blunt object.

709
00:33:20,022 --> 00:33:22,924
Oh, my God, no, Derek!

710
00:33:22,992 --> 00:33:25,160
(Squeaky sobbing)
Oh, Jillian, I'm so sorry.

711
00:33:25,227 --> 00:33:26,628
Peter:
Hey, can you grab his phone?

712
00:33:26,695 --> 00:33:28,730
I want to prove
something to these guys.

713
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,535
(Thunder crashing)

714
00:33:34,565 --> 00:33:37,167
(Wind whistling)

715
00:33:37,235 --> 00:33:38,568
I... I...
It's Priscilla.

716
00:33:38,636 --> 00:33:40,070
I... I mean,
it's got to be Priscilla.

717
00:33:40,138 --> 00:33:41,505
She's the only one
who's not here.

718
00:33:41,572 --> 00:33:42,606
Look, maybe, maybe not.

719
00:33:42,674 --> 00:33:44,872
We thought Muriel was the killer,
and look how that turned out.

720
00:33:44,884 --> 00:33:46,070
We have no proof of anything.

721
00:33:46,093 --> 00:33:47,887
Is this the latest
you've ever stayed up?

722
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,913
It's the latest
<i>I've</i> ever stayed up.

723
00:33:50,338 --> 00:33:54,217
Oh, no! Someone take
Mr. Woods' Golden Globe!

724
00:33:57,288 --> 00:34:00,323
She's right! There was a Golden Globe
award here, and it's gone.

725
00:34:00,391 --> 00:34:02,822
I think we may have
identified our blunt object.

726
00:34:02,834 --> 00:34:04,677
So all we have to do
is find that Golden Globe

727
00:34:04,689 --> 00:34:07,448
and we'll have our murder weapon...
And if we're lucky,

728
00:34:07,472 --> 00:34:09,268
it may just mean
we'll have our killer.

729
00:34:09,292 --> 00:34:11,777
All right, from
this moment forward,

730
00:34:11,789 --> 00:34:13,468
nobody leaves the group.

731
00:34:13,491 --> 00:34:14,971
Joe's right.
Everyone huddle up.

732
00:34:17,193 --> 00:34:19,060
Good. Now, we're gonna
search the house,

733
00:34:19,128 --> 00:34:20,695
and we're gonna move as one.

734
00:34:20,763 --> 00:34:22,097
Anyone who separates
from the group

735
00:34:22,165 --> 00:34:23,932
we will assume to be the killer.

736
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,033
All clear?

737
00:34:25,101 --> 00:34:26,735
Others:
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

738
00:34:26,803 --> 00:34:27,769
All right.

739
00:34:27,837 --> 00:34:28,870
Let's do this!

740
00:34:39,515 --> 00:34:40,982
Oh, boy,
we got a problem here.

741
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,451
All right,
on the count of three.

742
00:34:42,518 --> 00:34:44,119
One, two...

743
00:34:44,187 --> 00:34:45,420
three!

744
00:34:45,488 --> 00:34:46,521
Thanks, guys.

745
00:34:46,589 --> 00:34:49,257
(Peter humming "Hava Nagila")

746
00:34:49,325 --> 00:34:52,394
Stop it, Peter.
(Continues humming)

747
00:34:52,462 --> 00:34:53,728
Peter, knock it off!

748
00:34:53,796 --> 00:34:55,096
Okay, Jew. Joe.

749
00:34:55,164 --> 00:34:56,631
Shut up!
I'm not Jewish!

750
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:59,534
<i>Well!</i> I think we've
learned a little something

751
00:34:59,602 --> 00:35:02,637
about our friendly neighborhood
policeman today.

752
00:35:03,955 --> 00:35:06,074
All right, we got to search
every one of these rooms.

753
00:35:06,142 --> 00:35:07,409
We'll start with Quagmire's.

754
00:35:11,481 --> 00:35:13,448
Oh, my God!

755
00:35:13,516 --> 00:35:15,417
Are those
Stephanie's underpants?

756
00:35:15,485 --> 00:35:16,451
Oh, God.

757
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:17,819
They're huge!

758
00:35:17,887 --> 00:35:20,589
Looks like the crotch got
chewed on by a walrus mouth.

759
00:35:20,656 --> 00:35:22,791
(Laughs)
Look, it's got flowers!

760
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:24,125
I mean, why bother?

761
00:35:24,193 --> 00:35:25,427
Who's gonna see 'em?

762
00:35:25,495 --> 00:35:28,129
Maybe someone in space.

763
00:35:28,197 --> 00:35:29,731
(Raucous laughter)

764
00:35:29,799 --> 00:35:32,267
Come on, guys, can't we all
just be glad she's dead?

765
00:35:42,745 --> 00:35:44,579
Whose room is <i>this?</i>

766
00:35:44,647 --> 00:35:46,081
It's, uh, my room.

767
00:35:46,148 --> 00:35:48,650
You travel with a giant
poster of yourself?

768
00:35:48,718 --> 00:35:51,920
Yes. It helps me get to sleep,
knowing that Big Tom Tucker

769
00:35:51,988 --> 00:35:54,665
is keeping a watchful eye out
for nocturnal intruders.

770
00:35:54,689 --> 00:35:56,814
What a ridiculous
man you are.

771
00:35:56,837 --> 00:35:58,916
Look, I didn't know my room
was gonna be scrutinized.

772
00:35:58,939 --> 00:36:00,695
I... If you don't like it,
let's get out of here.

773
00:36:00,763 --> 00:36:02,964
Not till we've
searched the place.

774
00:36:13,543 --> 00:36:15,610
(Gasps)

775
00:36:15,678 --> 00:36:18,013
You guys?

776
00:36:19,215 --> 00:36:20,649
(Thunder crashing)

777
00:36:20,716 --> 00:36:21,716
(All gasp)

778
00:36:21,727 --> 00:36:23,385
Oh, my God!

779
00:36:25,179 --> 00:36:29,124
Well, well, I think
we've found our killer.

780
00:36:29,191 --> 00:36:31,026
Oh, now, now, wait a minute,
that's not mine!

781
00:36:31,093 --> 00:36:33,495
I suppose it crawled under
your bed all by itself.

782
00:36:33,563 --> 00:36:34,563
Well, maybe it did.

783
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,764
I didn't murder anybody.

784
00:36:35,831 --> 00:36:37,566
Tell it to Mike Judge.

785
00:36:37,633 --> 00:36:39,501
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
uh, this is crazy,

786
00:36:39,569 --> 00:36:40,702
Wh... What about Priscilla?

787
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:42,404
We have no idea
where she is.

788
00:36:42,471 --> 00:36:43,738
She could've planted that there.

789
00:36:43,806 --> 00:36:45,073
Well, uh...

790
00:36:45,141 --> 00:36:47,842
I suppose it's possible.

791
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:50,045
What the hell?

792
00:36:50,112 --> 00:36:52,380
Aw, dang it,
I got a nosebleed.

793
00:36:52,448 --> 00:36:54,783
No, you don't.

794
00:36:59,388 --> 00:37:01,022
Peter, give me a boost.

795
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,724
(Grunting)

796
00:37:08,264 --> 00:37:09,864
(All scream)

797
00:37:09,932 --> 00:37:12,434
You're going to jail,
Tucker.

798
00:37:12,501 --> 00:37:14,536
Like hell I am!
You're not taking me anywhere,

799
00:37:14,604 --> 00:37:15,837
you podunk,
Quahog redneck cop!

800
00:37:15,905 --> 00:37:18,173
Not you or anyone else
in this damn town!

801
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,975
I'm not going to jail!

802
00:37:21,477 --> 00:37:23,211
After him!

803
00:37:39,528 --> 00:37:40,729
Give it up, Tucker!

804
00:37:40,796 --> 00:37:41,963
Make me, Swanson!

805
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:53,842
(All panting)

806
00:37:53,909 --> 00:37:55,844
Damn, he's slippery.

807
00:37:55,911 --> 00:37:57,612
(Panting)
You guys give up?

808
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,814
- What do we do?
- Wait a minute, wait a minute, guys!

809
00:37:59,882 --> 00:38:02,064
- I got an idea.
- Shoot.

810
00:38:02,088 --> 00:38:04,019
What if half of us go around
one side of the table,

811
00:38:04,086 --> 00:38:05,654
and the other half
go around the other side,

812
00:38:05,721 --> 00:38:07,789
and then we won't have
to chase him around in circles.

813
00:38:07,857 --> 00:38:09,224
Damn, that's awfully risky.

814
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:12,961
It sure is, but at this point
I'm willing to try anything.

815
00:38:14,263 --> 00:38:16,364
All right.
Let's do it!

816
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,567
(Thumping)
Peter: It worked!

817
00:38:19,635 --> 00:38:21,569
(Grunting)
Let me go!

818
00:38:21,637 --> 00:38:23,371
Let me go,
you bastards!

819
00:38:23,439 --> 00:38:25,040
You're all gonna
pay for this!

820
00:38:25,107 --> 00:38:26,541
(Grunting, punch lands)

821
00:38:26,609 --> 00:38:29,377
Just for that, when the movie
of this story comes out,

822
00:38:29,445 --> 00:38:32,123
I'm gonna make sure
Adrian Brody plays you.

823
00:38:32,146 --> 00:38:34,107
I guess that means you
don't want anyone to see it.

824
00:38:34,131 --> 00:38:35,984
(Laughter)

825
00:38:36,052 --> 00:38:38,019
(Laughter dies down)
Okay. All right.

826
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,375
(birds chirping)

827
00:39:06,716 --> 00:39:10,018
Thanks a lot for
your help, boys.

828
00:39:16,705 --> 00:39:19,042
You know, despite all
the craziness this weekend,

829
00:39:19,053 --> 00:39:20,991
I feel like a lot of people
were looking at me

830
00:39:21,003 --> 00:39:22,282
like I was really attractive.

831
00:39:22,298 --> 00:39:25,133
Which makes me think that
I'm gonna grow up to be good-looking.

832
00:39:25,201 --> 00:39:26,434
What part of
that statement

833
00:39:26,502 --> 00:39:28,369
is supposed to lure me
into a conversation?

834
00:39:28,437 --> 00:39:30,764
I talk to you about
wet tennis balls.

835
00:39:32,243 --> 00:39:35,009
- Oh, come on!
- We're in a fight!

836
00:39:36,579 --> 00:39:39,614
Lois, are any of my Hot Wheels
in the bath... L... Lois?

837
00:39:39,682 --> 00:39:41,116
Lois? Lois?

838
00:39:41,183 --> 00:39:43,818
Lois, are any of my Hot Wheels
in the bathroom?

839
00:39:43,886 --> 00:39:45,453
No, I put 'em all in your bag.

840
00:39:45,521 --> 00:39:47,288
Okay, well,
I don't see the fire engine,

841
00:39:47,356 --> 00:39:51,526
but I guess we'll just find out
when we get home, won't we?

842
00:39:51,594 --> 00:39:53,828
I'll see you in the car.

843
00:39:58,701 --> 00:40:00,435
Hi, Diane.

844
00:40:00,503 --> 00:40:01,903
Oh, hi, Lois.

845
00:40:01,971 --> 00:40:03,304
How you doing?

846
00:40:03,372 --> 00:40:05,840
I just thought I'd
make sure you were okay.

847
00:40:05,908 --> 00:40:07,776
Oh, I'm managing.

848
00:40:07,843 --> 00:40:09,811
It's just...
so hard to believe

849
00:40:09,879 --> 00:40:12,013
you can work with someone
for fifteen years

850
00:40:12,081 --> 00:40:14,415
and yet have no idea
who they really are

851
00:40:14,483 --> 00:40:15,850
or what they're capable of.

852
00:40:15,918 --> 00:40:16,951
Oh, I know.

853
00:40:17,019 --> 00:40:18,419
And I'm sorry.

854
00:40:18,487 --> 00:40:20,355
So, what happens now?

855
00:40:20,422 --> 00:40:22,557
Will you just anchor
the news by yourself?

856
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:24,559
I suppose,
for the time being.

857
00:40:24,627 --> 00:40:26,895
Well, that's kind of
exciting, right?

858
00:40:26,962 --> 00:40:28,696
(Chuckles)
You sound like my mother.

859
00:40:28,764 --> 00:40:32,634
She actually bought me this blouse
for my first solo broadcast.

860
00:40:32,701 --> 00:40:34,369
I guess that's sweet, huh?

861
00:40:34,436 --> 00:40:36,070
She... uh...

862
00:40:36,138 --> 00:40:38,039
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

863
00:40:38,107 --> 00:40:39,174
What do you mean?

864
00:40:39,241 --> 00:40:40,809
I mean, how could she have known

865
00:40:40,876 --> 00:40:42,210
you'd be anchoring alone?

866
00:40:42,278 --> 00:40:44,746
I mean, none of this
happened until...

867
00:40:51,387 --> 00:40:52,687
(Soft gasp)

868
00:40:52,755 --> 00:40:56,157
Gosh, I, uh, you know,
I think I'd better, uh...

869
00:40:56,225 --> 00:40:59,027
go make sure Peter
has his, uh...

870
00:40:59,094 --> 00:41:00,395
fire engine.

871
00:41:00,462 --> 00:41:01,462
Oh, really?

872
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:03,364
But I was enjoying our talk.

873
00:41:03,432 --> 00:41:05,967
Oh, no, I... So was I,
but, you know,

874
00:41:06,035 --> 00:41:07,902
I've, really, I should...
I should go.

875
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:10,238
No.
I don't think so.

876
00:41:10,306 --> 00:41:11,940
Oh, my God.

877
00:41:12,007 --> 00:41:13,975
Oh, my God, it <i>was</i> you.

878
00:41:14,043 --> 00:41:15,610
You're the killer!

879
00:41:15,678 --> 00:41:17,011
Very clever, Lois.

880
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:19,180
You shouldn't have stopped
to say hi to me.

881
00:41:19,248 --> 00:41:20,548
You would've lived longer.

882
00:41:20,616 --> 00:41:23,251
God, why do I ever try to
be friends with other women?

883
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:24,452
But, Diane, why?

884
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,988
How could you do all
these horrible things?

885
00:41:27,056 --> 00:41:29,624
Well, I suppose it all
really began a year ago

886
00:41:29,692 --> 00:41:31,426
when James Woods and I met

887
00:41:31,493 --> 00:41:33,628
<i>at a press event</i>
<i>and began seeing each other.</i>

888
00:41:42,537 --> 00:41:43,938
<i>We both valued</i>
<i>our privacy, however,</i>

889
00:41:44,006 --> 00:41:47,242
<i>so we agreed to keep it</i>
<i>a secret from the media.</i>

890
00:41:52,612 --> 00:41:56,299
<i>Everything in my life</i>
<i>was wonderful.</i>

891
00:41:56,323 --> 00:41:59,053
<i>But then a few months ago,</i>
<i>I turned fourty.</i>

892
00:41:59,121 --> 00:42:01,356
Others:
Surprise!

893
00:42:01,423 --> 00:42:03,157
<i>It was hard for me</i>
<i>to begin with,</i>

894
00:42:03,225 --> 00:42:06,527
<i>but it got worse when,</i>
<i>not so coincidentally,</i>

895
00:42:06,595 --> 00:42:08,763
<i>Tom began pushing</i>
<i>Channel Five News to replace me</i>

896
00:42:08,831 --> 00:42:10,865
<i>with a fresh, young face,</i>

897
00:42:10,933 --> 00:42:12,533
<i>and he succeeded.</i>

898
00:42:13,171 --> 00:42:16,237
<i>Three weeks from now,</i>
<i>I'll be off the air.</i>

899
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:20,174
<i>Well, apparently,</i>
<i>all men think the same way,</i>

900
00:42:20,242 --> 00:42:22,268
<i>because around the same time,</i>

901
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:23,865
<i>James dumped me.</i>

902
00:42:25,881 --> 00:42:28,683
<i>I watched my career</i>
<i>and my love life crumble,</i>

903
00:42:28,751 --> 00:42:31,589
<i>and I wasn't gonna just</i>
<i>stand by and take it.</i>

904
00:42:31,709 --> 00:42:32,987
<i>That's when I had</i>
<i>the good fortune</i>

905
00:42:33,055 --> 00:42:36,057
<i>to meet a young news intern</i>
<i>named Priscilla.</i>

906
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:38,726
<i>She was so anxious to get</i>
<i>into the reporting business</i>

907
00:42:38,794 --> 00:42:41,448
<i>and would have done</i> anything
<i>to get on my good side.</i>

908
00:42:41,472 --> 00:42:43,151
<i>So I seized the moment.</i>

909
00:42:43,174 --> 00:42:46,438
<i>I paid her off to seduce</i>
<i>James Woods</i> <i>and reel him</i>

910
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:49,537
<i>into a relationship</i>
<i>like a fish on a line.</i>

911
00:42:49,605 --> 00:42:51,973
<i>I knew a hot, young woman</i>
<i>like Priscilla</i>

912
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:55,009
<i>could manipulate him</i>
<i>into doing anything I wanted.</i>

913
00:42:55,077 --> 00:42:56,678
<i>At my direction,</i>
<i>she persuaded him</i>

914
00:42:56,745 --> 00:42:58,638
<i>to become</i>
<i>a born-again Christian,</i>

915
00:42:58,662 --> 00:43:01,104
<i>and instilled him with</i>
<i>the drive</i> <i>to bring together</i>

916
00:43:01,116 --> 00:43:03,351
<i>all the people he'd wronged.</i>

917
00:43:03,419 --> 00:43:06,354
<i>That's how this weekend</i>
<i>came to pass.</i>

918
00:43:06,422 --> 00:43:09,662
<i>Of course, Priscilla knew</i>
<i>nothing of my real intentions,</i>

919
00:43:09,685 --> 00:43:12,827
<i>but she played the part</i>
<i>beautifully, nonetheless.</i>

920
00:43:12,895 --> 00:43:14,896
There's no way
she could have known

921
00:43:14,964 --> 00:43:18,099
I planned to kill James Woods
and frame Tom Tucker,

922
00:43:18,167 --> 00:43:20,034
thereby destroying
the two people

923
00:43:20,102 --> 00:43:22,804
who cast me aside
and ruined my life.

924
00:43:22,871 --> 00:43:24,839
Oh, my God...

925
00:43:24,907 --> 00:43:26,374
you're fourty?

926
00:43:26,442 --> 00:43:28,509
Yes.
I'm fourty.

927
00:43:28,577 --> 00:43:30,845
But then why did
you kill the others?

928
00:43:30,913 --> 00:43:33,147
It was all supposed
to go so smoothly.

929
00:43:33,215 --> 00:43:34,882
<i>The hidden gun goes off,</i>

930
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:37,118
<i>kills James Woods,</i>
<i>and at the first opportunity,</i>

931
00:43:37,186 --> 00:43:40,488
<i>I retrieve the gun</i>
<i>and plant it in Tom's bag.</i>

932
00:43:40,556 --> 00:43:41,923
<i>James Woods is dead,</i>

933
00:43:41,991 --> 00:43:44,392
<i>Tom goes to prison...</i>
<i>Nice and easy.</i>

934
00:43:44,964 --> 00:43:46,925
<i>But Stephanie got in the way.</i>

935
00:43:46,936 --> 00:43:49,285
<i>She was in James' chair</i>
<i>at the wrong time.</i>

936
00:43:49,308 --> 00:43:52,233
<i>And when I realized my mistake,</i>
<i>I had to improvise.</i>

937
00:43:52,301 --> 00:43:55,236
<i>The power outage provided</i>
<i>a perfect cover.</i>

938
00:43:55,304 --> 00:43:59,073
<i>I grabbed the knife off the</i>
<i>dinner table and stabbed him.</i>

939
00:43:59,141 --> 00:44:01,509
<i>But as Joe pointed out,</i>
<i>there were fingerprints.</i>

940
00:44:01,577 --> 00:44:03,277
<i>I couldn't just leave it there.</i>

941
00:44:03,345 --> 00:44:05,847
<i>So when Tom and I got separated</i>
<i>in the gallery,</i>

942
00:44:05,914 --> 00:44:08,449
<i>I went back into the dining</i>
<i>room</i> <i>and got the knife.</i>

943
00:44:08,517 --> 00:44:09,718
<i>But at that moment,</i>

944
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,953
<i>Priscilla regained</i>
<i>consciousness</i> <i>after fainting.</i>

945
00:44:12,021 --> 00:44:14,295
<i>She started</i>
<i>to become hysterical.</i>

946
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,224
<i>I knew I couldn't</i>
<i>risk her revealing</i>

947
00:44:16,291 --> 00:44:18,526
<i>that I had engineered</i>
<i>this whole gathering...</i>

948
00:44:18,594 --> 00:44:19,861
<i>so I killed her.</i>

949
00:44:19,928 --> 00:44:21,737
<i>And I hid her in Tom's room.</i>

950
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,031
<i>I tried to plant the knife</i>

951
00:44:23,098 --> 00:44:24,899
<i>in Tom's suitcase,</i>
<i>but at that moment,</i>

952
00:44:24,919 --> 00:44:27,652
<i>Muriel walked in,</i>
<i>caught me in the act.</i>

953
00:44:27,675 --> 00:44:29,580
<i>It wasn't her fault,</i>
<i>poor thing,</i>

954
00:44:29,604 --> 00:44:30,978
<i>but she had to die.</i>

955
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:33,584
<i>I stabbed her,</i>
<i>and she screamed.</i>

956
00:44:33,608 --> 00:44:34,675
<i>I had to leave the knife</i>

957
00:44:34,743 --> 00:44:36,310
<i>in her, because</i>
<i>I couldn't very well</i>

958
00:44:36,378 --> 00:44:38,859
<i>hide it on my person with</i>
<i>everyone quickly closing in.</i>

959
00:44:38,979 --> 00:44:42,170
<i>So I wiped off</i>
<i>the fingerprints and ran.</i>

960
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:44,052
<i>I slipped in</i>
<i>with the rest of the group,</i>

961
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:46,087
<i>when they all converged</i>
<i>on the scene.</i>

962
00:44:46,155 --> 00:44:49,436
<i>I needed more time</i>
<i>to finish my work framing Tom.</i>

963
00:44:49,556 --> 00:44:51,972
<i>But that's when Derek</i>
<i>went out to the balcony.</i>

964
00:44:52,217 --> 00:44:54,095
<i>I couldn't let him</i>
<i>contact the police</i>

965
00:44:54,107 --> 00:44:55,516
<i>before everything</i>
<i>was in the place.</i>

966
00:44:55,539 --> 00:44:57,331
<i>So I had to kill him, too.</i>

967
00:44:57,399 --> 00:44:59,033
<i>When Peter was yelling</i>
<i>at everyone</i>

968
00:44:59,101 --> 00:45:01,702
<i>about that picture of Derek</i>
<i>holding up the Hollywood sign,</i>

969
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:04,806
<i>I grabbed the Golden Globe</i>
<i>and slipped out.</i>

970
00:45:05,164 --> 00:45:07,475
<i>I followed Derek outside</i>
<i>and did what I had to do.</i>

971
00:45:10,882 --> 00:45:12,916
<i>I barely had enough time</i>
<i>to plant the Golden Globe</i>

972
00:45:12,928 --> 00:45:14,889
<i>in Tom's room and run back</i>
<i>downstairs,</i>

973
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:16,967
<i>where I took advantage</i>
<i>of the commotion</i>

974
00:45:16,991 --> 00:45:18,259
<i>and joined the crowd</i>

975
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:20,583
<i>as they were all running</i>
<i>outside.</i>

976
00:45:21,323 --> 00:45:22,890
<i>And the rest...</i>

977
00:45:22,958 --> 00:45:24,961
<i>Well, you did</i>
<i>all the rest for me.</i>

978
00:45:24,973 --> 00:45:28,366
<i>You turned on Tom</i>
<i>exactly as I planned.</i>

979
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:30,680
So there it is, Lois.

980
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,111
My God.

981
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,870
But wait, there's one
thing unaccounted for...

982
00:45:35,938 --> 00:45:37,905
What happened to
Stephanie's body?

983
00:45:37,973 --> 00:45:40,007
Actually, that's
the one thing I don't know.

984
00:45:42,583 --> 00:45:43,778
Damn it!

985
00:45:45,598 --> 00:45:48,330
Well, now you know
everything, Lois.

986
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:50,651
Which, of course,
means I have to kill you.

987
00:45:55,591 --> 00:45:56,757
Lois, are you coming?

988
00:45:56,825 --> 00:45:58,559
I can't play my tapes
without the key.

989
00:45:58,627 --> 00:46:00,895
Well, actually, Lois and I
were just about to go

990
00:46:00,963 --> 00:46:03,164
for a quick walk,
weren't we, Lois?

991
00:46:03,232 --> 00:46:04,765
We've been getting
better acquainted.

992
00:46:04,833 --> 00:46:06,434
All right, well,
just give me the key, please.

993
00:46:06,502 --> 00:46:08,736
All right, Peter,
I'll get it.

994
00:46:08,804 --> 00:46:11,072
Don't put a gun in my back.

995
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:13,341
I'm not, I'm just asking for the key.
Give me the key.

996
00:46:13,408 --> 00:46:15,343
Lois: <i>Peter, we've
been married twenty years.</i>

997
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:17,378
<i>Please recognize when I'm</i>
<i>acting out of the ordinary</i>

998
00:46:17,446 --> 00:46:18,846
<i>because I'm in danger.</i>

999
00:46:18,914 --> 00:46:22,416
Here you go.
Here's the key, Pete.

1000
00:46:22,484 --> 00:46:24,018
Peter:
<i>Why is she calling me Pete?</i>

1001
00:46:24,086 --> 00:46:25,820
<i>We been married fourteen years.</i>
<i>She never called me Pete.</i>

1002
00:46:25,888 --> 00:46:27,455
<i>Why am I trying to</i>
<i>figure this out</i>

1003
00:46:27,523 --> 00:46:29,557
<i>when I could be listening</i>
<i>to my tapes in the car?</i>

1004
00:46:30,041 --> 00:46:30,875
Bye.

1005
00:46:32,448 --> 00:46:33,916
Shall we?

1006
00:47:08,096 --> 00:47:11,265
Well, it's a shame that
you have to die, Lois,

1007
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:13,000
but look on the bright side:

1008
00:47:13,068 --> 00:47:15,836
You'll be a story
on the 6:00 news.

1009
00:47:15,904 --> 00:47:18,139
You know, unless a local
cat does something funny.

1010
00:47:18,207 --> 00:47:20,641
Diane, please,
please, don't do this!

1011
00:47:20,709 --> 00:47:23,110
I won't tell anybody,
I swear to God!

1012
00:47:23,178 --> 00:47:26,047
That's right.
You won't.

1013
00:47:26,114 --> 00:47:27,548
Good-bye, Lois.

1014
00:47:31,853 --> 00:47:33,621
(Gunshot)

1015
00:47:38,927 --> 00:47:40,828
(Gasps)

1016
00:47:44,366 --> 00:47:47,468
(Screaming)

1017
00:47:56,211 --> 00:47:57,812
Lois:
Hello?

1018
00:48:00,616 --> 00:48:02,650
Is anyone there?

1019
00:48:07,756 --> 00:48:11,626
Whoever you are...
Thank you!

1020
00:48:19,635 --> 00:48:23,070
If anybody's gonna take that
bitch down, it's gonna be me.

1021
