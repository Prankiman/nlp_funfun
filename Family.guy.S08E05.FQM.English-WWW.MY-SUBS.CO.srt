11
00:00:34,191 --> 00:00:35,858
Hi, Chris.

12
00:00:35,926 --> 00:00:37,460
How'd you do on
your science test?

13
00:00:37,528 --> 00:00:38,694
I got a "D."

14
00:00:38,762 --> 00:00:40,730
A "D"? That's fantastic!

15
00:00:40,797 --> 00:00:42,565
Just kiddin'.
I know it means you suck.

16
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:44,467
Come here,
you delightful idiot.

17
00:00:44,535 --> 00:00:45,835
Another "D," Chris?

18
00:00:45,903 --> 00:00:48,638
I'm sorry, Mom,
but science is so hard.

19
00:00:48,705 --> 00:00:50,673
Well, maybe you just need
a little extra help.

20
00:00:50,741 --> 00:00:52,642
Dad, would you help me
with my homework?

21
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:54,544
Uh, Chris, I've got to tell you,
that sounds worse

22
00:00:54,611 --> 00:00:56,145
than a trip to a failing mall.

23
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:58,681
All right, kids, your mom is

24
00:00:58,749 --> 00:01:00,583
going to go to the
Cinnabon that has the cage

25
00:01:00,651 --> 00:01:02,251
pulled halfway down,
and I'm going to go

26
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:04,754
to the stereo store next to the
dead fountain with garbage in it.

27
00:01:04,821 --> 00:01:06,989
Let's say we meet back here
under the glue outline

28
00:01:07,057 --> 00:01:08,658
of the old Limited sign.

29
00:01:08,725 --> 00:01:10,359
Well,
it doesn't matter anyway.

30
00:01:10,427 --> 00:01:12,528
Every time I try to study,
the Evil Monkey

31
00:01:12,596 --> 00:01:14,430
comes out of my closet
and scares me.

32
00:01:19,002 --> 00:01:21,537
Oh, for God's sake, Chris,
you're in high school now.

33
00:01:21,605 --> 00:01:23,472
Stop talking about
that evil monkey.

34
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,540
He's not real.

35
00:01:24,608 --> 00:01:25,875
He is too real!

36
00:01:25,943 --> 00:01:27,076
I can prove it!

37
00:01:27,144 --> 00:01:28,444
Well, you'll have to
do a better job

38
00:01:28,512 --> 00:01:29,979
than you did on
your science test.

39
00:01:30,047 --> 00:01:31,781
Or than God did
when he left the iron

40
00:01:31,848 --> 00:01:33,449
on Ellen Barkin's face too long.

41
00:01:35,252 --> 00:01:36,285
Oh, damn.

42
00:01:36,353 --> 00:01:37,987
- How is it?
- You know what?

43
00:01:38,055 --> 00:01:39,755
We'll put you in the '80s.
You'll pass for hot.

44
00:01:39,823 --> 00:01:41,057
Now get in the van
with Kelly McGillis.

45
00:01:42,292 --> 00:01:45,394
Next stop: Hollywood!

46
00:01:51,235 --> 00:01:53,769
<i>Up next, the
Hannah Montana marathon.</i>

47
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:55,905
- Yes!
<i>- And for all you fans,</i>

48
00:01:55,973 --> 00:01:58,574
<i>The Miley Cyrus Tour is coming
to the Quahog Civic Center</i>

49
00:01:58,642 --> 00:01:59,842
<i>for three nights only.</i>

50
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,544
<i>Call to get your tickets now!</i>

51
00:02:01,612 --> 00:02:03,613
Oh! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

52
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,248
But not now,
'cause it just sold out.

53
00:02:05,315 --> 00:02:07,083
What? Oh, no! No!
No, no! No!

54
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,684
I'm calling anyway!

55
00:02:08,752 --> 00:02:10,653
I need Hannah Montana tickets
and I need them now!

56
00:02:10,721 --> 00:02:13,155
Never mind who this is!
Can you get them or not?

57
00:02:13,223 --> 00:02:15,091
I guess I should dial
something first.

58
00:02:15,158 --> 00:02:17,093
What's all the noise?
What are you watching?

59
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,894
Sorry, but you know the rules.

60
00:02:18,962 --> 00:02:20,763
Hannah can't do the photo shoot

61
00:02:20,831 --> 00:02:22,999
until Miley finishes her homework.

62
00:02:23,066 --> 00:02:24,333
You can't tell
Hannah what to do.

63
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:25,635
She's not your daughter.

64
00:02:25,702 --> 00:02:28,371
Wait, so Miley's my daughter,
but Hannah isn't?

65
00:02:28,438 --> 00:02:30,072
- Right.
- Great.

66
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,140
Put your wig on.

67
00:02:32,676 --> 00:02:34,844
Shut up!
This is real.

68
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:37,446
Ha! You're watching
<i>Hannah Montana</i>?

69
00:02:37,514 --> 00:02:39,382
Well, yeah.
To make fun of it.

70
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:41,851
I mean, look how stupid
she is with her clothes

71
00:02:41,918 --> 00:02:44,186
and her makeup
and... and... and... and...

72
00:02:44,254 --> 00:02:46,555
and that fabulous hair
and, oh, my God!

73
00:02:46,623 --> 00:02:48,958
Brian, it's my favorite show!
It's my favorite show ever!

74
00:02:49,026 --> 00:02:50,293
- Gay.
- And she's coming to town

75
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,694
and I have to get
tickets, Brian.

76
00:02:51,762 --> 00:02:53,429
- You have to help me get tickets!
- No.

77
00:02:53,497 --> 00:02:55,765
It's a stupid show
and a huge waste of time.

78
00:02:55,832 --> 00:02:59,568
But... She's my favorite.

79
00:02:59,636 --> 00:03:01,871
Oh, my God, are you...
are you crying?

80
00:03:01,938 --> 00:03:04,206
Yes! Hannah Montana is my hero!

81
00:03:04,274 --> 00:03:05,708
I love her so, so much.

82
00:03:05,776 --> 00:03:07,977
And this is the only time
she's gonna be in town

83
00:03:08,045 --> 00:03:09,578
and now I'll never
get to see her!

84
00:03:09,646 --> 00:03:11,380
Will you help me?

85
00:03:11,448 --> 00:03:13,115
All right, fine.

86
00:03:16,953 --> 00:03:18,354
Hey, Chris.

87
00:03:18,422 --> 00:03:20,723
- You want to practice kissing again?
- I'm busy.

88
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,192
I set up a video camera
last night so I can prove

89
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,328
to Mom and Dad that
the Evil Monkey is real,

90
00:03:25,395 --> 00:03:26,796
and I want to see what I got.

91
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:06,068
Huh. Nothin'.

92
00:04:06,136 --> 00:04:08,938
All right,
it's time to play rough.

93
00:04:28,692 --> 00:04:31,594
I got you, you bastard!

94
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,065
Well, here he is.

95
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:37,967
The Evil Monkey!

96
00:04:38,034 --> 00:04:39,568
Do you believe me now?!

97
00:04:39,636 --> 00:04:40,970
Holy crap!

98
00:04:41,037 --> 00:04:42,271
It is real!

99
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:45,107
Oh, my God!
I thought I was the only one.

100
00:04:45,175 --> 00:04:47,109
Meg, we're do...
we're doin'...

101
00:04:47,177 --> 00:04:48,477
We're doin'
Chris' monkey.

102
00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:56,083
Oh, my God,
Chris was right!

103
00:04:56,151 --> 00:04:58,185
Holy crap, Chris,
is that thing dangerous?

104
00:04:58,253 --> 00:05:00,054
Yes, he's evil!

105
00:05:00,122 --> 00:05:01,422
I'm not really evil.

106
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:02,690
It talks!

107
00:05:02,758 --> 00:05:04,125
If... if someone will
please untie me,

108
00:05:04,192 --> 00:05:05,593
I'll explain everything.

109
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,894
No, Dad, don't do it!

110
00:05:06,962 --> 00:05:08,095
He's evil!

111
00:05:08,163 --> 00:05:09,363
Look, just trust me.

112
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:11,399
This is all a huge
misunderstanding.

113
00:05:11,466 --> 00:05:13,834
Chris, I think we should give him
a chance to explain himself.

114
00:05:13,902 --> 00:05:15,202
No!

115
00:05:16,838 --> 00:05:18,472
Thank you very much.

116
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,107
Now, I know this looks bad,

117
00:05:20,175 --> 00:05:21,842
me living in your
son's closet and all,

118
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,245
but it's a very
complex situation.

119
00:05:24,312 --> 00:05:26,914
You see, basically,
I got home from work one day,

120
00:05:26,982 --> 00:05:29,550
and found my wife cheating on me
with another monkey.

121
00:05:29,618 --> 00:05:31,318
Oh, that's terrible.

122
00:05:31,386 --> 00:05:33,788
I fell into a deep depression
after the divorce,

123
00:05:33,855 --> 00:05:35,456
which ended up
costing me my job.

124
00:05:35,524 --> 00:05:37,892
All my money was gone,
which means I lost the house.

125
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,226
So, I moved into Chris' closet,

126
00:05:39,294 --> 00:05:41,061
just until I got
back on my feet again.

127
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:43,497
Wound up living in there
for nine years.

128
00:05:43,565 --> 00:05:46,066
Oh, my God,
you've missed so much!

129
00:05:46,134 --> 00:05:47,568
Like when America
was attacked

130
00:05:47,636 --> 00:05:49,804
by mentally challenged
suicide bombers.

131
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:51,372
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

132
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:54,108
You know something?

133
00:05:54,176 --> 00:05:55,976
You're not evil at all,
are you?

134
00:05:56,044 --> 00:05:57,445
No, he's not.

135
00:05:57,512 --> 00:05:59,613
He's just a poor fellow
who's down on his luck.

136
00:05:59,681 --> 00:06:01,048
Easy for you to say!

137
00:06:01,116 --> 00:06:03,918
He doesn't hide in your
closet making a scary face!

138
00:06:03,985 --> 00:06:05,686
That's just the face
I make when I'm thinking.

139
00:06:05,754 --> 00:06:07,121
And you're always
pointing at me!

140
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:08,856
I was trying to start
a conversation.

141
00:06:08,924 --> 00:06:10,558
And you do that weird
trembling thing!

142
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:11,859
I have a copper deficiency.

143
00:06:11,927 --> 00:06:13,861
Look, Chris, I'm sorry
if I scared you before,

144
00:06:13,929 --> 00:06:16,263
but this is a great chance
for us to start over.

145
00:06:16,331 --> 00:06:17,731
No, it isn't!

146
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:20,234
You can fool everyone else,
but you can't fool me!

147
00:06:20,302 --> 00:06:21,335
You go to hell!

148
00:06:49,197 --> 00:06:50,798
Okay, now remember
to play it cool.

149
00:06:50,866 --> 00:06:52,600
Act like you belong here.

150
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:54,835
Oh, my God, Miley!
I love you! I love you!

151
00:06:54,903 --> 00:06:56,003
I love you!
I'm your biggest fan!

152
00:06:56,071 --> 00:06:57,605
Can I touch your hair?!

153
00:06:57,672 --> 00:06:58,606
Who are you guys?

154
00:06:58,673 --> 00:06:59,940
How did you get back here?

155
00:07:00,008 --> 00:07:01,342
Look, I'm really
sorry about this.

156
00:07:01,409 --> 00:07:02,943
This is my friend Stewie.

157
00:07:03,011 --> 00:07:06,247
H... he's just a baby and
he's your biggest fan and...

158
00:07:06,314 --> 00:07:07,481
he has cancer.

159
00:07:07,549 --> 00:07:09,316
Oh, my God! Really?

160
00:07:09,384 --> 00:07:10,951
Yeah, he's got
a tumor in his head

161
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:13,320
- the size of a football.
- I think I can see it.

162
00:07:13,388 --> 00:07:14,722
Well, in that case,

163
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:16,757
I wouldn't feel right
about throwing you out.

164
00:07:16,825 --> 00:07:18,692
Especially if you're
my biggest fan.

165
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:25,799
I mean, Sarah Silverman
is just one of the most

166
00:07:25,867 --> 00:07:27,601
wonderful people
you'll ever meet.

167
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:29,169
Oh, that's so good to hear.

168
00:07:29,237 --> 00:07:31,305
I want to like her.
She's so funny.

169
00:07:31,373 --> 00:07:33,073
I want her to also be nice.

170
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:36,110
Well, I'm glad you guys are
having such a great time

171
00:07:36,177 --> 00:07:39,213
with that evil thing
that tortured me for years!

172
00:07:39,281 --> 00:07:41,982
Dad, I thought you were going to
help me with my book report.

173
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,318
Chris, there is
a monkey here.

174
00:07:44,386 --> 00:07:46,687
And I just fed him a whole
bag of Subway sandwiches.

175
00:07:46,755 --> 00:07:48,722
In a couple hours,
we are going to sit around

176
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:51,025
and throw his soft bread stool
at each other.

177
00:07:51,092 --> 00:07:52,993
Now, you are welcome
to be a part of that.

178
00:07:53,061 --> 00:07:54,395
Or not.

179
00:07:54,462 --> 00:07:56,463
I'm just telling you
what's gonna happen.

180
00:07:56,531 --> 00:07:58,732
Well,
thanks for nothing, Dad!

181
00:08:00,235 --> 00:08:01,635
Don't mind him, Monkey.

182
00:08:01,703 --> 00:08:03,537
He's just a big
disappointment.

183
00:08:03,605 --> 00:08:06,040
Like things that look
like DVDs from far away.

184
00:08:06,107 --> 00:08:07,775
DVDs!

185
00:08:07,842 --> 00:08:08,909
Aw, books.

186
00:08:29,965 --> 00:08:32,199
Ah... That feels so good.

187
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:33,667
You are an artist.

188
00:08:33,735 --> 00:08:34,969
Thank you.

189
00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:36,971
Lois doesn't like
my toenails

190
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:38,706
'cause they stab her
in the night.

191
00:08:38,773 --> 00:08:40,007
Hear that, Lois?

192
00:08:40,075 --> 00:08:41,842
Somebody likes my toenails.

193
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,043
Good for you, Peter.

194
00:08:43,111 --> 00:08:44,778
Good for this family.

195
00:08:44,846 --> 00:08:46,413
Good for all of us.

196
00:08:46,481 --> 00:08:47,848
Mom! Dad!

197
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,917
I got an "A"
on my book report!

198
00:08:49,985 --> 00:08:51,518
That's wonderful, honey!

199
00:08:51,586 --> 00:08:53,687
Congratulations, Chris.
What'd you write about?

200
00:08:53,755 --> 00:08:55,122
I, um...

201
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,592
<i>"The Slave Trade Allegory
of Curious George."</i>

202
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,594
W... wait a minute, I didn't...
I didn't write this.

203
00:09:00,662 --> 00:09:02,062
Oh, really?

204
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,231
Did... Did you write this?

205
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:06,200
Well, I can't take
all the credit.

206
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:08,569
I've been listening to you
talk in your sleep for years,

207
00:09:08,637 --> 00:09:10,704
so I just put your thoughts
on paper, that's all.

208
00:09:10,772 --> 00:09:14,508
Wow, that's the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

209
00:09:14,576 --> 00:09:17,745
Thanks, Evil Monk...
thanks, Monkey.

210
00:09:17,812 --> 00:09:19,947
Ah, I'd get up to hug you,
but sittin' down's

211
00:09:20,015 --> 00:09:21,248
the only thing
keepin' the poop in.

212
00:09:21,316 --> 00:09:22,349
Nah, that's okay.

213
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:28,055
I can't believe
I'm sitting here

214
00:09:28,123 --> 00:09:29,523
with you, Miley Cyrus.

215
00:09:29,591 --> 00:09:30,991
It's like I'm in a dream.

216
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:32,593
Well, that makes me happy,
Stewie.

217
00:09:32,661 --> 00:09:33,961
What are you doing?

218
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:35,696
Oh, I'm just writing
some new lyrics.

219
00:09:35,764 --> 00:09:37,031
Oh, you write
your own lyrics?

220
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:39,800
- Yeah.
- So do I...

221
00:09:39,868 --> 00:09:41,702
Oh, you wrote a song?

222
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:42,870
Look at you.

223
00:09:42,937 --> 00:09:44,705
You're a regular
little Tim McGraw.

224
00:09:44,773 --> 00:09:47,007
Oh, oh, I'm...

225
00:09:47,075 --> 00:09:49,309
I'm... I'm a little better
than Tim McGraw.

226
00:09:49,377 --> 00:09:51,679
Hey, these are pretty good,
Stewie.

227
00:09:51,746 --> 00:09:52,846
Really?

228
00:09:52,914 --> 00:09:54,248
Do you think you
could sing them?

229
00:09:54,315 --> 00:09:55,783
Only if you sing with me.

230
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,384

Hey, where you guys been?

253
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,341
We went to the
father/son barbecue.

254
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:13,944
You drove all the way up
to Fatherson for a barbecue?

255
00:11:14,012 --> 00:11:17,047
No, Dad, it was a barbecue
for fathers and sons.

256
00:11:17,115 --> 00:11:18,749
Wait a minute...
you went with the monkey

257
00:11:18,817 --> 00:11:20,317
to a father/son thing?

258
00:11:20,385 --> 00:11:22,720
Well, it's not like you ever
take me anywhere.

259
00:11:22,787 --> 00:11:24,254
- What?
- Oh, listen, Peter, I didn't...

260
00:11:24,322 --> 00:11:26,190
- Meg, please!
- It's true.

261
00:11:26,257 --> 00:11:27,891
You never want to do
anything with me!

262
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,894
But the monkey's been taking me
to all the fun places I like,

263
00:11:30,962 --> 00:11:33,197
and he's been helping me
with all my homework!

264
00:11:33,264 --> 00:11:36,100
He helped me get
an "A" in algebra!

265
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:38,168
How did the monkey know you
needed help with algebra?

266
00:11:38,236 --> 00:11:40,104
Because he asked!

267
00:11:41,272 --> 00:11:42,639
That's right, Dad.

268
00:11:42,707 --> 00:11:44,775
You never ask,
and even if you did,

269
00:11:44,843 --> 00:11:46,276
you never listen!

270
00:11:46,344 --> 00:11:47,911
And now you're getting
mad at the monkey

271
00:11:47,979 --> 00:11:49,646
because he actually cares?

272
00:11:49,714 --> 00:11:51,515
Screw you!

273
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,885
You are the worst dad
in the world and I hate you!

274
00:11:54,953 --> 00:11:57,087
Well...
Well, I hate you, too!

275
00:11:58,256 --> 00:11:59,590
Ah, damn.

276
00:11:59,657 --> 00:12:02,292
I left my cell phone up
at that monkey/kid barbecue.

277
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,094
I thought you said it was
a father/son barbecue.

278
00:12:04,162 --> 00:12:05,562
Yeah, but it was up
in Monkeykid.

279
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,064
What?!

280
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:22,041
Boy, you guys have been
awful quiet this morning.

281
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:25,244
Lois, could you ask Chris
to pass the maple syrup?

282
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:27,012
Meg, could you tell Dad

283
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,048
that he's too fat
to need extra syrup?

284
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:31,317
Lois, could you tell Chris
that I'm sorry

285
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:34,253
I ever planted the seed version
of him in your vagina?

286
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:35,721
I want you two
to stop this.

287
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:38,057
This is no way for
a father and son to act.

288
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,658
Well, according to him,
that stupid monkey's

289
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,527
more of a father
to him than I am.

290
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:44,196
He makes time for me
and you never do.

291
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:47,399
You're supposed to love me
and all you do is hurt me.

292
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,201
This morning I had
a hard poo that hurt,

293
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,503
but then it felt great.

294
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,271
Meg, I'm trying to be
mad right now,

295
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:53,739
but that's making
me want to smile.

296
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,514
This'll get Chris.

297
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,682
Hey, classmates.

298
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,151
Griffin.
Did you gain weight?

299
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:06,485
Eh, that's
not important.

300
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:07,720
But you know
what is important?

301
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,221
I'm gay now.

302
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,757
Let's all of us go be
gay somewhere together.

303
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:13,359
And then you go
tell all your friends

304
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:15,761
that I welcome them
to be gay with me, too.

305
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:17,997
Because I am gay.

306
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,298
I'll be gay with you.

307
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:21,600
Oh, this is too perfect.

308
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:24,003
Chris is going to be
so gay by the end of this.

309
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,475
What's this?

310
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:32,411
"Put your head between
these two restrained logs

311
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,979
and win a free hat"?

312
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,682
Well, that's a no-brainer.

313
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,884
Come on, you fat (bleep).

314
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:39,985
Do it.

315
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,895
Who's laughing now?

316
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:52,331
I got my hat.

317
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:58,003
Hey, guys.
I stopped at Pinkberry

318
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,505
and I got some
for everybody.

319
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:01,340
- Wow, thanks.
- You're welcome.

320
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:03,676
I've got to go put on my
face for press interviews.

321
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:05,441
Stewie, can you hand
me my cell phone?

322
00:14:05,455 --> 00:14:07,413
Oh, sure.

323
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,415
Thanks!

324
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:10,783
That was weird...
did you hear that

325
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,251
when I was giving
her the phone?

326
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:14,854
- No.
- It was like, interference or something.

327
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,323
Wait a second.

328
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:32,238
Oh, my God!

329
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:33,772
She's an android!

330
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,741
Miley Cyrus is an android!

331
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:37,042
Of course.

332
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,078
She's a product
of Disney imagineering.

333
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:41,580
They built a perfect
robot teen idol.

334
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:43,682
Yes, assuring that
she could never fail.

335
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,718
Like famous duelist
Sir Henry

336
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:47,753
"Giant-Hole-in-the-Torso"
Wickenshire.

337
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,091
Aha!
Right through me!

338
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:55,060
Prepare for returned fire,
Sir Joseph Broadfront.

339
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:57,596
I give you one last
chance to rescind

340
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:59,865
tour insult of calling
me a "common dandy."

341
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:01,834
Never!

342
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,642
My God, I can't believe
she's an android.

343
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:12,144
Do you think we should
tell someone or do something?

344
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:13,679
Well, we could
do something.

345
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,314
- Like what?
- Well, look at her.

346
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:18,217
She dances like a real girl.
She moves like a real girl.

347
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:19,852
Yeah?

348
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,954
Do you think she does
other stuff like a real girl?

349
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:23,589
You know,
if you reprogrammed her?

350
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:25,257
Brian, that's sick!
She's sixteen!

351
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:26,659
I'm eight.

352
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:28,193
All right,
I'll see what I can do.

353
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:30,729
Hey, Miley.

354
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:31,964
Oh, hi, Stewie.

355
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:33,599
Hey, um, your shirt
tag is showing.

356
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:34,934
Let me just, uh...

357
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,204
There we go, all done.

358
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:42,374
Um...

359
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:46,078
Miley smash!

360
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:49,415
Uh-oh...
Hang on, hang on.

361
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:50,582
Maybe I can fix this.

362
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,653
Run!

363
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:59,158
Monkey, do you think
you could help me?

364
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:01,026
I just can't stand
Peter and Chris

365
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:02,594
being at each other's
throats anymore.

366
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,697
Of course, Lois;
I'm sure if we can just

367
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:06,131
get them in the same
room together,

368
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:07,766
I can convince them
to talk it out.

369
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:09,368
Why don't you invite
Peter to lunch,

370
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:11,704
and I'll invite Chris,
and we'll see what we can do.

371
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:14,440
Oh, thank you.
I really appreciate it.

372
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:21,714
What the hell
are you doing here?

373
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:23,015
I thought I was
meeting Lois.

374
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,683
She wanted me to
talk to you guys

375
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:26,118
about the way
you've been behaving.

376
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:28,120
Look, Monkey,
Chris is being a jerk, all right?

377
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:29,688
And there is
nothing you can say

378
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:31,590
that will make me
change my mind about that.

379
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,258
Peter, you're
acting bananas.

380
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,194
All right, I'll listen.

381
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:37,596
You're both good guys
and that's why it's important

382
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,264
for you to reconcile
your differences.

383
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,100
Chris, I know you're angry,

384
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,935
but do you really
hate your father?

385
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:45,437
No, I just think
he's a douche.

386
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,172
Sometimes he is.

387
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,842
And Peter, do you
really hate your son?

388
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:53,145
No, but sometimes he's
such a little fat jerk.

389
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:55,914
Well, it's only because you
never have any time for me!

390
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,383
Peter, do you think
you could make

391
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,118
a little more time
for your son?

392
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,120
Yeah, I guess so.

393
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:05,524
What the hell
was that about?

394
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,159
Was that Stewie
and Brian?

395
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:26,011
It's Miley Cyrus!

396
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,813
And she's
destroying the city!

397
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:30,516
Oh, my God!

398
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,851
Ms. Cyrus, I ask you
to stop what you're doing.

399
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:34,820
I don't just mean this,
I mean everything:

400
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:37,723
The show, the music...
it's all just awful.

401
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,733
Dad, we've got
to help him!

402
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:48,801
Do something!

403
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:50,135
What am I supposed to do?!

404
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:52,538
You're my dad!
Think of something!

405
00:17:57,811 --> 00:18:00,079
Quagmire,
fire up the biplane.

406
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:02,347
My son needs my help.

407
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,802
All right, Peter,
we're closing in.

408
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:24,937
Get ready to fire.

409
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:43,949
Monkey! Grab my hand!

410
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:12,611
Well, the airplane got her.

411
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:14,947
Oh, no, it wasn't the airplane.

412
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:18,283
'twas beauty
killed the beast.

413
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:19,685
You know, Brian,
here's your shot.

414
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:20,919
Go for it.

415
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:24,089
Oop, too late.

416
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:25,257
No, it's not.

417
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:30,762
Thanks for everything,
Monkey.

418
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,865
You made me realize how much
Chris really means to me

419
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:37,169
and how I should always remember
not to take him for granted.

420
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,937
Well, sometimes
all anybody needs

421
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:40,606
is a little bit
of a wake-up call.

422
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,407
And now that you two
are getting along again,

423
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:43,875
my work here is done.

424
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:45,477
Guess I'll be
moving on now.

425
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:47,045
You have to leave?

426
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:48,580
But I thought
you were gonna go

427
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:50,349
back to living
in my closet again.

428
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,551
I think that time of
my life is over, Chris.

429
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:53,752
But I'll always remember you.

430
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,324
But... Where will you go?

431
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:00,959
I'll go where I'm needed.

432

00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,402
Dad, there's an evil
monkey in my closet!

434
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,938
I don't care, son.
I just do not care.
