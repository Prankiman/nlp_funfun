I'm sure I've met her before.

00:00:43,388 --> 00:00:45,689
I'll introduce myself to her.
That'll get her to say it.

Well, I wasn't watching

59

67

This is ridiculous.
You're hurting my wrist!

So check this out, guys.
I got kicked out of Streaming-Con 2019.

Uh, I think I'm gonna get murdered.

75
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:23,612
Uh, but before I do, I forgot,

76

I'm supposed to mention Triscuits.

77

80
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:31,053

the recipes for those snacks?

81

Like, the-the mini pizzas?

82
00:03:32,623 --> 00:03:34,758

make those little pizzas.

00:04:12,864 --> 00:04:15,765
- That was bad.
- Eh, times have changed.

Three years ago, I would've been a hero.

Three years ago, they would've been 12.

98

I need a nap.

99
00:04:21,038 --> 00:04:23,539

- The recipe's right on the box.

127

- Yeah, but is it good?
- You can make them

with ingredients you probably
already have in the house.

129

- Dad, what does it taste like?
- That's right.

130
00:05:52,597 --> 00:05:55,632
Ugh! It's like I dropped
a tomato in some hay.

131
00:05:55,633 --> 00:05:58,101
Yeah, it's like if a horse made a pizza.

132
00:05:58,102 --> 00:06:01,239
Triscuits: make sure
you have a drink nearby.

133
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,912
All right, Meg, now that
you're an Internet personality,

134
00:06:08,913 --> 00:06:10,313
we got to build your brand.

135
00:06:10,314 --> 00:06:11,914
Is there anything you can do?

136
00:06:11,915 --> 00:06:13,649
Uh, yeah, actually, I can...

137
00:06:17,355 --> 00:06:19,888
I-Is...

138
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:22,726
Is there anything you can do
in front of your dad?

139
00:06:22,727 --> 00:06:24,794
- I can shuffle a deck of cards.
- Oh, good.

140

With my...

141
00:06:28,665 --> 00:06:31,534
All right, we're taking your
bedroom door off the hinges.

142
00:06:34,237 --> 00:06:36,739
Is the lady who owns the Prius here?

143
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,743
- Uh, actually, that's me.
- Oh, well, your wife's car is totaled.

144
00:06:39,744 --> 00:06:41,378
- It's my car.
- Sorry.

145
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:43,880
We were, however,
able to save your purse.

146
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:46,061
It's a gender-fluid Euro carrier.

147
00:06:46,062 --> 00:06:48,751
Either way, we'll have it towed
back to San Francisco.

148
00:06:48,752 --> 00:06:51,221
Hey, there are plenty of closer
gay cities, you big ape.

149
00:06:51,222 --> 00:06:52,955
How did this turn into my fight?

150
00:06:52,956 --> 00:06:54,224
You're gonna need a loaner.

151
00:06:54,225 --> 00:06:57,060
We have a pink Volkswagen Beetle
you might feel comfortable in.

152
00:06:57,061 --> 00:06:59,361
Ooh, Brian, we could be two in the pink!

153
00:06:59,362 --> 00:07:00,929
Take that one! Take that one!

154
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,364
Yeah, I'm thinking
of something sportier.

155
00:07:02,365 --> 00:07:05,368
- The red Miata it is.
- Give me your manliest car!

156
00:07:05,369 --> 00:07:06,969
Bill, I need a Hummer.

157
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,238
Again? You're insatiable.

158
00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:10,839
Wise guy.

159
00:07:30,828 --> 00:07:33,697
Wow, that thing's big.

160
00:07:33,698 --> 00:07:35,231
Brian, it's night now.

161
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,407
What's up? This is Refrigerator Meg.

162
00:07:44,408 --> 00:07:47,310
Thought I'd give you a tour
of my refrigerator lifestyle.

163
00:07:47,311 --> 00:07:49,212
Let's see what we've got in here.

164
00:07:49,213 --> 00:07:52,282
Ooh, check, check, check it out!

165
00:07:52,283 --> 00:07:54,017
Boom! Mini cream!

166
00:07:54,018 --> 00:07:56,419
Oh, and what's this? Strawberry yogurt?

167
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,854
Is-is your girl Meg
some kind of health nut?

168
00:07:58,855 --> 00:08:02,694
No, turn it around: 35 grams of sugar!

169
00:08:04,494 --> 00:08:06,361
Yeah, through the roof!

170
00:08:06,362 --> 00:08:08,231
Check it, check it, what's this?

171
00:08:08,232 --> 00:08:10,467
A bacon drawer? Stacked.

172
00:08:10,468 --> 00:08:13,169
Rashers on rashers.
Best part about these bad boys?

173
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,304
Don't even have to cook them.

174
00:08:15,305 --> 00:08:17,708
Cook them right in your stomach!

175
00:08:19,243 --> 00:08:21,446
Wash it down with a little cream!

176
00:08:29,186 --> 00:08:31,790
Oh, boy, that's-that's going
right through me.

177
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:39,329
Sponsored by Oscar Mayer
and Land O'Lakes.

178
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,065
If it's not Land O'Lakes,
it's not cream!

179
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:45,969
Hey, Meg? You can't use the Charmin.

180
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,370
You're now sponsored by
Safeway Rough 'n' Thin.

181
00:08:48,371 --> 00:08:50,473
Don't forget to wash the tip
of your middle finger

182
00:08:50,474 --> 00:08:51,810
when you're done.

183
00:09:01,451 --> 00:09:02,719
Mom, we've got a problem.

184
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,488
See, I-I promoted Magic Shell
ice cream topping on my channel,

185
00:09:05,489 --> 00:09:08,123
- so-so they sent me a ton of it.
- Yeah, so?

186
00:09:08,124 --> 00:09:10,128
Dad Han Solo'd himself.

187
00:09:11,228 --> 00:09:13,498
Oh, my God, he's gonna suffocate.

188
00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:22,971
I created a vanilla ice cream
Peter covered in Magic Shell.

189
00:09:22,972 --> 00:09:25,541
- Why?
- Because I must.

190
00:09:25,542 --> 00:09:27,543
Don't listen to him. He's an imposter.

191
00:09:27,544 --> 00:09:29,211
- I'm the real Peter.
- No, you're not.

192
00:09:29,212 --> 00:09:31,113
I made you. I'm the real Peter.

193
00:09:31,114 --> 00:09:33,383
Oh-oh, my God, I-I don't know
which one to believe.

194
00:09:33,384 --> 00:09:36,352
What do you mean?
I'm a guy, and he's ice cream.

195
00:09:39,989 --> 00:09:42,191
Thank God, Lois.

196
00:09:42,192 --> 00:09:45,195
Does anyone mind
if I turn the thermostat down

197
00:09:45,196 --> 00:09:46,797
to 32 degrees?

198
00:09:51,235 --> 00:09:54,604
<i>There ain't a reason on Earth
to waste it</i>

199
00:09:54,605 --> 00:09:58,974
<i>It ain't a crime to be good to yourself</i>

200
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:00,944
<i> Lick it up</i>

201
00:10:00,945 --> 00:10:02,311
<i>Lick it up...</i>

202
00:10:02,312 --> 00:10:03,580
- Yeah?
- It's me.

203
00:10:03,581 --> 00:10:05,581
Can you change the station?

204
00:10:07,384 --> 00:10:08,852
<i>Whoa, lick it up...</i>

205
00:10:09,954 --> 00:10:11,086
<i>Don't need to wait...</i>

206
00:10:11,087 --> 00:10:13,956
<i>Oh...</i>

207
00:10:13,957 --> 00:10:16,359
<i>Oh, yeah...</i>

208
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,963
Five different stations, all
playing "Lick It Up" by Kiss.

209
00:10:19,964 --> 00:10:21,230
Hummer.

210
00:10:21,231 --> 00:10:23,032
Well, it's nice of you
to once again drive me

211
00:10:23,033 --> 00:10:24,166
to day care, Brian.

212
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:25,567
Sure. It's only three klicks away.

213
00:10:25,568 --> 00:10:27,936
I just hope I don't
get branded a "Hummer guy."

214
00:10:27,937 --> 00:10:29,339
I can feel the Earth warming.

215
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,139
No one needs a car this big.

216
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,376
Yes, but I like how
when you cut to an outside shot,

217
00:10:33,377 --> 00:10:35,612
Sam Elliott is narrating your drive.

218
00:10:35,613 --> 00:10:38,580
<i>When you need
to take a talking baby to day care,</i>

219
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:40,048
<i>you'll move mountains.</i>

220
00:10:40,049 --> 00:10:42,618
<i>And if the mountains won't move,</i>

221
00:10:42,619 --> 00:10:45,021
<i>drive right over 'em.</i>

222
00:10:45,022 --> 00:10:47,589
<i>Hummer.</i>

223
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:51,493
<i>And, yes,</i> Big Lebowski<i> fans,
I've seen the movie.</i>

224
00:10:51,494 --> 00:10:54,331
<i>I don't need to hear the lines.</i>

225
00:10:59,503 --> 00:11:02,372
This place is paying Meg?
Uh, to do what?

226
00:11:02,373 --> 00:11:04,339
Nothing. When you have
a million followers,

227
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,075
people just pay you to hang out.

228
00:11:06,076 --> 00:11:09,211
Yo, yo, yo! Everything here
is made with corn syrup!

229
00:11:09,212 --> 00:11:12,482
Just drink the corn syrup!

230
00:11:20,124 --> 00:11:21,690
Oh, my God, she collapsed!

231
00:11:21,691 --> 00:11:24,426
We got to get her to the hospital.

232
00:11:24,427 --> 00:11:27,229
<i>Don't want to wait
till you know me better...</i>

233
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,932
Anybody need a ride to the hospital?

234
00:11:29,933 --> 00:11:31,066
What?

235
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:33,536
Does anybody need a ride
to the hospital?

236
00:11:33,537 --> 00:11:35,204
How is she?

237
00:11:35,205 --> 00:11:37,507
- What?
- How is Meg?

238
00:11:37,508 --> 00:11:41,104
I'm worried! Her pulse is very weak!

239
00:11:41,946 --> 00:11:44,648
Her middle finger smells weird.

240
00:11:47,084 --> 00:11:49,238
Meg has Type 2 diabetes.

241
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:50,651
The one where you're
supposed to shame her,

242
00:11:50,652 --> 00:11:51,838
not feel sorry for her.

243
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,507
But I need to draw
a little more blood for the lab.

244
00:11:58,394 --> 00:12:00,262
As I suspected. Sap.

245
00:12:00,263 --> 00:12:03,065
- Vermont gold.
- I love sugaring season.

246
00:12:03,066 --> 00:12:04,133
Me too.

247
00:12:04,134 --> 00:12:08,037
"The moon, though slight,
was moon enough to show

248
00:12:08,038 --> 00:12:10,506
"On every tree a bucket with a lid,

249
00:12:10,507 --> 00:12:14,142
And on black ground,
a bearskin rug of snow."

250
00:12:14,143 --> 00:12:17,245
Robert Frost,
"Evening In A Sugar Orchard."

251
00:12:17,246 --> 00:12:19,382
Robert Frost!

252
00:12:19,383 --> 00:12:21,283
What? Dad?

253
00:12:21,284 --> 00:12:23,753
It's okay, Meg.
You had a diabetic coma dream.

254
00:12:23,754 --> 00:12:27,124
Dad's still an idiot.
I'm still an idiot.

255
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:37,466
Coming up, local anchor brings
a concealed weapon to work,

256
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:39,234
as is his right.

257
00:12:39,235 --> 00:12:42,070
But first, popular
Internet star Meg Griffin

258
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:43,739
has Type 2 diabetes,

259
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,777
and is also the new face
of diabetes drug Pancresta.

260
00:12:47,778 --> 00:12:49,579
Refrigerator Meg here.

261
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:53,215
If diabetes has you down,
get your insulin levels up

262
00:12:53,216 --> 00:12:54,584
with Pancresta.

263
00:12:54,585 --> 00:12:56,185
<i>Pancresta may cause heart disease,</i>

264
00:12:56,186 --> 00:12:57,552
<i>swelling, allergic reactions.</i>

265
00:12:57,553 --> 00:12:59,155
<i>Do not take Pancresta
if you are pregnant</i>

266
00:12:59,156 --> 00:13:00,589
<i>or plan on becoming pregnant.</i>

267
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,157
<i>If you have a problem with addiction,</i>

268
00:13:02,158 --> 00:13:04,393
<i>do not take Pancresta,
as smoking Pancresta may mimic</i>

269
00:13:04,394 --> 00:13:06,195
<i>the otherworldly high of heroin.</i>

270
00:13:06,196 --> 00:13:07,796
<i>Chopping up and snorting
Pancresta may amplify</i>

271
00:13:07,797 --> 00:13:10,166
<i>and/or enhance sexual experience.</i>

272
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:13,069
<i>Rock concerts on Pancresta may
be excessively transformative.</i>

273
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,037
<i>Pancresta may cause
intense philosophical</i>

274
00:13:15,038 --> 00:13:16,471
<i>and scientific breakthroughs.</i>

275
00:13:16,472 --> 00:13:18,541
<i>Pancresta can be delivered
directly to your home,</i>

276
00:13:18,542 --> 00:13:20,743
<i>and since we're here, why not,
we'll do a bump.</i>

277
00:13:20,744 --> 00:13:23,079
<i>Pancresta is not for everyone,
just the sexy people.</i>

278
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,214
<i>Lame losers should not take Pancresta.</i>

279
00:13:25,215 --> 00:13:26,516
Pancresta.

280
00:13:26,517 --> 00:13:29,420
Makes opiates look like
(BLEEP) baby aspirin.

281
00:13:32,121 --> 00:13:34,690
Meg, like everyone
who doesn't have diabetes,

282
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:36,459
I'm not sure how it works,

283
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,326
but I do know you could go blind,

284
00:13:38,327 --> 00:13:41,196
you could have organ failure,
you could lose your feet.

285
00:13:41,197 --> 00:13:43,498
No amount of fame is worth this.

286
00:13:43,499 --> 00:13:45,634
James Woods High School
will also be saluting

287
00:13:45,635 --> 00:13:47,737
their own diabetic Internet celebrity

288
00:13:47,738 --> 00:13:50,172
with a pep rally in her honor
this Thursday.

289
00:13:50,173 --> 00:13:53,309
Sponsored by Pancresta,
which feels like being inside

290
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,713
the warm, wet mouth of the Lord.

291
00:14:04,788 --> 00:14:07,355
You know, I think you like
driving this Hummer.

292
00:14:07,356 --> 00:14:08,623
You're a Hummer guy.

293
00:14:08,624 --> 00:14:11,761
I'm not a Hummer guy, Stewie.
I'm a responsible Prius driver

294
00:14:11,762 --> 00:14:13,729
who's making the best
of a bad situation.

295
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,531
I didn't ask for this car.

296
00:14:15,532 --> 00:14:17,767
I also didn't ask for these
slowpokes in front of me.

297
00:14:17,768 --> 00:14:20,836
- Out of the way, you old bag!
- Brian, that's Paul McCartney

298
00:14:20,837 --> 00:14:23,638
doing "Carpool Karaoke" songs
we can afford.

299
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:27,844
<i>She'll be coming 'round
the mountain when she comes</i>

300
00:14:27,845 --> 00:14:29,644
<i>Whoo!</i>

301
00:14:32,182 --> 00:14:33,815
How should we end the scene, Brian?

302
00:14:33,816 --> 00:14:35,685
Sam Elliott or Kiss "Lick it Up"?

303
00:14:35,686 --> 00:14:37,386
Why not both?

304
00:14:37,387 --> 00:14:39,555
<i>"Lick it up. Lick it up.</i>

305
00:14:39,556 --> 00:14:41,423
<i>Oh, yeah."</i>

306
00:14:41,424 --> 00:14:44,227
<i>That's about all I care to read of that.</i>

307
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,801
Refrigerator Meg here

308
00:14:51,802 --> 00:14:53,402
having one of my favorite snacks:

309
00:14:53,403 --> 00:14:55,437
french fry sandwiches on white bread.

310
00:14:55,438 --> 00:14:59,175
Bad sugars and starches are the bomb!

311
00:15:04,581 --> 00:15:07,883
Meg's feet are gone. Rotted.

312
00:15:07,884 --> 00:15:10,719
I have a gift for knowing
when something bad happens

313
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,657
to someone's legs,
kind of like a shining.

314
00:15:20,596 --> 00:15:23,465
<i>How you doing, doc?</i>

315
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:37,946
Oh, you were thirsty, weren't you?

316
00:15:37,947 --> 00:15:39,614
Good girl. No!

317
00:15:39,615 --> 00:15:41,617
Good boy. You're a boy car.

318
00:15:41,618 --> 00:15:43,618
- Yeah, that's weird. Stop that.
- Stop what?

319
00:15:43,619 --> 00:15:45,187
The way you're touching, feeding,

320
00:15:45,188 --> 00:15:48,257
- and talking to your car.
- His name is Mark McGrath.

321
00:15:48,258 --> 00:15:49,926
What's happened to you?

322
00:15:49,927 --> 00:15:52,894
I-I don't know. All I know
is I love this Hummer.

323
00:15:52,895 --> 00:15:54,530
God, the power.

324
00:15:54,531 --> 00:15:56,431
I deserved a sweet ride
for a little while.

325
00:15:56,432 --> 00:15:58,200
It felt so good.

326
00:15:58,201 --> 00:16:00,503
People turned their heads
when I pulled into Hooters,

327
00:16:00,504 --> 00:16:03,638
Lids, GNC. It's not fair!

328
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:06,242
- How much creatine...
- I've been doing a lot of creatine!

329
00:16:06,243 --> 00:16:08,243
All set.

330
00:16:08,244 --> 00:16:11,647
You can probably get another
130,000 miles out of this thing.

331
00:16:11,648 --> 00:16:13,916
Well, let's see...
I drive about 4,000 a year,

332
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:15,785
so when this car goes, I'll be...

333
00:16:15,786 --> 00:16:17,388
Dead for 18 years.

334
00:16:18,522 --> 00:16:20,458
Let me just say goodbye to the Hummer.

335
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:24,727
I'll miss you, Mark McGrath.

336
00:16:24,728 --> 00:16:26,862
I'll miss scaring the hell
out of homeless people

337
00:16:26,863 --> 00:16:29,632
with your cruise-ship-grade air horn.

338
00:16:29,633 --> 00:16:31,267
I'll miss catching the eye of women

339
00:16:31,268 --> 00:16:33,870
smoking outside of government buildings.

340
00:16:41,644 --> 00:16:44,546
But mostly, I'll miss driving
a military vehicle

341
00:16:44,547 --> 00:16:46,782
45 miles an hour through a school zone

342
00:16:46,783 --> 00:16:49,017
to get Crest Whitestrips.

343
00:16:49,018 --> 00:16:52,321
The back side of this car
is all wrecked.

344
00:16:52,322 --> 00:16:53,855
Who fixed this thing, your wife?

345
00:16:53,856 --> 00:16:56,592
- No, she can't fix a car.
- That's my point.

346
00:16:56,593 --> 00:16:59,961
She passed away last month.
She was addicted to Pancresta,

347
00:16:59,962 --> 00:17:02,530
so she didn't so much
pass away as elevate

348
00:17:02,531 --> 00:17:04,767
to a higher level of consciousness.

349
00:17:04,768 --> 00:17:08,571
Just turned into a smiling beam
of light right before my eyes.

350
00:17:08,572 --> 00:17:11,306
She told me to be at peace, and I was.

351
00:17:11,307 --> 00:17:13,709
I'm hearing a lot of good stuff
about this Pancresta.

352
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,544
Sorry, Mr. Griffin.
I don't know what happened.

353
00:17:15,545 --> 00:17:16,812
Looks like you got the Hummer

354
00:17:16,813 --> 00:17:19,217
for another couple of days at least.

355
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:22,617
Stewie, why did you do it?

356
00:17:22,618 --> 00:17:24,519
Oh, you were having so much fun, Bri.

357
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,588
Besides, the Earth is on fire.

358
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:28,707
One dog driving a Prius won't fix that.

359
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:29,861
Where to?

360
00:17:29,862 --> 00:17:32,627
Let's do donuts on Mark Ruffalo's lawn.

361
00:17:32,628 --> 00:17:34,963
Yeah!

362
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:39,003
Hey, come on, you guys. Knock it off.

363
00:17:40,636 --> 00:17:42,738
Hey, why don't you turn into the Hulk?

364
00:17:42,739 --> 00:17:44,573
Oh, right. You're just
a Hollywood sissy.

365
00:17:44,574 --> 00:17:45,673
I'm calling the cops!

366
00:17:45,674 --> 00:17:48,376
Oh, you hear that, Brian?
Hulk's calling the cops.

367
00:17:54,684 --> 00:17:56,951
<i>Turns out old Mark really was the Hulk.</i>

368
00:17:58,188 --> 00:18:02,357
<i>And Brian and Stewie got tossed
clear up to New Hampshire.</i>

369
00:18:02,358 --> 00:18:03,625
<i>I'm Sam Elliott.</i>

370
00:18:03,626 --> 00:18:06,529
<i>This concludes your B story.</i>

371
00:18:12,368 --> 00:18:14,036
Look at 'em all out there, Meg.

372
00:18:14,037 --> 00:18:16,037
They're all here because of you.

373
00:18:16,038 --> 00:18:17,972
Hi, Meg.

374
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:19,909
It's your friends,
Patty, Ruth and Esther.

375
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,943
If anyone remembered what we look like,

376
00:18:21,944 --> 00:18:23,979
it would be shocking how fat we are.

377
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,348
You've inspired us
to gain all this weight,

378
00:18:26,349 --> 00:18:28,383
and we just wanted to say thanks.

379
00:18:35,525 --> 00:18:38,496
♪

380
00:18:39,962 --> 00:18:41,564
Dad, I can't do this.

381
00:18:41,565 --> 00:18:43,699
All my friends are fat because of me.

382
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,735
I don't want them
to lose their feet, too.

383
00:18:45,736 --> 00:18:47,202
Everybody needs their feet.

384
00:18:47,203 --> 00:18:51,440
<i>Feet. Those little
weirdos on the end of your legs.</i>

385
00:18:51,441 --> 00:18:54,979
<i>I used mine to mosey on over
to the A story.</i>

386
00:18:56,613 --> 00:18:58,146
I'm going out there to warn everybody

387
00:18:58,147 --> 00:19:00,149
about the dangers of unhealthy eating.

388
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,485
Meg, I am so high
on Pancresta right now,

389
00:19:02,486 --> 00:19:03,952
I don't care what you say.

390
00:19:03,953 --> 00:19:05,421
Three dimensions?

391
00:19:05,422 --> 00:19:08,090
No, six dimensions.

392
00:19:11,127 --> 00:19:13,094
Be at peace, Meg.

393
00:19:13,095 --> 00:19:14,699
Be at peace.

394
00:19:16,566 --> 00:19:18,568
Phone. Forgot my phone.

395
00:19:23,874 --> 00:19:26,475
- We love you, Meg!
- Eat something gross!

396
00:19:26,476 --> 00:19:28,009
I was gonna take you to prom

397
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:31,180
as part of a cruel bet,
but I'm fat now, too!

398
00:19:31,181 --> 00:19:33,949
Hey, everybody.

399
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,585
I want to talk to you guys
about something important.

400
00:19:36,586 --> 00:19:38,153
Being healthy.

401
00:19:38,154 --> 00:19:40,588
I'm still Refrigerator Meg!

402
00:19:40,589 --> 00:19:44,125
But from here on, my fridge
will be full of fruits,

403
00:19:44,126 --> 00:19:47,764
vegetables and lean meats! Yo, yo, yo!

404
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,700
Bring back the fridge!

405
00:19:52,701 --> 00:19:54,569
Bring back the fridge!

Aah!

408
00:20:00,743 --> 00:20:02,611
What's going on, guys?

409
00:20:02,612 --> 00:20:04,145
I'm Corey from<i> Corey's World.</i>

410
00:20:04,146 --> 00:20:05,881
Did you hear that all the Jewish kids

411
00:20:05,882 --> 00:20:07,884
stayed home from school that day?

412
00:20:11,521 --> 00:20:13,756
Is everyone okay, Principal Shepherd?

413
00:20:13,757 --> 00:20:15,958
Mostly. We only had one fatality.

414
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:18,193
An old janitor was crushed
under the bleachers.

415
00:20:18,194 --> 00:20:20,996
Huh. Has anyone claimed his feet?

416
00:20:20,997 --> 00:20:23,801
Yeah, and has anyone claimed his mop?

417
00:20:28,171 --> 00:20:32,240
Good news! The feet transplant
was a success.

418
00:20:32,241 --> 00:20:34,108
So...

419
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:36,880
good news all around.

420
00:20:39,682 --> 00:20:42,183
<i>Well,
I'm glad everything's back to normal.</i>

<i>No, it isn't!</i>
