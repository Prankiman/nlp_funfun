00:00:34,073 --> 00:00:36,174
- Lois, you have a gray hair.
- What?

12
00:00:36,242 --> 00:00:37,542
Inch-and-a-half left of your part.

13
00:00:38,945 --> 00:00:40,478
Oh, my God, you're right!

14
00:00:40,546 --> 00:00:42,714
You know, I don't mind so
much that you're aging,

15
00:00:42,782 --> 00:00:44,950
it's just the way you're
shoving it down my throat.

16
00:00:45,017 --> 00:00:46,051
Screw you, Peter.

17
00:00:46,118 --> 00:00:48,620
Not today! Oh, wow!

18
00:00:48,688 --> 00:00:51,056
Mom, Dad, is it okay if I
invite my new boyfriend

19
00:00:51,123 --> 00:00:52,223
over for dinner tonight?

20
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:53,425
Your what?!

21
00:00:53,492 --> 00:00:55,427
Yes, I share your
mother's skepticism.

22
00:00:55,494 --> 00:00:56,995
No, really, I have a boyfriend.

23
00:00:57,063 --> 00:00:58,797
His name is Anthony.

24
00:00:58,864 --> 00:01:00,598
Well, Meg,
if you're telling us the truth,

25
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:01,933
I just hope to God

26
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:03,368
he's an improvement
over the last one.

27
00:01:03,436 --> 00:01:05,470
Thanks, Mrs. Griffin,
that was delicious.

28
00:01:05,538 --> 00:01:06,504
You're welcome, Justin.

29
00:01:06,572 --> 00:01:08,039
It was a pleasure to meet you.

30
00:01:08,107 --> 00:01:09,374
Come on. I'll take you home.

31
00:01:09,442 --> 00:01:10,842
Okay, babe.

32
00:01:14,347 --> 00:01:17,015
He ain't got no legs.

33
00:01:24,423 --> 00:01:25,490
<i>Jolly Farm</i>?

34
00:01:25,558 --> 00:01:28,960
I can't believe you
still watch this crap.

35
00:01:29,028 --> 00:01:31,763
Man, how can you still
watch this, huh?

36
00:01:31,831 --> 00:01:33,164
Huh?!

37
00:01:33,232 --> 00:01:36,301
You know, I can tell you've
already been drinking,

38
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:37,936
and I...
I just don't want to engage.

39
00:01:38,004 --> 00:01:39,237
Besides, you can learn a lot

Oh, didn't know that.

Ooh, ooh,

Hey, did you read this?

51
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:09,067
They're gonna be making
an American version

52
00:02:09,135 --> 00:02:11,069
of <i>Jolly Farm</i> right
here in Quahog.

Oh, my God,
I didn't see that! Gimme!

Good lord, you're right,
an American <i>Jolly Farm</i>!

55
00:02:16,175 --> 00:02:17,475
Oh, there's no picture.

56
00:02:17,543 --> 00:02:19,110
I like the stories
that have pictures.

57
00:02:19,178 --> 00:02:21,346
Ooh, like this one.

58
00:02:21,414 --> 00:02:24,315

But there's...
there's nothing wrong with him.

62
00:02:43,836 --> 00:02:46,115
- Mom, where's my...?
- Shh!

63
00:02:48,574 --> 00:02:51,276
Quagmire, get over here.
You gotta see this.

64
00:02:54,947 --> 00:02:57,115
He seems to be completely normal.

65
00:02:57,183 --> 00:02:59,451
Oh...!

66
00:02:59,518 --> 00:03:01,553
I can honestly say
for the first time

67
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,222
that I am attracted
to our daughter.

68
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,924
This must be what other
fathers feel like.

69
00:03:05,991 --> 00:03:08,726
This was worth the 500-mile drive.

70
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,431
Well, it was very nice
meeting you, Anthony.

71
00:03:13,499 --> 00:03:14,799
You, too, Mrs. Griffin.

72
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:16,267
Thanks for having
me over for dinner.

73
00:03:16,335 --> 00:03:17,569
Come on, Peter.

74
00:03:17,636 --> 00:03:19,671
I think Anthony wants
some time alone with Meg.

75
00:03:19,738 --> 00:03:22,774
Who doesn't want some time
alone with Meg these days?

76
00:03:22,842 --> 00:03:24,442
Right, Meg?

77
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,644
Has anybody ever told
you you're pretty enough

78
00:03:26,712 --> 00:03:28,279
to be a movie star, Mrs. Griffin?

79
00:03:28,347 --> 00:03:30,748
Oh, my goodness.
Well, I don't know about that.

80
00:03:30,816 --> 00:03:33,151
Penelope Ann Miller, Nancy Travis,

81
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:35,053
now those are movie stars.

82
00:03:35,121 --> 00:03:36,254
Look, Anthony, trust me,

83
00:03:36,322 --> 00:03:38,223
she ain't what she used to be,
all right?

84
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,824
Once you get those pants off,

85
00:03:39,892 --> 00:03:42,894
it's like two sagging pressed
hams and a slice of pizza.

86
00:03:42,962 --> 00:03:43,928
Oh, thank you, Peter,

87
00:03:43,996 --> 00:03:45,096
that makes me feel terrific.

88
00:03:45,164 --> 00:03:46,131
Anyway, good night, kids.

89
00:03:46,198 --> 00:03:48,233
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Dad.

90
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,468
Ah-ah-ah, on the lips.

91
00:03:51,704 --> 00:03:52,871
Yes!

92
00:03:55,407 --> 00:03:57,308
Do you think your parents liked me?

93
00:03:57,376 --> 00:03:59,310
Yeah. Can we make out now?

94
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,614
Oh, I forgot my...

95
00:04:11,056 --> 00:04:13,992
Oh, my God, that's kind of hot.

96
00:04:19,131 --> 00:04:24,068
Mmm, I bet you taste like
Mountain Dew and Starburst.

97
00:04:28,641 --> 00:04:31,176
All right, wish me luck
on my audition, Brian.

98
00:04:31,243 --> 00:04:34,012
If anyone deserves to be
on <i>Jolly Farm</i>, it's me.

99
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,880
Sorry, all the boys can go home.

100
00:04:35,948 --> 00:04:38,149
We only have one part
left for a little girl.

101
00:04:38,217 --> 00:04:39,150
What?!

102
00:04:39,218 --> 00:04:40,318
No! No, that's impossible!

103
00:04:40,386 --> 00:04:41,753
Oh, that's too bad, Stewie.

104
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,988
Well, I guess we can go home now.

105
00:04:44,056 --> 00:04:45,957
But I don't want to go home!

106
00:04:46,025 --> 00:04:47,425
I want to be on <i>Jolly Farm</i>!

107
00:04:47,493 --> 00:04:48,526
Well, you heard her.

108
00:04:48,594 --> 00:04:49,727
They're only
auditioning little girls.

109
00:04:49,795 --> 00:04:51,362
Now come on. Let's get out of here.

110
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,331
I suppose you're right;
nothing I can do.

111
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:57,068
Okay, our next young actress
on the audition list is

112
00:04:57,136 --> 00:04:58,603
Karina Smirnoff.

113
00:05:00,172 --> 00:05:02,574
Hello, everyone!

114
00:05:07,145 --> 00:05:08,279
Thank you all so much

115
00:05:08,347 --> 00:05:09,781
for squeezing me
in for an audition.

116
00:05:10,049 --> 00:05:11,349
So, should we just jump in?

117
00:05:11,917 --> 00:05:12,983
Sure. When you're ready.

118
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:14,919
All right, let me just
get into character.

119
00:05:14,986 --> 00:05:16,587
I'm a bit distracted.

120
00:05:16,655 --> 00:05:18,055
I wasn't expecting
we'd do this today

121
00:05:18,123 --> 00:05:20,825
- in light of the circumstances.
- What circumstances?

122
00:05:20,892 --> 00:05:23,761
Oh, dear God,
didn't you hear? The bomb.

123
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:26,130
The bomb that went
off in Times Square.

124
00:05:26,198 --> 00:05:29,033
All those poor people... dead!

125
00:05:29,101 --> 00:05:31,669
Oh, my God, my cousin
works in Times Square.

126
00:05:31,736 --> 00:05:35,539
Well, your cousin is fine
because I was acting!

127
00:05:35,607 --> 00:05:36,707
That's impressive!

128
00:05:36,775 --> 00:05:38,442
- Oh. Wow!
- Risky, very risky!

129
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,011
All right, fun's over.
What do you want me to read?

130
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:43,180
We want you to read
your new contract!

131
00:05:43,248 --> 00:05:44,281
You mean it?!

132
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:46,484
Absolutely! You're hired!

133
00:05:46,551 --> 00:05:49,253
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh!

134
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:52,123
Well, I guess sometimes you're
just right for the part.

135
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,792
Like James Earl Jones
playing Darth Vader.

136
00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:00,364
So, James, we just want
you to do the voice.

137
00:06:03,535 --> 00:06:06,470
Thanks for taking time
for me today, Bonnie.

138
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:08,539
I just didn't know
who else to talk to.

139
00:06:08,607 --> 00:06:10,708
Oh, that's okay, Lois.
What's on your mind?

140
00:06:10,775 --> 00:06:12,610
Well, you're gonna think
I'm an awful person,

141
00:06:12,677 --> 00:06:15,713
but I'm attracted to another man.

142
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,248
Giggity?

143
00:06:17,315 --> 00:06:18,649
It's Meg's boyfriend, Anthony.

144
00:06:18,717 --> 00:06:19,750
Giggity...

145
00:06:19,818 --> 00:06:21,352
It's just that, lately,

146
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:23,954
Peter's been making me feel
so crappy about my age, and...

147
00:06:24,022 --> 00:06:25,322
well, then I'm around Anthony,

148
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,159
he looks at me like I'm
young and attractive.

149
00:06:28,226 --> 00:06:30,194
I'm gonna tell you a secret, Lois.

150
00:06:30,262 --> 00:06:32,029
I had an affair once.

151
00:06:32,097 --> 00:06:34,064
You had an affair?!

152
00:06:34,132 --> 00:06:36,734
Mm-hmm. It wasn't anything sordid.

153
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:38,569
Just some guys I met
on the internet.

154
00:06:38,637 --> 00:06:42,173
The point is, it's healthy
to explore your sexuality.

155
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,341
Oh, I don't know.

156
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:46,744
It just feels like
I'm lying to Peter...

157
00:06:46,811 --> 00:06:48,512
like Jesus lied to the meek.

158
00:06:50,115 --> 00:06:51,348
All right!

159
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,851
Jesus and the jocks win again!

160
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,787
Hey! You said we were gonna
inherit the earth.

161
00:06:56,855 --> 00:06:59,056
Yeah, when we're done with it!

162
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:11,168
Hello there.

163
00:07:11,236 --> 00:07:12,403
Hello.

164
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,105
Um, I'm new in town and
I'm awfully lonely.

165
00:07:15,173 --> 00:07:17,708
I'm wondering if you wouldn't
mind buying me a drink?

166
00:07:17,776 --> 00:07:19,176
Well, that'd be my pleasure.

167
00:07:19,244 --> 00:07:20,978
And maybe later I can show you some

168
00:07:21,046 --> 00:07:22,446
of the local points of interest.

169
00:07:22,514 --> 00:07:24,448
There's one right below the table.

170
00:07:24,516 --> 00:07:26,584
Oh, my, you're very bold.

171
00:07:26,651 --> 00:07:29,253
Well, when your lifespan
is thirteen years, you gotta be direct.

172
00:07:29,321 --> 00:07:32,389
Lucky for you, I like bold men.

173
00:07:32,457 --> 00:07:34,158
Karina, Karina Smirnoff.

174
00:07:34,226 --> 00:07:36,627
Brian, Brian Steel.

175
00:07:36,695 --> 00:07:38,329
Ooh, good heavens!

176
00:07:38,396 --> 00:07:40,231
Man, your accent is sexy.

177
00:07:40,298 --> 00:07:42,433
Oh, this is all
moving very quickly.

178
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,068
I'm afraid I'm a
little light-headed.

179
00:07:44,135 --> 00:07:46,036
You must think I'm a fool.

180
00:07:46,104 --> 00:07:48,439
I'm... I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to come on too strong.

181
00:07:48,506 --> 00:07:49,506
Oh, that's all right.

182
00:07:49,574 --> 00:07:51,308
I've been missing a man's touch

183
00:07:51,376 --> 00:07:52,977
lo these many months.

184
00:07:53,044 --> 00:07:56,213
And I've been missing
a woman's touch.

185
00:07:57,983 --> 00:08:01,885
Brian... Brian, it's me, Stewie!

186
00:08:01,953 --> 00:08:03,887
Oh, my God, that was hilarious!

187
00:08:03,955 --> 00:08:05,089
You really fell for it!

188
00:08:05,156 --> 00:08:07,124
I... I was, like,
"Is he gonna fall for this?"

189
00:08:07,192 --> 00:08:08,792
And then when you did, I was like,

190
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,128
"I guess I should see
how far I can take it

191
00:08:11,196 --> 00:08:12,463
'cause you know, it'll be funnier."

192
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,497
I'm gonna kill you!

193
00:08:13,565 --> 00:08:14,698
Why are you dressed like that?!

194
00:08:14,766 --> 00:08:16,934
Uh, because I'm the star
of <i>Jolly Farm</i>.

195
00:08:17,002 --> 00:08:19,270
Remember how they only
needed little girls?

196
00:08:19,337 --> 00:08:20,904
Oh, my God.

197
00:08:20,972 --> 00:08:21,905
I'm telling Lois.

198
00:08:21,973 --> 00:08:24,141
You're not telling anybody, friend.

199
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:26,710
No, no, you're gonna
be my on-set guardian.

200
00:08:26,778 --> 00:08:28,145
You're out of your mind.

201
00:08:28,213 --> 00:08:29,647
Brian, we both know I touched it.

202
00:08:29,714 --> 00:08:31,749
Now if you'd like to keep
that just between us,

203
00:08:31,816 --> 00:08:34,318
I suggest you sit back down and
order me some chicken fingers.

204
00:08:35,353 --> 00:08:38,789
See? We're having a nice time.

205
00:08:40,825 --> 00:08:43,694
All right, first scene
up is on page twelve.

206
00:08:43,762 --> 00:08:46,230
Everybody, this is our new
<i>Jolly Farm</i> resident,

207
00:08:46,298 --> 00:08:47,498
Karina Smirnoff.

208
00:08:47,565 --> 00:08:49,166
She'll be playing the role of Mary.

209
00:08:49,234 --> 00:08:51,735
Hello. Hi, I'm Julie.

210
00:08:55,607 --> 00:08:57,141
Oh, hello, I'm Stew...

211
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,208
uh, I'm Karina.

212
00:08:58,276 --> 00:08:59,910
Can we get some quiet on the set?

213
00:08:59,978 --> 00:09:00,944
I'm trying to rehearse!

214
00:09:01,012 --> 00:09:02,012
Quiet on the set!

215
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,080
Don't mind Randall.

216
00:09:03,148 --> 00:09:04,782
He's getting into character.

217
00:09:04,849 --> 00:09:06,050
Is he playing a dick?

218
00:09:06,117 --> 00:09:07,284
All right, everybody, here we go.

219
00:09:07,352 --> 00:09:09,386
Scene ten. Places, please.

220
00:09:09,454 --> 00:09:11,121
And... Action!

221
00:09:11,189 --> 00:09:13,757
Oh, it's so great being
here on Jolly Farm.

222
00:09:13,825 --> 00:09:16,060
Let's go to the barn
and meet the animals.

223
00:09:16,127 --> 00:09:17,161
Yeah! Hey, Mary,

224
00:09:17,228 --> 00:09:19,330
bet I'll beat you to the barn!

225
00:09:19,397 --> 00:09:20,798
That sounds like

226
00:09:20,865 --> 00:09:22,499
a really chauvinistic presumption.

227
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:25,569
I mean, because I'm a woman,
you think you'll beat me?

228
00:09:25,637 --> 00:09:27,504
A man is automatically
better than a woman

229
00:09:27,572 --> 00:09:29,106
at any physical challenge?

230
00:09:29,174 --> 00:09:32,443
Well, here are a few women who
might beat you to the barn:

231
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,511
Joanie Benoit,
Jackie Joyner Kersey,

232
00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:36,947
Babe Didrikson Zaharias,
Mary Decker, Zola Budd...

233
00:09:37,015 --> 00:09:38,148
Cut!

234
00:09:38,216 --> 00:09:40,884
Karina, your line is,
"That sounds fun."

235
00:09:40,952 --> 00:09:42,286
Well, yes, Dan, but I felt

236
00:09:42,354 --> 00:09:43,921
that just because we're on a farm,

237
00:09:43,988 --> 00:09:46,523
it doesn't mean we have to
be stuck in the 19th century

238
00:09:46,591 --> 00:09:47,591
with our value system.

239
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:49,660
Mary needs to stand up for herself.

240
00:09:49,728 --> 00:09:52,830
Hmm... Interesting.
I suppose we don't really have

241
00:09:52,897 --> 00:09:54,898
an outspoken female
character on the show.

242
00:09:54,966 --> 00:09:56,200
All right, Karina,

243
00:09:56,267 --> 00:09:57,768
we'll try it your way
and see what happens.

244
00:09:57,836 --> 00:09:59,269
Good luck.

245
00:09:59,337 --> 00:10:01,004
She'll be gone in three episodes.

246
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:07,711
♪ Go, Stewie, go! ♪

247
00:10:09,681 --> 00:10:14,451
♪ Roll, Stewie, roll! ♪

248
00:10:16,521 --> 00:10:21,925
♪ Sweet Stewie roll! ♪

249
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:30,601
Hi, Anthony.

250
00:10:30,668 --> 00:10:32,302
Hi, Mrs. Griffin.

251
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,104
You know, we've enjoyed having you

252
00:10:34,172 --> 00:10:37,241
around so much lately,
so we got a little

253
00:10:37,308 --> 00:10:40,043
"welcome to the family"
present for you.

254
00:10:40,111 --> 00:10:43,113
Your husband's work and
poker game schedule?

255
00:10:43,181 --> 00:10:45,048
My menstrual cycle's on there, too,

256
00:10:45,116 --> 00:10:46,984
but I don't mind if you don't.

257
00:10:47,051 --> 00:10:48,118
Uh, thanks.

258
00:10:48,186 --> 00:10:50,487
Oh, by the way, Meg,
I forgot to tell you,

259
00:10:50,555 --> 00:10:53,157
your grandfather needs you to
pick him up at the airport.

260
00:10:53,224 --> 00:10:56,160
Ugh, grandpa always makes me
so nervous when I'm driving.

261
00:11:00,298 --> 00:11:02,132
Okay, now me.

262
00:11:02,901 --> 00:11:04,134
That's a stop sign!

263
00:11:04,202 --> 00:11:05,335
Anthony, you want to come with me?

264
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:06,670
Sure.

265
00:11:06,738 --> 00:11:07,905
Oh, don't be ridiculous,

266
00:11:07,972 --> 00:11:09,540
I'll keep him company
till you get back.

267
00:11:09,607 --> 00:11:11,241
Good-bye, Meg.

268
00:11:12,277 --> 00:11:13,610
Let's not play games.

269
00:11:13,678 --> 00:11:15,279
The other day you
said I was attractive.

270
00:11:15,346 --> 00:11:16,914
Now, what are we gonna do about it?

271
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:18,081
Oh, my God.

272
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:19,650
Wow, this is so cool.

273
00:11:19,717 --> 00:11:22,152
I've never had a MILF
come on to me before.

274
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,154
Can I... can I kiss you?

275
00:11:24,222 --> 00:11:25,522
Let me ask you this:

276
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,191
Do my gray hairs bother you?

277
00:11:27,258 --> 00:11:28,559
What gray hairs?

278
00:11:28,626 --> 00:11:30,928
Oh, kiss me!

279
00:11:32,664 --> 00:11:34,231
Mom, I forgot my keys.

280
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:35,365
Do you know where...

281
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:38,402
Um... Rape?

282
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,581
Hey, another batch
of fan mail, Karina.

283
00:11:50,648 --> 00:11:52,382
Oh, careful, Sam,

284
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,218
you're emptying your
sack all over me.

285
00:11:54,285 --> 00:11:56,186
What?!

286
00:11:56,254 --> 00:11:57,855
Stewie, how the hell long

287
00:11:57,922 --> 00:11:59,389
do you think you can
keep up this charade?

288
00:11:59,457 --> 00:12:01,692
I will keep up this "charahhd"

289
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:04,294
as it's pronounced, Brian,
as long as I see fit.

290
00:12:04,362 --> 00:12:05,429
Ooh, ooh, shh, shh, shh.

291
00:12:05,497 --> 00:12:06,463
Hi, Karina.

292
00:12:06,531 --> 00:12:07,631
Oh, hi, Julie.

293
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:09,333
God, I love your makeup.

294
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,001
You know, I'm thinking
of asking them

295
00:12:11,069 --> 00:12:12,469
to do my makeup like yours.

296
00:12:12,537 --> 00:12:14,037
Oh, you don't need makeup.

297
00:12:14,105 --> 00:12:16,139
I mean, I need all
the help I can get,

298
00:12:16,207 --> 00:12:17,674
but you have such a youthful look,

299
00:12:17,742 --> 00:12:18,909
you could pass for eleven months.

300
00:12:18,977 --> 00:12:21,144
Ugh, then why do I
feel like fourty months?

301
00:12:21,212 --> 00:12:23,113
You've got to stop
doing that to yourself.

302
00:12:23,181 --> 00:12:24,882
You're fantastic.

303
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:27,718
Oh, I think you're the
nicest person I've ever met.

304
00:12:27,785 --> 00:12:30,387
Hey, baby, you ready
to go take a nap?

305
00:12:30,455 --> 00:12:32,523
Oh, okay, Randall.

306
00:12:34,325 --> 00:12:35,792
I don't think that
guy's right for her.

307
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,094
Do you see the way he treats her?

308
00:12:37,161 --> 00:12:38,295
Why do you care?

309
00:12:38,363 --> 00:12:41,465
Because... I think
I'm in love with her.

310
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:42,666
Whenever I talk to her,

311
00:12:42,734 --> 00:12:44,268
it makes my band-aid
start to peel off.

312
00:12:44,335 --> 00:12:45,569
What are you talking about?

313
00:12:45,637 --> 00:12:46,904
I'm talking about my thing.

314
00:12:46,971 --> 00:12:48,305
Gotta hide it for the cameras.

315
00:12:48,373 --> 00:12:50,007
Instead of tucking,
I just push it in

316
00:12:50,074 --> 00:12:51,308
like a button and put
a band-aid over it.

317
00:12:51,376 --> 00:12:52,476
What kind of band-aid?

318
00:12:52,544 --> 00:12:53,644
Big one.

319
00:12:53,711 --> 00:12:54,945
Big giant one.

320
00:12:55,013 --> 00:12:57,514
Nah, just one of those little
dots you put on a shot.

321
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,597
Okay, Brian, watch.

322
00:13:03,665 --> 00:13:04,965
Here comes my big part.

323
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:09,136
Oh, here comes large bird and
moody green garbage creature.

324
00:13:09,204 --> 00:13:11,272
Wow, you're a big bird.

325
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:13,674
And I'm grouchy,
so get out of my way!

326
00:13:13,742 --> 00:13:16,043
You watch that tone,
moody green garbage creature,

327
00:13:16,111 --> 00:13:19,179
or I'll get Bernie and Gert
over here to kick your butt.

328
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:20,881
Is there a problem here?

329
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:23,384
Yeah, you need us to use our fists?

330
00:13:23,451 --> 00:13:24,885
Look at Julie, Brian.

331
00:13:24,953 --> 00:13:27,454
She's absolutely beautiful.

332
00:13:30,859 --> 00:13:32,126
Julie?!

333
00:13:32,194 --> 00:13:33,627
Hi, we were just talking about you.

334
00:13:33,695 --> 00:13:35,396
Oh, hi, do I know you?

335
00:13:35,463 --> 00:13:36,497
Oh, right.

336
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,332
Yeah, no, you don't,
you know Karina.

337
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,567
I'm her brother, Stewie.

338
00:13:39,634 --> 00:13:40,935
It's nice to meet you.

339
00:13:41,002 --> 00:13:42,570
Is she home? Oh, yeah,
yeah, she's upstairs.

340
00:13:42,637 --> 00:13:43,737
Come in.

341
00:13:43,805 --> 00:13:46,040
Brian, you've met Julie, right?

342
00:13:46,107 --> 00:13:48,242
Julie's my sister's co-star
on <i>Jolly Farm</i>.

343
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,410
Hi, Brian.

344
00:13:49,477 --> 00:13:50,744
Why don't you keep her company,

345
00:13:50,812 --> 00:13:52,046
while I go fetch Karina.

346
00:13:52,113 --> 00:13:54,281
Just make sure you get her fast.

347
00:13:54,349 --> 00:13:55,883
Karina?
Yes?

348
00:13:55,951 --> 00:13:57,284
You have a visitor.
Who is it?

349
00:13:57,352 --> 00:13:59,553
It's that nice girl,
Julie, from your show.

350
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:01,555
Oh, Julie, did she
say what she wanted?

351
00:14:01,623 --> 00:14:02,823
Just go see for yourself,

352
00:14:02,891 --> 00:14:04,325
I'm not your secretary, Karina.

353
00:14:04,392 --> 00:14:05,359
Why are you so cruel to me?

354
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,594
Is it because I'm the pretty one?

355
00:14:06,661 --> 00:14:08,596
The talented one?
Oh, for God's sakes.

356
00:14:08,663 --> 00:14:09,597
You know, we're all sick of you!

357
00:14:09,664 --> 00:14:10,664
That's right, all of us!

358
00:14:10,732 --> 00:14:13,167
Sick of me?! Oh, that's rich.

359
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:14,602
You know, I wasn't
going to say this,

360
00:14:14,669 --> 00:14:16,170
but Mother hates you.

361
00:14:16,238 --> 00:14:17,805
That's not true,
you take that back!

362
00:14:17,873 --> 00:14:19,406
It is true, she hates you!

363
00:14:19,474 --> 00:14:21,542
She told me, it was the
Christmas we all went

364
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,477
to Edaville Railroad, and you cried

365
00:14:23,545 --> 00:14:25,412
because you were afraid
because one of Santa's elves

366
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,248
was a real midget, and Father said,

367
00:14:27,315 --> 00:14:29,149
"That's it, I can't
take this anymore,"

368
00:14:29,217 --> 00:14:30,918
and he left that very night

369
00:14:30,986 --> 00:14:33,554
and all you cared about was
ice cream on the way home

370
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,322
and Mother said you didn't
appreciate anything!

371
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,490
- Karina!
- Coming!

372
00:14:36,558 --> 00:14:38,492
Hello, Julie.

373
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,060
So nice to see you.

374
00:14:40,128 --> 00:14:41,362
Please.

375
00:14:41,429 --> 00:14:42,796
Two lemonades, Brian.

376
00:14:42,864 --> 00:14:44,431
Oh, yeah, I'll go
make you a lemonade.

377
00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:45,766
I'll make you a fresh one.

378
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:47,468
So, what brings you here?

379
00:14:47,535 --> 00:14:49,303
Well, I wanted to see
if you could come over

380
00:14:49,371 --> 00:14:51,038
to my house tonight
and run lines with me.

381
00:14:51,106 --> 00:14:53,107
Don't you usually do
that with Randall?

382
00:14:53,174 --> 00:14:54,742
We kind of had a fight.

383
00:14:54,809 --> 00:14:56,410
Oh, I'm sorry.

384
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,746
I thought maybe you and I could
have a sleepover tonight.

385
00:14:58,813 --> 00:15:00,114
You know, a little girl time.

386
00:15:00,181 --> 00:15:01,548
Oh, that would be so fun.

387
00:15:01,616 --> 00:15:03,417
Yes, let's. Terrific.

388
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:04,652
I can't wait.

389
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:06,420
Hey, do you mind if I say
good-bye to your brother?

390
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:09,023
Fine.

391
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,190
Stewie!

392
00:15:10,258 --> 00:15:11,358
What?

393
00:15:11,426 --> 00:15:13,127
Julie would like to
say goodbye to you.

394
00:15:13,194 --> 00:15:14,361
Well? Answer me.

395
00:15:14,429 --> 00:15:15,462
I'm not talking to you!

396
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,264
You're being a baby.
Go say good-bye.

397
00:15:17,332 --> 00:15:18,399
Why? She's your friend.

398
00:15:18,466 --> 00:15:20,067
And why should I do you any favors

399
00:15:20,135 --> 00:15:21,902
after the terrible things
you said to me earlier?

400
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:24,038
Well, at least I didn't bring
up that time at Brigham's

401
00:15:24,105 --> 00:15:26,173
when you showed your fanny to
that girl in the wheelchair!

402
00:15:26,241 --> 00:15:28,042
- Julie's gone!
- That's fine, Brian,

403
00:15:28,109 --> 00:15:29,543
we're having a
conversation up here!

404
00:15:29,611 --> 00:15:31,445
That girl in the wheelchair
called me a name!

405
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:34,214
Yes, well, that gives you
no right to be a blaggard!

406
00:15:40,121 --> 00:15:42,723
Meg, honey,
I think we need to talk.

407
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:43,958
I don't want to talk to you.

408
00:15:44,025 --> 00:15:45,025
Get out!

409
00:15:45,093 --> 00:15:47,227
Look, I understand
that you're upset.

410
00:15:47,295 --> 00:15:49,396
You made out with my boyfriend!

411
00:15:49,464 --> 00:15:50,864
How could you do that?

412
00:15:50,932 --> 00:15:54,335
I don't know, sweetheart,
but I am so, so sorry.

413
00:15:54,402 --> 00:15:55,903
It was an awful thing that I did.

414
00:15:55,971 --> 00:15:57,738
I never meant to
steal him from you.

415
00:15:57,806 --> 00:15:59,340
Is that what you think?

416
00:15:59,407 --> 00:16:00,908
You stole him from me?

417
00:16:00,976 --> 00:16:02,076
Are you kidding?

418
00:16:02,143 --> 00:16:03,744
You couldn't steal him from me.

419
00:16:03,812 --> 00:16:06,213
Well, I do know a few things, Meg.

420
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:08,349
And clearly, if I wanted
him I could have him.

421
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,751
You really think
you stand a chance?

422
00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:13,420
Look at you, you're old,
you're nothing.

423
00:16:13,488 --> 00:16:16,223
You couldn't even imagine
the things I do for him.

424
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:19,927
And this isn't about making out;
this is about power tools.

425
00:16:19,995 --> 00:16:22,363
Yeah, I go to places you
couldn't get back from.

426
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,697
I'll do anything.

427
00:16:23,765 --> 00:16:25,032
You don't know me.

428
00:16:26,534 --> 00:16:28,569
Oh, my God!

429
00:16:28,636 --> 00:16:30,104
He hangs me from the shower rod

430
00:16:30,171 --> 00:16:31,905
with your old bras,
and then we laugh at you.

431
00:16:31,973 --> 00:16:34,074
Now get out of my room!

432
00:16:34,142 --> 00:16:37,444
Well, when you're ready to talk.

433
00:16:40,148 --> 00:16:41,882
Are you okay in there, Karina?

434
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,217
Be right out!

435
00:16:43,284 --> 00:16:44,885
Just rinsing off my Noxzema.

436
00:16:44,953 --> 00:16:46,253
I'm so glad you came over.

437
00:16:46,321 --> 00:16:48,856
Oh, so am I, Jules;
it's been so fun.

438
00:16:48,923 --> 00:16:52,426
So, I guess I sleep in the
guest room or whatnot?

439
00:16:52,494 --> 00:16:54,161
No, you can sleep in here with me.

440
00:16:54,229 --> 00:16:58,265
Oh, well, my goodness,
I hope there's room for both of us.

441
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,567
I'll just have to squeeze in here.

442
00:17:00,635 --> 00:17:02,770
Well, good night, Karina.

443
00:17:02,837 --> 00:17:06,807
You know, I really like
spending time with you, Julie.

444
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,308
Me, too.

445
00:17:08,376 --> 00:17:09,543
Why couldn't we just
have girlfriends

446
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,311
- instead of boyfriends?
- I know.

447
00:17:11,379 --> 00:17:14,248
It's all just one big,
confusing mess.

448
00:17:14,315 --> 00:17:16,050
Can I snuggle with you?

449
00:17:16,117 --> 00:17:18,018
Uh-huh.

450
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,858
Good night, Julie.

451
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,034
Well, I hope you're happy, Peter.

452
00:17:34,102 --> 00:17:36,603
Our daughter hates me and
it's all because of you!

453
00:17:36,671 --> 00:17:38,238
Me? What the hell did I do?

454
00:17:38,306 --> 00:17:39,807
You've made me feel
so unattractive lately

455
00:17:39,874 --> 00:17:41,141
that I went and did something

456
00:17:41,209 --> 00:17:44,178
disgusting and abhorrent
and I'm ashamed of myself.

457
00:17:44,245 --> 00:17:46,246
Peter, I made out
with Meg's boyfriend.

458
00:17:46,314 --> 00:17:48,749
You made out
with Meg's boyfriend?

459
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,217
How the hell could
you do that to me?

460
00:17:50,285 --> 00:17:52,820
Because, Peter, you've been
making me feel old and fat

461
00:17:52,887 --> 00:17:55,122
and unattractive and worthless.

462
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,757
How do you expect me to respond?

463
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,793
Lois, I think you're the
most beautiful woman

464
00:17:59,861 --> 00:18:01,295
I ever seen in my life.

465
00:18:01,362 --> 00:18:03,464
Well, but then why
have you been saying

466
00:18:03,531 --> 00:18:05,065
all these horrible things?

467
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:08,769
Because I'm old and fat and
unattractive and worthless.

468
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:11,371
I guess I thought that if
I could bring you down,

469
00:18:11,439 --> 00:18:13,507
you wouldn't start to notice
that you're too good for me

470
00:18:13,575 --> 00:18:15,275
and run off looking
for another fella.

471
00:18:15,343 --> 00:18:17,611
Peter, that's ridiculous.

472
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,946
I love you.

473
00:18:19,013 --> 00:18:20,514
Why?

474
00:18:20,582 --> 00:18:22,549
Maybe I like fat guys.

475
00:18:22,617 --> 00:18:23,717
You do?

476
00:18:23,785 --> 00:18:26,487
Maybe I like having
sex with fat guys.

477
00:18:26,554 --> 00:18:27,754
Yeah?

478
00:18:27,822 --> 00:18:30,924
Maybe I want to have sex
with a fat guy right now.

479
00:18:30,992 --> 00:18:34,194
Well, maybe I want to have
sex with an ugly, old broad.

480
00:18:34,262 --> 00:18:35,596
- Peter!
- Gotcha!

481
00:18:35,663 --> 00:18:37,131
Wow!

482
00:18:43,404 --> 00:18:45,305
I'm going insane, Brian.

483
00:18:45,373 --> 00:18:47,341
I don't know how much
longer I can keep this up.

484
00:18:47,408 --> 00:18:49,776
I've got to tell Julie
my true feelings.

485
00:18:49,844 --> 00:18:50,878
So, tell her.

486
00:18:50,945 --> 00:18:52,212
Have you heard, Karina?

487
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,881
We're gonna be doing
the show live today.

488
00:18:53,948 --> 00:18:55,149
I'm so nervous,

489
00:18:55,216 --> 00:18:57,417
I've never been on live TV before.

490
00:18:57,485 --> 00:18:59,219
Would you give me a hug for luck?

491
00:19:02,624 --> 00:19:05,259
No... no... no... no... no...
I'm not done yet.

492
00:19:05,326 --> 00:19:07,294
Karina, what are you...

493
00:19:08,363 --> 00:19:10,297
Oh... oh... I'm not...

494
00:19:10,365 --> 00:19:11,932
I'm not a lesbian.

495
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,534
No... no... I'm not either!

496
00:19:13,601 --> 00:19:14,768
What are you exactly?

497
00:19:14,836 --> 00:19:16,436
I'm sorry, Karina.

498
00:19:16,504 --> 00:19:19,173
If only you were a boy.

499
00:19:20,108 --> 00:19:23,143
But... I am a boy.

500
00:19:23,211 --> 00:19:25,279
Okay, everybody,
we're live in five.

501
00:19:25,346 --> 00:19:27,080
You'd better get out there.

502
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:31,652
Four, three, two...

503
00:19:31,719 --> 00:19:35,722
Good morning and
welcome to Jolly Farm.

504
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:39,026
Today we're going to learn
about the letter "T."

505
00:19:39,093 --> 00:19:41,495
I've got something to say,
Mother Maggie.

506
00:19:41,563 --> 00:19:42,729
You do?

507
00:19:42,797 --> 00:19:44,765
Well, maybe that can
wait till later, Mary.

508
00:19:44,832 --> 00:19:47,367
No, I think this needs
to come out now.

509
00:19:47,435 --> 00:19:51,271
You see, I didn't move to
Jolly Farm from the big city

510
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:52,906
to be around animals.

511
00:19:52,974 --> 00:19:56,476
I moved here because my uncle
was molesting my sister,

512
00:19:56,544 --> 00:19:59,246
and my parents wanted
her to start a new life.

513
00:19:59,314 --> 00:20:01,648
But my sister Mary shot
herself in the face,

514
00:20:01,716 --> 00:20:04,918
and that's when I decided that
she would live on through me.

515
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:07,788
For I am not who you think I am.

516
00:20:07,855 --> 00:20:10,524
I am not little Mary Sunflower,

517
00:20:10,592 --> 00:20:13,827
daughter of Bradley
and Theresa Sunflower.

518
00:20:13,895 --> 00:20:15,829
No, I'm not.

519
00:20:15,897 --> 00:20:17,464
I'm Desmond Sunflower!

520
00:20:17,532 --> 00:20:20,067
Desmond Sunflower and I'm a boy!

521
00:20:23,071 --> 00:20:25,572
A perfectly normal little boy.

522
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,176
Who also happens to
be a transvestite.

523
00:20:29,244 --> 00:20:31,979
Which begins with the letter "T."

524
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:38,681
I'm ready.

525
00:20:38,749 --> 00:20:39,815
Did you talk to Julie?

526
00:20:39,883 --> 00:20:41,450
Her mother won't let me see her.

527
00:20:41,518 --> 00:20:43,853
It doesn't matter anyway,
she's back with Randall.

528
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,421
Oh, I'm sorry.

529
00:20:45,489 --> 00:20:47,390
Hey, why were they
shooting that scene live?

530
00:20:47,457 --> 00:20:49,191
- Convenience.
- Yeah, but why'd they...

531
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:51,060
Let's not start pulling
threads on this one.

532
00:20:51,128 --> 00:20:53,062
- Can we go home?
- Sure.

533
00:20:55,999 --> 00:20:57,800
You want to get some ice cream?

534
00:20:57,868 --> 00:20:59,268
Well, why not?

535
00:20:59,336 --> 00:21:01,370
I don't have to fit
in that dress anymore.

536
00:21:01,438 --> 00:21:04,073
Hey, can I borrow the dress?

537
00:21:04,141 --> 00:21:05,374
- What?
- Nah, I'm just kidding.

538
00:21:05,442 --> 00:21:06,509
I'm just doing some playful,

539
00:21:06,576 --> 00:21:08,778
walking-away banter
during the music.

540
00:21:08,845 --> 00:21:09,879
Can we not do that?

541
00:21:09,946 --> 00:21:10,980
I have such a headache.

542
00:21:11,047 --> 00:21:11,815
Sorry.

543
00:21:11,816 --> 00:21:12,816
