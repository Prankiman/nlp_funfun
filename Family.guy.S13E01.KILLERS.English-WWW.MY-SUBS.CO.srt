MAN (on TV): We now return
to the<i> All in the Family</i>

13
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,283
and<i> Modern Family</i>
crossover episode.

14
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:40,484
Hello,
Mr. Bunker.

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,819
We brought
some hummus.

16
00:00:41,855 --> 00:00:43,821
Oh, yeah, I knew
them two was hummus

17
00:00:43,857 --> 00:00:45,623
the minute
they walked in the door.

18
00:00:45,658 --> 00:00:49,460
Yay! A crossover always brings
out the best in each show!

19
00:00:49,495 --> 00:00:51,863
It certainly doesn't smack
of desperation.

20
00:00:51,898 --> 00:00:53,965
The priorities
are always creative,

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,499
and not driven
by marketing or...

22
00:00:55,535 --> 00:00:56,968
Okay, that's
enough.

23
00:00:57,003 --> 00:00:58,936
Oh, my God!
What is it, Peter?

24
00:00:58,972 --> 00:01:01,372
Look at this. Dennis the Menace
is just shoveling snow.

25
00:01:01,407 --> 00:01:02,974
He's being helpful.

26
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:04,842
Might as well just
call it<i> Dennis</i> now.

27
00:01:04,878 --> 00:01:06,444
He's not a menace.

28
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,312
Not every strip
is gonna be hilarious.

29
00:01:08,348 --> 00:01:10,781
You know something? I could
do better than these idiots.

30
00:01:10,817 --> 00:01:13,050
I should just go down to
the paper and sell 'em my own.

31
00:01:13,086 --> 00:01:15,286
Well, Peter, you might be
underestimating the difficulty

32
00:01:15,288 --> 00:01:16,854
of writing a comic strip.

33
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,423
As someone who occasionally
dates the creative muse,

34
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:22,693
I can vouch for the unforgiving
face of a blank sheet of paper.

35
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:25,229
In fact, I think it was
William Faulkner who said...

36
00:01:25,265 --> 00:01:27,498
I'm back. I'm published.
Check it out.

37
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,104
I call my comic
<i>For Pete's Sake,</i>

38
00:01:33,139 --> 00:01:34,572
because it points out things

39
00:01:34,607 --> 00:01:37,441
that make you shake your head
and say, "For Pete's sake."

40
00:01:37,477 --> 00:01:38,943
This one's for tomorrow.

41
00:01:42,982 --> 00:01:44,181
These are
good, Peter.

42
00:01:44,217 --> 00:01:46,117
I like how
you retell tired old gags

43
00:01:46,152 --> 00:01:48,185
with a detached,
ironic approach.

44
00:01:48,221 --> 00:01:50,054
Yeah, plus,
it's all brand-new jokes

45
00:01:50,089 --> 00:01:51,622
that I'm really,
really serious about.

46
00:01:51,658 --> 00:01:52,990
Well, good for you, Peter,

47
00:01:53,026 --> 00:01:54,959
but how did you get published
so quickly?

48
00:01:54,994 --> 00:01:57,328
Ah, the editor of the paper
owed me a favor.

49
00:01:57,363 --> 00:01:58,996
I got him a picture
of Spider-Man.

50
00:01:59,032 --> 00:02:01,666
Why can't anyone get me
a picture of the Spider-Man?!

51
00:02:01,701 --> 00:02:03,334
Here you go.

52
00:02:05,972 --> 00:02:09,507
Yeah, I got a whole subreddit
of superhero thong shots.

53
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:14,879
Here's your beer, Peter.

54
00:02:14,914 --> 00:02:16,314
Thanks, Jerome.
What do I owe you?

55
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:18,816
Nah, you already
paid me... in laughs.

56
00:02:18,851 --> 00:02:20,451
(laughs)

57
00:02:23,823 --> 00:02:25,356
I do a lot of island ones.

58
00:02:25,391 --> 00:02:26,624
Peter, you
should do one

59
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:28,693
where a baseball player
can't steal second,

60
00:02:28,728 --> 00:02:30,428
'cause he's
on probation.

61
00:02:30,463 --> 00:02:32,029
For drug crimes.

62
00:02:32,065 --> 00:02:33,331
Political.

63
00:02:33,366 --> 00:02:35,032
Yeah, you put an island
in there, you're in business.

64
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:36,801
Hey, how about one
where you draw a sock,

65
00:02:36,836 --> 00:02:38,302
and it says "Sock it to me,"

66
00:02:38,338 --> 00:02:40,671
or-or maybe draw Lois
taking a hot-tub dump,

67
00:02:40,707 --> 00:02:42,540
and she just says whatever?

68
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,448
Peter, your comic
in this morning's paper

69
00:02:50,483 --> 00:02:52,249
is really offensive.

70
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:56,887
(giggling)

71
00:02:56,923 --> 00:02:58,556
That's not funny, Peter.

72
00:02:58,591 --> 00:03:00,224
Ah, you're just not
getting it, Lois.

73
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:02,159
See, his wife washed
dishes for him.

74
00:03:02,195 --> 00:03:03,694
Oh, for Pete's sake.

75
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,230
Aha! There you go.

76
00:03:06,265 --> 00:03:07,498
Peter, you should see this.

77
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:08,833
Your dishwasher cartoon

78
00:03:08,868 --> 00:03:10,501
has really outraged
the online community.

79
00:03:10,536 --> 00:03:11,769
What?

80
00:03:11,804 --> 00:03:13,170
Gosh, it's not
like the Internet

81
00:03:13,206 --> 00:03:15,239
to go crazy about something
small and stupid.

82
00:03:15,274 --> 00:03:16,607
Peter, you have
to apologize.

83
00:03:16,642 --> 00:03:17,908
What, because of a joke?

84
00:03:17,944 --> 00:03:19,143
Not just a joke, Peter.

85
00:03:19,178 --> 00:03:21,412
A joke that angered some bloggers.
(sighs)

86
00:03:21,447 --> 00:03:22,913
Well, I guess this
ain't the first time

87
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:25,016
I got in trouble for something
I said about a woman.

88
00:03:26,552 --> 00:03:28,853
Oh, good.
We can steal.

89
00:03:34,794 --> 00:03:36,594
And welcome back
to<i> The Flow.</i>

90
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:37,862
We're talking
to Peter Griffin,

91
00:03:37,897 --> 00:03:39,864
the artist behind
<i>For Pete's Sake,</i>

92
00:03:39,899 --> 00:03:42,700
which has caused outrage
with a misogynistic comic.

93
00:03:42,735 --> 00:03:44,235
Here's a video
of some outrage.

94
00:03:46,272 --> 00:03:48,139
(chanting in native language)

95
00:03:48,174 --> 00:03:50,074
ALL:
Boo!

96
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:51,876
Yeah, those boos
don't hurt so much

97
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:54,145
'cause you spent two minutes
of the last segment

98
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,913
applauding a red velvet cake.

99
00:03:55,948 --> 00:03:57,381
AUDIENCE:
Ah!

100
00:03:57,417 --> 00:03:59,617
(applause)

101
00:03:59,652 --> 00:04:01,052
And if that's not bad enough,

102
00:04:01,087 --> 00:04:02,653
this morning's cartoon
is even worse.

103
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,088
Let's put that up.

104
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,925
(audience booing)

105
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,061
(booing continues)

106
00:04:10,096 --> 00:04:11,896
Mr. Griffin,
do you really think

107
00:04:11,931 --> 00:04:13,597
this is an
appropriate cartoon

108
00:04:13,633 --> 00:04:15,433
to run on Gloria Steinem's
half-birthday?

109
00:04:15,468 --> 00:04:16,600
You sound angry.

110
00:04:16,636 --> 00:04:18,235
Did one of your
friends get engaged?

111
00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:21,072
You have no idea how offensive
you are to women, do you?

112
00:04:21,107 --> 00:04:22,273
What?! I love women.

113
00:04:22,308 --> 00:04:24,508
I bet I can name more
porn stars than you.

114
00:04:24,544 --> 00:04:26,811
But-but don't tell my wife
how many porn stars I know.

115
00:04:26,846 --> 00:04:28,245
I'll get in a
lot of trouble.

116
00:04:28,281 --> 00:04:29,513
I know all of
'em, though.

117
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:30,681
There are people

118
00:04:30,716 --> 00:04:32,349
who just started an hour
ago, and I know 'em.

119
00:04:32,385 --> 00:04:35,352
(angry shouting)

120
00:04:35,388 --> 00:04:37,121
Your cartoon is sexist!

121
00:04:37,156 --> 00:04:38,756
Down with misogyny!

122
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:42,493
It wasn't even funny, and
I have a great sense of humor.

123
00:04:42,528 --> 00:04:44,762
Man, they seem really upset.

124
00:04:44,797 --> 00:04:46,597
I was just trying
to make people laugh.

125
00:04:46,632 --> 00:04:48,466
Dad, I'm worried
they're gonna hurt us.

126
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:49,834
No, no,
they're angry, Chris,

127
00:04:49,869 --> 00:04:51,836
but they ain't
gonna get violent.

128
00:04:51,871 --> 00:04:54,171
Oh, cool!
That brick I ordered.

129
00:04:54,207 --> 00:04:56,240
Wait a minute.
I didn't order<i> this</i> brick.

130
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:57,475
You may be right, Chris.

131
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,043
Peter, this is
getting out of hand.

132
00:04:59,078 --> 00:05:00,711
I don't feel safe
in my own home.

133
00:05:00,746 --> 00:05:03,013
Maybe we should get out
of Quahog for a while.

134
00:05:03,049 --> 00:05:04,348
You know, she's right.

135
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,050
We should get out of town
till this all blows over.

136
00:05:06,085 --> 00:05:08,152
Okay, we'll go,
but just give me a minute.

137
00:05:08,187 --> 00:05:10,521
I just want to turn in
my last<i> For Pete's Sake.</i>

138
00:05:11,657 --> 00:05:13,424
<i>I'm like Michael Jordan:</i>

139
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:17,061
<i>going out on top amid a flurry</i>
<i>of gambling rumors.</i>

140
00:05:28,605 --> 00:05:30,203
Peter, where are we?

141
00:05:30,203 --> 00:05:31,645
I don't know.
I just woke up, too.

142
00:05:31,646 --> 00:05:33,513
I tied the steering
wheel to my belt.

143
00:05:33,547 --> 00:05:36,348
I figure we've been on the
road about 20% of the time.

144
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,484
Dad, how long
until we can go back home?

145
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,818
Um, I don't know.

146
00:05:39,854 --> 00:05:41,620
How long do women
hold grudges?

147
00:05:41,655 --> 00:05:43,188
Not very long,
I'm guessing.

148
00:05:43,224 --> 00:05:45,157
Oh, Peter, we've been
driving all night.

149
00:05:45,192 --> 00:05:46,792
Pull over
to that gas station.

150
00:05:46,827 --> 00:05:48,927
We can use the bathroom
and stretch our legs.

151
00:05:48,963 --> 00:05:50,129
You got it, babe.

152
00:05:50,164 --> 00:05:51,597
Did you call me "babe"?

153
00:05:51,632 --> 00:05:52,431
I did.

154
00:05:52,466 --> 00:05:54,266
Oh, Peter.

155
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,369
Ew! Mom!

156
00:05:57,404 --> 00:06:00,139
You'll never
have this, Meg.

157
00:06:02,977 --> 00:06:04,610
All right, back
in the car, kids.

158
00:06:04,645 --> 00:06:06,712
For this leg of the
trip, I was thinking

159
00:06:06,747 --> 00:06:09,148
of driving with my shirt
off like New Mexico trash.

160
00:06:12,386 --> 00:06:14,319
Oh, my God!
Our car!

161
00:06:14,355 --> 00:06:15,721
Someone's stealing it.

162
00:06:15,756 --> 00:06:16,922
Ah, crap.

163
00:06:16,157 --> 00:06:17,323
Although, I got to say,

164
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:19,659
you never get to see
somebody else driving your car.

165
00:06:19,694 --> 00:06:21,294
It's kind of cool.
Kind of weird.

166
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:22,528
We're stuck
here, Peter!

167
00:06:22,564 --> 00:06:24,263
And we don't even
know where we are.

168
00:06:24,299 --> 00:06:26,632
Well, there's a sign.

169
00:06:26,668 --> 00:06:29,435
(theme from<i> The Simpsons</i> plays)

170
00:06:43,385 --> 00:06:45,485
Huh, guess we're in a town
called Springfield.

171
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,487
Springfield, eh?
What state?

172
00:06:47,522 --> 00:06:49,689
I can't imagine
we're allowed to say.

173
00:07:13,381 --> 00:07:15,214
Well, this Springfield place
seems nice.

174
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,582
We should visit here again.

175
00:07:16,618 --> 00:07:18,985
I don't know, Lois. This
seems like a one-shot deal.

176
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,853
Guys, we ain't here
for fun, all right?

177
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:23,189
We're here to find the police,
report our stolen car.

178
00:07:23,224 --> 00:07:24,624
Oh, and don't
drink the water.

179
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:26,793
Everybody around here looks
like they have hepatitis.

180
00:07:26,828 --> 00:07:28,361
Dad, I'm
starving.

181
00:07:28,396 --> 00:07:29,729
Can we get
some food?!

182
00:07:29,764 --> 00:07:32,098
Lois, whip out your boob,
give the boy his lunch.

183
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:33,299
Listen to
the man.

184
00:07:33,334 --> 00:07:35,034
Yeah, Lois,
listen to the man.

185
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,370
How about we just go into
that store there?

186
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:41,240
(bell dings)

187
00:07:41,276 --> 00:07:42,942
Uh, uh, excuse me?

188
00:07:42,977 --> 00:07:45,178
Hello. Welcome
to the Kwik-E-Mart.

189
00:07:45,213 --> 00:07:47,213
(applause)

190
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,783
Oh, I am so sorry.
Let me unplug that.

191
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:53,152
Oh, such a nuisance!

192
00:07:53,188 --> 00:07:54,887
Hello, funny-sounding
Cleveland.

193
00:07:54,923 --> 00:07:56,322
What's the specialty
of the house?

194
00:07:56,357 --> 00:07:58,791
To you, I recommend...
the donut.

195
00:07:58,827 --> 00:08:01,060
(magical chiming)

196
00:08:01,096 --> 00:08:02,462
Ooh!

197
00:08:02,497 --> 00:08:03,830
Yum!

198
00:08:03,865 --> 00:08:06,165
Have you guys seriously
never heard of donuts?

199
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:07,934
These are made
fresh every day.

200
00:08:07,969 --> 00:08:09,936
And then, several days
later, we receive them

201
00:08:09,971 --> 00:08:11,737
and make them available
for purchase.

202
00:08:11,773 --> 00:08:13,506
Hey, are these...
are these free?

203
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:16,676
'Cause I forgot to mention, all
our money is in our stolen car.

204
00:08:16,711 --> 00:08:18,211
Thank you. Come again.

205
00:08:18,246 --> 00:08:21,314
Sir, we can pay you back for
the donuts when we find our car.

206
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:23,883
Do you think that I am moved
by your sob story?

207
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:25,618
I come from a country
where the words

208
00:08:25,653 --> 00:08:27,487
for "sewage" and "beverage"
are the same.

209
00:08:27,522 --> 00:08:29,322
HOMER SIMPSON:
I'll pay for their donuts.

210
00:08:33,128 --> 00:08:34,961
Thank you so
much, sir.

211
00:08:34,996 --> 00:08:36,629
For what?
I didn't say anything.

212
00:08:36,664 --> 00:08:37,797
Oh.

213
00:08:37,832 --> 00:08:39,665
HOMER:
It was me.

214
00:08:42,904 --> 00:08:45,905
How come this convenience store
has so many shadowy parts?

215
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,175
Apu, a dozen donuts for
our albino visitors.

216
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,643
Wow! For real?!

217
00:08:50,678 --> 00:08:53,646
No man should be so poor
he cannot pay for a donut.

218
00:08:53,681 --> 00:08:55,181
I was once you.

219
00:08:55,216 --> 00:08:56,616
I couldn't afford donuts.

220
00:08:56,651 --> 00:08:58,951
Tell them what I did, Apu.
He stole the donuts.

221
00:08:58,987 --> 00:09:00,686
I stole the donuts.

222
00:09:00,722 --> 00:09:02,054
So, here you go.

223
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,856
12... ten...
eight donuts.

224
00:09:03,892 --> 00:09:06,159
That's very nice
of you, Mister...?

225
00:09:06,194 --> 00:09:08,161
Simpson. Homer Simpson.

226
00:09:08,196 --> 00:09:09,562
We're the Griffins.

227
00:09:09,597 --> 00:09:12,131
Peter, Lois, Stewie, and then,
uh, you know, the others.

228
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:14,000
Brian, I guess.

229
00:09:14,035 --> 00:09:16,235
Well, enjoy
your... six donuts.

230
00:09:17,939 --> 00:09:20,406
Mmm. Yummy... donut.

231
00:09:20,441 --> 00:09:22,808
That's pretty good,
but try it like this.

232
00:09:23,945 --> 00:09:26,546
Mmm. Donut.

233
00:09:27,582 --> 00:09:30,349
Mmm. Donut.

234
00:09:30,385 --> 00:09:35,288
I think you and I are
gonna get along just okay.

235
00:09:38,308 --> 00:09:40,075
(cats mewing)

236
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,710
Yeah, all right,
we'll be there.

237
00:09:41,745 --> 00:09:44,112
But if you want
to save us a little time,

238
00:09:44,147 --> 00:09:47,182
you can start
tracing his body with chalk.

239
00:09:47,217 --> 00:09:50,218
This is the
police station.

240
00:09:50,253 --> 00:09:54,656
Be careful. I think some
of them might be cops.

241
00:09:54,691 --> 00:09:56,524
Oh, hey there.
Cool hat, weird nose.

242
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,026
Hey, listen,
my car got stolen.

243
00:09:58,061 --> 00:09:59,394
I was hoping
you could help.

244
00:09:59,429 --> 00:10:00,762
Well, we got
a procedure

245
00:10:00,797 --> 00:10:02,597
for handling alleged
crimes around here.

246
00:10:02,632 --> 00:10:04,299
Let's see. Uh, did
you contribute

247
00:10:04,334 --> 00:10:05,800
to the policeman's ball?

248
00:10:05,836 --> 00:10:07,202
No.

249
00:10:07,237 --> 00:10:09,704
Oh, that's too bad,
'cause he really needs one.

250
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,740
He had an accident last week.

251
00:10:11,775 --> 00:10:14,609
Yeah, I tried to jump
over a parking meter.

252
00:10:14,644 --> 00:10:16,311
Yeah, all right,
well, with no contribution,

253
00:10:16,346 --> 00:10:19,414
your report goes right
into the circular file.

254
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:20,982
I got to be honest.

255
00:10:21,017 --> 00:10:22,650
I don't usually check this file,

256
00:10:22,686 --> 00:10:25,720
so it might be a while
until we find that car of yours.

257
00:10:25,756 --> 00:10:28,990
Uh, Chief, that excuse to
leave you asked for is here.

258
00:10:29,025 --> 00:10:30,825
Oh, sorry,
I got to take this.

259
00:10:30,861 --> 00:10:33,261
It never ends.

260
00:10:36,466 --> 00:10:37,699
Oh, thank you so much

261
00:10:37,734 --> 00:10:39,834
for putting us up
until we find our car.

262
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,570
And thank you for not being
a band of hippie murderers.

263
00:10:42,606 --> 00:10:44,239
And now
this again.

264
00:10:44,274 --> 00:10:46,708
You bring home two bands
of hippie murderers,

265
00:10:46,743 --> 00:10:48,543
and suddenly,
that's all you're about.

266
00:10:48,578 --> 00:10:50,545
Well, what do you say we have
some lunch?

267
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,880
Where's
Bart?

268
00:10:51,915 --> 00:10:53,515
Well, he's at
camp all week.

269
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,550
I'm sorry you
won't get to meet him.

270
00:10:59,489 --> 00:11:01,523
Got kicked out of camp.

271
00:11:01,558 --> 00:11:04,626
I superglued my counselor's
butt cheeks together.

272
00:11:04,661 --> 00:11:05,894
That's terrible.

273
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:09,063
But how did you even get access
to his butt cheeks?

274
00:11:09,099 --> 00:11:11,299
I'm not the only one
who got kicked out of camp.

275
00:11:11,334 --> 00:11:12,433
This is Bart.

276
00:11:12,469 --> 00:11:13,835
Honey, your hands
are filthy.

277
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,370
Go wash up
for lunch.

278
00:11:15,405 --> 00:11:16,871
Eat my shorts!

279
00:11:16,907 --> 00:11:18,206
"Eat my shorts."

280
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:20,542
I love that!
Is that a popular expression,

281
00:11:20,577 --> 00:11:23,011
like "what the deuce"?
Probably more popular.

282
00:11:23,046 --> 00:11:25,146
Probably... probably
way more popular.

283
00:11:25,182 --> 00:11:27,849
Well, here's my room.

284
00:11:27,884 --> 00:11:29,584
Hey, you want to see
my weapons closet?

285
00:11:29,619 --> 00:11:31,886
You have a
weapons closet, too?

286
00:11:31,922 --> 00:11:34,923
♪ ♪

287
00:11:40,096 --> 00:11:42,997
TODD: Ouch! Jesus
heard my mean thought!

288
00:11:43,033 --> 00:11:45,200
A slingshot!
It's so simple and pure.

289
00:11:45,235 --> 00:11:47,335
He doesn't need lasers
or time machines,

290
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,938
just gum balls and marbles
and balls of string.

291
00:11:49,973 --> 00:11:52,207
He's like something
out of Mark Twain!

292
00:11:52,242 --> 00:11:54,242
Whose real name
was Samuel Clemens.

293
00:11:54,277 --> 00:11:56,444
How... how does that further
this conversation?

294
00:11:56,479 --> 00:11:58,847
Hey, you want to make
a prank phone call?

295
00:11:58,882 --> 00:12:00,381
Ooh, prank phone call!

296
00:12:03,486 --> 00:12:05,220
(ringing)

297
00:12:05,255 --> 00:12:06,955
Moe's Tavern.
Moe speaking.

298
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,656
Uh, yeah, I'm looking
for a friend,

299
00:12:08,692 --> 00:12:11,292
last name Keebum,
first name Lee.

300
00:12:11,328 --> 00:12:12,594
Uh, hang on, I'll check.

301
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:14,696
Hey, guys, do I got
a Lee Keebum?

302
00:12:14,731 --> 00:12:17,398
Come on, look at the stools--
is there a Lee Keebum?

303
00:12:17,434 --> 00:12:20,235
Somebody check the rear--
I know I got a Lee Keebum.

304
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,470
Then you probably shouldn't
be handling food.

305
00:12:22,505 --> 00:12:24,472
(laughing loudly)

306
00:12:24,507 --> 00:12:26,341
(laughing over phone)
(laughing)

307
00:12:26,376 --> 00:12:27,909
Oh, my God,
that's amazing!

308
00:12:27,944 --> 00:12:29,477
That's the coolest
thing ever!

309
00:12:29,512 --> 00:12:31,346
Hey, I want to try.
Okay.

310
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,916
Moe's Tavern.

311
00:12:34,951 --> 00:12:37,619
Hello, Moe?
Your sister's being raped.

312
00:12:37,654 --> 00:12:40,221
Is that... is that one?

313
00:12:40,257 --> 00:12:41,689
So, this is my room.

314
00:12:41,725 --> 00:12:43,291

a lot of trophies of your own.

fall on the floor,

347

Yeah-heh-heh!

What's he doing here?

Hey, Chief, we could arrest every single
car thief in Springfield.

00:20:40,492 --> 00:20:42,291
After the show, Lou,

477
00:20:42,327 --> 00:20:44,660
after the show.

478
00:20:55,473 --> 00:21:00,209

I feel like I'm good at nothing!

Hey, everyone gets down
on themselves sometimes.

Those are the days
I'm glad I have my saxophone.

481
00:21:06,918 --> 00:21:07,918
Saxophone?

482
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,585
Yeah. My dad
gave it to me.

483
00:21:09,621 --> 00:21:11,788
My dad once gave me
a gun to hide.

That's terrible.

485

Whenever I feel
any pain or loneliness,

486
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,528
I just play away the blues
on my saxophone.

487
00:21:18,563 --> 00:21:21,130
Huh. I usually
just beat up a cat.

488
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:25,201
Good thing we don't have a cat.

489
00:21:25,236 --> 00:21:27,870
Why don't you
give it a shot?

It was okay, but it would

494
00:22:08,513 --> 00:22:12,014

You and I have quite a day
ahead of us.

You know, Nelson,

501
00:22:43,181 --> 00:22:45,548
I don't doubt that you've
had a twisted childhood.

502
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:46,949
Most evil people have.

503

Hitler, Manson, Jaden Smith.

But you're different
from them, aren't you?

505
00:22:51,389 --> 00:22:53,789
Because they're rail-thin,
and you're fat.

506
00:22:53,825 --> 00:22:55,658
You're a little piggy,
aren't you, Nelson?

507
00:22:55,693 --> 00:22:57,660
In fact, I bet
you're hungry right now.

(mumbling)
What's that?

509
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:02,231
I could eat.

510
00:23:02,267 --> 00:23:03,900
Good. Because you're going

511
00:23:03,935 --> 00:23:07,003
to eat... my... shorts.

512
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:09,038
(muffled shouting)

513
00:23:14,712 --> 00:23:17,346
Homer, you're never going
to believe what we did.

514
00:23:17,382 --> 00:23:20,082
We saw a movie
in the afternoon!

515
00:23:20,118 --> 00:23:22,218
Yeah, we saw
<i>Surf's Up 2.</i>

516
00:23:22,253 --> 00:23:24,887
Marge covered her eyes every
time the penguins surfed.

517
00:23:24,923 --> 00:23:28,024
It made me nervous.
They could drown.

Hey, where's
Santa's Little Helper?

519
00:23:30,395 --> 00:23:32,862
Brian, you took him
for a walk, right?

520
00:23:32,897 --> 00:23:34,830
Uh, yeah, yeah.
(chuckles)

521
00:23:34,866 --> 00:23:36,365
More-more like he took me
for a walk.

522
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:38,568
(chuckles) God, what a...
what a fun dog.

523
00:23:38,603 --> 00:23:41,504
He's in the kitchen right now,
totally accounted for.

524
00:23:41,539 --> 00:23:42,838
(quietly):
Shut up.

525
00:23:42,874 --> 00:23:45,174
I'll, uh... I'll go check
on him right now.

526
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,842
And Chris
will come with me.

527
00:23:46,878 --> 00:23:48,878
But nobody else!

Aw, you like that
behind the ear, don't you, boy?

Ruff! Ruff, ruff!

532
00:23:59,023 --> 00:24:02,124
Ruff, ruff! I'm
another dog in here!

533
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,459
(quietly):
What the hell are you doing?

534
00:24:03,494 --> 00:24:05,528
(quietly): He's having a
dog playdate.

535
00:24:05,563 --> 00:24:08,931
How does that help us?
We're creating a broad story.

536
00:24:08,967 --> 00:24:11,400
Also, Matthew McConaughey
is in here, too!

537
00:24:11,436 --> 00:24:13,536
(à la Matthew McConaughey):
"All right, all right, all right."

538
00:24:13,571 --> 00:24:16,005
BRIAN: No, no, he's-he's not
really in here! He's...

539
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,307
We-we thought it was him,
but it was just the oven!

540
00:24:18,343 --> 00:24:19,375
(quietly):
Now you're just doing voices.

541
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,577
Jack Nicholson?!

542
00:24:21,613 --> 00:24:24,113
Okay, Santa's Little Helper
got all tuckered out

543
00:24:24,148 --> 00:24:26,782
from his playdate, so he went
out back to take a nap

544
00:24:26,818 --> 00:24:29,051
under that tree where nobody
knows quite where it is.

545
00:24:29,087 --> 00:24:30,586
Hey, what happened
to Jack Nicholson

546
00:24:30,622 --> 00:24:32,221
and that other dog?
Yep.

547
00:24:32,257 --> 00:24:34,991
Wait, aren't you supposed
to be looking for our car?

548
00:24:35,026 --> 00:24:36,125
Didn't find the car, Lois,

549
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,027
but I found a good
time with a good pal.

550
00:24:38,062 --> 00:24:40,696
Right, Homer? Hey,
Quagmire who, right?

551
00:24:40,732 --> 00:24:42,765
Yeah, Quagmire who?

552
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,901
That's an actual question.
I don't know who Quagmire is.

553
00:24:45,937 --> 00:24:49,305
Peter, I'm glad you made a
friend, but what about our car?

554
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,840
Yeah, I got an idea
about that.

555
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:53,843
What's the one surefire way
to find a lost car?

556
00:24:53,878 --> 00:24:56,979
Giant magnet?
Giant magnet.

557
00:24:58,016 --> 00:24:59,148
Giant magnet?

558
00:24:59,183 --> 00:25:01,817
(grunting)

559
00:25:01,853 --> 00:25:03,152
Check.

560
00:25:03,187 --> 00:25:04,487
Giant plug?
Check.

561
00:25:04,522 --> 00:25:07,123
Giant curbside outlet?

562
00:25:10,228 --> 00:25:13,796
Oh, things never work
the way they do on the box.

563
00:25:16,968 --> 00:25:18,808
Okay, let's get this garbage
out of the street.

564
00:25:22,206 --> 00:25:26,842
Oh, dear, I was using that car
as pants.

565
00:25:26,878 --> 00:25:29,111
Oh, my God, Dad,
it's our car!

566
00:25:29,147 --> 00:25:32,715
That confused old guy must have
been driving it by mistake.

567
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:35,651
How many confused old guys
you got in this town?

568
00:25:35,687 --> 00:25:38,387

569

I'm old, so I'm the victim!

570
00:25:44,529 --> 00:25:46,896
Well, Homer, thanks
for helping me get my car back.

571
00:25:46,931 --> 00:25:49,699
And to show my appreciation, I
got a little something for you.

572
00:25:49,734 --> 00:25:52,034
Here you go.
Pawtucket Patriot Ale.

573
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:54,036
The best Quahog
has to offer.

574
00:25:54,072 --> 00:25:56,806
Always keep an emergency
six-pack in my trunk.

575
00:25:56,841 --> 00:25:59,742
Oh, that's cool, bringing
outside beer into my bar.

576
00:25:59,777 --> 00:26:01,711
Down the hatch!

577
00:26:03,381 --> 00:26:04,914
That's pretty good, right?

578
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,583
No.

579
00:26:07,618 --> 00:26:09,585
Huh?
It's not good.

580
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,253
This beer tastes exactly
like Duff.

581
00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:13,255
It's just a lousy rip-off.

582
00:26:13,291 --> 00:26:15,324
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
It's not a rip-off of Duff.

583
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,794
It may have been inspired
by Duff, but I-I like to think

584
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,496
it goes in
a different direction.

585
00:26:20,531 --> 00:26:23,666
No, this is just the same
as Duff, but, like, worse.

586
00:26:23,701 --> 00:26:26,669
Hey, come on, now, this is
my favorite beer you're talking about.

587
00:26:26,704 --> 00:26:28,671
Hell, I work for the company.
It's my livelihood.

588
00:26:28,706 --> 00:26:31,340
Oh, yeah? Well, your livelihood
is based on fraud.

589
00:26:31,376 --> 00:26:32,508
Look at this.

590
00:26:33,277 --> 00:26:35,778
Huh?

591
00:26:35,813 --> 00:26:37,113
(gasps)
It is Duff.

592
00:26:37,148 --> 00:26:39,415
Your beer is
in big trouble!

593
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:41,083
You can't just slap
a new label on something

594
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:42,218
and call it your own!

595
00:26:42,253 --> 00:26:44,553
Well, maybe Duff should be
in trouble for,

596
00:26:44,589 --> 00:26:46,489
you know,
not being that great.

597
00:26:46,524 --> 00:26:47,823
(gasps)

598
00:26:47,859 --> 00:26:50,192
Duff is an icon!

599
00:26:50,228 --> 00:26:52,128
Yeah, but some folks
prefer Pawtucket Pat.

600
00:26:52,163 --> 00:26:55,331
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I-I used to love Duff when I was younger,

601
00:26:55,366 --> 00:26:58,234
but I-I haven't even had it
in, like, 13 years.

602
00:26:58,269 --> 00:26:59,502
Be that as it may,

603
00:26:59,537 --> 00:27:02,104
I represent the Duff Brewery,
and you, sir,

604
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,440
as a representative
of Pawtucket Patriot Ale,

605
00:27:04,475 --> 00:27:08,077
are being sued for intellectual
theft and patent infringement.

606
00:27:08,112 --> 00:27:09,912
Aha! Intellectual theft!

607
00:27:09,947 --> 00:27:12,148
What do you have to say
about that, Griffin?

608
00:27:12,183 --> 00:27:13,516
D'oh!

609
00:27:15,944 --> 00:27:19,245

(helicopter whirring)

610
00:27:26,221 --> 00:27:28,921
The Pawtucket Patriot
Brewery being sued?

611
00:27:28,957 --> 00:27:31,457
It's the largest employer
in Quahog, Peter.

612
00:27:31,093 --> 00:27:33,393
A lot of people's jobs
are riding on this.

613
00:27:33,428 --> 00:27:35,729
(quietly): Yeah, I got a job for you
riding on something.

614
00:27:35,764 --> 00:27:36,796
Peter!

615
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,398
Sorry! Sorry, Lois,
I'm-I'm tired

616
00:27:38,433 --> 00:27:41,434
'cause we usually only do
these things for half an hour.

617
00:27:43,605 --> 00:27:44,637
Simpson.

618
00:27:44,673 --> 00:27:45,673
Griffin.

619
00:27:45,674 --> 00:27:46,840
Nice day, isn't it?

620
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:48,641
A nice day for stabbing
a friend in the back.

621
00:27:48,677 --> 00:27:52,212
Yeah, and a nice day for
bringing thieves to justice.

622
00:27:53,348 --> 00:27:55,115
We're getting a
lot of compliments.

623
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,617
Yep, we're doing
something right.

624
00:27:57,652 --> 00:28:00,153
(indistinct chatter)

625
00:28:00,188 --> 00:28:02,622
Your Honor,
citizens of Springfield

626
00:28:02,657 --> 00:28:05,358
and visitors from Quahog,
my client, the Duff Brewery,

627
00:28:05,394 --> 00:28:08,461
is the victim of flagrant
intellectual theft.

628
00:28:08,497 --> 00:28:11,131
(quietly): I'm whispering in court
to look smart.

629
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:14,467
But it's not just the main Duff
recipe that's been plagiarized.

630
00:28:14,503 --> 00:28:16,970
Several other Duff variations,
packages

631
00:28:17,005 --> 00:28:19,572
and design elements
have been similarly infringed,

632
00:28:19,608 --> 00:28:21,474
resulting again

633
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,410
and again in pale imitations,

634
00:28:23,445 --> 00:28:24,611
chp coes,
clumsy counterfeits

635
00:28:24,646 --> 00:28:27,847
and weak substitutions.

636
00:28:27,883 --> 00:28:29,516
You like sex?
Eh.

637
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:31,251
I don't think
we're very similar.

638
00:28:31,286 --> 00:28:34,053
You know why they got us
sitting next to each other.

639
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:36,723
Uh, 'cause we're the two
funniest guys in our towns?

640
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:38,191
Damn right.

641
00:28:38,226 --> 00:28:39,692
I'm a Jewish clown.

642
00:28:39,728 --> 00:28:41,094
Me, too.

643
00:28:41,129 --> 00:28:43,263
Are you a mayor?
Yes, I am.

644
00:28:43,298 --> 00:28:45,265
Are you a "cool" mayor?

645
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,834
I, uh... I like
to think so.

646
00:28:50,872 --> 00:28:52,172
You lived in Springfield?

647
00:28:52,207 --> 00:28:55,041
Yeah, I worked at the
Kwik-E-Mart, researching a role.

648
00:28:55,076 --> 00:28:57,310
These guys are gonna lose.

649
00:28:57,345 --> 00:29:00,914
FRED FLINTSTONES: I've heard all 
I need to hear to make a decision.

650
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:04,517
If you ask me, neither of
these beers is wholly original.

651
00:29:04,553 --> 00:29:08,455
They're both pale imitations
of my favorite beer, Bud Rock.

652
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:09,756
PETER: Oh, ho, ho!
HOMER: Ooh!

653
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:12,225
But rendering a verdict
is something

654
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:15,495
I'm paid to yabba-dabba-do!

655
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,830
PETER and HOMER:
Eh.

656
00:29:16,865 --> 00:29:19,432
And I find in favor of Duff.

657
00:29:19,468 --> 00:29:20,333
Oh, no!

658
00:29:20,368 --> 00:29:21,167
Oh, no!

659
00:29:21,203 --> 00:29:22,535
Oh, no!

660
00:29:23,538 --> 00:29:26,005
(phone rings)

661
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:27,173
Hello?

662
00:29:27,209 --> 00:29:28,274
Uh, hey.

663
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,510
I'm-I'm
in the wrong Springfield.

664
00:29:35,217 --> 00:29:37,116
So what's going
to happen now?

665
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,586
Well, the Pawtucket Brewery
will be shut down,

666
00:29:39,621 --> 00:29:43,490
so I guess we got to go back to
Quahog and find Peter a new job.

667
00:29:43,525 --> 00:29:45,091
Mmm, that's too bad.

668
00:29:45,126 --> 00:29:48,428
Yeah. Anyways, it was still nice
to meet you and your family,

669
00:29:48,463 --> 00:29:50,763
even though you kind of
screwed us over.

670
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,232
Good to have you.

671
00:29:52,267 --> 00:29:54,400
And, hey, next time
you stay with a family,

672
00:29:54,436 --> 00:29:57,570
maybe you can wear a
bra some of the time.

673
00:29:57,606 --> 00:30:00,507
Hey, uh, Marge, uh,

674
00:30:00,542 --> 00:30:02,782
listen, there's something
difficult that I've been trying

675
00:30:02,811 --> 00:30:05,278
to figure out how to
tell you, and, um...

676
00:30:05,313 --> 00:30:08,147
it's about, uh,
Santa's Little Helper.

677
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:09,382
What about him?

678
00:30:09,417 --> 00:30:11,117
He's, um...

679
00:30:11,152 --> 00:30:13,186
(barking)

680
00:30:13,221 --> 00:30:15,154
...right there.

681
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:17,824
You were trying to figure out
a way to tell me that?

682
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:19,626
I overthink things
sometimes.

683
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:21,961
Oh, and, look,
he's with Ed McMahon!

684
00:30:21,997 --> 00:30:23,663
(à la Ed McMahon):
Hey-o!

685
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:25,164
Here's Johnny!

686
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,499
Chris, we're done.

687
00:30:26,535 --> 00:30:29,502
You may be, but...
"I'm just getting warmed up!"

688
00:30:29,538 --> 00:30:32,038
That's Al Pacino.

689
00:30:32,073 --> 00:30:33,973
Thanks for being
so cool, Lisa.

690
00:30:34,009 --> 00:30:36,609
I cut your name in my arm
so I'll always remember you.

691
00:30:38,413 --> 00:30:39,946
(groans)

692
00:30:39,981 --> 00:30:42,115
Meg, I want you to have this.

693
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,416
Your saxophone?

694
00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:47,724
Yes, Meg.
When you played the saxophone,

695
00:30:50,596 --> 00:30:54,564
Lisa, no one has ever done
anything this nice for me.

696
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,968
You're amazing,
and I will never be like you.

697
00:30:58,003 --> 00:31:01,104
I'm not pretty, I'm not smart,
I'm not talented.

698
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,373
I have the same shoe size
as Charles Barkley.

699
00:31:03,408 --> 00:31:05,242
My prom date
was a scarecrow I stole,

700
00:31:05,277 --> 00:31:06,977
and he left
with someone else.

701
00:31:07,012 --> 00:31:09,513
The inside of my hat
smells so bad I'm not allowed

702
00:31:09,548 --> 00:31:11,748
in most restaurants...
Hey, hey!

703
00:31:11,784 --> 00:31:13,750
Shut up, Meg.

704
00:31:20,993 --> 00:31:23,460
No luggage. Car's full.
Let's go.

705
00:31:24,463 --> 00:31:26,096
Well, nice knowing you,
Stewie.

706
00:31:26,131 --> 00:31:27,564
Same here, Bart.

707
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:29,065
Hey, I hope
you don't mind,

708
00:31:29,101 --> 00:31:31,067
I got you a
little present.

709
00:31:33,806 --> 00:31:35,772
Whoa. Is that Nelson?

710
00:31:35,808 --> 00:31:37,574
Stewie, what the deuce?

711
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:39,576
Yes, I... Oh!
Oh, that's nice.

712
00:31:39,611 --> 00:31:41,511
You got that from me.
'Cause, you know,

713
00:31:41,547 --> 00:31:43,713
I was starting to worry
this was a one-way thing.

714
00:31:43,749 --> 00:31:45,448
You kidnapped him?

715
00:31:45,484 --> 00:31:47,417
I kidnapped all your enemies.

716
00:31:47,452 --> 00:31:50,887
Nelson, Jimbo, Principal
Skinner, Sideshow Bob, Apu.

717
00:31:50,923 --> 00:31:53,690
I know Apu's not your enemy,
but I just wanted to say,

718
00:31:53,725 --> 00:31:56,126
"I took Apu."
(chuckles)

719
00:31:56,161 --> 00:31:58,528
(laughs)
That is funny!

720
00:31:58,564 --> 00:32:00,397
But the rest of this?
It's messed up, man.

721
00:32:00,432 --> 00:32:02,032
I know! Isn't it awesome?

722
00:32:02,067 --> 00:32:04,401
So, how do you want to keep
in touch? Facebook? Twitter?

723
00:32:04,436 --> 00:32:06,169
Late-night phone calls
lying on our tummies

724
00:32:06,205 --> 00:32:07,637
with our feet up in the air?

725
00:32:07,673 --> 00:32:09,172
Stewie, I don't think
we can be friends.

726
00:32:09,208 --> 00:32:10,774
You freak me out.

727
00:32:10,809 --> 00:32:13,310
Bart, if we don't keep in touch,
I'll kill myself.

728
00:32:13,345 --> 00:32:14,644
That's what I'm talking about.

729
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,580
Later, dude!

730
00:32:16,615 --> 00:32:18,448
(crying):
Later...

731
00:32:18,483 --> 00:32:20,217
dude.

732
00:32:21,253 --> 00:32:23,887
(grunts)
(muffled): Haw-haw!

733
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:30,264
♪ ♪

734
00:32:49,552 --> 00:32:51,285
Aw.

735
00:32:52,688 --> 00:32:53,988
Hey, Griffin.

736
00:32:54,023 --> 00:32:56,157
Sorry about your job.

737
00:32:56,192 --> 00:32:58,092
I was just sticking
up for Duff.

738
00:32:58,127 --> 00:32:59,260
I love Duff.

739
00:32:59,295 --> 00:33:00,795
And Duff loves me.

740
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,229
Duff can keep a secret.

741
00:33:02,265 --> 00:33:03,697
Duff never says no.

742
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:06,801
Duff is more experimental than
any partner I've ever had.

743
00:33:06,836 --> 00:33:10,171
Anyway, the point
is, I'm sorry.

744
00:33:10,206 --> 00:33:13,441
You know, when I first met you,
I thought, hey, I love this guy!

745
00:33:13,476 --> 00:33:15,209
This is the funniest guy
I've ever met.

746
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:17,211
I'm gonna quote this guy
to all my friends.

747
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:19,246
I love his town,
I love his family.

748
00:33:19,282 --> 00:33:21,816
But now, I think
I speak for all of us

749
00:33:21,851 --> 00:33:24,718
when I say,
I am over the Simpsons!

750
00:33:24,754 --> 00:33:26,754
(gasps) Wh-What
are you saying?

751
00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:28,856
I'm saying
the Simpsons suck!

752
00:33:28,891 --> 00:33:30,591
Why, you...

753
00:33:30,626 --> 00:33:32,326

Ow! What the hell?
That really hurts.

764
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:04,291
No, it doesn't!
I do it to my son all the time.

765
00:34:04,327 --> 00:34:06,227
You strangle your son?
That's insane!

766
00:34:06,262 --> 00:34:09,396
No wonder he's fat and stupid
and masturbates all the time.

767
00:34:09,432 --> 00:34:10,631
That's<i> your</i> son!

Hey! Knock it off!
There's a kid back there!

I'm in danger.
