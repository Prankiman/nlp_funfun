11
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:37,535
Good evening.
I'm Diane Simmons.

12
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:40,772
In traffic news, heavy gridlock
on the 195 interchange.

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,042
We now go live to Drunk Billy
in the Channel 5 Newscopter.

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,913
This just in.

15
00:00:48,981 --> 00:00:51,783
Channel 5 Newscopter pilot
Drunk Billy passed away today.

16
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:53,451
In anticipation of this event,

17
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:54,853
we put together a clip package

18
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,388
featuring some of Billy's
work for Channel 5 News.

19
00:01:11,637 --> 00:01:14,472
"I'm still hungry,"
said the very hungry caterpillar.

20
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,407
"but you've already..."

21
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,247
Drunk Billy will be missed.

22
00:01:22,314 --> 00:01:24,282
But what you shouldn't
miss is the Quahog Rodeo,

23
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,884
coming to the
Civic Center this Friday.

24
00:01:25,951 --> 00:01:27,519
Tickets are on sale now.

25
00:01:27,586 --> 00:01:29,154
And for those of you who
are handy with a horse,

26
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:30,889
entry spots are still open.

27
00:01:30,956 --> 00:01:32,724
Oh, God, this seems like
the kind of thing Peter...

28
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:34,025
Too late, Brian.

29
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:35,627
Peter, you're gonna enter the rodeo?

30
00:01:35,694 --> 00:01:36,828
That's stupid.

31
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:38,029
You don't know anything about horses,

32
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,597
and you're in terrible shape.

33
00:01:39,665 --> 00:01:41,499
You know, that's the difference
between you and me, Lois.

34
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:42,867
When life comes knocking at the door,

35
00:01:42,935 --> 00:01:44,202
you go and hide in the kitchen.

36
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,004
I fling the door wide open and I say,

37
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:47,438
"Peter Griffin here.
What do you got?"

38
00:01:47,506 --> 00:01:49,040
And if that don't convince you,
look at this.

39
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:50,475
In this week's <i>TV Guide</i>, it says,

40
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:52,110
"Peter gets more than he bargained for

41
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:53,344
when he joins the rodeo."

42
00:01:53,412 --> 00:01:54,646
Well, it's in <i>The Guide</i>.

43
00:01:54,713 --> 00:01:56,281
Hey, can we make that a thing?

44
00:01:56,348 --> 00:01:58,116
Can we start calling <i>TV Guide</i>
"The Guide"?

45
00:01:58,184 --> 00:01:59,584
You know what?
I'm not even asking anymore.

46
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:00,785
That's what we're doing.

47
00:02:00,853 --> 00:02:02,921
Who says I couldn't be a rodeo star?

48
00:02:02,988 --> 00:02:06,024
I got more cowboy blood
in me than Billy the Kid.

49
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:11,796
♪ Well, he robbed his way
from Utah to Oklahoma ♪

50
00:02:11,864 --> 00:02:16,334

seem to track him down. ♪

54
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,591
Hyah!

55
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:23,835
Dad, what are you doing?!

56
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,036
All right, Meg, this is only gonna hurt

57
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:26,170
for about three weeks.

58
00:03:27,339 --> 00:03:28,806
What the hell?

59
00:03:28,874 --> 00:03:31,376
That there's my steer, Griffin.

60
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:38,549
All right, Lois.
Go ahead. Say it.

61
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:43,554
Chris, it's time for supper.

62
00:03:43,622 --> 00:03:45,023
Ho der, ho der, ho der!

63
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,691
Ho der, ho der, ho der, ho der!

64
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,993
Ho der, ho der, ho der!
Ho der, ho der!

65
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:50,962
Ho der, ho der, ho der.

66
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,665
Ho der, ho der, ho der.

67
00:03:53,732 --> 00:03:55,533
Ho der.

68
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:58,403
All right. I am ready for the rodeo.

69
00:04:01,907 --> 00:04:04,242
Mom, when's it Dad's turn?

70
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,476
I don't know, Chris.

71
00:04:05,544 --> 00:04:07,278
But I think we should
all pray for your father

72
00:04:07,346 --> 00:04:08,913
that he comes out of this uninjured.

73
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:10,448
Those horses stink.

74
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:11,983
And it's too hot in here.

75
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:15,053
I fell asleep in the car,
so now I'm cranky.

76
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,121
This is a disgusting display.

77
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:18,423
Boy, you can say that again.

78
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,526
Nothing like a bunch of adult men
teasing animals for fun.

79
00:04:21,593 --> 00:04:23,428
It's amazing that this is still legal.

80
00:04:23,495 --> 00:04:24,729
The only reason I'm here

81
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,831
is 'cause my idiot friend is in the rodeo.

82
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:29,000
I only came 'cause I'm
writing a magazine article.

83
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,368
One of the competitors

84
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,603
is a thirteen-year-old
female riding prodigy.

85
00:04:32,671 --> 00:04:34,405
Apparently she got
on the bull to miscarry,

86
00:04:34,473 --> 00:04:36,541
and found out she had a talent for it.

87
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:39,944
<i>Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen,
give an indifferent East Coast welcome</i>

88
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:42,814
<i>to the newest bullrider, Peter the Kid!</i>

89
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,355
You know what I am back at the ranch?

90
00:04:50,422 --> 00:04:52,256
I'm a breeding bull.

91
00:04:52,324 --> 00:04:53,858
W... what... what's that?

92
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:55,994
You gonna find out.

93
00:04:56,061 --> 00:04:57,095
Where you goin', fatty?

94
00:04:57,162 --> 00:04:58,296
We gonna have a party.

95
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:00,798
No! No!

96
00:05:06,271 --> 00:05:07,572
No! No!

97
00:05:09,508 --> 00:05:11,309
So, what magazine do you write for?

98
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:12,810
I'm the editor for <i>Teen People</i>.

99
00:05:12,878 --> 00:05:14,178
Editor?

100
00:05:14,246 --> 00:05:16,848
Well, gosh, you know,
I'm something of a writer myself.

101
00:05:16,915 --> 00:05:18,983
I... I wrote for <i>The New Yorker</i>
for a little while.

102
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:20,451
Wow, that's impressive.

103
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,552
Are you looking for work?

104
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,954
Oh, no. No, no, no.

105
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:24,789
I... I never have to
look too far for that.

106
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:25,823
I... W... w...
what are you...

107
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:27,358
What do you...
What... what do you got?

108
00:05:27,426 --> 00:05:29,193
Well, we're looking for
someone to write a piece

109
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:30,428
on the everyday activities

110
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,230
of the average American teenage girl.

111
00:05:32,297 --> 00:05:34,232
Oh, I love teenage girls.

112
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:35,633
It's all ahead of them, you know?

113
00:05:35,701 --> 00:05:37,135
They haven't turned into bitches yet.

114
00:05:37,202 --> 00:05:38,870
Oh, it's true.

115
00:05:38,937 --> 00:05:40,571
What happened to all of us?

116
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,374
I got a house on the cape.
Maybe you come visit.

117
00:05:43,442 --> 00:05:44,876
Maybe.

118
00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:46,811
Maybe you call a few days in advance

119
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,279
to give me time to get the house clean.

120
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,414
Okay.

121
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:50,648
Maybe you bring a blazer,

122
00:05:50,716 --> 00:05:52,750
so we can go to a wider
range of restaurants.

123
00:05:52,818 --> 00:05:54,152
I'll... I'll bring a blazer.

124
00:05:57,456 --> 00:05:58,689
You see this, Rupert?

125
00:05:58,757 --> 00:06:00,591
Most children build a sand castle.

126
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:04,062
But I'm building a sand retreat
for singles in their 30s.

127
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:05,830
Hi, I'm jeremy.

128
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:07,732
I work in corporate finance.

129
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,268
Hi, I'm a French Canadian girl

130
00:06:10,335 --> 00:06:12,036
down here on my vacation.

131
00:06:12,104 --> 00:06:15,173
It's a big deal for me to
be down here on my own.

132
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,608
I like the swimming pool with a bar in it

133
00:06:17,676 --> 00:06:20,545
'cause you can sit on a barstool
and you're in the water.

134
00:06:20,612 --> 00:06:23,147
I like how all the food
and drink is included

135
00:06:23,215 --> 00:06:24,615
in the price of the ticket.

136
00:06:24,683 --> 00:06:26,184
Yeah, that way you don't have

137
00:06:26,251 --> 00:06:28,519
to bring your cash
down from the room.

138
00:06:28,587 --> 00:06:30,788
Okay, I was just looking
for a friend of mine,

139
00:06:30,856 --> 00:06:32,490
so maybe I'll see you later.

140
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,125
Good for you, Janine.

141
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:37,628
You promised yourself you'd
talk to somebody and you did it.

142
00:06:37,696 --> 00:06:39,397
Brian, what are you doing up there?

143
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:40,398
Shh. I'm writing an article

144
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,467
on teenage girls for a magazine.

145
00:06:42,534 --> 00:06:44,569
I'm studying Meg to see
what goes on during her day.

146
00:06:44,636 --> 00:06:46,404
Well, be careful you don't
fall off that ladder.

147
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,172
Not all dogs go to heaven.

148
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,841
So, says here you were involved

149
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:51,576
in the plotting of September 11?

150
00:06:51,643 --> 00:06:54,879
Well, that's what they get
for supporting Israel.

151
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:57,748
Hyuck, yuck, yuck. Gawsh.

152
00:06:57,816 --> 00:07:00,318
Okay, into the eternal pit of fire you go.

153
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:03,121
Wa-hoo-hoo-hoo-ee!

154
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,695
You know, Brian, just because
you're writing a profile

155
00:07:10,762 --> 00:07:12,363
on teenage girls,
it doesn't mean you have

156
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:15,666
to be a creepy stalker and
follow Meg around all day.

157
00:07:15,734 --> 00:07:16,934
It's called research, Stewie.

158
00:07:17,002 --> 00:07:17,902
I'm just being thorough.

159
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,770
Where the hell is she going?

160
00:07:19,838 --> 00:07:21,072
There's nothing out
in this part of town.

161
00:07:24,943 --> 00:07:26,077
What is that, Brian?

162
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,045
What is an adult correctional institute?

163
00:07:28,113 --> 00:07:29,147
It's a prison, Stewie.

164
00:07:29,214 --> 00:07:30,348
Ah.

165
00:07:30,415 --> 00:07:32,049
One would think
they could just say that.

166
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:37,555
Hi, Meg.

167
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:38,789
Hi, Luke.

168
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,534
Oh, my God.

169
00:07:49,601 --> 00:07:51,702
Meg's dating a convict!

170
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,071
Oh looks like Consuela's son is in prison.

171
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:56,641
I see you soon, Rodrigo.

172
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,543
<i>Si, mama.</i>

173
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:07,869
It's really good to see you, Meg.

174
00:08:07,937 --> 00:08:09,104
It's been a while.

175
00:08:09,172 --> 00:08:10,772
I know. I'm sorry, Luke.

176
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,207
It's just so hard to get over here

177
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:13,742
without anybody finding out.

178
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,677
Have you gotten all the letters
and hair that I've sent?

179
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,912
It's the only thing

180
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:18,480
that's getting me by, Meg.
Thank you.

181
00:08:18,548 --> 00:08:19,981
How'd your parole hearing go?

182
00:08:20,049 --> 00:08:21,383
Not good.

183
00:08:21,451 --> 00:08:23,285
Looks like I'm gonna be in
here another three years.

184
00:08:23,353 --> 00:08:24,753
Oh, Luke.

185
00:08:24,821 --> 00:08:26,621
Oh, I don't expect you
to wait for me, Meg.

186
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:27,723
No, I will, Luke.

187
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,291
If it takes ten years or twenty years,

188
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:30,992
I will be here when you get out.

189
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,237
Oh, my God!

190
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:43,872
Meg's involved with a convict!

191
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,907
Wow, Meg's like one of those crazy chicks

192
00:08:45,975 --> 00:08:48,110
who hooks up with an even crazier guy.

193
00:08:53,249 --> 00:08:54,616
Brian, you bastard!

194
00:08:54,684 --> 00:08:56,084
How could you do this to me?!

195
00:08:56,152 --> 00:08:57,886
I'm sorry, Meg. I had to tell them!

196
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,521
Don't give him crap for this, Meg.

197
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:01,690
He did exactly the right
thing by coming to us.

198
00:09:01,758 --> 00:09:03,759
Don't you know what kind of fire

199
00:09:03,826 --> 00:09:05,227
you're playing with,
dating a prisoner?

200
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,262
Hold on, Lois.
This is some serious parenting.

201
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,798
I'm gonna go put on
my Cosby sweater.

202
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:11,567
Mom, you don't understand!

203
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,269
Luke and I really
connect, very deeply!

204
00:09:14,337 --> 00:09:17,239
He's all alone in there,
and I'm all alone out here.

205
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,274
In a way, we're both in prison.

206
00:09:19,342 --> 00:09:21,276
Well, Meg,
there's a big difference there.

207
00:09:21,344 --> 00:09:22,644
He's in prison for a reason.

208
00:09:22,712 --> 00:09:23,979
He broke the law!

209
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:25,581
He robbed a convenience store

210
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,816
to pay for medication for his mom.

211
00:09:27,884 --> 00:09:30,953
Oh, I'm sure he gave you a
very convincing sob story.

212
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,455
It's not a sob story! It's true!

213
00:09:33,523 --> 00:09:35,057
Frankly, I don't care, Meg.

214
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:36,925
I do not want you seeing him again!

215
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,060
I can't find the sweater.

216
00:09:38,127 --> 00:09:39,528
How the hell did you even meet him?!

217
00:09:39,596 --> 00:09:41,196
We had a pen pal project at school,

218
00:09:41,264 --> 00:09:42,431
and when it was over,

219
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,366
Luke and I just kind of
kept writing to each other.

220
00:09:44,434 --> 00:09:45,634
Well, it stops now!

221
00:09:45,702 --> 00:09:47,469
But, Mom, I love him!

222
00:09:47,537 --> 00:09:49,037
It stops now, Meg!

223
00:09:49,105 --> 00:09:50,872
Your mother's right, Meg.
You got to be careful

224
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,407
who you get involved with romantically.

225
00:09:53,643 --> 00:09:54,810
Hello?

226
00:09:54,877 --> 00:09:55,944
I'm in the mood for some coitus.

227
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,412
Get over here.

228
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,647
I can't. I'm with my family.

229
00:09:58,715 --> 00:10:00,782
Pick up wine on the way.

230
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,151
Well, Angela, if I'm
really the only guy at work

231
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:05,721
who can solve it,
I'll be right there.

232
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,031
Luke!

233
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:17,399
What are you doing here?!

234
00:10:17,467 --> 00:10:18,767
I escaped, Meg.

235
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:20,168
I escaped 'cause I just couldn't bear

236
00:10:20,236 --> 00:10:21,503
another second away from you.

237
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:23,572
My God, how did you get out?

238
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,540
I filed down a toothbrush to a fine point

239
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:27,175
and stabbed the guard with the most kids.

240
00:10:27,243 --> 00:10:28,877
- What?!
- I'm just kidding.

241
00:10:28,945 --> 00:10:32,014
Oh. I'm still getting used
to your sense of humor.

242
00:10:32,081 --> 00:10:34,149
Actually, there was a
riot in the prison yard,

243
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:35,417
and I slipped over the fence.

244
00:10:35,485 --> 00:10:37,352
Well, well, quick, get in
here before somebody sees you!

245
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,427
Oh, Meg, I've wanted to
do that for so long.

246
00:10:45,495 --> 00:10:47,929
And it's nice to be in front
of someone for a change.

247
00:10:49,332 --> 00:10:51,833
Now I know that was a joke!

248
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,101
Whatever.

249
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:54,503
Hey, Meg?

250
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,171
Can I talk to you for a second?

251
00:10:58,007 --> 00:11:01,043
Uh, yeah, come on in.

252
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,980
Listen, uh, I feel like
I should explain myself

253
00:11:05,048 --> 00:11:06,248
a little bit here.

254
00:11:06,316 --> 00:11:08,583
I'm sorry I had to tell
Lois what was going on.

255
00:11:08,651 --> 00:11:10,152
You just, you gotta realize

256
00:11:10,219 --> 00:11:11,787
I was only thinking about
your safety and...

257
00:11:16,626 --> 00:11:18,727
Luke, you might as well come out now.

258
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:22,164
Luke! What the...?
They let you out of jail?!

259
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:23,865
Not exactly.

260
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,735
He broke out to see me, Brian.
We're in love.

261
00:11:26,803 --> 00:11:28,136
Meg, are you crazy?!

262
00:11:28,204 --> 00:11:29,805
You can't harbor a fugitive.
That's a felony.

263
00:11:29,872 --> 00:11:30,872
Only if someone finds out.

264
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,274
Are you gonna do it?

265
00:11:32,342 --> 00:11:33,742
Are you gonna tell on me again?

266
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:34,943
Well, I... I...

267
00:11:35,011 --> 00:11:37,179
Brian, will you call me
on my Mickey Mouse phone?

268
00:11:37,246 --> 00:11:38,280
Wait a second.

269
00:11:38,348 --> 00:11:40,315
Why is that guy wearing
a prison jumpsuit?

270
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:41,316
Think, Peter, think.

271
00:11:41,384 --> 00:11:43,685
Wait. Hang on.

272
00:11:43,753 --> 00:11:45,354
Sunday, Sunday... Here it is.

273
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:47,089
"Peter gets more than he bargains for

274
00:11:47,156 --> 00:11:49,591
when he joins the rodeo."
Boy, did I.

275
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:51,593
"And Meg dates a prison escapee"!

276
00:11:51,661 --> 00:11:53,628
Oh, no! Luke, run!

277
00:11:56,733 --> 00:11:58,166
Joe, it's Peter! Two things:

278
00:11:58,234 --> 00:12:00,869
First of all, when I was over
at your house the other day,

279
00:12:00,937 --> 00:12:03,205
I forgot to tell you how
much I like the rearrangement

280
00:12:03,272 --> 00:12:05,040
you and Bonnie did with
your living room furniture.

281
00:12:05,108 --> 00:12:06,575
Second of all, come outside!

282
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,377
There's an escaped convict
running across the street!

283
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:25,093
No, Luke, don't run downhill!

284
00:12:32,735 --> 00:12:35,036
You're going to jail, punk!

285
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:40,776
No, Mr. Swanson,
you can't take him!

286
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,177
Yes, I can, Meg.

287
00:12:42,245 --> 00:12:43,779
He's going back to jail.

288
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,180
Well, if you're taking him to jail,

289
00:12:45,248 --> 00:12:46,515
you have to take me, too!

290
00:12:46,582 --> 00:12:47,849
I know. That's the plan.

291
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:51,086
You're under arrest for
harboring an escaped convict.

292
00:12:51,154 --> 00:12:53,088
Oh, well, that's only
fair because after all,

293
00:12:53,156 --> 00:12:54,656
I did hide him from the...

294
00:12:54,724 --> 00:12:55,690
<i>What?!</i>

295
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:05,267
Uh, hi.

296
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:08,603
Did you also get caught
trying to vote in Ohio?

297
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:14,643
Well, this is it.

298
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,111
Meg gets out of jail today.

299
00:13:16,179 --> 00:13:18,413
Already? It seems like just
yesterday we rented her room

300
00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:21,383
to that fly that wants to leave,
but can't figure it out.

301
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,085
Okay, now where now?

302
00:13:24,153 --> 00:13:25,120
Right there.

303
00:13:25,188 --> 00:13:26,555
I'm having some trouble here.

304
00:13:26,622 --> 00:13:28,390
It's right there!
It's right in front of you!

305
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,525
Okay, I can hear you.
Volume's not a problem.

306
00:13:30,593 --> 00:13:32,461
I'm just not quite seeing
what you're referring to.

307
00:13:32,528 --> 00:13:33,929
Okay, then fly, fly out the window.

308
00:13:33,996 --> 00:13:35,764
Up here maybe? No, to your left!

309
00:13:35,832 --> 00:13:37,499
No, that's not it. That's just more wall.

310
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,401
How many eyes do you have, huh?!

311
00:13:39,469 --> 00:13:41,937
Just two, same number as you,
but I can't, I'm not...

312
00:13:42,004 --> 00:13:43,371
Just go! Oh, my God!

313
00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:44,840
Whatever it is you're driving at,

314
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,107
I'm just apparently not getting it...

315
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:47,342
You're right there!

316
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,844
...so I'm just gonna go back upstairs.

317
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,480
I think we should all go
together to pick Meg up.

318
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:53,882
She's probably a little fragile
after being in there so long,

319
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,518
and I'm sure she'll be
heartened to see our faces.

320
00:13:58,287 --> 00:14:00,589
I'm home. You're all my bitches now.

321
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,291
Okay.

322
00:14:07,094 --> 00:14:09,296
Meg! You look so different.

323
00:14:09,364 --> 00:14:10,330
How was prison?

324
00:14:10,398 --> 00:14:11,765
First question:

325
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,134
Who's the biggest,
toughest guy in this house?

326
00:14:14,202 --> 00:14:16,103
Well, I don't like to
toot my own horn,

327
00:14:16,171 --> 00:14:17,738
but I believe I hold the distinction...

328
00:14:26,514 --> 00:14:28,315
My house now, bitch!

329
00:14:28,383 --> 00:14:29,850
Now who's the funniest?

330
00:14:29,918 --> 00:14:31,518
I know my way around a joke.

331
00:14:33,488 --> 00:14:34,888
For God's sake, Dad,

332
00:14:34,956 --> 00:14:37,324
Have some humility!
It'll save your life!

333
00:14:37,392 --> 00:14:41,428
There better be beer in the fridge.

334
00:14:41,496 --> 00:14:44,264
Boy, I liked her better when
she was more predictable...

335
00:14:44,332 --> 00:14:46,767
like the stock photos
on a corporate website.

336
00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:49,002
I'm a woman in a lab coat
wearing goggles,

337
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,405
staring intently at a beaker
that I'm holding near my face.

338
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,073
I'm a Latino in a hardhat,

339
00:14:53,141 --> 00:14:55,809
but I'm also wearing a tie
so you know I'm a supervisor.

340
00:14:55,877 --> 00:14:57,911
We're college students
listening to our professor,

341
00:14:57,979 --> 00:15:01,148
but the class is taking
place outside?!

342
00:15:08,223 --> 00:15:09,523
Hey.

343
00:15:09,591 --> 00:15:11,892
Meg! What the hell are you doing in here?!

344
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,961
- Shower time.
- Yeah, for me.

345
00:15:14,028 --> 00:15:16,130
Not... not for... What are you
doing with that loofah?

346
00:15:16,197 --> 00:15:17,097
Don't worry about it.

347
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,201
You told me not to
worry about it!

348
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:23,704
I shoulda been worried
the whole time!

349
00:15:25,907 --> 00:15:29,076
Meg, honey?
I did all your laundry.

350
00:15:29,144 --> 00:15:32,079
Oh, my God, what is that smell?

351
00:15:32,147 --> 00:15:33,247
It's my poop bucket.

352
00:15:33,314 --> 00:15:34,481
What the hell?!

353
00:15:34,549 --> 00:15:36,817
I'm used to going to the
bathroom in my room.

354
00:15:36,885 --> 00:15:38,385
That's disgusting!

355
00:15:38,453 --> 00:15:40,854
No, you use the toilet
here like everyone else!

356
00:15:40,922 --> 00:15:42,623
- No.
- Ugh!

357
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:44,091
God, it smells horrible!

358
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:46,827
Well, can you at least empty
it each time you use it?

359
00:15:46,895 --> 00:15:48,428
I like to fill it up.

360
00:15:48,496 --> 00:15:49,830
I'm not making a million trips.

361
00:15:49,898 --> 00:15:53,200
Oh, my God, are you using
my shirts as toilet paper?

362
00:15:53,268 --> 00:15:54,368
Yeah. And I think

363
00:15:54,435 --> 00:15:56,737
I might need some right now.

364
00:15:56,804 --> 00:15:59,673
Get out now or stay and get weird.

365
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:01,208
Your call, warden.

366
00:16:05,813 --> 00:16:07,548
Hey, who's the new dude?

367
00:16:07,615 --> 00:16:09,183
Oh, my God,
that's Meg Griffin!

368
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,418
She just got out of prison!

369
00:16:11,486 --> 00:16:13,654
Hey, Meg,
what'd they put you in jail for,

370
00:16:13,721 --> 00:16:14,755
being ugly?

371
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:17,991
Hey, Meg, what happened?

372
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:19,826
Did you get out early
for fat behavior?

373
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:22,829
Nice tattoo.

374
00:16:22,897 --> 00:16:24,598
Did you get your
butt hair braided, too,

375
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,400
while you were in there?

376
00:16:26,467 --> 00:16:28,635
What'd you do,
carve a gun out of soap

377
00:16:28,703 --> 00:16:31,371
and then not wash with it?
Ha-ha! P.U.

378
00:16:33,107 --> 00:16:35,642
Hey, Meg, are you gonna
take those soda cans

379
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,611
to the Shaw-skank
Redemption Center?

380
00:16:51,926 --> 00:16:54,228
Peter, Meg's been
suspended from school.

381
00:16:54,295 --> 00:16:55,963
That's okay.
Whatever she wants to do.

382
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,931
She cracked three kids' skulls open!

383
00:16:57,999 --> 00:16:59,800
Ever since she's gotten out of prison,

384
00:16:59,867 --> 00:17:01,602
she is completely out of control.

385
00:17:01,669 --> 00:17:03,070
Don't you see?

386
00:17:03,137 --> 00:17:05,072
That's what the penal
system does in this country.

387
00:17:05,139 --> 00:17:06,607
It turns small-time offenders
into hardened criminals.

388
00:17:06,674 --> 00:17:08,976
Look at Meg. They took
an innocent little girl

389
00:17:09,043 --> 00:17:11,378
and turned her into a psychotic,
sociopathic freak.

390
00:17:13,248 --> 00:17:14,514
What'd you say, Brian?

391
00:17:14,582 --> 00:17:17,017
Oh, I... I was just picking
up on something Lois said.

392
00:17:17,085 --> 00:17:18,585
What... what was it?
What'd you say, Lois?

393
00:17:18,653 --> 00:17:20,020
Something about Meg being a freak?

394
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:22,189
Oh, no, I didn't say anything.

395
00:17:22,257 --> 00:17:23,857
Uh, Peter said something about Meg,

396
00:17:23,925 --> 00:17:25,626
which I completely disagree with.

397
00:17:25,693 --> 00:17:26,960
That... that... that wasn't me.

398
00:17:27,028 --> 00:17:28,662
Stewie was really laying
into Meg about something.

399
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:29,563
Yeah, it was Stewie.

400
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:30,697
Definitely Stewie.

401
00:17:30,765 --> 00:17:32,499
Oh, so now everyone understands me.

402
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:35,035
Look, Meg,
we're just worried about you.

403
00:17:35,103 --> 00:17:37,170
Well, don't. I can take care of myself.

404
00:17:37,238 --> 00:17:39,239
I'll be outta here by the end of the week.

405
00:17:39,307 --> 00:17:41,141
Punch yourself in the face.

406
00:17:42,243 --> 00:17:43,477
Punch yourself in the face!

407
00:17:44,812 --> 00:17:46,613
All right, he doesn't know what he's doing.

408
00:17:46,681 --> 00:17:49,616
You, fatso, punch your baby in the fa...

409
00:17:49,684 --> 00:17:50,851
I did good, Meg?

410
00:17:50,918 --> 00:17:52,753
Shut up.

411
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,789
I did good. I did good.

412
00:18:04,265 --> 00:18:05,465
Drive.

413
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:08,068
Uh, any particular direction?

414
00:18:08,136 --> 00:18:09,136
That way.

415
00:18:11,639 --> 00:18:13,206
You're gonna help me get some money

416
00:18:13,274 --> 00:18:14,908
so I can get out of this town.

417
00:18:14,976 --> 00:18:16,376
Really? Where are you gonna go?

418
00:18:16,444 --> 00:18:18,545
I don't know. Somewhere far away.

419
00:18:18,613 --> 00:18:20,447
Maybe China.

420
00:18:20,515 --> 00:18:22,149
I hear they got Nascar there now.

421
00:18:30,024 --> 00:18:33,293
What kind of birdhouse can
you build with popsicles,

422
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:34,728
roofies, and a mallet?

423
00:18:34,796 --> 00:18:38,432
It's for a rare African bird
called "Nunya business."

424
00:18:41,035 --> 00:18:42,736
Hi, Meg. Can I help you?

425
00:18:42,804 --> 00:18:44,838
Hands in the air, Goldman!

426
00:18:44,906 --> 00:18:47,007
Oh, my God, what are you doing?!

427
00:18:47,075 --> 00:18:48,008
Gimme your money!

428
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:49,810
Here, here, just take this jar

429
00:18:49,877 --> 00:18:51,044
for the leukemia kids.

430
00:18:51,112 --> 00:18:52,646
I don't give it to 'em anyhow.

431
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,014
Meg, put down the gun.

432
00:18:54,082 --> 00:18:55,682
Brian, get back in the car!

433
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:59,186
Look, don't do this.
This isn't you, Meg.

434
00:18:59,253 --> 00:19:01,088
What happened to
the girl we used to know?

435
00:19:01,155 --> 00:19:03,023
The one that Luke fell in love with?

436
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:04,391
The one he's expecting to see

437
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:06,593
when he steps out of
that prison in fourty years?

438
00:19:06,661 --> 00:19:07,994
I don't care about Luke.

439
00:19:08,062 --> 00:19:10,430
I don't need him.
I don't need anyone!

440
00:19:10,498 --> 00:19:12,099
Look, if you don't
put the gun down,

441
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,734
I'm gonna be forced
to call the police.

442
00:19:13,801 --> 00:19:15,235
Good! Call the police!

443
00:19:15,303 --> 00:19:16,370
I want you to!

444
00:19:16,437 --> 00:19:18,538
What do I care
if I go back to prison?

445
00:19:18,606 --> 00:19:19,873
Nobody cares about me anyway!

446
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:21,641
You're wrong, Meg.

447
00:19:21,709 --> 00:19:23,377
I wanna show you something.

448
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:28,215
<i>Teen People</i>?

449
00:19:28,282 --> 00:19:30,050
It's the article I wrote about you.

450
00:19:30,118 --> 00:19:32,452
You wrote an article about me?

451
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,520
They wanted a story

452
00:19:33,588 --> 00:19:35,288
about a typical teenage girl.

453
00:19:35,356 --> 00:19:39,025
Is it "A Fistful of Backne:
Tale of a Teenage Loser"?

454
00:19:39,093 --> 00:19:41,395
Yeah, they make the title.
Read paragraph three.

455
00:19:41,462 --> 00:19:43,163
This isn't a library, you know.

456
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,665
"And in the face of every
adolescent challenge,

457
00:19:45,733 --> 00:19:47,968
"she looks at the world through hopeful eyes

458
00:19:48,035 --> 00:19:50,003
"and maintains an
uncommon resilience

459
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:51,538
"that can only be admired.

460
00:19:51,606 --> 00:19:55,208
"In this sense, Meg Griffin is
not the typical American girl.

461
00:19:55,276 --> 00:19:58,545
She is far sweeter and
kinder than that."

462
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:01,581
Oh, God, that is so nice, Brian.

463
00:20:01,649 --> 00:20:03,016
Did you mean all that?

464
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:04,484
Of course I did.

465
00:20:04,552 --> 00:20:07,254
Oh, my God, I...
I can't believe I did this.

466
00:20:07,321 --> 00:20:10,590
I was just so tired of being
everyone's whipping girl

467
00:20:10,658 --> 00:20:13,059
that it felt kind of good
to do some of the whipping.

468
00:20:13,127 --> 00:20:14,795
Give me the gun, Meg.

469
00:20:17,598 --> 00:20:20,133
Thanks for reminding me
who I really am.

470
00:20:25,773 --> 00:20:27,507
Well, at least I didn't get robbed.

471
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:32,446
And what can I do for you four
fine black gentlemen today?

472
00:20:36,617 --> 00:20:39,586
I got to say, Meg, I like you
so much better like this.

473
00:20:39,654 --> 00:20:41,021
Me, too, Meg.

474
00:20:41,088 --> 00:20:42,856
God, it must have been horrible in there.

475
00:20:42,924 --> 00:20:44,257
It wasn't so bad.

476
00:20:44,325 --> 00:20:45,992
- I met Wesley Snipes.
- Is that right?

477
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,094
Yeah. Oh, and
you know what's funny?

478
00:20:48,162 --> 00:20:49,863
