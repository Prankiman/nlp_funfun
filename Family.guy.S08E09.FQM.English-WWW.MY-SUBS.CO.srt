11
00:00:42,054 --> 00:00:43,455
Oh, uh, it sure was nice of you

12
00:00:43,523 --> 00:00:45,491
to invite us out on your yacht,
Mr. Pewterschmidt.

13
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:46,925
It's not a boat,
it's a yacht.

14
00:00:46,993 --> 00:00:49,294
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought
you said it was a boat.

15
00:00:52,232 --> 00:00:53,999
Wow, it's beautiful
down there.

16
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:56,535
I just can't believe it
really looks like this.

17
00:00:56,603 --> 00:00:58,537
Boy, the fish tank
at day care

18
00:00:58,605 --> 00:01:01,040
really nailed it.

19
00:01:01,107 --> 00:01:03,542
Lois, are you feeling
all right?

20
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,545
I'm just a little seasick,
that's all.

21
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:10,049
Oh, my God!

22
00:01:10,116 --> 00:01:12,051
Oh, Brian's eatin' it.

23
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:13,719
Boy, that's a lot
of puke, Lois.

24
00:01:13,787 --> 00:01:15,888
I ain't seen that much puke
since my bachelor party.

25
00:01:15,955 --> 00:01:17,089
Your what?

26
00:01:17,157 --> 00:01:18,757
- My bachelor party.
- What's that?

27
00:01:18,825 --> 00:01:20,626
- You don't know what a bachelor party is?
- No!

28
00:01:20,693 --> 00:01:22,127
When you got married,
didn't you have,

29
00:01:22,195 --> 00:01:24,129
- like, a bachelor party with all your friends?
- My what?

30
00:01:24,197 --> 00:01:26,732
Oh, my God, well,
we are gonna fix that.

31
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,233
Carter,
I am gonna throw you

32
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:30,035
the best bachelor
party ever!

33
00:01:30,103 --> 00:01:31,970
- Why would you do that?
- 'Cause I'm your pal

34
00:01:32,038 --> 00:01:34,006
and I want to help.
Like Cheeseburger Helper.

35
00:01:34,074 --> 00:01:35,674
Hey there, Peter.

36
00:01:35,742 --> 00:01:38,143
How would you like to take a
half a pound of hamburger

37
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:40,979
and make a delicious meal
for the whole family?

38
00:01:41,047 --> 00:01:42,981
- Sure!
- Okay, then let's...

39
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:44,983
Hold on there,
Peter!

40
00:01:45,051 --> 00:01:46,985
I've got something
even better!

41
00:01:47,053 --> 00:01:48,987
- Oh, really?
- You bet.

42
00:01:49,055 --> 00:01:51,657
How would you like to take
a half pound of hamburger

43
00:01:51,724 --> 00:01:53,892
and make a delicious meal
for the whole family...

44
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,894
with cheese?

45
00:01:55,962 --> 00:01:57,563
What?

46
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,997
Wha... I... I don't...

47
00:01:59,065 --> 00:02:00,165
I... I could just take cheese

48
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:01,733
and put it on the
thing he's doing.

49
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:03,836
No! It won't be
the same!

50
00:02:03,903 --> 00:02:05,104
Look,
he's my brother.

51
00:02:05,171 --> 00:02:07,106
He didn't get enough
oxygen at birth.

52
00:02:07,173 --> 00:02:09,274
He's never gonna be quite in
step with the rest of us

53
00:02:09,342 --> 00:02:11,510
and this is sort of my way
of taking care of him.

54
00:02:11,578 --> 00:02:13,779
Well, that's nice of you,
but it was so much simpler

55
00:02:13,847 --> 00:02:15,614
when it was just you
and me doing our thing.

56
00:02:15,682 --> 00:02:17,483
I know, but just let
him have this one.

57
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,985
Odds are he won't even come
back with the actual food.

58
00:02:20,053 --> 00:02:22,654
Okay, Cheeseburger Helper,
you're on.

59
00:02:22,722 --> 00:02:23,889
Yay!

60
00:02:23,957 --> 00:02:25,357
Cheese, cheese, cheese!

61
00:02:25,425 --> 00:02:26,692
Yay!

62
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,694
I'm so sorry for your burden.

63
00:02:28,761 --> 00:02:30,462
You're a good brother.

64
00:02:38,338 --> 00:02:40,472
So what do you think, Carter?
You having a good time?

65
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,541
I'm not sure what I'm supposed
to do with myself.

66
00:02:42,609 --> 00:02:43,876
I'm very uncomfortable.

67
00:02:43,943 --> 00:02:46,211
Why don't you get a lap dance,
Mr. Pewterschmidt?

68
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:48,714
No, Peter's crippled friend,
I think I'm just gonna leave.

69
00:02:48,781 --> 00:02:50,048
This was a stupid idea.

70
00:02:50,116 --> 00:02:52,117
Aw, come on, you just gotta
relax and cut loose.

71
00:02:52,185 --> 00:02:53,852
Like those foreign
guys over there.

72
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,355
I can't believe
I'm back at the horse.

73
00:02:56,422 --> 00:02:58,023
I had many drinks last night

74
00:02:58,091 --> 00:03:00,025
and I was so hung out
this morning.

75
00:03:00,093 --> 00:03:01,860
Aw, me, too, friend.

76
00:03:01,928 --> 00:03:04,229
I was blowing chinks like crazy.

77
00:03:04,297 --> 00:03:05,831
Boy, this is fun, huh?

78
00:03:05,899 --> 00:03:07,733
Except for the fact we gotta
sit next to that woman

79
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,134
who came with her
co-workers.

80
00:03:09,202 --> 00:03:10,802
Huh, aren't we all pals?

81
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,037
I work at the office.

82
00:03:12,105 --> 00:03:13,305
This is empowering.

83
00:03:13,373 --> 00:03:14,907
Maybe I'll get a dance, huh?

84
00:03:14,974 --> 00:03:16,975
You guys are probably gonna be
talking about this forever.

85
00:03:17,043 --> 00:03:18,844
A woman who's so cool
with all of this?

86
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,078
Jackpot!

87
00:03:20,146 --> 00:03:21,647
All right, there's a
cute-looking one.

88
00:03:21,714 --> 00:03:22,881
Excuse me, miss?

89
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:24,950
This older gentleman would
like a lap dance.

90
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,687
What am I supposed to do?

91
00:03:28,755 --> 00:03:30,689
Nothing. You just sit there
and enjoy yourself.

92
00:03:30,757 --> 00:03:33,692
Do I, do I stick the money
directly inside of her?

93
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,760
No, you do not.

94
00:03:34,827 --> 00:03:36,562
Why, have you done that before?

95
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:38,564
- Doesn't go over.
- When do I hit her?

96
00:03:38,631 --> 00:03:41,400
Oh, for crying out loud,
just drink this.

97
00:03:41,467 --> 00:03:44,403
And you, give this old bastard
the ride of his life.

98
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,904
♪ ♪

99
00:03:45,972 --> 00:03:47,072
Yeah!

100
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,207
- All right, go, Carter!
- All right!

101
00:03:48,274 --> 00:03:49,708
Get some! Get some!

102
00:03:49,776 --> 00:03:51,977
Hey, Joe, that's like
right in my (bleep) ear.

103
00:03:52,045 --> 00:03:53,579
Stop it! Peter, I... I...

104
00:03:53,646 --> 00:03:54,913
Whoa!

105
00:03:54,981 --> 00:03:56,748
Boy, she's bendy!

106
00:03:56,816 --> 00:03:58,650
wow! Y... yes!

107
00:03:58,718 --> 00:04:00,485
Oh! Awesome!

108
00:04:00,553 --> 00:04:02,321
All right! Oh!

109
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,024
Oh, my God!
What's happening to him?

110
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:08,360
I'm having a heart attack...
ack... ack... ack... ack... ack!

111
00:04:08,428 --> 00:04:10,429
You ought to know by now!

112
00:04:12,932 --> 00:04:14,366
Oh, my God!

113
00:04:14,434 --> 00:04:16,835
Is my father gonna be
okay, Dr. House?

114
00:04:16,903 --> 00:04:18,737
He's in a coma, Mrs. Griffin.

115
00:04:18,805 --> 00:04:20,405
And listening to the
sound of your voice,

116
00:04:20,473 --> 00:04:22,407
I'd say he's the lucky one.

117
00:04:22,475 --> 00:04:25,644
Oh, dear, I do hope there's
something to be done.

118
00:04:25,712 --> 00:04:27,646
Dr. House, if you're gonna
save this patient,

119
00:04:27,714 --> 00:04:28,914
you'll need this.

120
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,218
Get this thing outta my sight!

121
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,153
But wait a second!

122
00:04:35,221 --> 00:04:36,989
How are you gonna
play by the rules

123
00:04:37,056 --> 00:04:38,824
if you don't have
the rule boo... oh...!

124
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:41,827
My methods are a little
unorthodox, Mr. Griffin.

125
00:04:41,894 --> 00:04:43,161
I think I can help.

126
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:45,163
- What are you doing?
- My job.

127
00:04:45,231 --> 00:04:46,999
Sometimes people fake
being in a coma.

128
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:48,333
This man's not.

129
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:50,335
Unless of course, the first
punch knocked him out.

130
00:04:50,403 --> 00:04:52,871
In which case, we won't know
for some time.

131
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:54,873
- House.
<i>- Road House</i>.

132
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:56,675
That, too.

133
00:04:59,412 --> 00:05:01,179
Any word on Carter's
condition yet?

134
00:05:01,247 --> 00:05:02,848
No, it's been three days

135
00:05:02,915 --> 00:05:04,683
and I'm really starting
to get worried.

136
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:06,752
What if he's in a coma for,
like, twenty years

137
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:09,421
and he comes out of the coma
and you guys are all dead,

138
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:12,090
but I'm still alive and
I'm a famous race car driver,

139
00:05:12,158 --> 00:05:15,093
and he's like "Aw, man,
Stewie turned out awesome."

140
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:16,762
And he comes to one of my races

141
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:19,097
and I'm so surprised
to see him there, I crash,

142
00:05:19,165 --> 00:05:21,099
and then I'm in a coma
for twenty years,

143
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:23,602
and I wake up and
he's a race car driver.

144
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,771
Stewie, do you want to be a
race car driver when you grow up?

145
00:05:25,838 --> 00:05:27,706
Well, gosh, if you think
I'd be good at it.

146
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,943
Hello, Mrs. Griffin,

147
00:05:32,011 --> 00:05:33,845
I'm Kenneth Gould,
Mr. Pewterschmidt's attorney.

148
00:05:33,913 --> 00:05:35,914
I'd like to talk to you
about a few things.

149
00:05:35,982 --> 00:05:38,083
As part of Mr. Pewterschmidt's
estate planning,

150
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:39,751
he has left video wills

151
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:42,054
applicable to a wide
variety of situations.

152
00:05:44,357 --> 00:05:45,791
Hello, if you're watching this,

153
00:05:45,858 --> 00:05:48,126
it means they didn't cut
the rope when I climaxed.

154
00:05:48,194 --> 00:05:49,494
As a result, I'm now dead.

155
00:05:49,562 --> 00:05:50,696
That's not it.

156
00:05:50,763 --> 00:05:52,130
If you're watching this one,

157
00:05:52,198 --> 00:05:53,932
it means the train wasn't
able to push the Delorean

158
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,935
up to 88 miles per hour and
I'm still stuck in 1885.

159
00:05:57,003 --> 00:05:58,403
This could
take a while.

160
00:05:58,471 --> 00:06:00,405
...eaten by sharks
while snorkeling...

161
00:06:00,473 --> 00:06:02,607
...stabbed to death
in a Toys-R-Us bathroom.

162
00:06:02,675 --> 00:06:04,810
...1940s roller skate
left in the hall.

163
00:06:04,877 --> 00:06:06,144
Death by chocolate.

164
00:06:06,212 --> 00:06:07,446
No, no, leave it in.

165
00:06:07,513 --> 00:06:09,114
...had a heart attack and have
slipped into a coma.

166
00:06:09,182 --> 00:06:10,382
Here we go.

167
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,317
In that case,
I leave control of my company,

168
00:06:12,385 --> 00:06:14,686
Pewterschmidt Industries,
to my daughter Lois.

169
00:06:14,754 --> 00:06:15,887
What?!

170
00:06:15,955 --> 00:06:17,289
I don't know the first thing

171
00:06:17,357 --> 00:06:18,957
about running
a billion-dollar company.

172
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:20,659
The board of directors
is fully prepared

173
00:06:20,727 --> 00:06:22,327
to run the company in
Carter's absence,

174
00:06:22,395 --> 00:06:24,062
if that's what you'd prefer,
Mrs. Griffin.

175
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,098
Well, yes,
I think that'd be best.

176
00:06:26,165 --> 00:06:27,332
Well, now wait
a second, Lois.

177
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,334
- I could run the company.
- You?

178
00:06:29,402 --> 00:06:31,336
You can't run a business
that size.

179
00:06:31,404 --> 00:06:33,171
You have no experience.

180
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:34,406
You know what
that is, Lois?

181
00:06:34,474 --> 00:06:35,907
That's you playing
by the rule book.

182
00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:37,542
And I don't play
by the rule book.

183
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,344
- Right, Dr. House?
- Well, don't ask me.

184
00:06:39,412 --> 00:06:41,346
My superiors
think I'm crazy.

185
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,016
Scared ya, didn't I?

186
00:06:45,084 --> 00:06:47,018
<i>- House</i>.
<i>- House</i>.

187
00:06:47,086 --> 00:06:48,687
And I'm gonna run
the company.

188
00:06:52,144 --> 00:06:53,911
Well, Lois,
I'm off to my first day

189
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:55,246
as a corporate bigwig.

190
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,248
I'm not so sure about
this, Peter.

191
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:58,916
I mean,
that's Daddy's company.

192
00:06:58,984 --> 00:07:01,385
He spent his whole life building
it from the ground up.

193
00:07:01,453 --> 00:07:03,721
And you don't know anything
about running a big business.

194
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:05,890
Whoa, whoa, thanks
for the vote of confidence.

195
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,726
Geez, you're a bigger downer
than a German bedtime story.

196
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:25,242
And in addition,

197
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,244
Pewterschmidt Industries'
pharmaceutical division

198
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:28,746
is up over 30%,

199
00:07:28,814 --> 00:07:30,915
profits in new media have
doubled each quarter

200
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:34,418
over the past year,
and our stock is at an all-time high.

201
00:07:34,486 --> 00:07:35,786
All right, stand aside.

202
00:07:35,854 --> 00:07:36,988
I'll take it from here.

203
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:38,189
Good afternoon, gentlemen,

204
00:07:38,256 --> 00:07:39,557
my name is Peter Griffin.

205
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,027
I will be running the company
from hence here forth.

206
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,196
Now, I want you all to lay
some business talk on me.

207
00:07:45,263 --> 00:07:46,497
I need ideas.

208
00:07:46,565 --> 00:07:48,766
What can we do to make this
quarter more quarterly?

209
00:07:50,502 --> 00:07:51,502
Well, come on, come on.

210
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:56,574
Okay, I can see I'm gonna have
to get things rollin'.

211
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,843
All right, we're gonna do an
exercise called the idea ball.

212
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,711
I'm gonna toss a ball
to one of you,

213
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:02,713
and whoever catches it,
throw out the first idea you got,

214
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:04,415
then pass the ball
to the next guy,

215
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:06,684
and he throws out an idea and so on.
Everybody clear?

216
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:08,786
Yeah.

217
00:08:08,854 --> 00:08:10,554
All right, here we go.

218
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,090
All right, Abrams, whaddaya got?

219
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:14,792
My lung's collapsing.

220
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,662
You know what I'm hearin',
gentlemen?

221
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:20,164
What's the best way to put this?

222
00:08:20,232 --> 00:08:23,234
What I'm hearing...

223
00:08:27,172 --> 00:08:29,440
What I'm hearin' is a
lot of yesterday talk.

224
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:31,742
This isn't the way we're gonna
do things under my leadership.

225
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,744
We are gonna turn
this company around.

226
00:08:33,812 --> 00:08:35,379
But, sir, the company's
doing fine.

227
00:08:35,447 --> 00:08:36,380
Better than ever, in fact.

228
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:37,815
Mr. Pewterschmidt would...

229
00:08:37,883 --> 00:08:39,650
I don't care what Mr.
Pewterschmidt would have done.

230
00:08:39,718 --> 00:08:40,685
We need to take risks.

231
00:08:40,752 --> 00:08:42,453
We need a complete overhaul.

232
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:44,488
Gentlemen, you're all fired.

233
00:08:44,556 --> 00:08:45,890
What?!

234
00:08:45,957 --> 00:08:47,658
There, now that I've got
your attention...

235
00:08:47,726 --> 00:08:48,926
you're all fired.

236
00:08:52,998 --> 00:08:55,199
Peter, what the hell
is going on?

237
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:57,535
You fired everybody
at Daddy's company?!

238
00:08:57,602 --> 00:08:59,270
- You bet.
- Are you outta your mind?!

239
00:08:59,337 --> 00:09:00,938
Keep it up, Lois,
I might fire you.

240
00:09:01,006 --> 00:09:02,273
You wouldn't.

241
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,242
Does the name Lacey Chabert
mean anything to you?

242
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,744
Okay, I'll behave.

243
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:07,978
Yes, you will.

244
00:09:08,046 --> 00:09:09,480
Look, Peter,
all I'm saying is,

245
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:11,482
those guys have been
with Daddy for years.

246
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,051
How are you supposed to run
that company without them?

247
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:15,386
That's it, Lois,
you're fired.

248
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:16,987
Chris, you are
now Meg's mother.

249
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:20,825
Ooh, Peter, your muscles
are so muscley.

250
00:09:20,892 --> 00:09:24,095
I am gonna plow you
so gross later.

251
00:09:27,132 --> 00:09:30,067
You are a team of executives
I can trust.

252
00:09:30,135 --> 00:09:32,069
Brian, Quagmire, Mort,

253
00:09:32,137 --> 00:09:33,738
you are gonna be
my creative team.

254
00:09:33,805 --> 00:09:36,207
You are gonna help me lead
this company into the future.

255
00:09:36,274 --> 00:09:38,109
Peter, we don't know
anything more than you do

256
00:09:38,176 --> 00:09:39,110
about running
a company.

257
00:09:39,177 --> 00:09:40,177
Hey, where's Joe?

258
00:09:40,245 --> 00:09:42,079
I think he's still outside.

259
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:45,649
Hey, Joe!
What're you doin' down there?!

260
00:09:45,717 --> 00:09:46,717
There's no ramp!

261
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:48,219
I can't get inside!

262
00:09:48,286 --> 00:09:49,553
Well, we don't need him anyway.

263
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:52,056
This company's gonna
make it on my ideas.

264
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:53,891
Here are the products
we'll be unveiling

265
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:55,192
in the new fiscal year.

266
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,228
The African American
heart monitor.

267
00:09:57,295 --> 00:10:01,332
<i>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</i>

268
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:03,367
<i>Aw, he dead.</i>

269
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:05,369
Jeremy Irons cereal.

270
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:08,873
If you're looking for
marshmallows, there are none.

271
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,909
It's quite bland, I assure you.

272
00:10:11,977 --> 00:10:13,677
And scream in a box.

273
00:10:15,747 --> 00:10:17,281
I needed that today.

274
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:19,517
And now,
new lady scream in a box.

275
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:24,155
Finally, a scream
that's right for me.

276
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:29,193
Well, it's good to see
everyone's adapting

277
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:31,228
to their new business roles.

278
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:33,297
Brian, I like
your successories.

279
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:37,835
I will.

280
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:39,937
I will go get it.

281
00:10:43,942 --> 00:10:45,876
Mr. Quagmire, the Davidson
account is waiting for you

282
00:10:45,944 --> 00:10:47,044
in the conference room.

283
00:10:47,112 --> 00:10:48,212
All right, thanks, Marlene.

284
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,547
Tell 'em I'll be right in.

285
00:10:49,614 --> 00:10:52,950
All right, Glenn,
time to go make millions.

286
00:10:54,052 --> 00:10:55,853
What happened
to you, man?

287
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,488
I grew up!
That's what happened!

288
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,156
What happened to the
free-loving Quagmire

289
00:10:59,224 --> 00:11:01,325
Who was banging ten
chicks at a time?

290
00:11:01,393 --> 00:11:02,993
I still do that.

291
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:04,595
- Oh. Good.
- Yup.

292
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:05,763
Can I have
some money?

293
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,398
Oh, get out of here,
you bum.

294
00:11:07,465 --> 00:11:08,632
Ah, all right.

295
00:11:11,469 --> 00:11:16,240
<i>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</i>

296
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:17,474
<i>He's a'ight.</i>

297
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:19,109
Daddy, you're awake!

298
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:21,278
Oh, Carter,
I'm so relieved.

299
00:11:21,346 --> 00:11:22,513
What happened?

300
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:23,681
Where am I?

301
00:11:23,748 --> 00:11:25,516
Oh, you had
a heart attack, Daddy,

302
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:27,017
But you're all right now.

303
00:11:27,085 --> 00:11:28,285
<i>Yeah, he cool.</i>

304
00:11:28,353 --> 00:11:29,486
What the hell is that?!

305
00:11:29,554 --> 00:11:31,255
Oh, it's an African American
heart monitor

306
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:32,423
made by your company.

307
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,824
What?!

308
00:11:33,892 --> 00:11:36,694
Yes, it has two settings...
Barry White and Bill Cosby.

309
00:11:36,761 --> 00:11:39,897
<i>Beep. Beep. Boop. Beep.</i>

310
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,699
My company makes
no such thing.

311
00:11:41,766 --> 00:11:44,301
Well, you see, Daddy,
when you were in a coma,

312
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:47,238
Peter stepped in and took charge
of Pewterschmidt Industries.

313
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:49,840
<i>Zibida, zoobida, gebada,
bopada, zipity, ziggita,</i>

314
00:11:49,908 --> 00:11:52,309
<i>sagata, boopada, bopada,
ghost dad!</i>

315
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,381
Well, you made it, Peter.

316
00:11:57,449 --> 00:11:58,749
You're a big shot.

317
00:11:58,817 --> 00:12:00,818
In charge of a whole bunch
of people.

318
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,187
Peggy, hold my calls
for a few minutes, please.

319
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:04,521
<i>Yes, Mr. Griffin.</i>

320
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:07,458
Well, buddy,
you're in love with Peggy.

321
00:12:07,525 --> 00:12:08,959
What a mess.

322
00:12:09,027 --> 00:12:11,328
Griffin! Get the hell
out of my building!

323
00:12:11,396 --> 00:12:13,464
Holy crap, Mr. Pewterschmidt,
you're okay!

324
00:12:13,531 --> 00:12:14,965
You're damn
right I'm okay,

325
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:17,334
and I'm here to reassume
charge of my company.

326
00:12:17,402 --> 00:12:18,903
Maybe I don't want to leave.

327
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,638
Maybe I like being a fat cat.

328
00:12:20,705 --> 00:12:21,939
What are you saying?

329
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,440
I'm saying it's my company now,

330
00:12:23,508 --> 00:12:26,210
and it's better than it ever was
when you were running it.

331
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,312
Security, we have a situation
in the conference room.

332
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,481
I'll give you a situation,
you fat turd.

333
00:12:30,548 --> 00:12:32,683
Gentlemen, please remove
this man from the building.

334
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,251
What th...?
I'm Carter Pewterschmidt!

335
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:35,419
This is my company!

336
00:12:35,487 --> 00:12:36,720
Throw that guy out!

337
00:12:36,788 --> 00:12:37,888
Sorry,
Mr. Pewterschmidt,

338
00:12:37,956 --> 00:12:39,623
but we work
for Mr. Griffin now.

339
00:12:39,691 --> 00:12:41,158
You can't do
this to me!

340
00:12:41,226 --> 00:12:42,660
Do you know
who I am?!

341
00:12:42,727 --> 00:12:43,827
I'm Carter
Pewterschmidt!

342
00:12:43,895 --> 00:12:45,296
I'm not getting
in that elevator!

343
00:12:45,363 --> 00:12:47,464
Don't you dare throw
me out of this lobby!

344
00:12:47,532 --> 00:12:48,632
Don't you...
Damn it!

345
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,334
Hey, what are you
doing out here?

346
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,002
I can't get in
the building!

347
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,170
Uh, Peggy?

348
00:12:53,238 --> 00:12:54,571
<i>Yes, Mr. Griffin.</i>

349
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,474
That fart I have at 3:00...
can you push that up to now?

350
00:12:57,542 --> 00:12:58,742
<i>Very good, sir.</i>

351
00:13:05,004 --> 00:13:07,172
Lois, how could you
let your idiot husband

352
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,507
take over my company?

353
00:13:08,574 --> 00:13:09,908
He fired all my staff,

354
00:13:09,976 --> 00:13:12,511
his stupid ideas are bankrupting
Pewterschmidt Industries,

355
00:13:12,578 --> 00:13:14,079
and now he won't step down!

356
00:13:14,147 --> 00:13:15,247
I know, Daddy.

357
00:13:15,314 --> 00:13:16,915
He's become so full
of himself.

358
00:13:16,983 --> 00:13:19,651
He's more annoying than when
he's making his Christmas list.

359
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:22,788
Now, Peter, are you sure this is
all you want for Christmas?

360
00:13:22,855 --> 00:13:24,623
I'm only going
to the mall once.

361
00:13:24,691 --> 00:13:26,158
Yeah, yeah,
that's it.

362
00:13:26,225 --> 00:13:28,794
<i>All new this Christmas...
remote control cars...</i>

363
00:13:28,861 --> 00:13:31,029
<i>that glow in the dark?!</i>

364
00:13:35,034 --> 00:13:36,968
Get that!

365
00:13:37,036 --> 00:13:39,037
I've run that
company for fourty years.

366
00:13:39,105 --> 00:13:41,039
He even froze my
corporate bank accounts.

367
00:13:41,107 --> 00:13:42,274
I'm broke.

368
00:13:42,341 --> 00:13:43,442
Oh, that's ridiculous.

369
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:45,811
I'll talk to him
as soon as he gets home.

370
00:13:47,046 --> 00:13:48,213
What the hell is that?!

371
00:14:00,126 --> 00:14:01,259
Damn it, Peter!

372
00:14:01,327 --> 00:14:03,428
Your plane set
my lawn on fire!

373
00:14:03,496 --> 00:14:04,963
Here, that ought
to cover it.

374
00:14:05,031 --> 00:14:06,732
Peter, I don't
want your money!

375
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:09,334
Well, fine, then, have a box
of Jeremy Irons cereal.

376
00:14:09,402 --> 00:14:13,305
If you're looking for a prize
at the bottom, there is none.

377
00:14:13,372 --> 00:14:16,108
Only more cardboard.

378
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:17,943
Peter, this has gone on
long enough.

379
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:20,178
I want you to make things right
with Daddy.

380
00:14:20,246 --> 00:14:21,346
It's his company.

381
00:14:21,414 --> 00:14:22,514
It's my company.

382
00:14:22,582 --> 00:14:23,682
It's your company.

383
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,850
<i>Three's Company</i>.

384
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:27,152
Where the kisses are hers
and hers and his.

385
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,553
- What?
- I'm sorry, Lois.

386
00:14:28,621 --> 00:14:30,689
We all had some pot brownies
on the plane.

387
00:14:30,757 --> 00:14:32,390
Hey, Peter,
are you seeing this rabbit?

388
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,458
No.

389
00:14:33,526 --> 00:14:34,626
Well, I sure am.

390
00:14:34,694 --> 00:14:35,827
You know something?

391
00:14:35,895 --> 00:14:38,597
You're not qualified
to sit in that chair.

392
00:14:38,664 --> 00:14:40,866
Oh, aren't I?

393
00:14:43,336 --> 00:14:45,070
Maybe there's a rabbit
head under here.

394
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,408
Peter, all of my father's assets
are tied up in that corporation.

395
00:14:50,476 --> 00:14:51,943
If you freeze up his money,

396
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:53,879
he's not gonna have
anything to live on.

397
00:14:53,946 --> 00:14:56,581
Now you are gonna make amends
with Daddy, and that's final.

398
00:14:56,649 --> 00:14:58,617
All right, Lois,
if that's what you want.

399
00:14:58,684 --> 00:15:01,319
Mr. Pewterschmidt, be in
my office tomorrow morning at 9:00.

400
00:15:01,387 --> 00:15:03,989
I'm sure we can
figure something out.

401
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:09,694
Hmm... I don't know if I like
the sound of that laugh.

402
00:15:09,762 --> 00:15:11,997
I knew I didn't like
the sound of that laugh.

403
00:15:12,064 --> 00:15:13,198
Peter, this is
unacceptable.

404
00:15:13,266 --> 00:15:15,433
What gives you the right
to treat me like this?

405
00:15:15,501 --> 00:15:16,968
You've been treating me
like crap

406
00:15:17,036 --> 00:15:19,905
for twenty years, Mr. Pewterschmidt,
and now I'm the one in charge.

407
00:15:19,972 --> 00:15:21,973
Hang on a second.

408
00:15:32,084 --> 00:15:33,418
Clean that up.

409
00:15:36,055 --> 00:15:37,322
Carter, as your boss,

410
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,291
I command you
to have a viewing party

411
00:15:39,358 --> 00:15:41,359
for tonight's episode
of <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>,

412
00:15:41,427 --> 00:15:43,895
and you have to go cubicle
to cubicle inviting people.

413
00:15:43,963 --> 00:15:46,665
Aw, come on, Peter, I'm not...
I'm not good with rejection.

414
00:15:46,732 --> 00:15:48,600
I'm your boss.
Now do it!

415
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,605
Hi. I was gonna catch
<i>The Big Bang Theory</i> tonight,

416
00:15:53,673 --> 00:15:56,241
and wondered if you wanted
to come over and watch.

417
00:15:56,309 --> 00:15:57,776
Wha... What?
What is that?

418
00:15:57,844 --> 00:15:59,344
It's a comedy.
It's on CBS.

419
00:15:59,412 --> 00:16:00,512
I'm really into it.

420
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,913
I don't want
to watch that.

421
00:16:01,981 --> 00:16:03,782
I don't want to
watch it with you.

422
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:06,084
All right, if you change
your mind, here's a flyer.

423
00:16:06,152 --> 00:16:07,485
If you do decide to come,

424
00:16:07,553 --> 00:16:09,354
I'm just asking
that you bring an appetizer.

425
00:16:09,422 --> 00:16:10,755
Yeah, I'm not
gonna do that.

426
00:16:10,823 --> 00:16:13,058
See, Peter, I told you,
no one wants to come.

427
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,793
- This is awful.
- You're not off the hook.

428
00:16:14,861 --> 00:16:16,328
You still got
to have that party.

429
00:16:16,395 --> 00:16:19,497
Babs, you want to
sit and watch...?

430
00:16:19,565 --> 00:16:20,932
No.

431
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,368
I'll have you know
that I can bench press

432
00:16:23,436 --> 00:16:25,637
over 690 billion nanograms.

433
00:16:25,705 --> 00:16:27,472
Sheldon, that's less
than two pounds.

434
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,574
It sounded better
the way I said it.

435
00:16:31,577 --> 00:16:34,312
Oh, when I tell that joke
at work tomorrow, people...

436
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,448
people... people are gonna
be sorry they didn't come.

437
00:16:36,515 --> 00:16:37,983
They're... they're gonna...
this... this was...

438
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,417
this... this was a good night.

439
00:16:42,021 --> 00:16:43,822
Carter, as your boss,
I'm ordering you

440
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:47,092
to pay a compliment to this
sharply-dressed Asian man.

441
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,326
You look very nice.

442
00:16:48,394 --> 00:16:49,794
What else?

443
00:16:49,862 --> 00:16:51,129
- Uh...
- What about my shoe?

444
00:16:51,197 --> 00:16:52,297
They're nice, too.

445
00:16:52,365 --> 00:16:53,899
How you think
my house smell?

446
00:16:53,966 --> 00:16:55,133
Not oniony?

447
00:16:55,201 --> 00:16:56,568
You good man.

448
00:16:56,636 --> 00:16:59,771
I pat you on the head and
feed you from the hand.

449
00:17:04,677 --> 00:17:07,279
And then he made me
clean out the fridge

450
00:17:07,346 --> 00:17:10,315
in the employee lounge,
and the employees were mad at me

451
00:17:10,383 --> 00:17:12,617
Because I... I threw out food
that they still wanted.

452
00:17:12,685 --> 00:17:14,085
I don't know
what's in there!

453
00:17:14,153 --> 00:17:15,253
Oh, that's it.

454
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:16,821
Peter is completely
out of control.

455
00:17:16,889 --> 00:17:18,890
We've got to do something
to take him down

456
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,392
and get your company back.

457
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:21,760
Right, right. But how?

458
00:17:21,827 --> 00:17:23,261
In order to oust an idiot,

459
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:25,030
we've got to think
like an idiot.

460
00:17:25,097 --> 00:17:26,298
Let's see.

461
00:17:26,365 --> 00:17:27,632
What's Peter's weakness?

462
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,701
He's got to have a weakness.

463
00:17:31,003 --> 00:17:32,337
Swamp monsters.

464
00:17:32,405 --> 00:17:35,173
Swamp monsters, of course!

465
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,844
Lois, what are you doing here?

466
00:17:39,912 --> 00:17:42,480
Oh, I just wanted to make
sure everything was okay.

467
00:17:42,548 --> 00:17:44,516
Of course it's okay.
Why wouldn't it be?

468
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,584
Oh, you know, that whole
swamp monster story.

469
00:17:46,652 --> 00:17:47,686
Swamp monster?

470
00:17:47,753 --> 00:17:49,521
- You haven't heard?
- Heard what?

471
00:17:49,588 --> 00:17:51,489
Oh, I'm sure it's nothing.

472
00:17:51,557 --> 00:17:52,691
It's just, apparently,

473
00:17:52,758 --> 00:17:54,459
somebody flushed a
baby swamp monster

474
00:17:54,527 --> 00:17:56,695
down the toilet somewhere,
not far from here.

475
00:17:56,762 --> 00:17:59,564
What?! Who would flush
a baby swamp monster?

476
00:17:59,632 --> 00:18:01,166
Don't they know
what would happen?

477
00:18:01,233 --> 00:18:03,001
Well, apparently,
it has happened.

478
00:18:03,069 --> 00:18:04,269
And now it's grown up

479
00:18:04,337 --> 00:18:06,571
and is attacking
important businessmen.

480
00:18:06,639 --> 00:18:08,106
I'm an important
businessman!

481
00:18:10,643 --> 00:18:11,977
What the hell was that?!

482
00:18:12,044 --> 00:18:14,012
It sounds like maybe
a swamp monster

483
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,981
who needs to project
a little more.

484
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:21,519
Ah, crap!

485
00:18:22,688 --> 00:18:24,255
Aah! A swamp monster!

486
00:18:27,026 --> 00:18:28,460
Quick, Peter,
sign this legal document

487
00:18:28,527 --> 00:18:31,329
giving the company
back to Daddy so you won't get eaten!

488
00:18:31,397 --> 00:18:33,431
Oh, I don't understand,
but nothing makes sense

489
00:18:33,499 --> 00:18:35,066
in these swamp monster times.

490
00:18:36,635 --> 00:18:38,136
We did it, Daddy.

491
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:40,905
I have my husband back,
and you have your company.

492
00:18:40,973 --> 00:18:42,607
Sorry I'm late, Lois.

493
00:18:42,675 --> 00:18:44,642
Okay, are we doing the
swamp monster thing?

494
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:48,246
Wait, if you're Daddy,
then who...?

495
00:18:48,314 --> 00:18:51,583
S... s... s... s... s... s... s...
Swamp monster!

496
00:19:17,076 --> 00:19:20,178
Now let's find out
who you really are.

497
00:19:21,514 --> 00:19:22,614
Dr. House?!

498
00:19:22,681 --> 00:19:23,848
Indeed, Lois.

499
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,817
And if you don't mind,
I'll address you

500
00:19:25,885 --> 00:19:27,252
in my natural speaking voice,

501
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:29,687
as I've grown so weary
of doing an American accent.

502
00:19:29,755 --> 00:19:30,855
Do you want to come

503
00:19:30,923 --> 00:19:32,724
to my <i>Big Bang</i>
viewing party next week?

504
00:19:32,792 --> 00:19:34,626
Daddy, you don't have
to do that anymore.

505
00:19:34,693 --> 00:19:36,795
I know, I know.
I... I... I like it now.

506
00:19:39,331 --> 00:19:41,299
Well, I'm sorry
you lost the company, Peter,

507
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:43,068
but I think it's for the best.

508
00:19:43,135 --> 00:19:45,070
You were turning
into a real jerk.

509
00:19:45,137 --> 00:19:46,337
Well, maybe so.

510
00:19:46,405 --> 00:19:49,140
But I sure am gonna miss
being a corporate big shot.

511
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:52,143
Well, you'll always be a big
shot in this family, sweetheart.

512
00:19:52,211 --> 00:19:53,578
Thanks, honey.

513
00:19:53,646 --> 00:19:55,747
And I got a little
surprise for you.

514
00:19:55,815 --> 00:19:57,382
In that contract
you signed,

515
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,317
you got to keep the
corporate plane.

516
00:19:59,385 --> 00:20:01,486
Yeah!

517
00:20:05,057 --> 00:20:06,558
Peter, how are
you doing that?

518
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,059
I... I don't...
I don't know, Lois.

519
00:20:08,127 --> 00:20:09,060
I'm scared.

520
00:20:09,128 --> 00:20:10,195
Well, come down.

521
00:20:10,262 --> 00:20:11,729
I can't. I... I...
Get help.

522
00:20:11,797 --> 00:20:12,897
Call somebody.

523
00:20:12,965 --> 00:20:14,232
Wh... wh... who do I call?

524
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,901
I... I don't know. A police...
a fireman... a scientist!

525
00:20:16,969 --> 00:20:18,136
Call a scientist!

526
00:20:18,204 --> 00:20:20,004
Okay, you kids stay here
with your father.

527
00:20:20,072 --> 00:20:22,373
I'm gonna go find
a scientist.

528
00:20:22,441 --> 00:20:24,442
Am I gonna die?
