1
00:00:35,782 --> 00:00:39,621
Now, remember, don't touch this money
until you get to the grocery store.

2
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,085
Then buy one can of beans and come
straight home. Do you understand?

3
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,463
Lois, I'm a guy you can trust
with a task.

4
00:00:45,672 --> 00:00:48,134
I'm the one who almost
conquered the dragon's layer.

5
00:00:54,894 --> 00:00:56,020
Ah!

6
00:00:57,064 --> 00:00:59,150
<i>"Dragon's Layer"</i>

7
00:01:04,366 --> 00:01:05,952
Peter, where have you been?

8
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,997
You left for the market six hours ago.

9
00:01:08,247 --> 00:01:10,625
- Did you get the beans?
- I got something better.

10
00:01:10,876 --> 00:01:14,088
You know how you always wanted
a real diamond engagement ring?

11
00:01:14,631 --> 00:01:16,008
Oh, my God.

12
00:01:16,216 --> 00:01:19,222
That's right. I bought a horse.

13
00:01:19,598 --> 00:01:21,183
You bought a horse?

14
00:01:21,392 --> 00:01:23,979
Why the hell did...?
I didn't give you that much money.

15
00:01:24,187 --> 00:01:25,481
That's what I thought, Lois.

16
00:01:25,857 --> 00:01:28,694
Sold to the gentleman
from Quahog, Rhode Island.

17
00:01:28,903 --> 00:01:31,990
Congratulations, sir.
What brings you down here to Louisville?

18
00:01:32,157 --> 00:01:33,618
I don't know.

19
00:01:33,826 --> 00:01:36,413
Peter, there's something off
about that horse.

20
00:01:36,622 --> 00:01:38,082
You have an eye for animals.

21
00:01:38,249 --> 00:01:41,463
This horse is retarded.
That's why I got it so cheap.

22
00:01:42,881 --> 00:01:45,969
I don't think it's wise
to have a retarded horse as a house pet.

23
00:01:46,178 --> 00:01:51,144
Shut up. You don't know nothing
about anything.

24
00:01:51,353 --> 00:01:53,606
Whatever, Peter. Fine, keep the horse.

25
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:56,401
Good, this family works much better
when we're unified.

26
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,407
You'll see, this horse
will be a fine addition to our family.

27
00:02:01,826 --> 00:02:04,580
I don't want him to feel self-conscious.
Everybody, pee.

28
00:02:04,747 --> 00:02:07,834
- Peter, we...
- Everybody, pee now.

29
00:02:08,043 --> 00:02:10,421
We're an unusual family.

30
00:02:16,555 --> 00:02:19,645
- Peter, the horse is here.
- Oh, yeah.

31
00:02:19,853 --> 00:02:22,273
It's so creepy,
the way it just stares like that.

32
00:02:22,482 --> 00:02:23,775
Why doesn't it do something?

33
00:02:23,983 --> 00:02:26,112
He's retarded, Lois.
You should understand.

34
00:02:26,321 --> 00:02:28,866
You're married to a retarded man. Eh?

35
00:02:29,075 --> 00:02:31,245
You're married to a retarded man.

36
00:02:33,915 --> 00:02:35,835
Ew! Ew! Ew!

37
00:02:36,043 --> 00:02:39,966
What is it? Brian,
is Paul Sorvino standing behind me?

38
00:02:40,174 --> 00:02:41,801
Hey, you want a sugar cube, horsy?

39
00:02:42,052 --> 00:02:43,846
Oh, God, Brian, don't.

40
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:50,731
Ugh! Ew! Ew! Ew!

41
00:03:02,624 --> 00:03:06,212
What made you come around, Lois?

42
00:03:07,298 --> 00:03:10,135
I love you so much.

43
00:03:10,302 --> 00:03:13,139
I love you so much, Lois.

44
00:03:13,306 --> 00:03:15,517
I love you too, Peter.

45
00:03:17,604 --> 00:03:20,610
Take Maple Drive, otherwise
we won't make the movie on time.

46
00:03:20,818 --> 00:03:22,905
All right. Uh-oh.

47
00:03:23,113 --> 00:03:24,489
What is it?

48
00:03:24,656 --> 00:03:27,244
The horse is right behind the car.

49
00:03:28,454 --> 00:03:30,248
Peter, that thing is just creepy.

50
00:03:30,415 --> 00:03:33,669
Hey. Scat, scat. Go on, you.

51
00:03:33,921 --> 00:03:36,382
We're go...
We're going to see a movie.

52
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,427
All right,
I'm gonna try something else.

53
00:03:48,274 --> 00:03:50,403
No, no, no!

54
00:03:54,618 --> 00:03:58,832
Oh, that's got
all my stink of the day in it.

55
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:00,542
That's nasty.

56
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:07,762
Why are there so many bottles of milk
in the refrigerator?

57
00:04:07,971 --> 00:04:11,267
Thanks for reminding me. Some
of the milk in the fridge is not milk...

58
00:04:11,475 --> 00:04:14,145
...it's horse sperm.
I'm a horse breeder now.

59
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,957
No one's gonna wanna breed
with that horse.

60
00:04:27,165 --> 00:04:28,376
After tomorrow, they will.

61
00:04:28,584 --> 00:04:31,171
I'm gonna enter him in the derby
and he's gonna win.

62
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,217
I just know it.
I got a sixth sense about this things.

63
00:04:34,384 --> 00:04:37,055
<i>Remember when I predicted the ending
to Wild Hogs?</i>

64
00:04:37,264 --> 00:04:39,475
This movie's gonna suck.

65
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,777
Hey there, little fella.

66
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,447
I'm 48.

67
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,994
This whole place is a giant mindfuck.

68
00:04:52,202 --> 00:04:53,830
I've never been in the owner's box.

69
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:56,333
We are gonna get a great view
from up here.

70
00:04:56,542 --> 00:04:58,879
This is gonna be a great race.

71
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:01,466
Hey, wha...?
What are you doing? Get down there.

72
00:05:01,675 --> 00:05:04,220
- Where's your midget?
- Sorry, boss. Had to pee.

73
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,515
Come on, you.

74
00:05:06,891 --> 00:05:08,184
Guess he's got a small bladder.

75
00:05:09,603 --> 00:05:12,023
A little tiny guy.
Gotta go all the time.

76
00:05:12,231 --> 00:05:15,153
Even though he's gotta race,
he couldn't hold it.

77
00:05:18,073 --> 00:05:20,912
<i>And they're off.
- Go, horsy, go.</i>

78
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,582
God, it even runs like it's messed up
in the head.

79
00:05:27,713 --> 00:05:31,177
Is there a reason all the horses
are named after cancelled Fox shows?

80
00:05:31,385 --> 00:05:33,680
<i>Kitchen Confidential,
The Wedding Bells...</i>

81
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:36,351
<i>...followed by Happy Hour,
The War at Home, Drive...</i>

82
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:39,146

87
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:52,750
<i>And bringing up the rear
but still in the race is 'Til Death.</i>

88
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:55,420
- You named your horse "'Til Death"?
- You know why?

89
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:59,176
Because I'm gonna take this horse
and shove it down America's throat.

90
00:05:59,385 --> 00:06:01,972
<i>What's this?
'Til Death has taken a right turn...</i>

91
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,432
<i>...and is heading into the stands.</i>

92
00:06:04,893 --> 00:06:07,397
<i>I could describe
the horror I am witnessing...</i>

93
00:06:07,605 --> 00:06:11,486
<i>...but it is so ugly and heartrending
that I cannot bring myself to do so.</i>

94
00:06:11,736 --> 00:06:14,407
<i>Although I do possess
the necessary descriptive powers.</i>

95
00:06:14,615 --> 00:06:17,869
<i>Well, at least the horse ran past
the class of deaf second graders.</i>

96
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,748
<i>Oh, no, dear God, he's going back!</i>

97
00:06:21,251 --> 00:06:24,005
<i>Oh, I know you can't hear any screams,
but I assure they are signing frantically...</i>

98
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:26,925
<i>...just as fast as their fingers
can shape the phonemes...</i>

99
00:06:27,134 --> 00:06:29,053
<i>...necessary
to convey dread and terror.</i>

100
00:06:29,262 --> 00:06:31,933
Wait. Hold the phone,
he's going back toward the track.

101
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,685
Fellas, this race ain't over yet.

102
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:37,441
Oh, my baby's dead!

103
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:38,651
It's over.

104
00:06:44,576 --> 00:06:47,330
One hundred thousand dollars'
worth of damage...

105
00:06:47,581 --> 00:06:49,291
...all thanks to that stupid horse.

106
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:52,047
Can we not talk about the horse, please?
It's gone.

107
00:06:52,255 --> 00:06:56,177
It suffered a heart attack from the
excitement, and I disposed of it properly.

108
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,362
Oh, boy.

109
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,613
I miss the old days...

110
00:07:09,821 --> 00:07:13,410
...when it was just a flaming bag
of poop and a hurtful note.

111
00:07:13,619 --> 00:07:16,206
I have no idea
how the hell we're gonna pay for this.

112
00:07:16,414 --> 00:07:20,546
Well, I'll just have to get a second job
or something. Hand me the classifieds.

113
00:07:20,713 --> 00:07:24,677
Hey, Lois, look at this.
"Subject wanted for medical... "

114
00:07:24,886 --> 00:07:26,680
- What's that?
- "Experiments. "

115
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,016
Exparagus.

116
00:07:28,225 --> 00:07:29,601
Experiments.

117
00:07:29,768 --> 00:07:31,813
Experiments.

118
00:07:32,021 --> 00:07:33,023
Right.

119
00:07:33,232 --> 00:07:36,111
And it says they'll pay handsomely.
This is perfect.

120
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,864
I won't have to take that job
as Matt Damon's neck.

121
00:07:39,282 --> 00:07:40,867
Hey, Matt.

122
00:07:41,076 --> 00:07:42,120
Matt.

123
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:46,084
Is this one of those movies where you're
an educated Boston street tough?

124
00:07:46,292 --> 00:07:50,257
- I don't have to take that crap from you.
- You have to, my friend. I'm your neck.

125
00:07:50,465 --> 00:07:53,554
What are you gonna do choke me?
You'll die if you do that.

126
00:07:53,762 --> 00:07:55,598
Can somebody from Wardrobe
get a scarf?

127
00:07:55,807 --> 00:07:58,352
Oh, I'm still gonna...
I'll just talk louder.

128
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,148
Ben Affleck married Jennifer Garner...

129
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,943
...but you married a bartender
with a kid.

130
00:08:04,153 --> 00:08:05,904
These are facts.

131
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,327
What do I gotta do, doc?

132
00:08:10,536 --> 00:08:12,080
You don't have to do anything.

133
00:08:12,247 --> 00:08:15,251
We're isolating and studying the effects
of various genes.

134
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:18,923
We're just gonna give you experimental
injections and record the results.

135
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:21,595
- What's this one?
- We call this the squirrel gene.

136
00:08:21,803 --> 00:08:24,725
It's effects
will become apparent shortly.

137
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,780
- Okay, what's next?
- This is the Seth Rogen gene.

138
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:37,242
It will give you the appearance
of being funny...

139
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:40,122
...even though you haven't actually done
anything funny.

140
00:08:42,626 --> 00:08:44,502
Hey, doc,
are we gonna be much longer?

141
00:08:44,712 --> 00:08:47,299
I gotta get some beers with the fellas
before I go out on this date.

142
00:08:48,926 --> 00:08:51,598
How charming and chubby.
I'm rooting for you.

143
00:08:53,475 --> 00:08:56,063
All right, Mr. Griffin.
We're gonna inject you...

144
00:08:56,271 --> 00:08:59,025
...with what we believe we've isolated
as the gay gene.

145
00:08:59,192 --> 00:09:01,403
- I don't understand.
- Well, if we're correct...

146
00:09:01,612 --> 00:09:04,491
...we will have proven
that homosexuality is genetic...

147
00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:06,577
...and not choice or environment.

148
00:09:06,786 --> 00:09:09,457
Are you crazy? I don't wanna
take a chance on being gay.

149
00:09:09,624 --> 00:09:11,167
We'll give you $ 125.

150
00:09:11,334 --> 00:09:12,336
All right, I'll do it.

151
00:09:12,544 --> 00:09:14,631
Boy, you're more persuasive
than James Bond.

152
00:09:16,007 --> 00:09:18,470
Now,
time for some unfinished business.

153
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:20,055
- No, James.
- Yes.

154
00:09:20,263 --> 00:09:23,228
- No, James.
- Yes, you're going to have sex with me.

155
00:09:23,436 --> 00:09:26,107
- No, James! I don't want to.
- Yes, you do.

156
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:28,276
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

157
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,780
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

158
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:32,866
- Okay, yes.
- See that?

159
00:09:33,075 --> 00:09:35,995
Fifty noes and a yes means yes.

160
00:09:40,127 --> 00:09:41,337
Hi.

161
00:09:41,546 --> 00:09:43,424
So how'd
the medical experiments go?

162
00:09:43,632 --> 00:09:45,802
So good, Lois. So good.

163
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,681
I'm gonna squeeze right in here
if my thighs will let me.

164
00:09:51,018 --> 00:09:53,147
Peter, what exactly
did they inject you with?

165
00:09:53,355 --> 00:09:56,526
Oh, all sorts of things.
Hepatitis vaccine, a couple of steroids...

166
00:09:56,736 --> 00:09:59,114
...the gay gene, calcium,
a vitamin B extract.

167
00:09:59,322 --> 00:10:00,866
- What did you say?
- The gay gene.

168
00:10:01,032 --> 00:10:04,329
I assume that's the one you meant,
though it wasn't the last I said...

169
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:07,667
...when you said, "What did you say?"
It was the most unusual.

170
00:10:07,876 --> 00:10:12,550
Yes, that's the one I meant.
Peter, are you gay?

171
00:10:12,758 --> 00:10:20,019
Guilty.

172
00:10:27,405 --> 00:10:28,491
Did anybody see...

173
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:32,621
...that absolutely fabulous piece on Fiji
in yesterday's travel section?

174
00:10:34,457 --> 00:10:36,251
I wish I was Beyoncé.

175
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:40,049
Maybe you should go back and have
that doctor undo whatever he did.

176
00:10:40,257 --> 00:10:41,342
I mean, you're not gay.

177
00:10:43,428 --> 00:10:46,266
- What?
- I said homosexuality is wrong.

178
00:10:46,433 --> 00:10:48,520
Are you...?
Are you being serious right now?

179
00:10:48,728 --> 00:10:50,355
Keep it in the bedroom, you know?

180
00:10:50,563 --> 00:10:53,486
I'm not holding your face
with my heterosexuality.

181
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:54,820
No, you are not.

182
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:58,243
Dad, now that you're gay,
I don't have to have sex with you, do I?

183
00:10:58,451 --> 00:10:59,912
Not unless you want to. Oh!

184
00:11:06,337 --> 00:11:08,215
Oh, my muffins are ready.

185
00:11:10,927 --> 00:11:11,929
You made muffins?

186
00:11:12,137 --> 00:11:13,807
Well, it wasn't the muffin fairy.

187
00:11:14,015 --> 00:11:15,308
Or was it?

188
00:11:17,813 --> 00:11:19,106
- Go ahead, try it.
- Peter...

189
00:11:19,314 --> 00:11:21,443
Try it.

190
00:11:21,652 --> 00:11:24,615
Dad, I think Mom's right.
You should go back to that doctor.

191
00:11:24,824 --> 00:11:26,450
Well, now, wait a minute, Meg.

192
00:11:26,617 --> 00:11:27,995
Let's not be too hasty.

193
00:11:28,161 --> 00:11:29,872
These are delicious.

194
00:11:30,081 --> 00:11:33,168
- What's the secret ingredient?
- Spugizakom.

195
00:11:33,795 --> 00:11:35,380
- Ew!
- What?

196
00:11:35,588 --> 00:11:38,051
Oh, you...
Oh, you thought... No, no, no.

197
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,889
Spugizakom, it's a sugar substitute
from the Czech Republic.

198
00:11:42,098 --> 00:11:43,559
That's right. Spugizakom.

199
00:11:50,152 --> 00:11:51,697
All right, I'll say it.

200
00:11:51,864 --> 00:11:53,574
What the hell are you drinking?

201
00:11:53,867 --> 00:11:56,078
A pomtini. It's a pomegranate martini.

202
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,457
<i>I read about them
in the issue of In Style.</i>

203
00:11:58,665 --> 00:12:01,919
They're what Courtney Thorne-Smith
served at her bachelorette party.

204
00:12:06,968 --> 00:12:08,012
Mm.

205
00:12:08,804 --> 00:12:12,643
So you guys feel like watching
the game at my house on Sunday?

206
00:12:12,852 --> 00:12:14,396
- Sounds good.
- That'd be good.

207
00:12:14,563 --> 00:12:16,023
Hey, Quagmire.

208
00:12:16,231 --> 00:12:18,485
- Quagmire.
- Yeah?

209
00:12:18,694 --> 00:12:20,488
I'll be there.

210
00:12:20,696 --> 00:12:23,452
Well, I think I better get going.

211
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,955
Yeah, why don't you and Cleveland
both get going?

212
00:12:26,164 --> 00:12:28,709
Hey, hey, hey, where you guys going?

213
00:12:30,962 --> 00:12:33,549
If we're gonna do this,
we're gonna do it my way.

214
00:12:36,638 --> 00:12:38,808
- Darn it!
- Knock, knock.

215
00:12:39,016 --> 00:12:40,267
What's the problem, champ?

216
00:12:40,476 --> 00:12:42,562
Why is math so hard?

217
00:12:42,813 --> 00:12:44,357
You know, it doesn't have to be.

218
00:12:44,524 --> 00:12:47,277
One trick I used is turning things
into a word problem.

219
00:12:47,486 --> 00:12:51,116
For example, if there are three
glory holes in the bathroom at the club...

220
00:12:51,326 --> 00:12:53,246
...and 28 guys at the circuit party...

221
00:12:53,454 --> 00:12:57,168
...how many rotations of guys will
it take before everybody's had a turn?

222
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,713
- I don't know.
- Nine, with a remainder of Brent.

223
00:12:59,922 --> 00:13:01,131
Oh.

224
00:13:01,341 --> 00:13:03,426
<i>Because Brent can't fit in the glory hole</i>

225
00:13:03,636 --> 00:13:06,056
<i>And that's why we all like Brent</i>

226
00:13:08,768 --> 00:13:11,605
<i>We now return
to That Black Guy Must Be Doing Well...</i>

227
00:13:11,814 --> 00:13:13,775
...Because Everything He Owns
is White.

228
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,447
Hey, how you doing?

229
00:13:17,614 --> 00:13:19,909
Wow. He must be doing well.

230
00:13:20,285 --> 00:13:22,873
Well, here's the new nightie
you picked out for me.

231
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:24,166
What do you think?

232
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,670
I'm jealous
of Miss Eats-Anything-She-Wants...

233
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:29,382
...and-Still-Fits-Into-a-Size-Four.
I could scratch your eyes out.

234
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:35,308
You know, Peter, with all the shopping
and cooking and decorating...

235
00:13:35,516 --> 00:13:38,645
...I have to say I'm really liking
the new you an awful lot.

236
00:13:38,854 --> 00:13:41,942
An awful lot.

237
00:13:42,151 --> 00:13:43,986
What are you doing?

238
00:13:44,195 --> 00:13:46,449
I'm fooling around.

239
00:13:46,657 --> 00:13:49,411
Come on, sweetie.
Let's have some fun.

240
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,124
Lois, I'm gay.

241
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:55,086
Wait a minute, you mean,
we can't have sex?

242
00:13:55,253 --> 00:13:56,255
No.

243
00:13:56,464 --> 00:13:58,175
But, Peter, we're married.

244
00:13:58,342 --> 00:14:01,346
Tony Randall was married, Lois.
Rock Hudson was married.

245
00:14:01,512 --> 00:14:02,973
Ronald Reagan was married.

246
00:14:03,182 --> 00:14:05,185
Did you reach a missile pact?

247
00:14:05,727 --> 00:14:08,564
Well, you could say that.
There was a missile.

248
00:14:08,773 --> 00:14:11,026
And something definitely got packed.

249
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,074
Did you discuss ICBMs?

250
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,951
Well, I did see a BM.

251
00:14:19,288 --> 00:14:22,293
So would you consider this
a successful summit?

252
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:25,215
Oh, yes. I summited three times.

253
00:14:25,423 --> 00:14:27,426
Are you finished
with butt-fucking puns?

254
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:33,476
Just tell me. Is there anything
you can do to remove this gene?

255
00:14:33,685 --> 00:14:35,980
Mrs. Griffin,
it really doesn't work that way.

256
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:38,066
We wait for the effects to wear off.

257
00:14:38,275 --> 00:14:41,488
- Well, how long will that take?
- A week, a month, a year.

258
00:14:41,696 --> 00:14:44,242
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
six hundred minutes.

259
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,994
<i>Rent, Rent, Rent.</i>

260
00:14:46,161 --> 00:14:48,540
He could be this way
for the rest of his life.

261
00:14:48,748 --> 00:14:51,252
I don't see the big deal.
I like myself this way.

262
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,216
It's a very big deal.
You'll be treated differently...

263
00:14:54,425 --> 00:14:56,928
...just like my Uncle Ray
with a really high-up anus.

264
00:14:58,346 --> 00:15:00,057
I'll be out in a minute.

265
00:15:02,811 --> 00:15:05,732
- So Dad's gonna be gay forever?
- Possibly, Meg.

266
00:15:05,941 --> 00:15:07,944
We're all gonna have
to get used to this...

267
00:15:08,153 --> 00:15:10,448
...and learn to accept your father
for who he is.

268
00:15:10,656 --> 00:15:12,659
Great plan, Lois.
Hey, here's a nutty idea.

269
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:15,705
Ever read the Bible? Leviticus 18:22.

270
00:15:15,872 --> 00:15:19,544
You're judgmentally quoting Bible verses
and you don't even know how to read.

271
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,297
Welcome to America, Brian.

272
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:24,844
Hi, everybody. This is Scott.

273
00:15:25,052 --> 00:15:26,805
Oh, who's Scott?

274
00:15:27,014 --> 00:15:28,141
My soul mate, Lois.

275
00:15:28,349 --> 00:15:31,228
I'm here. I'm queer.
Don't get used to it, I'm leaving you.

276
00:15:31,437 --> 00:15:33,273
- What?
- I'm sorry, Lois.

277
00:15:33,481 --> 00:15:35,401
I can't deny who I am any longer.

278
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,113
I am Peter Griffin, homosexual.

279
00:15:38,322 --> 00:15:40,116
And that's how I'm gonna live my life.

280
00:15:40,325 --> 00:15:42,286
Yeah,
I think that's perfectly disgusting.

281
00:15:42,494 --> 00:15:45,165
Every time you do it,
you're basically sodomizing Jesus.

282
00:15:45,373 --> 00:15:46,667
I just wanna point that out.

283
00:15:46,876 --> 00:15:50,047
Chris, you're the man of the house.
Take the lessons I've taught...

284
00:15:50,256 --> 00:15:52,802
...and be the best leader
of this household you can.

285
00:15:53,011 --> 00:15:54,221
I will, Dad.

286
00:16:02,107 --> 00:16:04,778
Oh, God. I miss Peter so much.

287
00:16:04,986 --> 00:16:07,448
Gay or not,
I just wish he was still here.

288
00:16:07,657 --> 00:16:09,868
I miss Dad too, Mom,
but we'll manage somehow.

289
00:16:10,077 --> 00:16:11,454
We're still a family, right?

290
00:16:11,663 --> 00:16:14,166
Yeah, I mean,
we're tighter than an Asian family.

291
00:16:15,001 --> 00:16:17,588
- You doctor yet?
- No, Dad. I'm 12.

292
00:16:17,797 --> 00:16:19,675
Talk to me when you doctor.

293
00:16:23,514 --> 00:16:25,809
I am so gay for you, Scott.

294
00:16:26,017 --> 00:16:28,855
I'm so gay for you, Peter.

295
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,859
- Penis for your thoughts.
- I just...

296
00:16:32,068 --> 00:16:34,071
You complete me, you know that?

297
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:36,282
You just make me
wanna be a gayer man.

298
00:16:36,491 --> 00:16:39,036
Oh, come here.

299
00:16:39,955 --> 00:16:42,792
- And you don't miss your wife at all?
- Oh, sure I do.

300
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,421
But this is a whole new chapter
in my life, Scott.

301
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,549
And that chapter is all about you.

302
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:51,138
<i>Oh, Peter. Let's snuggle on the couch
and watch Lifetime.</i>

303
00:16:51,346 --> 00:16:55,185
<i>We now return to
Meredith Baxter in Raped by a Clown.</i>

304
00:16:55,394 --> 00:16:56,479
<i>It was awful.</i>

305
00:16:56,688 --> 00:16:59,233
<i>He made me do things, awful things.
Awful things.</i>

306
00:16:59,442 --> 00:17:00,527
<i>What kinds of things?</i>

307
00:17:00,736 --> 00:17:01,987
<i>I don't even wanna talk about it.</i>

308
00:17:05,951 --> 00:17:08,705
You sure you don't need
any house repairs, Mrs. Griffin?

309
00:17:08,913 --> 00:17:10,875
No, thanks, Rick.
Ever since Peter left...

310
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:15,631
...our house hasn't been destroyed
by shenanigans on a weekly basis.

311
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,807
God, I feel so bad for Lois.
She really misses Peter.

312
00:17:22,016 --> 00:17:23,811
I wish there was something
we could do.

313
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,108
Well, there is, Brian. I looked into it.
Straight Camp.

314
00:17:27,317 --> 00:17:28,318
Straight Camp?

315
00:17:28,526 --> 00:17:30,446
Yeah, it's where gays go to get cured.

316
00:17:30,654 --> 00:17:31,865
This is dated last year.

317
00:17:32,073 --> 00:17:34,160
Yeah, I just...
I just had it lying around.

318
00:17:34,368 --> 00:17:37,122
I don't know.
It goes against everything I believe in.

319
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,292
At this point,
I'm willing to try anything.

320
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,013
Oh, for the love of penis.

321
00:17:55,483 --> 00:17:57,402
What the...? Where am I?

322
00:17:57,611 --> 00:18:00,908
This is Straight Camp, Peter.
I'm sorry, but I'm doing this for Lois.

323
00:18:01,116 --> 00:18:03,787
By the time you get out,
you'll be back to your old self.

324
00:18:03,995 --> 00:18:05,540
Welcome to Straight Camp.

325
00:18:05,748 --> 00:18:09,127
You've made a choice
to renounce your evil, sinful ways...

326
00:18:09,336 --> 00:18:12,633
...and redeem yourselves in the eyes
of your lord and savior, Jesus...

327
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:15,595
...who hates many people,
but none more than homosexuals.

328
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:19,142
And through our carefully structured
program, you will succeed.

329
00:18:20,852 --> 00:18:23,023
All right, men.
This is Harry the homosexual.

330
00:18:23,232 --> 00:18:27,948
- Say hi to everyone, Harry.
- Hi, fellas. I sure do love being gay.

331
00:18:28,156 --> 00:18:31,786
Harry's choice of lifestyle is wrong.
So we're gonna beat him up for it.

332
00:18:31,995 --> 00:18:35,083
Now, take these baseball bats
and get to it.

333
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,878
All right, good so far.

334
00:18:38,087 --> 00:18:40,215
No, no, no.
Don't use the bats like that.

335
00:18:40,424 --> 00:18:42,218
No, don't use them like that either.

336
00:18:42,427 --> 00:18:45,097
All right, look.
Just put them down and use your fists.

337
00:18:45,306 --> 00:18:47,017
No, no. Not like that!

338
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:51,857
This next exercise will train you
to talk like a straight man.

339
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:55,780
Peter, we'll start with you. Repeat
every word I say exactly as I say it.

340
00:18:55,989 --> 00:19:00,203
Me and my friends Polly and Matty
are going out to drink a ton of beers.

341
00:19:00,412 --> 00:19:02,040
My friends and I are going out...

342
00:19:02,206 --> 00:19:04,668
...but we're not drinking.
Those are empty calories.

343
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:08,507
Then we'll play full-contact football
in the park with no pads or helmets.

344
00:19:08,716 --> 00:19:11,553
Then we're gathering at Alan
and Omar's for bad-movie night.

345
00:19:11,762 --> 00:19:14,891
Then it's straight to the bars
to find women to have sex with.

346
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:17,269
Then it's straight to the gym
for crunches...

347
00:19:17,479 --> 00:19:19,397
...and eye contact with strangers.

348
00:19:19,647 --> 00:19:21,192
- Peter!
- Don't give me that look.

349
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:23,780
That's what you said.
I said it right back to you.

350
00:19:27,952 --> 00:19:29,205
Oh, excuse me.

351
00:19:29,413 --> 00:19:32,292
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I didn't know where else to go.

352
00:19:32,501 --> 00:19:35,672
I haven't seen Peter in two days
and I thought he might be here.

353
00:19:35,881 --> 00:19:38,009
What? Oh, my God. Peter's missing?

354
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,219
Hey, hang on, hang on.

355
00:19:39,427 --> 00:19:42,516
Before anyone gets too worked up,
I know where Peter is.

356
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:44,519
- Where?
- I put him in a straight camp.

357
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:46,772
- You what?
- Oh, you bastard.

358
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,109
Brian, what...? Why did you do that?

359
00:19:49,317 --> 00:19:51,027
It's just you seemed so unhappy...

360
00:19:51,237 --> 00:19:53,991
...and I just wanted to help you
get your husband back.

361
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,287
Who knows? By now, Peter
could be completely heterosexual again.

362
00:20:07,302 --> 00:20:08,971
Stop!

363
00:20:09,597 --> 00:20:11,391
Lois, what are you doing here?

364
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:15,355
I'm here to get you out of this place,
Peter. I'm taking you back to Scott.

365
00:20:15,564 --> 00:20:18,861
Really? You're not still upset
about my leaving?

366
00:20:19,069 --> 00:20:21,614
There's nothing I'd want more
than to have you back...

367
00:20:21,823 --> 00:20:24,035
...but your place is in Scott now.

368
00:20:24,244 --> 00:20:27,666
I mean, a person's sexual identity
is no more a choice...

369
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,418
...than the color of his skin.

370
00:20:29,627 --> 00:20:33,173
This is who you are,
I can't change you.

371
00:20:33,382 --> 00:20:35,260
And it would be wrong for me to try.

372
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:39,433
Oh, Lois, you've made me happier
than a pig among guinea pigs.

373
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:44,648
All right, I think we're all in agreement.
I'm in charge here.

374
00:20:48,821 --> 00:20:49,823
Hi, Peter.

375
00:20:50,032 --> 00:20:51,867
Hi, Scott.

376
00:20:53,537 --> 00:20:56,458
Guess what.
I have a welcome-home surprise for you.

377
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:58,044
Dish, dish, dish.

378
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,671
Remember how you told me...

379
00:20:59,838 --> 00:21:02,216
...your ultimate fantasy
was to have an 11-way?

380
00:21:02,425 --> 00:21:05,095
Oh, my God, yes, I do,
and you so did not even.

381
00:21:05,304 --> 00:21:06,681
Oh, but I did.

382
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,684
Yoo-hoo! Guys.

383
00:21:14,108 --> 00:21:16,445
Oh, here are my notes
about the gay gene.

384
00:21:17,822 --> 00:21:20,368
It wears off
after two and a half weeks.

385
00:21:20,576 --> 00:21:23,331
Oh, great.
Now I can't find Mrs. Griffin's number.

386
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,334
Okay, everybody ready?

387
00:21:25,542 --> 00:21:27,796
Oh, God,
I feel like a kid in a candy store...

388
00:21:28,004 --> 00:21:30,132
...who's having sex
with a bunch of gay guys.

389
00:21:40,231 --> 00:21:41,524
Wait a minute.

390
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,735
What's going on here?

391
00:21:44,028 --> 00:21:47,282
Holy crap! Ah!

392
00:21:49,411 --> 00:21:50,955
These are mine.

393
00:21:51,163 --> 00:21:52,248
Ah!

394
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,802
So we're just, like,
never gonna talk about this again?

395
00:21:59,969 --> 00:22:01,095
That's right, sweetie.

396
00:22:01,303 --> 00:22:03,890
Well, I'm just happy
to have your father home again.

397
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,479
Yeah, and thank God
everything's back to normal.

398
00:22:08,313 --> 00:22:10,692
Take back your fucking horse!
