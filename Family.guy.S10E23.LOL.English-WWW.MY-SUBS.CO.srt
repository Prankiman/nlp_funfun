TV ANNOUNCER: And now,
Quahog Channel Five presents:

13
00:00:37,427 --> 00:00:39,628
"Movie and a Bath
with a Guy Named Lou."

14
00:00:39,696 --> 00:00:41,680
Hey. It's Saturday night,
and you know what that means.

15
00:00:41,748 --> 00:00:43,498
We're gonna take a bath

16
00:00:43,566 --> 00:00:46,685
and watch the 1984
interesting movie, <i>Gremlins.</i>

17
00:00:46,753 --> 00:00:48,604
Now, the Gremlins are funny.

18
00:00:48,671 --> 00:00:50,272
I don't know
if those things are puppets

19
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,923
or they put costumes
on dogs or something,

20
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:54,610
but let's press "play"
and find out, huh?

21
00:00:54,677 --> 00:00:57,245
You can't get them things
wet, by the way,

22
00:00:57,313 --> 00:00:59,948
but don't worry,
this don't affect that.

23
00:01:02,151 --> 00:01:03,652
We interrupt this
program for some

24
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,087
breaking news,
which is why

25
00:01:05,154 --> 00:01:06,722
I'm still
chewing a bagel.

26
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:08,357
Mmm.

27
00:01:08,424 --> 00:01:09,891
Just-just roll
the footage.

28
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,560
JOYCE: <i>A major drug bust</i>
<i>in Quahog today</i>

29
00:01:11,628 --> 00:01:14,980
<i>as police seized</i>
<i>over 100 kilos of cocaine.</i>

30
00:01:15,064 --> 00:01:16,281
TUCKER (smacks lips):
<i>Okay, I'm done.</i>

31
00:01:16,366 --> 00:01:17,816
<i>That's right, Joyce.</i>
<i>Apparently,</i>

32
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,235
<i>there were 100 kilos</i> <i>of cocaine</i>
<i>right here in Quahog,</i>

33
00:01:20,286 --> 00:01:22,571
<i>and yet my guy can't get dick.</i>

34
00:01:22,622 --> 00:01:24,206
JOYCE: <i>Singled out</i>
<i>for special recognition</i>

35
00:01:24,273 --> 00:01:25,907
<i>in orchestrating</i>
<i>today's drug bust</i>

36
00:01:25,975 --> 00:01:27,959
<i>was Officer Joe Swanson.</i>

37
00:01:28,027 --> 00:01:30,746
It feels good to know that,
thanks to me and my colleagues,

38
00:01:30,813 --> 00:01:32,814
a lot fewer people
will be injecting cocaine

39
00:01:32,882 --> 00:01:34,750
into their penises tonight.

40
00:01:34,817 --> 00:01:35,817
Is that a thing?

41
00:01:35,885 --> 00:01:36,952
It's a great thing.

44
00:01:40,556 --> 00:01:41,506
There he is!

45
00:01:41,591 --> 00:01:42,991
Hey, thanks, everybody.

46
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:45,460
Hey, guys.
Hey, Joe, I saw you on TV.

47
00:01:45,528 --> 00:01:47,262
Now I have to go
through the five stages

48
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,597
of having a celebrity friend.

49
00:01:48,665 --> 00:01:50,632
Oh, you're on TV!
That's so cool!

50
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,167
We're going right
to the top together.

51
00:01:52,235 --> 00:01:53,969
Oh, you think
you're better than us, huh?

52
00:01:54,037 --> 00:01:55,237
Just one (bleep)
stroke of luck,

53
00:01:55,304 --> 00:01:56,571
and you're there
and I'm here.

54
00:01:56,639 --> 00:01:58,740
I'm sorry I overreacted.
Look, you got to be careful.

55
00:01:58,808 --> 00:02:00,809
You need someone looking out
for you, who knows you.

56
00:02:00,877 --> 00:02:02,811
Someone you can trust.
Give me some money!

57
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:05,180
Man, that was some pretty
impressive police work, Joe.

58
00:02:05,248 --> 00:02:06,848
Thanks, Quagmire.
I'll be honest,

59
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:09,351
it was nice to be acknowledged
by the chief for once.

60
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:10,986
Usually, he's just
reminding me

61
00:02:11,054 --> 00:02:12,954
that whatever punk
I'm roughing up ain't worth it.

62
00:02:13,005 --> 00:02:16,258
You son of a bitch!
I ought to kill you right here!

63
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:18,794
Hey! This punk's
not worth it.

64
00:02:18,861 --> 00:02:20,128
You're right.

65
00:02:22,665 --> 00:02:24,166
You're not worth it.

66
00:02:26,936 --> 00:02:29,988
So, listen, if you guys
aren't doing anything later,

67
00:02:30,056 --> 00:02:32,858
the chief's throwing me a little
party to celebrate my bust.

68
00:02:32,925 --> 00:02:35,227
I am going to let Quagmire
answer first.

69
00:02:35,294 --> 00:02:36,661
Yeah, I'll go.
I shall go, too.

70
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:39,481
Oh, great. I'll see
you guys tonight.

71
00:02:40,983 --> 00:02:42,984
(tires screech)

72
00:02:43,035 --> 00:02:44,336
Oh, God, buddy, I'm sorry.

73
00:02:44,404 --> 00:02:45,437
You okay?

74
00:03:05,374 --> 00:03:07,275
You bastard!

75
00:03:32,168 --> 00:03:34,719
Well, now I've seen
Woodrow Wilson naked.

76
00:03:34,787 --> 00:03:36,738
(grunts)

77
00:03:48,918 --> 00:03:49,768
(yells)

78
00:03:54,891 --> 00:03:57,142
(screaming)

79
00:04:16,262 --> 00:04:18,947
(tires screech)

80
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:38,900
(whirring)

81
00:04:49,011 --> 00:04:50,161
(electrical buzzing)

82
00:04:56,168 --> 00:04:57,469
(steam hissing)

83
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:03,992
(whooshing)

84
00:05:14,687 --> 00:05:16,571
(whooshing)

85
00:05:46,218 --> 00:05:48,386
(electrical buzzing)

86
00:06:01,383 --> 00:06:03,268
(grunts)

87
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,084
(screaming cluck)

88
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,477
(whirring)

89
00:06:40,306 --> 00:06:41,523
(screaming cluck)

90
00:06:46,595 --> 00:06:47,862
(screams)

91
00:07:08,084 --> 00:07:09,334
(whirring)

92
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:11,720
(screaming cluck)

93
00:07:26,635 --> 00:07:29,303
(whooshing)

94
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,271
(dramatic music plays)

95
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,862
Hey, Bonnie, I made a
major drug bust today.

96
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,564
The biggest one the
force has ever seen.

97
00:08:12,631 --> 00:08:14,165
That's great, Joe.

98
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:15,867
You don't seem
very excited.

99
00:08:15,935 --> 00:08:17,702
I mean, this is a
huge deal for me.

100
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,004
The chief is even throwing
me a party tonight.

101
00:08:20,072 --> 00:08:21,706
I don't know
if I can take another

102
00:08:21,774 --> 00:08:23,441
evening of
sympathetic eye contact

103
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:25,443
from all
the other wives.

104
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:29,748
Well, just so you know,
this is a really big deal.

105
00:08:29,815 --> 00:08:33,184
They even asked me to be a guest
on <i> Muy Importante!</i>

106
00:08:33,252 --> 00:08:36,938
(Latin music plays)

107
00:08:37,006 --> 00:08:39,441
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Muy Importante!</i>

108
00:08:43,028 --> 00:08:45,663
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Muy Importante!</i>

109
00:08:49,368 --> 00:08:52,303
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Muy Importante!</i>

110
00:08:52,371 --> 00:08:55,874
<i>Muy Importante!</i>

111
00:08:55,941 --> 00:08:58,543
ALL:
<i>Muy Importante!</i>

112
00:08:58,611 --> 00:09:01,946
A donkey just bit
a child in the hallway.

113
00:09:06,685 --> 00:09:08,887
Wow, I've never been
to a cop bar before.

114
00:09:08,954 --> 00:09:10,155
Yeah, look at
the bartender.

115
00:09:10,222 --> 00:09:11,990
I bet working here,
she's one of those women

116
00:09:12,057 --> 00:09:14,125
who's tough as nails
and good at giving sass.

117
00:09:15,995 --> 00:09:17,529
What will it be, fellas?

118
00:09:17,596 --> 00:09:19,898
I'd like to cram both your boobs
into a martini glass.

119
00:09:19,965 --> 00:09:23,034
(sobbing)

120
00:09:23,102 --> 00:09:25,036
I-I think she's just
a normal woman.

121
00:09:25,104 --> 00:09:26,871
To Joe Swanson!

122
00:09:26,939 --> 00:09:28,139
And the biggest
drug bust

123
00:09:28,207 --> 00:09:29,474
in the history
of Quahog!

124
00:09:29,542 --> 00:09:31,226
(all cheering)

125
00:09:33,095 --> 00:09:35,914
Officer Swanson, I just wanted
to say congratulations.

126
00:09:35,981 --> 00:09:37,549
I'm Nora. I just joined the
force.

127
00:09:37,616 --> 00:09:38,900
Nice to meet you.

128
00:09:38,968 --> 00:09:40,902
Wow, I've heard
so much about you.

129
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,804
You're like a legend
at the academy.

130
00:09:42,872 --> 00:09:44,506
Is it true you
got straight A's

131
00:09:44,573 --> 00:09:46,440
in Officer Henderson's
Overintensity Workshop?

132
00:09:46,492 --> 00:09:48,092
You're damn right I did!

133
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,094
Well, you did some
great work today.

134
00:09:50,162 --> 00:09:51,796
And I mean
regular-person great,

135
00:09:51,864 --> 00:09:53,131
not just
wheelchair-person great.

136
00:09:53,199 --> 00:09:54,966
Yeah, I guess.

137
00:09:55,034 --> 00:09:57,468
You seem a little distracted.
Is everything okay?

138
00:09:57,536 --> 00:10:00,038
Yeah, sorry,
I was just thinking about...

139
00:10:00,105 --> 00:10:02,607
someone should have come
tonight, but they didn't.

140
00:10:02,675 --> 00:10:04,275
Ah, it's nothing.

141
00:10:04,343 --> 00:10:05,677
That's good.

142
00:10:05,744 --> 00:10:07,946
Hey, Officer Swanson?
Yeah?

143
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:10,415
You know how they say
never meet your heroes?

144
00:10:10,482 --> 00:10:12,400
Well, they don't say anything
about kissing them.

145
00:10:13,686 --> 00:10:15,320
Whoa!

146
00:10:15,387 --> 00:10:17,155
Geez, every cop
in town is here.

147
00:10:17,223 --> 00:10:19,691
I know. Who do you think is
taking care of the city?

148
00:10:19,758 --> 00:10:21,309
No.

149
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,710
No.

150
00:10:22,778 --> 00:10:24,212
No.

151
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,646
No.

152
00:10:25,698 --> 00:10:27,465
(horn honking)

153
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:28,900
MAN: What the hell?
Come on!

154
00:10:28,968 --> 00:10:30,735
No drive. Is wet.

155
00:10:37,483 --> 00:10:39,200
Hey-hey, fun party
last night, Joe.

156
00:10:39,268 --> 00:10:41,069
You guys, I got something
to tell you.

157
00:10:41,137 --> 00:10:43,805
The weirdest thing happened
to me at that party.

158
00:10:43,873 --> 00:10:45,907
I got kissed
by this chick cop.

159
00:10:45,975 --> 00:10:48,309
No way! What's she look like?
Is she hot?

160
00:10:48,377 --> 00:10:49,744
Well, I don't know. Uh...

161
00:10:49,812 --> 00:10:51,946
Is Elizabeth Perkins hot?

162
00:10:52,014 --> 00:10:55,550
I... I, uh...
I-I don't... I don't know.

163
00:10:55,618 --> 00:10:57,452
Way to go, Joe.
Did you bang her?

164
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,587
What? Of course
not, Quagmire.

165
00:10:59,655 --> 00:11:00,922
I mean, I'm a
married man.

166
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,524
I could never
cheat on Bonnie.

167
00:11:02,591 --> 00:11:03,558
Well, under normal
circumstances,

168
00:11:03,626 --> 00:11:04,792
you'd be right
to say that,

169
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,927
but in this case,

170
00:11:05,995 --> 00:11:07,462
cheating would be
the only fair thing.

171
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:08,930
What? What are you
talking about?

172
00:11:08,998 --> 00:11:11,332
Come on. Didn't Bonnie
have that affair in Paris?

173
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,835
Oh, yeah. I don't want
to talk about that.

174
00:11:13,903 --> 00:11:15,703
Joe, how can I put this
delicately?

175
00:11:15,771 --> 00:11:19,174
He used his stinky French wiener
to defile her.

176
00:11:19,241 --> 00:11:22,210
Wow. That's a...
real hit above the belt.

177
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:25,313
But I'm still not sure that's
a reason to betray Bonnie.

178
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:27,749
Come on, Joe. Sleeping with
this girl wi even things up.

179
00:11:27,816 --> 00:11:30,201
You can't have that kind of
imbalance in your relationship.

180
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:33,071
In fact, you owe it to Bonnie
to have sex with this woman.

181
00:11:33,138 --> 00:11:34,472
It's for the good
of your marriage.

182
00:11:34,573 --> 00:11:35,957
Yeah, you should
go for it, Joe.

183
00:11:36,025 --> 00:11:37,926
Secrets are what
keep a marriage fresh.

184
00:11:37,993 --> 00:11:39,661
I have a CB radio
in the basement.

185
00:11:39,728 --> 00:11:42,297
I go down there a couple times
a week to have CB sex.

186
00:11:42,364 --> 00:11:43,731
Lois has no idea.

187
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:45,700
Breaker breaker one-nine.
What's your 20?

188
00:11:45,768 --> 00:11:47,669
(woman speaks
in garbled, staticky voice)

189
00:11:49,872 --> 00:11:53,041
Ah, it's so hot
just knowing you're in a truck.

190
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:58,162
Good morning,
Officer Swanson.

191
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,864
Oh, hey... Nora.

192
00:11:59,932 --> 00:12:01,599
Uh, listen, I...
It's okay, Joe.

193
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:02,901
You don't need
to explain.

194
00:12:02,968 --> 00:12:04,903
I stepped over the line
at the bar last night.

195
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,321
I'm... I'm sorry.

196
00:12:06,388 --> 00:12:07,989
It's not that I don't
find you attractive.

197
00:12:08,057 --> 00:12:09,924
I do. I just...

198
00:12:09,992 --> 00:12:11,459
I'm married and...
I get it.

199
00:12:11,527 --> 00:12:13,311
I totally
understand, Joe.

200
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:15,413
(phone ringing)
Excuse me.

201
00:12:15,481 --> 00:12:16,514
Hello?

202
00:12:16,582 --> 00:12:17,415
BONNIE:
Joe?

203
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:18,449
Bonnie?

204
00:12:18,517 --> 00:12:19,417
Oh.

205
00:12:19,485 --> 00:12:20,852
I-I meant to call someone else.

206
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,920
Oh.

207
00:12:21,987 --> 00:12:22,921
Yeah.

208
00:12:22,988 --> 00:12:24,422
So, how is everything?

209
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,723
(click)

210
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,859
(sighs)

211
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:31,696
QUAGMIRE: <i>Didn't Bonnie</i>
<i>have that affair in Paris?</i>

212
00:12:31,764 --> 00:12:34,532
PETER: <i>He used his stinky</i>
<i>French wiener to defile her.</i>

213
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,768
QUAGMIRE: <i>Didn't Bonnie</i>
<i>have that affair in Paris?</i>

214
00:12:36,835 --> 00:12:39,804
PETER: <i>He used his stinky</i>
<i>French wiener to defile her.</i>

215
00:12:39,872 --> 00:12:41,472
<i>Hey, Quagmire,</i>
<i>we're in Joe's head.</i>

216
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,991
<i>Hey, let's mess with him.</i>

217
00:12:43,058 --> 00:12:44,692
<i>I'm going to leave a fart</i>
<i>trapped in here.</i>

218
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,910
(passing gas)

219
00:12:45,978 --> 00:12:47,278
(Peter and Quagmire laughing)

220
00:12:47,346 --> 00:12:48,880
PETER: <i>All right,</i>
<i>let's get out of here.</i>

221
00:12:48,948 --> 00:12:50,949
(rapid footsteps,
car door opens and closes)

222
00:12:51,016 --> 00:12:51,950
I want you.

223
00:12:52,034 --> 00:12:53,067
I want you, too.

224
00:12:53,118 --> 00:12:54,218
Come on.

225
00:12:54,286 --> 00:12:56,421
I have a little
place we can go to.

226
00:12:56,488 --> 00:12:58,222
NORA: Wow. I've
never seen a sofa

227
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,590
in a bathroom
stall before.

228
00:12:59,658 --> 00:13:01,626
JOE: Well, I'm the only
one who comes in here,

229
00:13:01,694 --> 00:13:03,261
so I figured I'd
make it my own.

230
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:04,629
How are you enjoying
your steak?

231
00:13:04,697 --> 00:13:06,230
Mmm. It's delicious.

232
00:13:06,298 --> 00:13:08,199
Let me put another
log on the fire.

233
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:09,434
(flame whooshing and crackling)

234
00:13:09,501 --> 00:13:10,635
Thanks, Joe.

235
00:13:10,703 --> 00:13:12,470
It was getting
a little chilly in here.

236
00:13:12,538 --> 00:13:14,138
That's 'cause you're
all the way over there.

237
00:13:14,206 --> 00:13:16,240
Well, let me
fix that.

238
00:13:16,308 --> 00:13:17,542
(kissing)

239
00:13:17,609 --> 00:13:19,010
Oh, Joe.

240
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:20,244
Oh, Nora.

241
00:13:20,312 --> 00:13:21,446
Did you bring
protection?

242
00:13:21,513 --> 00:13:22,680
Oh, don't worry.

243
00:13:22,748 --> 00:13:24,082
Nothing comes out
of the front.

244
00:13:28,253 --> 00:13:30,021
What a great day
for Joe and Bonnie.

245
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:31,589
This is Kevin's
first birthday

246
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:33,324
since he came home
from Iraq.

247
00:13:33,392 --> 00:13:35,126
Why does Kevin always sit
at the bus stop,

248
00:13:35,194 --> 00:13:36,661
but never gets on a bus?

249
00:13:36,729 --> 00:13:37,996
Please don't
bring that up.

250
00:13:38,063 --> 00:13:39,864
Don't bring
anything he does up.

251
00:13:39,932 --> 00:13:41,632
Hey, you guys.

252
00:13:41,717 --> 00:13:42,967
You're right on time.

253
00:13:43,035 --> 00:13:45,786
Kevin just woke up screaming
from his afternoon nap.

254
00:13:45,838 --> 00:13:47,171
Mom, it's <i>my</i>
birthday,

255
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:48,506
and you invited
<i>your</i> friends.

256
00:13:48,574 --> 00:13:50,375
All yours are dead!

257
00:13:50,442 --> 00:13:51,776
Hey, guys.

258
00:13:51,844 --> 00:13:53,644
Uh, can I talk to
you for a second?

259
00:13:53,712 --> 00:13:55,013
I did something
terrible.

260
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,015
Ah, hey, we've all
done terrible things.

261
00:13:58,317 --> 00:13:59,517
Attention, everyone.

262
00:13:59,585 --> 00:14:01,302
The plane is sinking,
so I need you all

263
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,204
to proceed onto the
floating slide.

264
00:14:04,973 --> 00:14:06,424
PETER:
<i>Dear airplane people,</i>

265
00:14:06,492 --> 00:14:08,893
<i>I owe you one floating slide.</i>

266
00:14:08,961 --> 00:14:11,162
<i>And just so you know,</i>
<i>the guy stewardess</i>

267
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,064
<i>was angry gay, not happy gay.</i>

268
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:14,532
What does it say?
Nothing.

269
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,567
Just instructions
and stuff.

270
00:14:16,635 --> 00:14:18,152
Oh, my God. You actually
went through with it?

271
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,120
How was it?

272
00:14:19,188 --> 00:14:20,355
I don't know, you guys.

273
00:14:20,422 --> 00:14:21,723
I thought I would feel better

274
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,424
after I slept with Nora,
but I don't.

275
00:14:23,492 --> 00:14:25,159
I just feel really guilty.

276
00:14:25,227 --> 00:14:27,195
And I'm not mad
at Bonnie anymore;

277
00:14:27,262 --> 00:14:29,030
I'm just mad at myself.

278
00:14:29,098 --> 00:14:31,132
Guys, am I the only one
who thinks it's weird

279
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,333
talking about Joe
cheating on Bonnie

280
00:14:32,401 --> 00:14:33,818
in front of their baby?

281
00:14:33,886 --> 00:14:35,453
MAN'S VOICE:
<i>I think we can all benefit</i>

282
00:14:35,521 --> 00:14:37,155
<i>from a little strange</i>
<i>now and then.</i>

283
00:14:37,222 --> 00:14:38,389
<i>I know I will.</i>

284
00:14:39,608 --> 00:14:41,142
Uh-oh.

285
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,910
The baby monitor.
Wha...?

286
00:14:42,978 --> 00:14:44,345
The baby monitor.

287
00:14:44,413 --> 00:14:45,847
You cheated on me?

288
00:14:45,914 --> 00:14:47,281
I-I, uh...

289
00:14:47,349 --> 00:14:49,350
You bastard!

290
00:14:49,418 --> 00:14:50,985
Bonnie, please.

291
00:14:51,053 --> 00:14:52,653
After all
I do for you,

292
00:14:52,704 --> 00:14:54,839
this is how
you repay me?

293
00:14:54,907 --> 00:14:57,075
Well, how do you think
I felt when I found out

294
00:14:57,142 --> 00:14:58,493
you slept with that
French guy, huh?

295
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,328
I never slept
with Francois.

296
00:15:00,396 --> 00:15:02,497
What? But Peter said...

297
00:15:02,564 --> 00:15:04,348
Lois, didn't you say
that Bonnie slept with him?

298
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,783
No, Peter. I said
she wanted to.

299
00:15:05,851 --> 00:15:07,318
Damn it, Peter!

300
00:15:07,386 --> 00:15:08,603
Now, hold on.

301
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,505
In my defense,
it is my experience

302
00:15:10,572 --> 00:15:13,074
that I am generally correct
about most things.

303
00:15:13,142 --> 00:15:14,709
You know what,
it doesn't matter.

304
00:15:14,777 --> 00:15:17,345
Bonnie's been driving me away
for some time now.

305
00:15:17,413 --> 00:15:19,347
What? Driving you away?

306
00:15:19,415 --> 00:15:23,151
Do you have any idea
how hard it is living with you?

307
00:15:23,218 --> 00:15:25,286
They still have
one of those TVs

308
00:15:25,354 --> 00:15:27,321
with the big, fat back.

309
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:28,689
Maybe we should
all leave.

310
00:15:28,757 --> 00:15:29,590
No!
No!

311
00:15:29,658 --> 00:15:30,775
Everyone stays.

312
00:15:30,843 --> 00:15:32,343
I want this to
be a disaster.

313
00:15:32,411 --> 00:15:34,345
'Cause this has been
a long time coming.

314
00:15:34,413 --> 00:15:36,564
You care about nothing
except yourself.

315
00:15:36,615 --> 00:15:37,949
You son of a bitch.

316
00:15:38,016 --> 00:15:41,202
I got a license to operate
a sex crane for you.

317
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,421
And I got earplugs so I
could put up with that

318
00:15:43,489 --> 00:15:45,189
(imitating Bonnie):
horrible voice of yours.

319
00:15:45,257 --> 00:15:47,725
I'm not an impressionist,
but you get the idea.

320
00:15:47,793 --> 00:15:52,096
I perform purification rituals
on my body after we have sex.

321
00:15:52,164 --> 00:15:54,832
I find it cleanses
the immeasurable sadness

322
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,767
of having lain with a wretch.

323
00:15:56,835 --> 00:15:58,002
I want a divorce!

324
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,470
You got it!

325
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:01,506
Sorry. I opened
some of the gifts.

326
00:16:08,815 --> 00:16:11,082
Does the Swanson divorce
mean that I

327
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,784
have to go live
with Grandma and Grandpa?

328
00:16:12,852 --> 00:16:14,553
No, Chris, it does not.

329
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,121
That doesn't even
make any sense.

330
00:16:16,189 --> 00:16:17,522
Peter, I can't believe

331
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,508
you would encourage Joe
to have an affair.

332
00:16:19,575 --> 00:16:20,959
Look, Lois, it's
in the Bible.

333
00:16:21,027 --> 00:16:22,394
What's in the Bible?

334
00:16:22,462 --> 00:16:23,762
I-I don't know.

335
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,564
Doesn't that always
cover it somehow?

336
00:16:25,631 --> 00:16:27,299
Peter, you blew up
their marriage.

337
00:16:27,366 --> 00:16:29,201
This was
a huge mistake.

338
00:16:29,268 --> 00:16:30,735
Well, we've all made mistakes.

339
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:35,240
Eh.

340
00:16:36,926 --> 00:16:38,777
(Stewie screaming)

341
00:16:38,845 --> 00:16:41,096
Why did the sign say
"not an exit"?

342
00:16:41,164 --> 00:16:43,265
It should have just said
"gorilla door."

343
00:16:43,332 --> 00:16:44,649
(screaming)

344
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,971
So, it's really
over, huh?

345
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:51,606
After all
these years?

346
00:16:51,674 --> 00:16:52,874
I'm afraid so.

347
00:16:52,942 --> 00:16:54,309
But let's be
honest, Peter.

348
00:16:54,377 --> 00:16:56,478
Bonnie and I seem
to have grown apart.

349
00:16:56,546 --> 00:16:57,812
Boy, I never would have seen

350
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,664
this day coming
when we first met.

351
00:16:59,732 --> 00:17:02,734

Lois, I know
how to get

367
00:18:15,308 --> 00:18:16,775
Joe and Bonnie
back together.

368
00:18:16,842 --> 00:18:18,677
Joe just told me
how he and Bonnie met.

369
00:18:18,744 --> 00:18:21,096
So I figure, all we got to do
is find a way

370
00:18:21,163 --> 00:18:22,731
to recreate the magic
of that night.

371
00:18:22,815 --> 00:18:24,015
Well, we better
do something soon,

372
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,283
'cause I just
talked to Bonnie

373
00:18:25,351 --> 00:18:26,801
and she's already
on D-Date.

374
00:18:26,869 --> 00:18:28,370
What the hell's D-Date?

375
00:18:28,437 --> 00:18:29,871
Diarrhea Date.
It's filthy.

376
00:18:29,956 --> 00:18:31,389
But she found someone,

377
00:18:31,457 --> 00:18:33,291
and they're doing whatever
they do tomorrow.

378
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:35,627
What the hell's
wrong with people?

379
00:18:37,363 --> 00:18:39,097
Thanks for inviting
me to lunch, Lois,

380
00:18:39,165 --> 00:18:41,132
but why are we eating
at a strip club?

381
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,435
I know the waitress here
from water aerobics.

382
00:18:43,502 --> 00:18:45,370
She said she'd
give us 20% off.

383
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:48,706
All units, all units.

384
00:18:48,758 --> 00:18:50,508
We have a disturbance
at the Fuzzy Clam.

385
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,676
This is Officer Swanson.

386
00:18:51,727 --> 00:18:53,061
What's the problem?

387
00:18:53,145 --> 00:18:55,313
Well, one of the dancers
was dancing with a guy

388
00:18:55,381 --> 00:18:57,432
and saying, "You're my favorite,
you're my favorite,"

389
00:18:57,516 --> 00:18:59,184
but now she's dancing
with another guy.

390
00:18:59,235 --> 00:19:00,568
That's not a crime.

391
00:19:00,653 --> 00:19:02,070
Well, shouldn't it be?

392
00:19:02,154 --> 00:19:03,554
I'll be right there.

393
00:19:03,606 --> 00:19:05,707

394
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,928
("Africa" by Toto playing)

395
00:19:09,996 --> 00:19:13,114
Boy, I haven't heard this
song in a long time.

396
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:15,083
Police! What's going on?

397
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:16,935
Bonnie?

398
00:19:17,003 --> 00:19:18,236
Joe?

399
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:19,421
What are you
doing here?

400
00:19:19,505 --> 00:19:20,588
I'm here with Lois.

401
00:19:20,673 --> 00:19:22,007
What are you doing here?

402
00:19:22,074 --> 00:19:23,875
I got a call.

403
00:19:23,926 --> 00:19:26,594
Is that... is that
"Africa" by Toto?

404
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:28,079
Yeah.

405
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,597
That's our song.

406
00:19:29,665 --> 00:19:31,216

things are fine here.

409
00:19:38,107 --> 00:19:40,108
Listen, Bonnie,
I, uh...

410
00:19:40,192 --> 00:19:42,193
I just want to
say I'm sorry.

411
00:19:42,261 --> 00:19:44,929
I was a real ass,
and I miss you.

412
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,731
I'm sorry, too.

413
00:19:46,782 --> 00:19:49,901
I know I haven't been
that easy to live with lately.

414
00:19:49,952 --> 00:19:52,570
Okay.

415
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:55,623
Well, I'm going
to go now.

416

Joe, wait.

417
00:19:58,711 --> 00:20:01,496
You want a lap dance, mister?

418
00:20:03,632 --> 00:20:05,783
No. Sit down.
