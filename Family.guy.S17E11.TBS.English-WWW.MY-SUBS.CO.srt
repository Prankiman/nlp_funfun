00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:04,956
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

2
00:00:04,957 --> 00:00:08,293
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

3
00:00:08,294 --> 00:00:11,930
<i>But where are those
good old-fashioned values</i>

4
00:00:11,931 --> 00:00:14,838
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

5
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:18,264
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

6
00:00:18,265 --> 00:00:21,740
<i>Lucky there's a man
who positively can do</i>

7
00:00:21,741 --> 00:00:23,308
<i>All the things that make us</i>

8
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:24,932
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

9
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:30,048
<i>He's... a... Fam... ily... Guy!</i>

10
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,055
<i>Previously on</i> Family Guy...

11
00:00:33,056 --> 00:00:35,687
<i>Dad's working
for the Trump White House?</i>

12
00:00:35,688 --> 00:00:38,314
Huh... hey, Stewie,
can we do that again?

13
00:00:38,315 --> 00:00:39,929
Maybe a little more energy?

14
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:44,417
Uh, no?

15
00:00:46,265 --> 00:00:47,799
I-I think we can use it.

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,719
Oh, yay, that's awesome.

17
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,503
Wow, the White House is great.

18
00:00:55,504 --> 00:00:58,009
There's no wonder
you spend two days a week here.

19
00:00:58,927 --> 00:01:00,745
I'm sorry, can you hang on a sec?

20
00:01:00,746 --> 00:01:02,414
Got to close this window.

21
00:01:02,415 --> 00:01:05,984
Melania's out there
blowing bubbles for Eric.

22
00:01:08,287 --> 00:01:10,488
Dad, I got one in my mouth.

23
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:12,524
It tastes like soap!

24
00:01:12,525 --> 00:01:14,759
Tremendous. Amazing.

25
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,430
Okay, Peter, your main job here
is to go in rooms before me

26
00:01:18,431 --> 00:01:21,766
to make sure
there's no static electricity.

27
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:25,203
Don't go in there. It's not safe.

28
00:01:25,204 --> 00:01:26,771
Well done, Peter.

29
00:01:32,903 --> 00:01:35,247
Everyone, welcome to our new place.

30
00:01:35,248 --> 00:01:38,016
I think we're gonna enjoy
the Beltway lifestyle.

31
00:01:38,017 --> 00:01:41,152
Washington, D.C. is
a wonderful city to call home.

32
00:01:41,153 --> 00:01:44,256
And will we be putting our kids
in the local public schools?

33
00:01:44,257 --> 00:01:45,857
No, I would not recommend it.

34
00:01:45,858 --> 00:01:48,260
Dibs on the bedroom
in which an intern got murdered.

35
00:01:48,261 --> 00:01:50,829
Aw, I want the intern murder bedroom!

36
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,430
There's no need to fight, kids.

37
00:01:52,431 --> 00:01:55,066
An intern has been murdered
in each of the bedrooms.

38
00:01:56,235 --> 00:01:57,469
Well, I think this sucks.

39
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,137
I want to go back to Quahog.

40
00:01:59,138 --> 00:02:01,139
But we just got here, sweetie.

41
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,741
Tomorrow, at James Woods High,

42
00:02:02,742 --> 00:02:04,576
it's Scoliosis Spine Check Day.

43
00:02:04,577 --> 00:02:06,911
It's the one day a year I get touched!

44
00:02:06,912 --> 00:02:09,481
Meg, your father got
this great new opportunity,

45
00:02:09,482 --> 00:02:11,249
and we need to support him.

46
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,251
Let's give D.C. a chance, huh?

47
00:02:13,252 --> 00:02:14,653
Yeah, Meg, trust me...

48
00:02:14,654 --> 00:02:16,488
Before long, we'll fit right in here,

49
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:19,257
like a cowboy in a Chinese Starbucks.

50
00:02:21,494 --> 00:02:24,496
This is the most strangest place ever.

51
00:02:24,497 --> 00:02:26,164
Yee! Ha!

52
00:02:26,165 --> 00:02:28,833
Oh, this ain't so different.

53
00:02:36,008 --> 00:02:37,842
Oh, this is so exciting!

54
00:02:37,843 --> 00:02:40,779
I've never been to a fancy
White House party before.

55
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,615
We're happy you're here,
Mrs. Griffin, Mr. Griffin.

56
00:02:43,616 --> 00:02:45,784
And we're glad you brought
your two children

57
00:02:45,785 --> 00:02:48,224
and former Governor Chris Christie.

58
00:02:48,225 --> 00:02:51,289
That's, like, the fourth person
who's called Meg Chris Christie.

59
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,126
Aw, sweetie, I'm sorry everyone thinks

60
00:02:55,127 --> 00:02:58,763
you're a historically unpopular
fatso from New Jersey.

61
00:02:58,764 --> 00:03:00,765
Whatever. I just want to go home.

62
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:02,524
Oh, you can't go home yet!

63
00:03:02,525 --> 00:03:04,002
We haven't even served dinner.

64
00:03:04,003 --> 00:03:05,937
And I hope you saved your appetite,

65
00:03:05,938 --> 00:03:08,106
because, later, we're all wiping our ass

66
00:03:08,107 --> 00:03:10,041
with the Constitution.

67
00:03:10,042 --> 00:03:11,331
Hi, Brian Griffin.

68
00:03:11,332 --> 00:03:13,597
They let me write some
of the liberal jokes.

69
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:14,698
How you liking 'em?

70
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:15,997
Good, there's more coming.

71
00:03:18,284 --> 00:03:20,185
Folks, to drink this evening,
we've got red wine,

72
00:03:20,186 --> 00:03:22,120
white wine, and a fifth of bourbon.

73
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:24,622
What'll you have, disgraced
political oddity Roger Stone?

74
00:03:24,623 --> 00:03:26,224
I'll take the fifth.

75
00:03:26,225 --> 00:03:28,059
That works on two levels.

76
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,627
Layered.

77
00:03:29,628 --> 00:03:31,963
Man, the Trump White House
is so awesome.

78
00:03:31,964 --> 00:03:34,032
And for sure it's not crawling
with Russians.

79
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:35,266
That's for actual,

80
00:03:35,267 --> 00:03:37,135
other American at this party.

81
00:03:37,136 --> 00:03:38,803
So, what kinds of things

82
00:03:38,804 --> 00:03:41,639
do you hearing
from our Mr. USA President?

83
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,241
I don't know, fellow American,

84
00:03:43,242 --> 00:03:45,243
but here's my Gmail log-in and password,

85
00:03:45,244 --> 00:03:46,678
'cause I know I can trust you with it.

86
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:47,679
Wonderful.

87
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,314
Now, to please excuse,

88
00:03:49,315 --> 00:03:53,122
I have very aching gut
from eating so much apple cake.

89
00:03:53,123 --> 00:03:56,221
Ha! Doesn't get more American than that.

90
00:04:06,265 --> 00:04:07,699
Sorry! I'm just looking for the exit.

91
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,200
I didn't mean to...

92
00:04:09,201 --> 00:04:11,538
Holy girl boner.

93
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:13,204
<i>Ivanka Trump</i>

94
00:04:13,205 --> 00:04:15,940
<i>Has a gentle breeze indoors.</i>

95
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:19,110
Tell those kids, if they ever
want to see their parents again,

96
00:04:19,111 --> 00:04:20,445
they'll make the shoes!

97
00:04:20,446 --> 00:04:22,470
Do you know who you're dealing with?

98
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,549
My husband is the son of a felon

99
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,551
who went to prison for
blackmailing his brother-in-law

100
00:04:26,552 --> 00:04:28,153
by entrapping him with a prostitute

101
00:04:28,154 --> 00:04:31,756
and then mailing a copy
of the tape to his own sister!

102
00:04:31,757 --> 00:04:33,425
<i>All that stuff</i>

103
00:04:33,426 --> 00:04:35,260
<i>Happened for real.</i>

104
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:36,861
Is everything okay?

105
00:04:36,862 --> 00:04:38,863
Huh? Oh. Yeah.

106
00:04:38,864 --> 00:04:40,932
Sorry to be out of sorts. I just...

107
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:42,934
Sometimes I wish
I could meet someone else

108
00:04:42,935 --> 00:04:45,770
whose dad is a fat idiot who
once had a hit television show

109
00:04:45,771 --> 00:04:47,605
and who, over time,
has worn out his welcome.

110
00:04:47,606 --> 00:04:49,874
- You know, Meg's dad is als...
- Shut up, Tiffany.

111
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,076
Yeah. Shut up, Tiffany.

112
00:04:52,077 --> 00:04:54,078
Meg, I think you'd look amazing

113
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,814
in my brand of lifestyle products

114
00:04:55,815 --> 00:04:57,916
that are designed to represent
a poor person's idea

115
00:04:57,917 --> 00:04:59,417
of what a rich person would wear.

116
00:04:59,418 --> 00:05:01,319
- You think so?
- Trust me.

117
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,822
When I'm done with you,
you'll be pretty enough to marry

118
00:05:03,823 --> 00:05:05,590
an Orthodox Jewish son of a felon

119
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:07,926
who's too stupid to get
into Harvard the normal way.

120
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:10,495
And whose voice is way higher
than you thought it would be?

121
00:05:10,496 --> 00:05:12,447
Hi, honey. Ready for dinner?

122
00:05:17,896 --> 00:05:19,267
Stewie, where have you been?

123
00:05:19,268 --> 00:05:22,841
Ugh, many
American baby things am I doing.

124
00:05:22,842 --> 00:05:27,612
So, what is your favorite
ballistic missile launch codes?

125
00:05:27,613 --> 00:05:29,547
Whoa, is that Meg?

126
00:05:35,851 --> 00:05:37,021
That girl <i>is</i> pretty.

127
00:05:37,022 --> 00:05:38,857
So pretty by D.C. standards.

128
00:05:38,858 --> 00:05:42,160
With Geico, you can save
up to 15% on car insurance.

129
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:46,509
Wow! Two-thirds of the people
here are talking about <i>me.</i>

130
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,066
Because you're beautiful, Meg.

131
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:49,667
Thanks to you.

132
00:05:49,668 --> 00:05:51,769
Come on, let me introduce you
to the president.

133
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,472
He's kind of like my boyfriend.

134
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,143
Hang on. He's still getting ready.

135
00:06:04,817 --> 00:06:07,585
Hey, Dad, I want you
to meet my new friend, Meg.

136
00:06:07,586 --> 00:06:10,021
- Pleased to meet you.
- I've got to run, Dad.

137
00:06:10,022 --> 00:06:12,905
Thanks again for getting me
plastic surgery in my teens.

138
00:06:13,893 --> 00:06:15,460
Um, yeah, anyway,

139
00:06:15,461 --> 00:06:17,695
it's an honor to meet you,
Mr. President.

140
00:06:17,696 --> 00:06:19,030
This is amazing.

141
00:06:19,031 --> 00:06:20,698
Yesterday, I was at Quahog Pond,

142
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:22,934
pulling out carps
just to watch them suffocate.

143
00:06:22,935 --> 00:06:24,369
And now look at me,

144
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,271
with the winner of the 46th-largest

145
00:06:26,272 --> 00:06:28,640
electoral college victory of all time.

146
00:06:28,641 --> 00:06:30,975
And, I got to say, I'm a huge fan

147
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:32,977
of your board game
and your beef products

148
00:06:32,978 --> 00:06:34,712
and your fraudulent university and...

149
00:06:36,048 --> 00:06:38,383
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, please.

150
00:06:38,384 --> 00:06:41,619
Every president
since Washington has done this.

151
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,254
<i>Dearest Martha,</i>

152
00:06:43,255 --> 00:06:46,524
<i>I cannot wait
to once again place my hand</i>

153
00:06:46,525 --> 00:06:49,360
<i>onto your Gates of Venus.</i>

154
00:06:49,361 --> 00:06:51,029
<i>My darling Bess,</i>

155
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,031
<i>tonight, I'm going to drop the Big One</i>

156
00:06:53,032 --> 00:06:54,933
<i>onto your Pacific theater.</i>

157
00:06:54,934 --> 00:06:57,769
<i>Hey,
Barbara Bush, working late.</i>

158
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,204
<i>Sleeping in office.</i>

159
00:07:00,205 --> 00:07:01,773
<i>Crazy headache.</i>

160
00:07:01,774 --> 00:07:03,702
<i>You look like my mom.</i>

161
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:11,942
Good afternoon, I'm Tim Tucker,

162
00:07:11,943 --> 00:07:13,611
not my twin brother, Tom.

163
00:07:13,612 --> 00:07:17,040
Our top story: mentally
challenged boys' T-shirts.

164
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,568
Are they getting even longer?

165
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:22,686
Um, guys, I got to tell you something.

166
00:07:22,687 --> 00:07:24,288
Last night, at the White House,

167
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:27,124
President Trump
touched me inappropriately.

168
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,693
- What?!
- Meg, that's my boss, all right?

169
00:07:29,694 --> 00:07:31,362
This is my career you're talking about.

170
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:33,030
I spent a whole day working on this.

171
00:07:33,031 --> 00:07:34,865
You want me to just
throw away in one day

172
00:07:34,866 --> 00:07:36,967
what I've spent a whole day
trying to build?

173
00:07:36,968 --> 00:07:39,303
A whole day's worth of work,
poof, gone in a day!

174
00:07:39,304 --> 00:07:40,971
Meg, you expect us to believe

175
00:07:40,972 --> 00:07:42,473
that the president of the United States

176
00:07:42,474 --> 00:07:44,375
would grab a woman by her (BLEEP)?

177
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:45,643
That's ridiculous!

178
00:07:45,644 --> 00:07:47,211
How could you not believe me?

179
00:07:47,212 --> 00:07:48,879
Oh, hang on. CNN's on,

180
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,382
where I'm the loudest guy
on an overcrowded panel.

181
00:07:51,383 --> 00:07:53,651
This country needs
stronger border security.

182
00:07:53,652 --> 00:07:55,653
Our border security
is the strongest in the world.

183
00:07:55,654 --> 00:07:57,888
What we need
is to take care of our children.

184
00:07:57,889 --> 00:07:59,323
I can't get an erection!

185
00:07:59,324 --> 00:08:00,825
You think giving them amnesty

186
00:08:00,826 --> 00:08:02,560
is fair to the people
who are already here?

187
00:08:02,561 --> 00:08:04,395
They're contributing to the economy.

188
00:08:04,396 --> 00:08:05,496
I've tried all the herbs!

189
00:08:05,497 --> 00:08:06,897
Amnesty is never the answer.

190
00:08:06,898 --> 00:08:08,699
It's not amnesty.

191
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,001
It's recognizing their
contributions to our country.

192
00:08:11,002 --> 00:08:13,337
They said to meditate,
but I keep fallin' asleep!

193
00:08:13,338 --> 00:08:14,805
We need stronger vetting.

194
00:08:14,806 --> 00:08:16,707
And to enforce the laws
already on the books.

195
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,642
I'm terrified
of being alone with my wife!

196
00:08:18,643 --> 00:08:19,944
It's too much pressure!

197
00:08:19,945 --> 00:08:21,445
Well, nothing's ever gonna change

198
00:08:21,446 --> 00:08:23,113
if Congress isn't willing to compromise.

199
00:08:23,114 --> 00:08:25,249
- Exactly my point.
- A wall would solve this.

200
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,784
I wake up with an erection,

201
00:08:26,785 --> 00:08:28,385
but never when she's in the bed with me!

202
00:08:28,386 --> 00:08:29,720
A wall would solve nothing.

203
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:31,322
These children have rights.

204
00:08:31,323 --> 00:08:33,724
I spent three grand
on a Sandals vacation,

205
00:08:33,725 --> 00:08:34,725
thinking that might do it!

206
00:08:34,726 --> 00:08:35,759
Know what it was?

207
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,862
Me being limp on a lazy river!

208
00:08:37,863 --> 00:08:39,530
Well, that's all the time we have.

209
00:08:39,531 --> 00:08:41,098
- Thank you to Peter Griffin...
- No!

210
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,133
Don't send me home to my wife!

211
00:08:43,134 --> 00:08:44,702
Democrats.

212
00:08:44,703 --> 00:08:46,470
That's why we went to Sandals?

213
00:08:46,471 --> 00:08:47,972
Dad, did you hear what I said?

214
00:08:47,973 --> 00:08:49,540
Sorry, Meg, I got to go to work.

215
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,709
What? You're still gonna work
for that man

216
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,377
after he assaulted me?

217
00:08:53,378 --> 00:08:55,713
Meg, you got to stop with these stories.

218
00:08:55,714 --> 00:08:57,448
People hate a liar.

219
00:08:57,449 --> 00:08:59,950
Just like closed captioning
stenographers hated

220
00:08:59,951 --> 00:09:02,575
the <i>Sleepy Hollow</i> guy for some reason.

221
00:09:12,831 --> 00:09:14,932
Did he carry a broadax?

222
00:09:16,734 --> 00:09:18,476
The mark on his hand...

223
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:21,572
Was it a bow?

224
00:09:27,841 --> 00:09:30,597
Oh, no. No, no, no, it can't be.

225
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,551
When I cut off his head.

226
00:09:41,323 --> 00:09:43,327
Okay, I'll take your questions.

227
00:09:43,328 --> 00:09:44,828
Me With A Fake Mustache.

228
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:47,164
America wants to know
what you're packin' up there.

229
00:09:47,165 --> 00:09:48,834
I've heard 11 inches. True?

230
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:50,267
All right, that's enough from you.

231
00:09:50,268 --> 00:09:51,602
Me With A Funny Hat.

232
00:09:51,603 --> 00:09:53,304
I also have heard 11 inches.

233
00:09:53,305 --> 00:09:55,306
Okay, any non-11-inch questions?

234
00:09:55,307 --> 00:09:56,570
Me With An Old-Timey Wig.

235
00:09:56,571 --> 00:09:58,768
I've heard four handbreadths.

236
00:10:03,315 --> 00:10:05,633
Mr. President, the press
briefing went very well.

237
00:10:05,634 --> 00:10:06,984
Many people are saying

238
00:10:06,985 --> 00:10:09,219
it was the best press briefing
in all of history.

239
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,822
Mr. Griffin, you're not speaking
to President Trump.

240
00:10:11,823 --> 00:10:13,590
That's a butternut squash.

241
00:10:13,591 --> 00:10:17,821
Oh. Well, if this lumpy orange
garbage vegetable is here,

242
00:10:17,822 --> 00:10:19,997
then where's President Donald Trump?

243
00:10:19,998 --> 00:10:21,665
Mr. President, please,

244
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,167
I'm not interested.

245
00:10:23,168 --> 00:10:24,802
You'll regret this.

246
00:10:32,998 --> 00:10:34,478
Oh, my God.

247
00:10:34,479 --> 00:10:36,480
<i>Bob's Burgers</i> is on!

248
00:10:36,481 --> 00:10:39,116
This show speaks
to us young people, apparently.

249
00:10:39,117 --> 00:10:42,163
That show... and-and I mean
no disrespect when I say this...

250
00:10:42,164 --> 00:10:44,941
But that show looks like
it was animated in a moving car.

251
00:10:44,942 --> 00:10:47,684
And again, no disrespect,
wonderful people over there.

252
00:10:47,685 --> 00:10:50,728
But... oh, my God, President
Trump is assaulting Meg,

253
00:10:50,729 --> 00:10:53,382
I can't believe what
I just saw, Mr. President!

254
00:10:53,383 --> 00:10:54,999
What would your third wife,

255
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,002
the soft-core girl-on-girl
porn lady, think about this?

256
00:10:58,003 --> 00:11:01,338
Or the actual porn star
your lawyer paid hush money to?

257
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:04,421
I'm so sorry we didn't
believe you earlier, sweetie.

258
00:11:04,422 --> 00:11:06,677
Yeah, where do you get off
behaving like this?

259
00:11:06,678 --> 00:11:09,046
- Why shouldn't I? You do.
- What?

260
00:11:09,047 --> 00:11:13,003
When you walked through that
door, you insulted <i>Bob's Burgers</i>

261
00:11:13,004 --> 00:11:15,260
and the hundreds of people
who work there.

262
00:11:15,261 --> 00:11:16,754
Well, I was just kidding around.

263
00:11:16,755 --> 00:11:18,756
No, you weren't. You're just jealous

264
00:11:18,757 --> 00:11:22,027
'cause it wins all the Emmys
and the kids love it.

265
00:11:22,028 --> 00:11:23,927
You seem to know a lot
about <i>Bob's Burgers.</i>

266
00:11:23,928 --> 00:11:25,416
Of course I do.

267
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:29,366
<i>Bob's Burgers
is my favorite animated show.</i>

268
00:11:29,367 --> 00:11:32,272
Wow. There's your headline, Emmy voters.

269
00:11:32,273 --> 00:11:33,722
Vote your conscience.

270
00:11:33,723 --> 00:11:35,606
Anyway, my point is,

271
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:38,809
if Peter Griffin gets to be
a jerk all the time,

272
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:41,245
then why can't Donald Trump?

273
00:11:41,246 --> 00:11:42,880
Huh.

274
00:11:42,881 --> 00:11:46,517
That is not the...
dumbest thing you've ever said.

275
00:11:46,518 --> 00:11:48,557
So are we square?

276
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,687
No.

277
00:11:50,688 --> 00:11:52,689
No, President Trump, we are not!

278
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:53,924
I quit!

279
00:11:53,925 --> 00:11:55,392
- What?
- That's right.

280
00:11:55,393 --> 00:11:57,795
And you know what else?
My days of being mean

281
00:11:57,796 --> 00:11:59,109
and insulting are over!

282
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,497
From here on out,

283
00:12:00,498 --> 00:12:02,733
I'm gonna be the nice,
kind Peter Griffin.

284
00:12:02,734 --> 00:12:04,869
You can't walk out on me.

285
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,904
I'm the president.

286
00:12:06,905 --> 00:12:08,505
Well, you're not a very good one.

287
00:12:08,506 --> 00:12:09,640
Like that guy.

288
00:12:09,641 --> 00:12:11,608
Or-or that one.

289
00:12:11,609 --> 00:12:12,976
Or that one.

290
00:12:12,977 --> 00:12:14,427
Hey, which one is that, anyway?

291
00:12:14,428 --> 00:12:15,930
I'm Grover Cleveland,

292
00:12:15,931 --> 00:12:18,916
the only president to be married
in the White House.

293
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:21,118
Oh, what a nice story.

294
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,353
It's a great story. I married a girl

295
00:12:23,354 --> 00:12:26,643
who I'd raised since
the time she was 11 years old.

296
00:12:26,644 --> 00:12:27,740
Oh.

297
00:12:27,741 --> 00:12:30,067
Well, that guy's not getting a musical.

298
00:12:35,865 --> 00:12:38,495
<i>We now return
to Pirates of the Caribbean,</i>

299
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:40,931
<i>where the sound guy
put the microphone too close</i>

300
00:12:40,932 --> 00:12:43,163
<i>to Johnny Depp's jangling bracelets.</i>

301
00:12:43,164 --> 00:12:45,736
<i>Hold it right there, Sparrow.</i>

302
00:12:45,737 --> 00:12:47,838
This is the day you will always remember

303
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,707
as the day you almost caught
Captain Jack Sparrow.

304
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,376
- What?!
- I said...

305
00:12:52,377 --> 00:12:54,478
I've spent $65 million

306
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:56,780
on vacation homes and daytime wine.

307
00:12:59,751 --> 00:13:01,752
All right, turn off
that cheap celebrity slam.

308
00:13:01,753 --> 00:13:03,954
The Griffins are gonna be
better than that now.

309
00:13:03,955 --> 00:13:05,289
- What?
- You heard me.

310
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,224
We are done being mean and insulting,

311
00:13:07,225 --> 00:13:09,259
like Donald Trump is. From now on,

312
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,862
this family's
gonna be nice and supportive.

313
00:13:11,863 --> 00:13:14,249
Oh. So if we're being nice now,

314
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,500
maybe you have nice things
to say to <i>me,</i> Dad.

315
00:13:16,501 --> 00:13:18,268
Uh... of course I do.

316
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:20,537
Your hair is, um...

317
00:13:20,538 --> 00:13:23,140
very... hat.

318
00:13:23,141 --> 00:13:25,776
You're a... hat owner.

319
00:13:25,777 --> 00:13:27,678
You're also hatted.

320
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,179
Why does he keep coming back to the hat?

321
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,615
Peter, stop. Your nipples are bleeding.

322
00:13:31,616 --> 00:13:34,051
All right, fine, I'm not a nice person.

323
00:13:34,052 --> 00:13:36,186
I'm sick of complimenting your hat!

324
00:13:36,187 --> 00:13:38,689
I knew that fat man
couldn't keep this up.

325
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,491
He always buckles under pressure.

326
00:13:40,492 --> 00:13:43,193
Yeah, you're right.
Like at that Billy Joel concert.

327
00:13:46,498 --> 00:13:47,965
<i>Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da</i>

328
00:13:47,966 --> 00:13:49,366
<i>Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da</i>

329
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:50,901
<i>Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da</i>

330
00:13:50,902 --> 00:13:52,503
<i>Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da</i>

331
00:13:52,504 --> 00:13:54,828
<i>Uptown girl!</i>

332
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,014
Trump!

333
00:14:04,015 --> 00:14:06,527
Who are you? I have dementia.

334
00:14:06,528 --> 00:14:08,051
Peter Griffin.

335
00:14:08,052 --> 00:14:09,553
Look, you were right.

336
00:14:09,554 --> 00:14:11,910
I can be insulting sometimes,
I admit it.

337
00:14:11,911 --> 00:14:14,591
But so what? I'm just a guy
from Rhode Island.

338
00:14:14,592 --> 00:14:16,994
You' the President of the United States!

339
00:14:16,995 --> 00:14:19,229
You're not just a guy from Rhode Island.

340
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,832
You're Peter Griffin from <i>Family Guy.</i>

341
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,735
Many children have learned
their favorite Jewish, black

342
00:14:24,736 --> 00:14:28,372
and gay jokes by watching
<i>your</i> show over the years.

343
00:14:28,373 --> 00:14:31,575
In fairness, we've been trying
to phase out the gay stuff.

344
00:14:31,576 --> 00:14:33,577
But you know what? We're a cartoon.

345
00:14:33,578 --> 00:14:35,579
You can turn us off.
You're the president.

346
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,181
We can't turn you off.

347
00:14:37,182 --> 00:14:39,249
And you're on, like, all the time!

348
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,051
Yes, tremendous ratings.

349
00:14:41,052 --> 00:14:44,054
Our Leslie Nielsen ratings
are the highest in history.

350
00:14:44,055 --> 00:14:45,889
Surely you can't be serious.

351
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:49,026
I am serious. And don't call me Leslie.

352
00:14:49,027 --> 00:14:52,396
Argh... You really do find a way
to screw everything up.

353
00:14:52,397 --> 00:14:55,766
If I screwed up so bad,
how come I'm a billionaire?

354
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:57,267
Billionaire? Please.

355
00:14:57,268 --> 00:14:59,637
You're worth $700 mil on the high side.

356
00:14:59,638 --> 00:15:02,272
And most of that is borrowed
or tied up and underwater.

357
00:15:02,273 --> 00:15:04,575
That's why you ain't
releasin' your taxes, Trump.

358
00:15:04,576 --> 00:15:06,376
You're cash poor!

359
00:15:06,377 --> 00:15:08,378
Say that again.

360
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:10,047
I dare you.

361
00:15:10,048 --> 00:15:11,548
You...

362
00:15:11,549 --> 00:15:13,217
are cash...

363
00:15:13,218 --> 00:15:14,785
poor.

364
00:15:30,435 --> 00:15:32,603
Peter! Catch!

365
00:15:32,604 --> 00:15:35,772
Kill him in front of me, and I sex you.

366
00:15:35,773 --> 00:15:36,873
Yah!

367
00:15:46,284 --> 00:15:47,684
Yah!

368
00:16:13,945 --> 00:16:14,978
Aah!

369
00:16:18,283 --> 00:16:19,583
Yah!

370
00:16:42,173 --> 00:16:44,174
Sarah, any update?

371
00:16:44,175 --> 00:16:46,677
I haven't had the chance
to ask the president

372
00:16:46,678 --> 00:16:48,779
if he is fighting with Peter Griffin.

373
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,480
Oh!

374
00:17:03,628 --> 00:17:06,029
- Yah!
- Yah!

375
00:17:33,157 --> 00:17:34,858
I wrote that one.

376
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:37,611
Why are we so damn divided, America?

377
00:17:48,406 --> 00:17:50,197
<i>...making Neil Armstrong</i>

378
00:17:50,198 --> 00:17:52,409
<i>the first man to walk on the Moon.</i>

379
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,411
<i>Who knows,
maybe someone listening to this</i>

380
00:17:54,412 --> 00:17:57,180
<i>might be the first chicken
to walk on the Moon.</i>

381
00:18:06,724 --> 00:18:09,059
I got a sillier plane.

382
00:18:40,758 --> 00:18:42,209
Peter!

383
00:18:43,594 --> 00:18:45,095
Grab my hand!

384
00:18:46,831 --> 00:18:48,999
I can't! It's too little!

385
00:19:05,683 --> 00:19:08,318
Wha...? Who... who put this here?

386
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:11,288
I did. Sure hope that's okay.

387
00:19:16,794 --> 00:19:18,628
Justin Trudeau?

388
00:19:18,629 --> 00:19:20,997
The hunky prime minister of Canada?

389
00:19:20,998 --> 00:19:22,566
He's not that hunky.

390
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:24,634
Very weak borders.

391
00:19:24,635 --> 00:19:26,203
I was just kayakin' past,

392
00:19:26,204 --> 00:19:28,638
and it looked like
you guys could use some help.

393
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,474
- Everything okay?
- No, yeah, we're good.

394
00:19:30,475 --> 00:19:32,309
He touched my daughter,
but I punched him,

395
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,377
like, a hundred times,
so we're fine now.

396
00:19:34,378 --> 00:19:36,680
I punched you, like, a million times.

397
00:19:36,681 --> 00:19:38,582
I punched you infinity times.

398
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,985
I punched you infinity plus one times.

399
00:19:41,986 --> 00:19:43,820
- Damn it!
- Right on!

400
00:19:43,821 --> 00:19:46,590
Well, then, I'll just go do
some awesome Canada stuff.

401
00:19:46,591 --> 00:19:49,392
Hey, call me if you
ever need help movin'.

402
00:19:51,062 --> 00:19:53,497
Trudeau, away...!

403
00:19:54,732 --> 00:19:56,099
That guy's the best.

404
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,235
You know who's really the best?

405
00:19:58,236 --> 00:20:00,537
Putin. Putin's the best.

406
00:20:00,538 --> 00:20:03,573
Yes, he is. Putin is the best.

407
00:20:03,574 --> 00:20:05,408
Ha! I write this part.

408
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:07,844
Am I not to be a stinker?

409
00:20:07,845 --> 00:20:11,992
Bye-bye, American
situation comedy with drawings.

410
00:20:17,475 --> 00:20:19,476
I'm glad we're back in Quahog.

411
00:20:19,477 --> 00:20:22,545
And just in time to see
my appearance on <i>Jeopardy!</i>

412
00:20:22,546 --> 00:20:24,381
- Peter?
- What is...

413
00:20:24,382 --> 00:20:26,583
it like to have an erection?

414
00:20:26,584 --> 00:20:30,453
I'm sorry, we were looking for
"the electromagnetic spectrum."

415
00:20:30,454 --> 00:20:32,400
Betty, still your board.

416
00:20:32,401 --> 00:20:34,591
I was not included in the final round.

417
00:20:34,592 --> 00:20:37,594
I'll tell you one thing, I'm
not gonna miss Washington, D.C.

418
00:20:37,595 --> 00:20:41,262
Well, we had a lot of fun this
week and changed zero minds.

419
00:20:41,263 --> 00:20:43,267
If you want to learn more
about our president,

420
00:20:43,268 --> 00:20:45,066
consult the steele dossier,

421
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:47,423
which is all about getting peed on.

422
00:20:47,424 --> 00:20:49,572
He also, with whole heart
and full throat,

423
00:20:49,573 --> 00:20:52,142
endorsed a pedophile
for the United States Senate.

424
00:20:52,143 --> 00:20:54,310
That didn't fit
into tonight's narrative,

425
00:20:54,311 --> 00:20:55,567
but should not be forgotten.

426
00:20:55,568 --> 00:20:57,947
And I am a proud hat owner.

427
00:20:57,948 --> 00:20:59,471
Shut up, Meg.

428
00:20:59,472 --> 00:21:02,761
From our family to yours,
we're very frightened.

429
00:21:03,952 --> 00:21:07,452
