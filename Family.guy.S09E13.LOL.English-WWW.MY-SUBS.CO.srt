00:00:39,162 --> 00:00:41,063
<i>kind of a crap day,</i>

14
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:42,998

15
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:45,935
<i>So, smell that finger, Quahog!</i>

16
00:00:46,002 --> 00:00:48,304
Ooh, a drunk news report
from Tom Tucker.

17
00:00:48,371 --> 00:00:50,639
We haven't had one of those
since they canceled <i>Passions.</i>

18
00:00:50,707 --> 00:00:52,141
This should be good.

19
00:00:52,209 --> 00:00:55,878
<i>Okay, our top story tonight:
A local car dealer has announced</i>

20
00:00:55,946 --> 00:00:59,181
<i>a "Hands on a Hard Body"
promotion in which</i>

21
00:00:59,249 --> 00:01:02,518
<i>a used dirt bike will be reward...
awarded to the one customer</i>

22
00:01:02,586 --> 00:01:05,821
<i>who can successfully outlast
his competitors.</i>

23
00:01:05,889 --> 00:01:09,925
<i>And, and in other news,
they're bringing back Passions!</i>

24
00:01:09,993 --> 00:01:11,210
<i>Yes, they are!</i>

25
00:01:11,277 --> 00:01:13,762
Holy crap! A dirt bike!
That's awesome!

26
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,731
Lois, I'm gonna win that thing!

27
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:17,633
Peter, why would you want
a used dirt bike

28
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:19,335
when you already have a car?

29
00:01:19,402 --> 00:01:21,270
Because this is 1978, Lois,

30
00:01:21,338 --> 00:01:22,771
and dirt bikes have
never been hotter.

31
00:01:22,839 --> 00:01:24,456
Besides, I get one
of those things,

32
00:01:24,508 --> 00:01:26,292
it's gonna be a buffet
of beav.

33
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:28,227
Mmm, I don't know.
Seems stupid to me.

34
00:01:31,498 --> 00:01:33,666
Thanks to all of you for coming
out today.

35
00:01:33,733 --> 00:01:35,100
In just a minute, we'll begin

36
00:01:35,168 --> 00:01:37,336
our "Hands on a Hard Body"
contest.

37
00:01:37,404 --> 00:01:40,523
And the lucky one of you who can
keep his or her hand on

38
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,658
this dirt bike for the longest
amount of time

39
00:01:42,726 --> 00:01:44,493
will get to take it home!

40
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:46,712
(all cheer)
Yeah, all right! Yeah!

41
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,582
Okay, everyone who wants to win
this dirt bike,

42
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:52,051
come on up and put a hand on it!

43
00:01:55,589 --> 00:01:57,640
Mr. Pewterschmidt?
What are you doin' here?

44
00:01:57,707 --> 00:01:59,341
You want a used dirt bike?

45
00:01:59,426 --> 00:02:02,228
Oh, not at all. But Lois told
me how much you wanted it.

46
00:02:02,295 --> 00:02:03,696
So I decided to win it
for myself

47
00:02:03,763 --> 00:02:05,481
just so I could destroy
it in front of you.

48
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:08,784
And the clock starts... now!

49
00:02:08,852 --> 00:02:10,269
How are you gonna destroy
a dirt bike?

50
00:02:10,337 --> 00:02:11,670
You can't even open
your own aspirin.

51
00:02:11,738 --> 00:02:12,571
With that.

52
00:02:14,574 --> 00:02:16,258
Aw, damn it!

53
00:02:16,326 --> 00:02:19,762
Ooh! Our first hand off
the dirt bike!

54
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:21,847
Huh. I guess you're out,
Mr. Pewterschmidt.

55
00:02:21,915 --> 00:02:23,549
Well, I already paid
for that thing.

56
00:02:23,617 --> 00:02:26,619
So I'm just gonna stick around
and smash other stuff you like.

57
00:02:28,588 --> 00:02:31,023
Hey, fat-ass, you like, um...

58
00:02:31,091 --> 00:02:32,374
You like, uh...

59
00:02:32,442 --> 00:02:33,576
This... This bus bench?

60
00:02:33,643 --> 00:02:35,678
Uh... I... It's okay.

61
00:02:35,745 --> 00:02:38,147
All right, that's good enough for me.
I'm smashing it!

62
00:03:59,512 --> 00:04:02,214
Haha! You loved that thing.

63
00:04:21,217 --> 00:04:22,484
Amazing!

64
00:04:22,552 --> 00:04:24,019
Nine hours with no break!

65
00:04:24,087 --> 00:04:26,138
Who's gonna win this thing?

66
00:04:26,206 --> 00:04:28,140
You might as well give up now,
Mr. Mayor.

67
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,826
- This dirt bike is mine.
- Like heck, it is!

68
00:04:30,894 --> 00:04:31,960
(dialing tones)

69
00:04:32,028 --> 00:04:34,797
- Hey, check your phone.
- Why?

70
00:04:34,864 --> 00:04:37,199
I just sent you a picture
of a kitten in sunglasses.

71
00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:38,934
Well, this I gotta see!

72
00:04:39,002 --> 00:04:40,969
Hello, cool kitty.

73
00:04:41,037 --> 00:04:42,004
Oh...!

74
00:04:42,072 --> 00:04:44,206
And we have a winner!

75
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,208
(cheering)

76
00:04:46,276 --> 00:04:47,710
Aw, darn it.

77
00:04:47,777 --> 00:04:52,114
Well, I guess I'll just disappear
into that field of corn.

78
00:04:55,352 --> 00:04:58,854
Help! I'm lost in corn!

79
00:05:02,242 --> 00:05:04,009
Hey, where's Peter?

80
00:05:04,077 --> 00:05:07,363
I don't know. I haven't heard
from him since he left work.

81
00:05:07,447 --> 00:05:09,715
Hope you made extra.
I brought a guest.

82
00:05:09,783 --> 00:05:11,583
What the hell?! Who is this?!

83
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:14,486
- This is my dirt bike girlfriend.
- Amber.

84
00:05:14,554 --> 00:05:15,921
I'm a dirt bike guy now,

85
00:05:15,989 --> 00:05:17,222
so I need a dirt bike
girlfriend.

86
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,424
Yes, she has small breasts,

87
00:05:18,491 --> 00:05:20,025
but she makes up
for it by smoking.

88
00:05:20,093 --> 00:05:21,093
Peter, she has to leave.

89
00:05:21,161 --> 00:05:22,494
We're havin' dinner.

90
00:05:22,562 --> 00:05:25,064
No, Lois! I will not allow you
to look down on Amber

91
00:05:25,131 --> 00:05:27,332
just 'cause she goes to an
alternative high school!

92
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,501
There's different ways
to measure intelligence

93
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:31,036
besides someone's
grade-point average!

94
00:05:31,104 --> 00:05:33,105
Fact is, she rumpled up some
poetry she wrote

95
00:05:33,173 --> 00:05:34,907
and threw it away in a fit,

96
00:05:34,974 --> 00:05:37,242
but I un-rumpled it,
and it was really good!

97
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,445
(sighs)
Fine. Amber, would you like to have

98
00:05:39,512 --> 00:05:40,946
some dinner with our family?

99
00:05:41,014 --> 00:05:42,247
Nah, I can't.

100
00:05:42,315 --> 00:05:44,950
I got a wicked bruise on
the back of my throat.

101
00:05:45,018 --> 00:05:48,387
<i>ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,
please rise for our national anthem,</i>

102
00:05:48,455 --> 00:05:52,591
<i>performed this afternoon by
Peter Griffin and his dirt bike.</i>

103
00:05:54,861 --> 00:05:58,397
(engine revs to the tune
of "The Star-Spangled Banner")

104
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,717
There it is, Meg.

105
00:06:18,785 --> 00:06:20,803
What do you say
we take it for a spin?

106
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,870
Chris, get off there.

107
00:06:21,938 --> 00:06:23,439
You shouldn't
be sitting on that.

108
00:06:23,506 --> 00:06:24,473
Come on.

109
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:27,025
(clucking)

110
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,814
That's fake.

111
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:34,116
Come on, Meg, just get on!

112
00:06:34,184 --> 00:06:35,767
(sighs)

113
00:06:45,628 --> 00:06:47,379
Hey, Meg, check it out.

114
00:06:47,446 --> 00:06:49,498
I'm gonna jump
that fire hydrant.

115
00:06:49,582 --> 00:06:51,917
Chris, don't!
You're gonna wreck Dad's bike!

116
00:06:51,968 --> 00:06:54,470
Too late,
I already narrowed my eyes.

117
00:07:00,059 --> 00:07:01,643
(Meg screams)

118
00:07:03,146 --> 00:07:05,314
Chris, you idiot!
Look at what you did!

119
00:07:05,381 --> 00:07:07,766
You mean look what two black
teenagers did

120
00:07:07,817 --> 00:07:09,485
when they stole Dad's bike.

121
00:07:12,755 --> 00:07:14,389
What were you kids thinking?!

122
00:07:14,457 --> 00:07:15,791
You could have been killed!

123
00:07:15,859 --> 00:07:18,060
It was Chris' idea.
He talked me into it.

124
00:07:18,127 --> 00:07:19,361
Is that right?

125
00:07:19,429 --> 00:07:22,397
So you like taking dirt bikes
that don't belong to you, huh?

126
00:07:22,465 --> 00:07:24,349
Then here, have a whole
carton of cigarettes!

127
00:07:24,417 --> 00:07:25,551
W... What?!

128
00:07:25,618 --> 00:07:27,169
Peter, that's not what
this is about.

129
00:07:27,237 --> 00:07:28,537
See how you like 'em!

130
00:07:28,605 --> 00:07:30,172
Here, I'll even
get you started.

131
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,790
(coughs)

132
00:07:31,858 --> 00:07:33,025
Dad, I don't smoke.

133
00:07:33,092 --> 00:07:34,793
Sure, you don't now.
But keep at it.

134
00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:35,794
You'll get the hang of it.

135
00:07:35,862 --> 00:07:37,479
By the end of that pack,

136
00:07:37,547 --> 00:07:39,898
you'll be smoking like a real pro.
Like a cool kid.

137
00:07:39,966 --> 00:07:41,049
There, that's it.

138
00:07:41,117 --> 00:07:42,017
Gettin' smoother, isn't it?

139
00:07:42,085 --> 00:07:43,352
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah!

140
00:07:43,436 --> 00:07:45,637
Wait till you try it after a meal.
Delicious!

141
00:07:45,705 --> 00:07:47,356
And after sex?
Forget about it.

142
00:07:47,423 --> 00:07:49,825
It's like puttin' your penis
to sleep in a feather bed.

143
00:07:49,893 --> 00:07:51,610
I think I may want
more cigarettes.

144
00:07:51,678 --> 00:07:52,895
Oh, I'll get you more
cigarettes.

145
00:07:52,962 --> 00:07:54,496
But I'm pretty mad
about my dirt bike!

146
00:07:54,564 --> 00:07:55,898
Kids, I'm sorry to say this,

147
00:07:55,965 --> 00:07:58,300
but I think the two of you need
to be punished.

148
00:07:58,368 --> 00:07:59,735
Look, it was an accident, okay?

149
00:07:59,802 --> 00:08:02,037
I mean, you can always buy
another one, right?

150
00:08:02,105 --> 00:08:03,338
Buy another one?!

151
00:08:03,406 --> 00:08:05,173
You know, I don't think
you kids appreciate

152
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:06,575
how hard your father and I work

153
00:08:06,643 --> 00:08:08,110
to provide you with
everything we do.

154
00:08:08,177 --> 00:08:11,079
Sometimes you just seem
to take us for granted.

155
00:08:11,147 --> 00:08:13,115
You know, it's very
difficult bein' a parent.

156
00:08:13,182 --> 00:08:14,550
No, it's not.

157
00:08:14,617 --> 00:08:16,151
You get to do
anything you want.

158
00:08:16,219 --> 00:08:17,886
And you get to make
all the rules.

159
00:08:17,954 --> 00:08:20,322
Damn right I do,
'cause I make the money!

160
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,791
I'm the big...
mamoo around here!

161
00:08:22,859 --> 00:08:24,693
Now, when you start bringin'
in a paycheck

162
00:08:24,761 --> 00:08:27,129
and providin' for this family,
then you can make the rules!

163
00:08:27,196 --> 00:08:29,231
Well, I'd do a better
job of it than you!

164
00:08:29,299 --> 00:08:30,866
Oh, you think so, huh?

165
00:08:30,934 --> 00:08:33,368
Well, maybe you'd like
to try it for a little while.

166
00:08:33,436 --> 00:08:35,737
- You be the adults!
- What do you mean?

167
00:08:35,805 --> 00:08:38,206
I mean, maybe we try
a little experiment.

168
00:08:38,274 --> 00:08:40,642
You kids switch places
with your dad and me.

169
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:44,446
For the next week, you'll be the
parents and we'll be the kids.

170
00:08:44,514 --> 00:08:46,014
- Seriously?
- Yeah, that'd be awesome!

171
00:08:46,082 --> 00:08:47,182
That sounds great!

172
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,418
That's a great idea, Lois.
<i>Crisscross</i>!

173
00:08:49,485 --> 00:08:52,187
- Yes, that is a crisscross.
- Yes!

174
00:08:52,255 --> 00:08:54,623
- So we got a deal?
- Yeah, we got a deal.

175
00:08:54,691 --> 00:08:57,292
- <i>Face/Off</i>!
- No, Peter.

176
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,327
<i>Road House</i>.

177
00:09:04,924 --> 00:09:08,460
- Here's your breakfast, Lois.
- Thank you, Mom.

178
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:12,263
Wh... Wh... What is...
What is this? What's goin' on?

179
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:14,049
Oh, apparently,
Chris and Meg are switching places

180
00:09:14,116 --> 00:09:16,084
with Peter and Lois
for the week.

181
00:09:16,152 --> 00:09:17,252
Myah!

182
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:19,487
Hey, Mom, do you mind
if I go shoppin'

183
00:09:19,555 --> 00:09:20,789
with Jennifer after school?

184
00:09:20,856 --> 00:09:22,590
No, Peter, no, no,
you're still you.

185
00:09:22,658 --> 00:09:25,493
Y... You're just a teenager.
You're not switching genders.

186
00:09:25,561 --> 00:09:27,762
Ah. I shall return.

187
00:09:29,965 --> 00:09:32,283
Well, I'm off to work
at the brewery.

188
00:09:32,351 --> 00:09:34,219
Okay, have a good day, honey.

189
00:09:34,286 --> 00:09:36,421
- You know, Brian, you and I should do...
- No.

190
00:09:36,489 --> 00:09:39,140
Okay, it just, it... It... It...
It looked fun.

191
00:09:39,225 --> 00:09:44,195
All right, time to make all those
popular kids pay for ignoring me!

192
00:09:44,263 --> 00:09:47,132
Peter, no, y... You're just
a normal high school kid.

193
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:49,851
Oh.

194
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:53,104
Hey, Lance, it's off, it's off,
it's off, it's off.

195
00:09:53,172 --> 00:09:54,456
<i>(gunfire, screams over phone)</i>

196
00:09:54,523 --> 00:09:55,990
Throw this phone away, Lois!

197
00:09:58,928 --> 00:10:01,963
Griffin, did you finish
those reports I gave you?

198
00:10:02,031 --> 00:10:03,598
Right here, Angela.

199
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,935
Wow. You know, I gotta say,
when your dad told me

200
00:10:07,002 --> 00:10:08,670
about this whole switching
places thing,

201
00:10:08,738 --> 00:10:10,271
I was kinda skeptical,

202
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:12,507
but you're actually
doing good work.

203
00:10:12,575 --> 00:10:14,576
Well, it's a lot easier
than high school,

204
00:10:14,643 --> 00:10:15,760
I'll tell you that.

205
00:10:15,828 --> 00:10:17,078
Well, how do you mean?

206
00:10:17,146 --> 00:10:18,680
High school's like
<i>Lord of the Flies.</i>

207
00:10:18,748 --> 00:10:20,215
It's a social nightmare.

208
00:10:20,282 --> 00:10:22,984
And I hear Canadian high
schools are even worse.

209
00:10:23,052 --> 00:10:26,988
Well, well, look who
matriculated to grade nine.

210
00:10:27,056 --> 00:10:29,290
Someone wants
to get into university.

211
00:10:29,358 --> 00:10:31,326
Hey, guys, I'm sorry.

212
00:10:31,393 --> 00:10:32,660
Well, you're gonna be "sore-y"

213
00:10:32,728 --> 00:10:34,763
when we put you in
the hospital for free, eh?

214
00:10:36,582 --> 00:10:40,084
(cheering)

215
00:10:40,152 --> 00:10:41,986
I don't know what the kids are
complainin' about.

216
00:10:42,054 --> 00:10:42,954
This ain't so bad.

217
00:10:43,022 --> 00:10:44,456
I know, this is fun.

218
00:10:44,523 --> 00:10:46,424
I haven't been
to a pep rally in years.

219
00:10:46,492 --> 00:10:49,260
- Do you have school spirit?!
- Yeah!

220
00:10:49,328 --> 00:10:52,464
- Do you have school spirit?!
- Yeah!

221
00:10:52,515 --> 00:10:54,432
Who's got
the most school spirit?!

222
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,533
I do!

223
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:58,486
Show me your school spirit!

224
00:10:58,554 --> 00:10:59,771
(inhales)

225
00:11:03,442 --> 00:11:05,910
The players will remember
this while they're playing.

226
00:11:08,848 --> 00:11:10,181
Hey, Mom,
where the hell's dinner?

227
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:11,249
I'm starving.

228
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:13,485
Oh man,
can you imagine the disaster

229
00:11:13,552 --> 00:11:14,886
she's gonna walk out here with?

230
00:11:14,954 --> 00:11:17,455
She has no idea how
hard it is to cook.

231
00:11:17,523 --> 00:11:20,091
Yeah, yeah, I bet...
I bet she comes out with just like...

232
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,726
Just like a poop
on a plate, right?

233
00:11:21,794 --> 00:11:23,795
Poop on a plate would be good,
because at least

234
00:11:23,863 --> 00:11:25,847
there'd be traces
of my food still in there.

235
00:11:25,915 --> 00:11:28,216
Oh ho ho, snap! Snap! Snap!

236
00:11:28,284 --> 00:11:29,417
Hey, guys?

237
00:11:29,485 --> 00:11:31,019
Give her a (bleep) chance,
all right?

238
00:11:31,086 --> 00:11:32,821
Here it is, gang.

239
00:11:32,888 --> 00:11:36,591
Seared ahi tostadas,
grilled asparagus, couscous,

240
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:39,561
and for dessert,
molten chocolate lava cake.

241
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,848
Wait a minute.

242
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,384
Meg, when did you find
the time to do all this?

243
00:11:46,452 --> 00:11:48,119
Oh, I had all day to do this.

244
00:11:48,187 --> 00:11:49,554
Mm.

245
00:11:49,622 --> 00:11:51,489
Oh my God, this is delicious.

246
00:11:51,557 --> 00:11:53,424
Wh... What do you
mean "all day"?

247
00:11:53,492 --> 00:11:54,993
Wh... What about all
the housework?

248
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,495
I did it in like an hour.
I don't understand why

249
00:11:57,563 --> 00:11:59,297
you're such a freakin'
martyr all the time.

250
00:11:59,365 --> 00:12:03,368
It's a house. It's a finite area.
I'm not cleaning a town.

251
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:05,653
Hey, family, I'm home.

252
00:12:05,721 --> 00:12:07,889
Ooh, that smells fantastic.

253
00:12:07,957 --> 00:12:10,558
Hey, buddy, how was your first
day in the real world?

254
00:12:10,626 --> 00:12:12,227
It was actually really great.

255
00:12:12,294 --> 00:12:14,629
And Angela even told me
I might get a raise

256
00:12:14,697 --> 00:12:16,130
for doing such a good job.

257
00:12:16,198 --> 00:12:18,116
Wow, guys, you hear that?

258
00:12:18,183 --> 00:12:20,435
A raise.
Hm, interesting.

259
00:12:20,502 --> 00:12:22,337
Seems like the kids are
doing pretty well

260
00:12:22,404 --> 00:12:23,671
at this grown-up thing, huh?

261
00:12:23,739 --> 00:12:25,840
I would suggest
that you suck that.

262
00:12:25,908 --> 00:12:28,309
Wow, I am already so stuffed.

263
00:12:28,377 --> 00:12:29,844
Guess I shouldn't have had

264
00:12:29,912 --> 00:12:31,479
so many action figure
guns for lunch.

265
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,021
Well, hello, you two.

266
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:41,656
How's your little
experiment going?

267
00:12:41,724 --> 00:12:43,391
(sobbing):
Horrible.

268
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:46,661
Three girls I don't care about
made me cry in the bathroom.

269
00:12:48,664 --> 00:12:50,815
Um, hey, you guys.

270
00:12:50,883 --> 00:12:54,002
I bet you Lois Griffin
doesn't make the track team,

271
00:12:54,086 --> 00:12:56,321
which is an important thing
in high school right now.

272
00:12:56,388 --> 00:12:57,906
Yeah, everyone who's
anyone is running track

273
00:12:57,973 --> 00:12:59,591
at our high school right now.

274
00:12:59,642 --> 00:13:02,393
Yeah, and I bet she also doesn't
live on the south side of town,

275
00:13:02,461 --> 00:13:03,845
which is suddenly important.

276
00:13:03,913 --> 00:13:05,980
(all laughing)

277
00:13:07,683 --> 00:13:08,983
(sobbing)

278
00:13:09,051 --> 00:13:11,970
I hate your north side face.

279
00:13:12,037 --> 00:13:15,523
- Lois, that's terrible.
- My day was even worse.

280
00:13:15,591 --> 00:13:17,425
I got pegged by a
new form of spitball.

281
00:13:20,696 --> 00:13:21,529
(mooing)

282
00:13:26,268 --> 00:13:27,936
(gasping)

283
00:13:28,003 --> 00:13:30,738
BOY: Hey, get up, you faker.
It's just a spitball.

284
00:13:32,608 --> 00:13:35,460
Hi, family, I'm home.

285
00:13:35,527 --> 00:13:37,195
Oh, Chris, there you are.

286
00:13:37,262 --> 00:13:38,896
Good, now that
you're both here,

287
00:13:38,964 --> 00:13:40,732
your father and I have
something to say.

288
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:42,967
Kids, we're callin' off
the experiment early.

289
00:13:43,035 --> 00:13:44,452
What? Why?

290
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,937
Because you were right.

291
00:13:46,005 --> 00:13:48,373
Being a kid is a lot harder
than bein' an adult.

292
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,658
High school sucks.
Everything sucks.

293
00:13:50,726 --> 00:13:52,794
So let's just put things
back the way they were

294
00:13:52,861 --> 00:13:54,479
and just forget all about this,
all right?

295
00:13:54,546 --> 00:13:57,181
You kids go back to school,
Lois goes back to groceries,

296
00:13:57,249 --> 00:13:58,466
I go back to my job.

297
00:13:58,534 --> 00:14:01,002
- That's not gonna work out, Dad.
- Why not?

298
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,737
'Cause you don't have
a job anymore.

299
00:14:02,805 --> 00:14:04,572
What? Chris, what do you mean?

300
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,075
Angela fired you and hired me.

301
00:14:07,142 --> 00:14:09,744
She said I've been doing twice
as good a job as you did.

302
00:14:09,812 --> 00:14:12,797
So from now on,
I'm the breadwinner in this house.

303
00:14:12,865 --> 00:14:15,099
Hey, I forget.
Were you in for this or not?

304
00:14:22,004 --> 00:14:24,072
Chris, you are not
taking Peter's job.

305
00:14:24,158 --> 00:14:26,492
You're a fourteen-year-old boy,
and you belong in school.

306
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,828
Why, so I can get
a job someday?

307
00:14:28,896 --> 00:14:30,229
I already have a job.

308
00:14:30,297 --> 00:14:32,582
Chris, we're not gonna
allow you to do this.

309
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:34,384
I seem to remember
somebody saying

310
00:14:34,451 --> 00:14:36,636
the breadwinner
makes the rules.

311
00:14:36,703 --> 00:14:39,422
Well, I'm the breadwinner.
And you know what?

312
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:42,024
I like being a grown-up,
and I wanna stay this way.

313
00:14:42,092 --> 00:14:43,693
Well, Lois,
practically speaking,

314
00:14:43,761 --> 00:14:45,661
somebody's gotta pay
the bills around here.

315
00:14:45,729 --> 00:14:47,480
Seems like you don't
have a choice

316
00:14:47,548 --> 00:14:49,148
but to let Chris work
at the brewery

317
00:14:49,216 --> 00:14:50,583
until Peter finds a new job.

318
00:14:50,651 --> 00:14:52,318
Well, I suppose that
makes sense.

319
00:14:52,386 --> 00:14:54,887
I guess it could take
Peter a long time

320
00:14:54,955 --> 00:14:56,422
to find a job in this economy.

321
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,157
Well, it may not
be that bad, Lois.

322
00:14:58,225 --> 00:15:00,026
I could see about
getting back my old job

323
00:15:00,094 --> 00:15:01,527
as a police sketch artist.

324
00:15:01,595 --> 00:15:03,896
Now, did you get a look
at the man who assaulted you?

325
00:15:03,964 --> 00:15:05,765
- I did.
- Okay, can I get a description?

326
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,234
Yeah, he was probably
around 5'9", 5'10"?

327
00:15:08,302 --> 00:15:09,535
Which is it, 5'9" or 5'10"?

328
00:15:09,603 --> 00:15:12,438
- I'd say 5'10".
- Okay, we'll go 5'9" and a half.

329
00:15:12,506 --> 00:15:15,575
- And now, how old was he?
- Late 30's, maybe 37.

330
00:15:15,642 --> 00:15:17,343
I... I don't know, anywhere
between 35 and 40.

331
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,879
Okay, well, let's say 37.
How about ethnicity?

332
00:15:19,947 --> 00:15:22,515
- Yeah, he was Asian-American.
- Asian-American.

333
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,066
Are we talking Korean?
Are we talking Thai?

334
00:15:24,134 --> 00:15:25,084
Are we talking Vietnamese?

335
00:15:25,152 --> 00:15:26,352
Maybe Korean.

336
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,871
Could have been Japanese,
but I... I think Korean.

337
00:15:28,939 --> 00:15:30,323
Okay, Korean.

338
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,674
Now how about identifying
characteristics?

339
00:15:31,742 --> 00:15:33,142
Any... Any marks, piercings?

340
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,812
- He may have had a tattoo.
- He may have had a tattoo?

341
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:37,130
Did have a tattoo?
Which one was it?

342
00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:39,198
I... I don't know, it...
It all happened so fast.

343
00:15:39,266 --> 00:15:40,433
You know what?
It's fine.

344
00:15:40,501 --> 00:15:41,617
I have a preliminary
sketch here.

345
00:15:41,702 --> 00:15:43,202
Is this the man
who assaulted you?

346
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,438
Peter, they're never
gonna take you back.

347
00:15:45,506 --> 00:15:47,473
You got fired for
racist drawings.

348
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:48,891
I guess.

349
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,993
Hey, you know what else
I draw really well? Bullwinkle.

350
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:52,295
I'd probably still be working

351
00:15:52,362 --> 00:15:53,629
if more crooks
looked like Bullwinkle.

352
00:15:58,785 --> 00:16:00,253
Early night, Griffin?

353
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,355
Well, actually, it's eight o'clock.

354
00:16:02,422 --> 00:16:04,724
Well, did you finish
all the accounts payable

355
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:05,958
and the accounts receivable?

356
00:16:06,026 --> 00:16:09,228
- But that's not my department.
- It is now.

357
00:16:09,296 --> 00:16:10,730
The company's making cutbacks.

358
00:16:10,797 --> 00:16:13,799
You can handle it,
it's just a little extra paperwork.

359
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:38,424
Ugh. I am exhausted.

360
00:16:50,704 --> 00:16:53,589
Can this day get
any more stressful?

361
00:16:59,763 --> 00:17:03,699
"Wanted: Muscular man for
discreet pushing and pulling."

362
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:05,451
Well, I'm not above
manual labor.

363
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:08,120
Oh, hi, Chris.
How was your day?

364
00:17:08,188 --> 00:17:10,172
You know what would be great?

365
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,658
If I could come home
and have five minutes

366
00:17:12,726 --> 00:17:14,694
before you jump
all over my back.

367
00:17:14,761 --> 00:17:16,462
Also, she broke a plate.

368
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,965
And what about you?
Did you get a job today?

369
00:17:19,032 --> 00:17:21,500
(chuckles)
I kind of got one.

370
00:17:21,568 --> 00:17:23,436
Right, Lois? Right?

371
00:17:23,503 --> 00:17:25,071
So, Chris,
good day at the office?

372
00:17:25,138 --> 00:17:27,456
You know, actually,
Angela said that the spreadsheets

373
00:17:27,524 --> 00:17:29,859
I presented were beyond the
projections for last quarter.

374
00:17:29,927 --> 00:17:31,260
Oh, is that good?

375
00:17:31,328 --> 00:17:32,979
You know what?! Never mind!

376
00:17:34,765 --> 00:17:36,482
Now I'm mad at you!

377
00:17:40,487 --> 00:17:42,721
Peter, I'm really
worried about Chris.

378
00:17:42,773 --> 00:17:45,141
All this pressure seems
to be getting to him.

379
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:46,676
I know,
he's turning into a jerk.

380
00:17:47,911 --> 00:17:49,679
Oh, hey, Chris.

381
00:17:49,746 --> 00:17:51,347
You wanna keep it down in here?

382
00:17:51,415 --> 00:17:53,516
One of us has to work
in the morning.

383
00:17:53,584 --> 00:17:55,651
Chris, have you...
Have you been drinking?

384
00:17:55,719 --> 00:17:58,454
Yes. Have you been aging?

385
00:17:58,522 --> 00:18:01,190
I want you two to do it
right in front of me.

386
00:18:01,258 --> 00:18:05,294
And I'm gonna throw forty bucks
on your sweaty bodies when you're done.

387
00:18:05,362 --> 00:18:06,679
Let's see the money.

388
00:18:06,746 --> 00:18:09,315
Why do you guys hate me?

389
00:18:09,383 --> 00:18:12,852
Ugh, that pain in my
stomach is back.

390
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:14,519
Ow!

391
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:21,877
What? What?

392
00:18:21,945 --> 00:18:23,412
What are you looking at?

393
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,281
I could fight you both.

394
00:18:25,349 --> 00:18:28,200
You don't know what
I go through every day.

395
00:18:28,268 --> 00:18:29,635
(sobbing)

396
00:18:29,703 --> 00:18:33,823
Now go to sleep,
the both of you.

397
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:36,559
PETER (whimpering):
I think we should go live with Mom.

398
00:18:36,627 --> 00:18:38,194
STEWIE:
I just heard all of that,

399
00:18:38,261 --> 00:18:40,896
and I just wanna say this family
is (bleep) disintegrating.

400
00:18:46,637 --> 00:18:48,104
Oh, hey, Chris, by the way,

401
00:18:48,171 --> 00:18:49,538
the roofer came today
while you were at work.

402
00:18:49,606 --> 00:18:50,622
And?

403
00:18:50,674 --> 00:18:52,124
It's gonna be
five grand to fix it.

404
00:18:52,192 --> 00:18:54,226
Oh that's just perfect.

405
00:18:54,294 --> 00:18:57,296
I love spending $5,000 on
something nobody can see.

406
00:18:57,364 --> 00:18:59,015
Anyone got more happy news?

407
00:18:59,082 --> 00:19:00,983
I'm gonna need
a check for the dentist.

408
00:19:01,051 --> 00:19:02,485
Peter has two cavities.

409
00:19:02,552 --> 00:19:04,920
I'll bet if I go upstairs
to that bathroom

410
00:19:04,988 --> 00:19:06,789
that toothbrush is
as dry as a bone.

411
00:19:06,857 --> 00:19:08,591
Sometimes I forget.

412
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:10,810
Anything else I should
know about?!

413
00:19:10,877 --> 00:19:13,479
Well, my science class
is taking a field trip

414
00:19:13,547 --> 00:19:15,081
to the water
purification center.

415
00:19:15,094 --> 00:19:15,904
And?

416
00:19:15,928 --> 00:19:18,517
And it costs ten dollars
for lunch and the bus.

417
00:19:18,585 --> 00:19:20,119
Ten dollars?

418
00:19:20,187 --> 00:19:22,271
What... What the hell is
it with that school

419
00:19:22,339 --> 00:19:24,640
that every time you walk in there
somebody wants ten dollars?!

420
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,559
Look, I... I'm really sorry,

421
00:19:26,626 --> 00:19:27,977
but if we're that
desperate for money,

422
00:19:28,045 --> 00:19:29,462
isn't there something we can do?

423
00:19:29,513 --> 00:19:31,347
I mean, maybe we could ask

424
00:19:31,415 --> 00:19:32,815
to borrow some
from Mr. Quagmire.

425
00:19:32,883 --> 00:19:34,617
Oh, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

426
00:19:34,685 --> 00:19:36,419
Like to see me walk next door,

427
00:19:36,486 --> 00:19:38,220
hat in hand,
and ask him for money.

428
00:19:38,288 --> 00:19:40,189
Bet you'd have your nose
pressed against the glass

429
00:19:40,257 --> 00:19:42,191
to watch that conversation.

430
00:19:42,259 --> 00:19:44,160
No, you know what? Instead,
let's just go knock on all the doors

431
00:19:44,227 --> 00:19:46,028
of all our neighbors and
tell 'em I'm a failure!

432
00:19:46,096 --> 00:19:48,881
- No, that's not what I...
- No, no, no, it's a good idea.

433
00:19:48,949 --> 00:19:51,517
Let's just go right now and tell
everyone how much of a failure I am.

434
00:19:51,585 --> 00:19:52,451
But I...

435
00:19:54,421 --> 00:19:57,189
(knocking)
QUAGMIRE: Oh, hey, Chris.

436
00:19:57,257 --> 00:19:59,375
CHRIS: Meg has something
she wants to tell you.

437
00:19:59,443 --> 00:20:01,894
- MEG: Chris, please, I'm sorry.
- CHRIS: Say it!

438
00:20:01,962 --> 00:20:03,345
MEG (crying):
Chris is a failure.

439
00:20:03,413 --> 00:20:04,880
QUAGMIRE: Uh, okay.

440
00:20:04,948 --> 00:20:06,749
CHRIS: Now we're going
to the Swansons!

441
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:10,853
(Meg sobbing)
(Chris grunting)

442
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:13,255
(yelling)

443
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,425
Oh, my God! I think Chris is
having a heart attack!

444
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,260
We're not aspose'ta
leave the table.

445
00:20:23,483 --> 00:20:25,551
Be cool, be quiet, be quiet.

446
00:20:27,938 --> 00:20:29,455
All right, well,
nothing to worry about.

447
00:20:29,523 --> 00:20:30,806
Chris is going to be just fine.

448
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:36,429
Oh, Chris,
I'm so glad you're okay.

449
00:20:36,496 --> 00:20:37,930
What... What happened?

450
00:20:37,998 --> 00:20:39,882
You had a heart attack,
sweetie.

451
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,383
A heart attack?

452
00:20:41,451 --> 00:20:43,735
Yeah, you almost worked yourself
right into the ground, buddy.

453
00:20:43,787 --> 00:20:46,255
Oh, it's all our fault.
We never should have let you

454
00:20:46,323 --> 00:20:47,857
take on the pressure
of being an adult.

455
00:20:47,924 --> 00:20:49,525
It's okay, Mom.

456
00:20:49,593 --> 00:20:51,260
Boy, I thought being a grown-up

457
00:20:51,328 --> 00:20:52,728
would be easier
than being a kid.

458
00:20:52,796 --> 00:20:54,697
But it turned out
it was just as hard.

459
00:20:54,765 --> 00:20:57,533
I guess what we all learned is
that no matter who you are,

460
00:20:57,601 --> 00:21:00,402
or where you come from,
life is a terrible thing.

461
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:03,305
Yeah, but if you got your family
to help you get through it,

462
00:21:03,373 --> 00:21:04,573
it's not quite as bad.

463
00:21:04,641 --> 00:21:06,809
And, hey, at least
I get my old job back.

464
00:21:06,877 --> 00:21:09,278
You know, from now on,
let's not complain so much.

465
00:21:09,346 --> 00:21:12,880
