Oh, one minute to opening,
everybody!

11
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:44,367
Why are they selling
all those DVDs so cheap?

12
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,270
Because, Chris,
DVDs are outdated and obsolete.

13
00:00:47,353 --> 00:00:48,756
Like white track stars.

14
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:50,870
On your marks, get set.

15
00:00:50,953 --> 00:00:52,302
White guys, go!

16
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:55,739
I have high hopes for this.
I had a Clif Bar before we started.

17
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,278
Everybody else!

18
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:00,813
I thought they were coming after us.

19
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:04,642
All right, everyone, all DVDs are a dollar,
and everything must go!

20
00:01:04,725 --> 00:01:05,725
Come on in!

21
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,221
Please be here.
Please be here.

22
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,780
Oh, sweet mother of God,
there you are!

23
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,716
I'll watch you with the lights off.

24
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,745
Like I would dare.

25
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,333
You're getting <i>Dan in Real Life</i>?

26
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,323
- What? I heard it's good.
- No, I get it.

27
00:01:24,406 --> 00:01:26,395
He's resting his head on pancakes.

28
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:27,706
It looks hilarious.

29
00:01:28,061 --> 00:01:31,284
The joke, of course,
being that one wouldn't generally do that

30
00:01:31,367 --> 00:01:34,404
were there a pillow available.

31
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:38,552
Oh, my God, <i>Road House!</i>

32
00:01:38,778 --> 00:01:41,581
- I want to buy this!
- Great, and as a bonus, I'll throw in

33
00:01:41,664 --> 00:01:43,569
<i>What Dreams May Come</i>
with Robin Williams.

34
00:01:43,652 --> 00:01:45,185
- No, thank you.
- No charge.

35
00:01:45,268 --> 00:01:47,221
- I do not want it.
- But it's free, sir.

36
00:01:47,304 --> 00:01:50,240
If that DVD even touches
<i>Road House</i>, I will kill you.

37
00:01:51,529 --> 00:01:52,529
Don't worry.

38
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,990
Someday someone will come
and take you home for their very own.

43
00:02:24,404 --> 00:02:25,873
Help! Somebody!

44
00:02:25,956 --> 00:02:29,315
These drunk, redneck truckers are
trying to have their way with me!

45
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,878
Not while my scrotum is pressed up

46
00:02:31,961 --> 00:02:34,361
against my stomach
in these jeans, they won't.

47
00:02:46,972 --> 00:02:48,004
<i>Road House.</i>

48
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,858
That was awesome.

49
00:02:49,941 --> 00:02:51,378
And its message is timeless.

50
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,321
The only message in that movie is

51
00:02:53,404 --> 00:02:55,726
that every problem in life
can be solved by kicking.

52
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,416
Oh, my God.

53
00:02:57,499 --> 00:02:58,882
Brian, you're right.

54
00:02:58,965 --> 00:03:00,049
Peter, I'm joking.

55
00:03:00,132 --> 00:03:01,788
What did you say to me?

56
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:04,531
- Peter, what are you doing?
- Get off my plane.

57
00:03:04,614 --> 00:03:07,063
That's not even the same...
Oh! What the hell?!

58
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:09,566
Not gonna talk to me
like that in my bar.

59
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:11,020
It's not a bar.

60
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,404
Oh, that's right.
Cleveland moved.

61
00:03:24,645 --> 00:03:26,821
- Here's your burger, sir.
- Thank you.

62
00:03:26,904 --> 00:03:28,790
Sir, I need another $1.25.

63
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:30,125
Is that right?

64
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:33,672
Keep the change.

65
00:03:33,938 --> 00:03:35,404
<i>Road House.</i>

66
00:03:39,696 --> 00:03:42,490
Okay, that is the last time
you are gonna pull that crap.

67
00:03:43,017 --> 00:03:44,017
You hear me?!

68
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,474
- Yes.
- Do you hear me?!

69
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:47,571
Yes.

70
00:03:49,524 --> 00:03:52,633
Now, you are gonna hold down that
football until Charlie Brown kicks it.

71
00:03:52,716 --> 00:03:53,890
You got that?

72
00:03:54,546 --> 00:03:56,438
- Yes.
- Go ahead, Charlie.

73
00:03:59,309 --> 00:04:00,331
Yay!

74
00:04:00,351 --> 00:04:02,659
And you know what else?
I did some checking around.

75
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,494
You're not a licensed therapist.

76

77
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,921
You know, it's still early, Peter.

78
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:16,003
What do you say we horse
around a little, huh?

79
00:04:16,086 --> 00:04:18,404
I think I can get
on board with that.

80
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,093
- <i>Road House.</i>
- Peter, for God's sakes,

81
00:04:26,176 --> 00:04:28,424
if you're gonna do that,
at least aim for my breasts.

82
00:04:29,404 --> 00:04:30,604
Oh, yeah.

83
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,576
<i>Road House.</i>

84
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,235
Peter, I don't think you should
be driving with your feet.

85
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,558
<i>Road House.</i>

86
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:44,033
Wait. Why you taking the back way home?
There are so many turns.

- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

99
00:05:06,969 --> 00:05:09,660
Sorry. I wasn't really looking
where I was going.

100
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:12,321
- Probably a little blame on our side too.
- <i>Road House</i>?

101
00:05:12,404 --> 00:05:14,438
Well, I guess we're just lucky
nobody got hurt.

102
00:05:14,806 --> 00:05:16,221
Yeah, yeah, I agree.

103
00:05:16,304 --> 00:05:18,898
But, uh, you know,
I sort of have one other problem.

104
00:05:18,981 --> 00:05:20,861
- Maybe you can help me out.
- What's that?

105
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,658
I have a dinner reservation
for two tonight at Dominick's,

106
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:26,288
- and it's just me.
- I see your problem.

107
00:05:26,371 --> 00:05:27,952
I think I might be able to help.

108
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,287
Ma'am, you want me to kick
those dents out for you?

109
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,400
Peter, we've had complaints
from all over town.

110
00:05:32,483 --> 00:05:34,291
You're gonna have to
stop with the kicking.

111
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:38,146
Oh, yeah? I think my scary,
otherworldly, shadowy, spirit friends

112
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:40,005
might have something
to say about that.

<i>Ghost.</i>

114

Can I help you?

115
00:05:56,132 --> 00:05:58,357
Hi. I'm Brian.
I'm here to pick up Nicole.

116
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,383
Oh, hi. I'm Rita, her mom.

117
00:06:00,466 --> 00:06:03,195
You must be the one
she had that fender bender with.

118
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,874
I got to meet Nicole, so I prefer
to think of it as a happy accident.

119
00:06:06,897 --> 00:06:09,316
- Is she ready?
- Oh... w... well...

120
00:06:09,546 --> 00:06:13,789
Unfortunately, she left for dinner
with another guy about half an hour ago.

121
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,248
What?! We had a date.

122
00:06:15,331 --> 00:06:18,752
Yeah, I'm afraid that's Nicole.
She's 21 and gorgeous.

123
00:06:18,835 --> 00:06:21,697
Guys ask her out all the time,
and I... I think she loses track.

124
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,235
Oh, for God's sake.

125
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,593
Well, let me at least leave my car
insurance information for her.

126
00:06:29,126 --> 00:06:31,380
Is that...
your condom?

127
00:06:31,463 --> 00:06:35,125
No! I... I mean, I mean, I wasn't
gonna use that on your daughter.

128
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:38,230
I wouldn't... I would not... I would not
use a condom on your daughter.

129
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,580
I mean, I... I... I would,

130
00:06:39,663 --> 00:06:42,252
if I was having sex with her,
which obviously, I would not do.

131
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:46,641
But If I mean... I'm safe and all,
I get an AIDS test once every three months.

132
00:06:46,724 --> 00:06:48,240
And... and... and not because I... I...

133
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,558
you know, it's not because
I have a lot of sex.

134
00:06:50,855 --> 00:06:53,286
I just eat a lot
of poo off the street.

135
00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:56,457
Come to think of it, how did this get
in my wallet in the first place?

If it's any consolation,
I would never have stood you up.

one of the rare ones nowadays.

Oh.

Well, at the risk of
humiliating myself once again,

146
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,691
I still have a reservation.

- Well, I don't have plans.
- Well, terrific.

Hey, maybe I'll get
to use this after all, huh?

- I'm... I'm just... I'm kidding.
- Oh, please.

00:07:31,031 --> 00:07:33,523
At my age, I don't have
to worry about pregnancy.

How old are ya?

Wow. She seems great.

00:07:47,678 --> 00:07:49,319
You want to smoke some crack?

157
00:07:51,977 --> 00:07:53,322
I love you.

158
00:07:53,971 --> 00:07:55,390
Get the (bleep) crack!

159
00:07:59,171 --> 00:08:00,479
Brian, you want some lasagna?

160
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,987
Oh, no, thanks.
Rita and I grabbed a bite already.

161
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,193
Gosh, you've been seeing
this Rita for weeks now,

162
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,511
and you still haven't
brought her over to the house.

163
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:10,489
When are we gonna meet
the lovely lady, huh?

164
00:08:11,773 --> 00:08:13,279
Oh, she's being ironic.

165
00:08:13,362 --> 00:08:15,323
What are you saying,
I don't date lovely women?

166
00:08:15,406 --> 00:08:16,618
You got it. You got it.

167
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:19,165
No, it just seems like some
of your past girlfriends

168
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,333
have been a little dumb and trampy.

169
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,901
First of all, that's not true,

170
00:08:22,984 --> 00:08:24,500
and second of all,
she's not like that.

171
00:08:24,512 --> 00:08:26,872
She's wonderful, she's smart,
she's pretty...

172
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,129
And you know, the only reason
I haven't brought her around

173
00:08:29,153 --> 00:08:30,315
is that you guys don't always make

174
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,088
the best impression
with girls I date.

175
00:08:32,171 --> 00:08:33,220
Especially Peter.

176
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,511
Hey, aren't you that chick
from the bathroom door?

177
00:08:35,594 --> 00:08:37,756
Come on, Peter. She doesn't
want to talk about work.

178
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,079
What's it like in there?

179
00:08:39,162 --> 00:08:41,385
I assume it's like how
it is in the men's room.

180
00:08:41,468 --> 00:08:43,772
Oh, there's a long trough
with a big poo in it?

181
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,588
You know, Brian,
the past few weeks have been great.

182
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:56,473
I can't remember the last time I've had
this much fun dating somebody.

183
00:08:56,556 --> 00:08:58,944
I can remember the last
time I have: Never.

184
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:02,169
That's the writer in you, Brian.

185
00:09:02,252 --> 00:09:04,459
Did you always know
that's what you wanted to do?

186
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,881
Well, actually, I really thought
I was going to be an actor at one point.

187
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,756
I even got a few high profile gigs.

188
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,300
Really? Anything I've seen?

189
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,982
Oh, you ever heard of a tiny,
little independent movie

190
00:09:14,065 --> 00:09:15,304
called <i>Die Hard</i>?

191
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,832
- Wow! You were in that?
- Sure was.

192
00:09:17,915 --> 00:09:20,392
What do you say we go back to my
place and I'll show it to you?

193
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,935
Sounds good to me.

194
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,199
We'll have to be a little quiet,
everyone's asleep.

195
00:09:27,282 --> 00:09:28,282
Have a seat.

196
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:31,240
Okay, watch this.
This is my scene.

197
00:09:31,873 --> 00:09:33,155
<i>Doesn't make sense, man.</i>

198
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:38,493
Don't ask me, man. I'm just a desk jockey
who was on my way home when you rang.

199
00:09:39,124 --> 00:09:42,090
The way you drove that car,
I figured you for the street, Al.

200
00:09:42,173 --> 00:09:43,173
<i>In my youth.</i>

201
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,542
Here it comes. Watch, watch.

202
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,249
<i>We've had situations</i>

203
00:09:47,332 --> 00:09:50,528
<i>where the hostages have embraced
their captors after their release,</i>

204
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:52,925
<i>and even corresponded
with them in prison.</i>

205
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,527
No, no, no, darling.
Asian dawn.

206
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,923
Dawn, D - A - W - N.

207
00:09:59,006 --> 00:10:00,636
- Sir?
- I... Yeah?

208
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:01,899
Sir, the FBI is here.

209
00:10:01,982 --> 00:10:04,188
Hold...
The FBI is here now?

210
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,856
Yes, sir.
Right over there.

211
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,688
Hold this.

212
00:10:07,771 --> 00:10:09,032
Want a breath mint?

213
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:11,485
Breath mint.

214
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:12,980
I ad-libbed that line.

215
00:10:13,063 --> 00:10:16,804
Well, I had no idea
I was dating a famous actor.

216
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:24,957
- Should we go upstairs?
- Sounds good to me.

217
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,301
That's right, Shia,
give me all you got.

218
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,330
Okay, the coast is clear.

219
00:11:00,074 --> 00:11:01,417
Oh. Good morning.

220
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,789
Oh, uh, hey, Lois.

221
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,398
Who's, uh, who's your friend?

222
00:11:05,481 --> 00:11:07,623
Uh, Rita, this is Lois.

223
00:11:07,706 --> 00:11:08,706
Lois, Rita.

224
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:10,040
So great to meet you.

225
00:11:10,123 --> 00:11:11,354
Lovely to meet you.

226
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,223
Perfect, everyone hits it off. Listen,
Rita, why don't you wait in the car,

227
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,271
- I'll be out in a minute.
- Okay, sweetie.

228
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,440
Well, you met her.

229
00:11:18,523 --> 00:11:19,638
What do you think?

230
00:11:21,689 --> 00:11:23,473
- What?
- What do I think?

231
00:11:23,556 --> 00:11:25,089
She's a hundred!

232
00:11:25,172 --> 00:11:27,748
Oh, my God!
Peter, did you see her?

233
00:11:27,831 --> 00:11:30,468
I'm looking at her now!
I can see her from the window up here!

234
00:11:30,551 --> 00:11:32,690
Hey, anybody make
a Jessica Tandy joke yet?

235
00:11:32,773 --> 00:11:34,834
- No!
- Awesome! I'll be right down!

236
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:37,378
Brian, who are you dating,
Jessica Tandy?

237
00:11:37,461 --> 00:11:40,505
Son of a bitch. Damn it, Chris,
I called that from upstairs!

238
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,481
What are you guys talking about?
She's a beautiful woman.

239
00:11:43,564 --> 00:11:45,397
Lois, you of all
people should be pleased.

240
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,823
I mean, all the crap I take
for dating young bimbos.

241
00:11:47,906 --> 00:11:50,116
How old is she, Brian?

242
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:53,108
Wha... what difference does it make?
Age has nothing to do with anything.

243
00:11:53,191 --> 00:11:55,214
Okay, you know what?
I'll bring her to dinner,

244
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,943
and you can see for yourself what a
bright, fun, and charming woman she is.

245
00:11:59,026 --> 00:12:01,928
Wonderful. I'll cook something
that's not too binding.

246
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,934
Well, Rita, I'm so glad
you could join us for dinner.

247
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:10,937
Thanks for having me, Lois.
This food is delicious.

248
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,815
Oh, thank you.
I'm so glad you can taste it.

249
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,516
You know what we haven't done
for a while? Go around the table,

250
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:18,381
and everybody says what year they were born.

251
00:12:18,494 --> 00:12:20,057
Uh, so, kids, how was your day?

252
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,018
- Well, the sandbox...
- It was great!

253
00:12:22,101 --> 00:12:23,326
Guess he's going first.

254
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,119
We got a new pencil sharpener
in math class!

255
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,396
Well, that's nice.

256
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:29,442
Say, Rita, who was president
when you were born?

257
00:12:29,525 --> 00:12:31,674
- Great pot roast, Lois.
- Thank you, Brian.

258
00:12:31,757 --> 00:12:34,058
Would you like me to cut
yours up a little smaller?

259
00:12:34,141 --> 00:12:35,005
Oh, I'm fine.

260
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,920
Boy, speaking of that, I don't know
how many people have asked me today

261
00:12:38,003 --> 00:12:40,066
where I was when
Martin Luther King was shot.

262
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:42,170
I'm sure you've been asked.
What do you tell them?

263
00:12:42,253 --> 00:12:43,556
Ugh, who can forget?

264
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:46,335
I remember just crying like a baby.

265
00:12:46,418 --> 00:12:48,321
Crying like a baby,

266
00:12:48,404 --> 00:12:50,352
or crying like someone in college?

267
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,497
Say, Brian,
on her answering machine,

268
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,448
how long after her
message is the beep?

269
00:12:54,531 --> 00:12:55,982
This has just been a delight.

270
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,527
Oh, you can't go yet.
We haven't had dessert.

271
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:02,939
Interesting. You know, the first time
I had dessert was 36 years ago today.

272
00:13:03,022 --> 00:13:05,101
How about you, Rita,
you remember your first dessert?

273
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,537
Oh, lord, no.
It was so many years ago.

274
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,771
Like fourty years ago?

275
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,743
- Peter.
- What were stagecoaches like?

276
00:13:10,826 --> 00:13:12,624
Fifty years ago?
Would that be a good guess?

277
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,251
- Oh, dear.
- Peter!

278
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,130
How old are you?!
How old are you?!

279
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:18,463
Fifty! Okay! I'm fifty!

280
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,884
Happy now?!

281
00:13:22,904 --> 00:13:24,136
You people are awful!

282
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,791
You know,
this is what's wrong with society!

283
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:29,266
Nobody bats an eye
if a woman dates an older man,

284
00:13:29,349 --> 00:13:31,195
but God forbid
it's the other way around!

285
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:33,444
There is nothing wrong
with me dating Rita!

286
00:13:33,527 --> 00:13:36,780
She's beautiful,
she's a charming woman, and I love her!

287
00:13:47,404 --> 00:13:49,089
- Rita...
- Oh, Brian,

288
00:13:49,172 --> 00:13:50,495
please leave me alone.

289
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:54,192
They're right, I'm just an old fool
thinking we could be together.

290
00:13:54,275 --> 00:13:57,490
Will you stop that? They're insane.
They don't know what they're talking about.

291
00:13:57,573 --> 00:13:59,307
You're an amazing woman.

292
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,490
Oh, you're just saying that.

293
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:02,615
No, I'm not.

294
00:14:03,044 --> 00:14:05,772
The only thing that matters
is how I feel about you.

295
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,588
Rita... I love you.

296
00:14:08,671 --> 00:14:10,254
I love you, too, Brian.

297
00:14:10,337 --> 00:14:12,880
I think you're the most
wonderful woman I've ever met.

298
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,434
Will you marry me?

299
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,022
What did you just say?

300
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,077
Come on, you're only fifty,
you heard me.

301
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,045
- Will you marry me?
- Oh, Brian.

302
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:22,287
Yes.

303
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,804
Yes, Brian, I'll marry you!

304
00:14:26,995 --> 00:14:29,348
Hey, Mom. Hey, Brian.
We'll be upstairs.

305
00:14:29,431 --> 00:14:31,143
Yo, Rita, you want in on this?

306
00:14:31,226 --> 00:14:33,641
No, thanks.
We just got engaged!

307
00:14:33,724 --> 00:14:35,338
I'm faithful to Brian now.

308
00:14:35,421 --> 00:14:37,793
Whatever.
This ain't even my whole night.

309
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:43,404
You're engaged?!

310
00:14:43,487 --> 00:14:45,972
Yes. Rita and I are getting married.

311
00:14:46,055 --> 00:14:48,631
My God,
I can't even react big enough.

312
00:14:48,714 --> 00:14:49,871
Here's Mrs. Garrett.

313
00:14:49,954 --> 00:14:51,112
What?!

314
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,456
Look, if my happiness means
so little to you all that you have

315
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:57,918
Charlotte Rae just standing by to crack
a joke, then you really disappoint me.

316
00:14:58,001 --> 00:15:00,340
Look, Brian,
I apologize for the other night.

317
00:15:00,423 --> 00:15:02,624
We... we were all very insensitive.

318
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:06,737
And if this is what you want,
we as a family, support your decision.

319
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,088
I don't.
I'd... I'd rather you marry

320
00:15:09,171 --> 00:15:13,787
a... a... a... a... a... a... a...
a Japanese or something.

321
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,258
I'm with you, too, buddy.

322
00:15:15,341 --> 00:15:18,586
In twenty years, she'll be seventy,
and you'll have been dead for fifteen years.

323
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:20,047
God bless the both of yous.

324
00:15:24,222 --> 00:15:25,738
Hey, it's 4:30.

325
00:15:25,821 --> 00:15:28,381
Isn't there an early bird special
you should be running off to?

326
00:15:28,464 --> 00:15:30,547
She's fifty, Stewie.
She's not an old woman.

327
00:15:31,727 --> 00:15:33,473
Hello?
Hey, Rita.

328
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,610
Uh, no, I'm not hungry yet.

329
00:15:38,275 --> 00:15:41,098
Well, if we get there by 5:30,
I'm sure they'll honor it.

330
00:15:41,181 --> 00:15:43,211
Brian, is she calling
dinner "supper?"

331
00:15:43,294 --> 00:15:45,203
So, what are you doing
this afternoon?

332
00:15:45,286 --> 00:15:48,168
"Oh, I'm just sorting out my
pills for the week, sweetie. "

333
00:15:48,251 --> 00:15:50,406
Well, you do that,
and I'll be over a little later.

334
00:15:50,489 --> 00:15:51,821
Huh? Did I get it?

335
00:15:51,904 --> 00:15:54,138
Was she sorting out
her pills for the week?

336
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:57,265
In that little plastic thing
with the seven boxes? Hmm?

337
00:15:57,348 --> 00:16:00,364
Actually, she just got back from the gym,
and she's jumping in the shower.

338
00:16:00,772 --> 00:16:03,235
- She got a chair in that shower?
- Shut up!

339
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:07,571
Have archaeologists ever discovered
Ancient Egyptian pottery in her vagina?

340
00:16:07,654 --> 00:16:10,241
You know what? That one was too wordy.
That one was too wordy.

341
00:16:10,324 --> 00:16:12,382
That... that was...
that was flawed from the ground up.

342
00:16:12,465 --> 00:16:14,507
It wasn't funny,
and we'll work on it

343
00:16:15,043 --> 00:16:16,309
and get back to you.

344
00:16:20,552 --> 00:16:21,809
- Hey, Rita?
- Yeah?

345
00:16:21,892 --> 00:16:25,056
- Where do you keep your toothpaste?
- What are you looking for, tooth polish?

346
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:27,660
- Toothpaste, yeah.
- Just use the baking soda.

347
00:16:27,743 --> 00:16:28,835
"Baking soda"?

348
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:30,572
Ah, what the hell,
I can skip a night.

349
00:16:30,816 --> 00:16:34,117
Oh, I've never noticed this picture before.
Is that you when you were a little girl?

350
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:37,078
Oh, yeah. That's the summer
my family went to DC.

351
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,582
That, uh, flag's missing
some stars there.

352
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,524
Why don't you come to bed, Brian?

353
00:16:42,607 --> 00:16:45,023
What do you say we make
a little whoopee?

354
00:16:45,106 --> 00:16:46,535
Yeah, sure. Why not?

355
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:52,756
You're okay?
I'm not hurting you, am I?

356
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:54,902
No, I'm fine.
What are you talking about?

357
00:16:54,985 --> 00:16:56,854
I just want to make sure
you're comfortable.

358
00:16:59,171 --> 00:17:00,588
Oh, I love you, Brian!

359
00:17:00,806 --> 00:17:02,044
Sock it to me!

360
00:17:02,127 --> 00:17:03,189
- What?!
- Ouch!

361
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,998
- What's wrong?!
- Oh, nothing.

362
00:17:05,081 --> 00:17:08,523
When I'm on my back, sometimes
my breast can slide in my armpit.

363
00:17:08,606 --> 00:17:10,456
Just got pinched, that's all.

364
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:11,539
Okay.

365
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:17,768
- Was that your boob?
- God, no!

366
00:17:18,164 --> 00:17:19,561
I think I broke my hip!

367
00:17:19,711 --> 00:17:21,294
Oh, my God!
Wh... wh... wh... what should I do?

368
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,149
Call the number on my bracelet!

369
00:17:23,504 --> 00:17:25,879
It says, "Murray Hill, 4185."

370
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,423
- that's not enough numbers!
- That's the number, Brian!

371
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,691
Just dial zero and read it to Sarah.

372
00:17:30,774 --> 00:17:32,008
For God's sake, Rita!

373
00:17:35,325 --> 00:17:36,325
She's fine.

374
00:17:36,408 --> 00:17:38,098
She's out of surgery and she's resting.

375
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,504
Well, how did she break it?
Did she fall?

376
00:17:40,587 --> 00:17:43,353
Well, uh... She...
Yes, she fell.

377
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:46,390
Boy, you know, Brian, a woman her age
comes in here, they don't always leave.

378
00:17:46,473 --> 00:17:47,886
Peter, she's going to be okay.

379
00:17:47,969 --> 00:17:49,449
Listen, Brian, you say the word

380
00:17:49,532 --> 00:17:52,224
and I'll go in there with a pillow
and you won't have any more problems.

381
00:17:52,307 --> 00:17:55,075
How many times do I have to tell you,
I'm sticking by this woman?

382
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,806
- I love her.
- Careful, Brian.

383
00:17:56,889 --> 00:17:59,045
Sometimes the things you
love can disappoint you.

384
00:17:59,128 --> 00:18:00,503
Like that <i>Playboy</i> issue.

385
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,889
Ah, here we go.

386
00:18:01,972 --> 00:18:04,074
<i>Playboy's</i> "Women of the Olympics."

387
00:18:04,398 --> 00:18:06,250
Wow, those are some broad shoulders.

388
00:18:06,881 --> 00:18:09,214
Okay, I guess small boobs
are good for swimming.

389
00:18:10,151 --> 00:18:12,682
That... that... those are balls.

390
00:18:17,219 --> 00:18:19,730
Brian?!
Brian?!

391
00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:22,559
Oh. Is the soup ready?

392
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,623
- Yeah, got it right here.
- Oh, good. I need to take my pills.

393
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:27,030
It's been three hours.

394
00:18:27,571 --> 00:18:31,316
You know, they warned me these blue ones
were going to make me constipated.

395
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:33,086
- Right they were.
- Okay.

396
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:34,990
I am plugged up.

397
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,604
No, I... I got it.

398
00:18:39,804 --> 00:18:42,071
Do it, Brian.
Do it.

399
00:18:43,527 --> 00:18:44,799
It's me as a pillow.

400
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,471
You know what, Brian?

401
00:18:46,554 --> 00:18:48,890
Oh, I could really use
some milk of magnesia.

402
00:18:48,973 --> 00:18:50,956
Okay, well, I'll go pick some up.

403
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,769
Thanks, Brian.
I love you.

404
00:18:53,071 --> 00:18:56,198
Oh, and... and if you're going out,
get some milk of magnesia.

405
00:18:56,281 --> 00:18:57,595
Yeah, you just said that.

406
00:19:07,704 --> 00:19:10,023
<i>I am plugged up.</i>

407
00:19:16,604 --> 00:19:18,688
Wow, you are really pretty.

408
00:19:18,939 --> 00:19:19,939
Thanks.

409
00:19:20,257 --> 00:19:22,666
You know, uh, I wrote a book.

410
00:19:22,939 --> 00:19:24,055
What's that?

411
00:19:24,138 --> 00:19:25,555
It's like a long magazine.

412
00:19:25,638 --> 00:19:28,036
Huh? It's like the Internet
made out of a tree.

413
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,590
Oh. Weird. You want to have
sex in the bathroom?

414
00:19:31,673 --> 00:19:35,571
Oh, gosh, what a treat.
Yes. Yes, I... I would... I would like that.

415
00:19:40,504 --> 00:19:42,655
Boy, that took you a long time.

416
00:19:42,738 --> 00:19:44,599
Did you have to wait
for the streetcar?

417
00:19:44,682 --> 00:19:46,976
Look, Rita,
I have a confession to make.

418
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,240
I met a girl,
I had a couple of drinks,

419
00:19:49,323 --> 00:19:51,439
- and I slept with her.
- You what?

420
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,397
I know, I feel awful.
It was a terrible thing to do.

421
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,756
I'm so sorry.
It'll never happen again.

422
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:58,421
But there's an upside.

423
00:19:58,504 --> 00:20:02,706
You see, these past few weeks I've been
doubting whether we're compatible,

424
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:07,250
you know, because of the age difference.
But I realized that that doesn't matter.

425
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:10,423
That what... what I get from you
is what I always wanted:

426
00:20:10,506 --> 00:20:12,888
a smart, sexy, real person

427
00:20:12,971 --> 00:20:16,062
who I can talk with and share
every piece of me with.

428
00:20:16,606 --> 00:20:19,554
I had a moment of weakness today,
but in a way, it's all right

429
00:20:19,637 --> 00:20:23,590
because it's taken me to a place where
I now realize that you're not too old for me.

430
00:20:23,673 --> 00:20:24,888
Isn't that great?

431
00:20:24,971 --> 00:20:26,595
You're not too old for me!

432
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,355
You know what, Brian?

433
00:20:28,438 --> 00:20:29,923
You're not old enough for me.

434
00:20:30,006 --> 00:20:31,757
- What?
- You cheated on me.

435
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,521
That's what happened today.

436
00:20:33,604 --> 00:20:36,490
You can rationalize it any
way you want, but to me,

437
00:20:36,573 --> 00:20:38,823
all that shows is that
you're an immature guy

438
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:40,868
who doesn't realize
what a catch I am.

439
00:20:40,951 --> 00:20:43,523
I'm sorry, Brian,
but you screwed up.

440
00:20:43,606 --> 00:20:45,124
Now, please go.

441
00:20:45,207 --> 00:20:46,655
- But, Rita...
- Go!

442
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,738
You can leave my apartment
key on the davenport.

443
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Here?

444
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,335
No, the davenport...
The chesterfield.

445
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:56,671
On this?

446
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,882
No, does that look
like a divan to you?

447
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:00,842
Here?

448
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,184
Ugh. Leave them on the chifforobe.

449
00:21:03,267 --> 00:21:05,025
You know what? Just take your (bleep) keys.

450
00:21:05,108 --> 00:21:07,173
I don't know what
the (bleep) you're talking about.
