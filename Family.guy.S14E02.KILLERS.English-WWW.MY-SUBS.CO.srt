ANNOUNCER:
We now return

13
00:00:35,688 --> 00:00:38,656
to <i>The Autistic Postman Always</i>
<i>Rings Four Hundred Times.</i>

14
00:00:38,691 --> 00:00:42,026
(doorbell rings repeatedly)

15
00:00:44,296 --> 00:00:47,265
So is everybody excited
for Father's Day on Sunday?

16
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:48,600
Oh, yeah,
that's right.

17
00:00:48,634 --> 00:00:50,935
I always try to avoid
Father's Day now.

18
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,937
Every year, I used to take
my dad to the horse track.

19
00:00:52,972 --> 00:00:56,007
Now we just go rooting around
for bargains at the mall.

20
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:58,676
Oh, this is darling, isn't it?
Uh-huh.

21
00:00:58,711 --> 00:01:01,159
Glenn, do you think you'd see
my bra through this blouse?

22
00:01:01,183 --> 00:01:01,713
Uh, I don't know.

23
00:01:01,714 --> 00:01:03,681
Is it too sheer?
I don't know what that means.

24
00:01:03,716 --> 00:01:05,016
Glenn? Do you think
it's too sheer?

25
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,651
I said I don't know!

26
00:01:06,685 --> 00:01:08,319
Hey, Joe, you know,
come to think of it,

27
00:01:08,354 --> 00:01:09,320
I've met
Cleveland's dad,

28
00:01:09,355 --> 00:01:10,989
and my dog slept
with Quagmire's dad,

29
00:01:11,023 --> 00:01:12,657
but I don't know anything
about your dad.

30
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:13,992
Yeah, is he
still with us,

31
00:01:14,026 --> 00:01:16,661
or is he living in Heaven
with Jesus Christ?

32
00:01:16,695 --> 00:01:18,663
Ugh, save that
for your black friends.

33
00:01:18,697 --> 00:01:20,331
Eh, my dad's out
there somewhere,

34
00:01:20,366 --> 00:01:22,000
but I haven't spoken
to him in years.

35
00:01:22,034 --> 00:01:23,301
What?! Really?!

36
00:01:23,335 --> 00:01:24,969
Sorry, Cleveland,
that was mean of me.

37
00:01:25,004 --> 00:01:26,838
I already forgave you.

38
00:01:26,872 --> 00:01:28,873
But, Joe, why haven't you
seen your dad?

39
00:01:28,908 --> 00:01:31,209
Well, he's a good guy,
but we just drifted apart.

40
00:01:31,243 --> 00:01:32,377
It's no big deal.

41
00:01:32,411 --> 00:01:33,945
It's a very big deal.

42
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:35,819
My dad's a stinking drunk
who lives in Ireland,

43
00:01:35,848 --> 00:01:37,382
but you got
a perfectly good dad.

44
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:38,716
You can't waste that.

45
00:01:38,751 --> 00:01:40,451
You gotta call him up
for Father's Day.

46
00:01:40,486 --> 00:01:42,787
Peter, I don't even know
where he is.

47
00:01:42,822 --> 00:01:45,023
Who's ready for another beer?

48
00:01:45,057 --> 00:01:47,358
Hey, Cleveland, weren't you
supposed to buy the next round?

49
00:01:47,393 --> 00:01:49,694
That's a shame Joe
never sees his dad.

50
00:01:49,728 --> 00:01:50,695
I know.

51
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:51,696
Hey, you know what?

52
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:53,031
Joe's our friend.

53
00:01:53,033 --> 00:01:54,673
He should be with his dad
on Father's Day,

54
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,000
and we're gonna
track him down.

55
00:01:56,035 --> 00:01:58,002
Yeah, that's a
good idea, Peter.

56
00:01:58,037 --> 00:01:59,671
Well, I like
helping people out.

57
00:01:59,705 --> 00:02:02,273
That's why I was such a good
break-up rodeo clown.

58
00:02:02,308 --> 00:02:04,275
I'm just gonna go
ahead and tell you.

59
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,610
I've been sleeping
with your sister.

60
00:02:05,644 --> 00:02:06,945
What?!

61
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:08,379
Hey, now! Hey, now!
Over here! Over here!

62
00:02:08,414 --> 00:02:10,148
Over here! Hey, now!
Hey, now! Over here!

63
00:02:10,182 --> 00:02:11,482
Over here!
Hey, now! Hey, now!

64
00:02:11,517 --> 00:02:12,483
Over here! Over here!

65
00:02:12,518 --> 00:02:13,518
(growls)

66
00:02:15,855 --> 00:02:17,488
(echoing): Oh, and now that
I'm inside the barrel,

67
00:02:17,523 --> 00:02:20,024
he gave you
and your sister HPV.

68
00:02:23,495 --> 00:02:25,463
Hey, want to see
something?

69
00:02:25,497 --> 00:02:27,465
Check out how hot
my last patient was.

70
00:02:27,499 --> 00:02:28,466
Oh.

71
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,467
They look fake.

72
00:02:29,501 --> 00:02:30,501
Yeah, who cares?

73
00:02:30,536 --> 00:02:32,837
Okay, according
to this projection,

74
00:02:32,872 --> 00:02:35,240
Stewie's adult height
will be five-foot-one.

75
00:02:35,274 --> 00:02:36,241
What?!

76
00:02:36,275 --> 00:02:37,976
Five-foot-one?!

77
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,645
Wow, Dr. Hartman,
that's really short.

78
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:43,982
I mean, I suppose it's fine
if he's gonna die at 14.

79
00:02:44,016 --> 00:02:45,984
Is-is there anything
on there about that?

80
00:02:46,018 --> 00:02:47,652
Well, we learned
in medical school

81
00:02:47,686 --> 00:02:49,320
that the short ones
do go faster,

82
00:02:49,355 --> 00:02:51,356
'cause they smell more farts
than the rest of us.

83
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,357
This is terrible!

84
00:02:52,391 --> 00:02:53,858
I can't be short!

85
00:02:53,893 --> 00:02:57,262
I'll be an outcast, like Rudolph
the Uncircumcised Reindeer.

86
00:02:57,296 --> 00:02:59,264
Look, Rudolph, it's
not me, all right?

87
00:02:59,298 --> 00:03:01,266
It's Dasher, he's
been complaining,

88
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,268
and he is the one who has
to look at it all night.

89
00:03:03,302 --> 00:03:04,602
I don't know.

90
00:03:04,637 --> 00:03:06,938
Mrs. Claus says
it'll decrease my sensitivity.

91
00:03:06,972 --> 00:03:09,908
I-I'm sorry, why are you
talking to my wife about this?

92
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,847
Okay, you guys,
it's all set.

93
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:17,515
I found Joe's dad
on the Internet,

94
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:19,851
and he just e-mailed me
to say he's coming tomorrow.

95
00:03:19,885 --> 00:03:22,186
All right, great, but remember,
this is a surprise for Joe.

96
00:03:22,221 --> 00:03:23,521
Why are you
looking at me?

97
00:03:23,555 --> 00:03:24,856
Because you're terrible
at keeping secrets.

98
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,524
No, I'm not;
I'm great at it.

99
00:03:26,558 --> 00:03:28,593
Like when I was
an OB/GYN.

100
00:03:28,627 --> 00:03:30,261
Well, I got the results
of your ultrasound,

101
00:03:30,296 --> 00:03:31,596
and I got some
news for you.

102
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,931
Wait, wait, wait--
(chuckles)

103
00:03:32,965 --> 00:03:34,565
We don't want to know
if it's a boy or a girl.

104
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,900
(chuckling):
Oh, okay.

105
00:03:35,935 --> 00:03:38,269
Well, <i>it's</i>
not breathing.

106
00:03:38,304 --> 00:03:39,270
Hey, guys.

107
00:03:39,305 --> 00:03:41,940
Uh, uh, so, Joe,
big day tomorrow, eh?

108
00:03:41,974 --> 00:03:43,241
Father's Day.

109
00:03:43,275 --> 00:03:45,910
Gonna be home all day,
especially at 11:30 a.m.?

110
00:03:45,945 --> 00:03:46,759
Peter.

111
00:03:46,783 --> 00:03:47,912
What? I didn't say
anything about his dad.

112
00:03:47,913 --> 00:03:48,880
My dad?

113
00:03:48,914 --> 00:03:50,548
What about my dad?

114
00:03:50,582 --> 00:03:54,619
Well, now that Quagmire ruined
the surprise, we found your dad!

115
00:03:54,653 --> 00:03:55,653
You what?!

116
00:03:55,688 --> 00:03:56,821
That's right.

117
00:03:56,855 --> 00:03:58,189
He's coming tomorrow,
for Father's Day.

118
00:03:58,223 --> 00:04:00,191
You shouldn't have
done that, Peter.

119
00:04:00,225 --> 00:04:02,193
My father's not gonna
be happy to see me.

120
00:04:02,227 --> 00:04:03,528
Sure he will.

121
00:04:03,562 --> 00:04:05,196
Just get him one of them
Father's Day cards

122
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,531
what plays a song.

123
00:04:06,565 --> 00:04:07,532
"Dad to the Bone."

124
00:04:07,566 --> 00:04:09,033
"I'm Dad."

125
00:04:09,068 --> 00:04:11,703
Pretty much anything with
"bad," you turn it to "dad."

126
00:04:11,737 --> 00:04:13,705
Wait, w-why wouldn't
your dad be happy?

127
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:15,239
What, is he a jerk
or something?

128
00:04:15,274 --> 00:04:18,242
No, it's just that
ever since I was a little kid,

129
00:04:18,277 --> 00:04:21,479
he was constantly making
fun of handicapped people.

130
00:04:21,513 --> 00:04:23,815
Really?
Yeah, my whole life,

131
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:27,151
my-my dad would ridicule
anyone in a wheelchair.

132
00:04:27,186 --> 00:04:29,487
It was all,
"Hey, spaghetti legs!"

133
00:04:29,521 --> 00:04:31,823
And, "Hey, rigatoni legs!"

134
00:04:31,857 --> 00:04:34,492
And, uh, "Hey,
angel-hair legs!"

135
00:04:34,526 --> 00:04:37,528
He was a sales manager
at Ronzoni.

136
00:04:37,563 --> 00:04:39,864
Wow, then it must have been
hard for him to accept

137
00:04:39,898 --> 00:04:41,199
when you were
paralyzed.

138
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:42,533
That's just it.

139
00:04:42,568 --> 00:04:44,869
My dad doesn't know
I'm handicapped.

140
00:04:44,903 --> 00:04:46,237
I never told him.

141
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:49,574
(sobbing): I never...
I never told him!

142
00:04:49,608 --> 00:04:51,342
(cries)

143
00:04:51,377 --> 00:04:52,677
Ah, Joe, don't cry.

144
00:04:52,711 --> 00:04:54,145
It's gonna make me cry.

145
00:04:54,179 --> 00:04:55,346
(wails)

146
00:04:55,381 --> 00:04:57,015
I cry like Snoopy.

147
00:04:57,049 --> 00:04:58,449
(wails)

148
00:05:03,357 --> 00:05:06,559
I can't believe you invited
my father without telling me.

149
00:05:06,593 --> 00:05:08,427
You guys got to get
in touch with him

150
00:05:08,462 --> 00:05:09,662
and tell him
not to come.

151
00:05:09,696 --> 00:05:11,330
It's too late, Joe,
he's already on his way.

152
00:05:11,365 --> 00:05:12,331
He is?

153
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:13,666
Yeah, we got him
tickets on Kayak.

154
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,668
It is a nightmare
itinerary.

155
00:05:15,702 --> 00:05:17,670
It was, like, 80 bucks,
but he has four stops.

156
00:05:17,704 --> 00:05:19,505
Two of them are
in Houston.

157
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:20,840
What am I gonna do?

158
00:05:20,874 --> 00:05:23,109
My dad has no idea
I'm paralyzed.

159
00:05:23,143 --> 00:05:25,111
Well, there's only
one thing we can do.

160
00:05:25,145 --> 00:05:26,445
We'll just figure out a way

161
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,214
to hide your handicap
from your dad.

162
00:05:28,248 --> 00:05:30,216
Hide the fact
that I can't walk?

163
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,884
Peter, that'll
never work.

164
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:32,885
It's worth a try.

165
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:34,553
Come on, Joe,
don't be so negative.

166
00:05:34,588 --> 00:05:36,322
You're like a Boston
fortune cookie.

167
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:39,325
"I don't know, numbnuts.

168
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:42,328
Maybe buy a garage and fill it
with hockey equipment."

169
00:05:42,362 --> 00:05:43,663
Huh.

170
00:05:43,697 --> 00:05:45,665
Well, let's see
what my lucky numbers are.

171
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:48,000
"Screw you, math dick."

172
00:05:48,035 --> 00:05:50,569
Well, that wasn't
very helpful at all.

173
00:05:55,575 --> 00:05:56,776
Here you go, Stewie.

174
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,878
I know clothes shopping
always cheers you up.

175
00:05:58,912 --> 00:06:01,514
I can't believe I'm only
going to be five-foot-one.

176
00:06:01,548 --> 00:06:03,149
Aw, come on, look
at the bright side.

177
00:06:03,183 --> 00:06:05,217
You'll be in the front row
of every class picture.

178
00:06:05,252 --> 00:06:06,519
Holding that little plaque.

179
00:06:06,553 --> 00:06:07,753
You suck.

180
00:06:07,788 --> 00:06:09,622
Why don't you go drink out
of the fountain?

181
00:06:09,656 --> 00:06:10,890
I'll text you
when I'm done.

182
00:06:10,924 --> 00:06:12,491
I know you're
trying to be rude,

183
00:06:12,526 --> 00:06:14,860
but I am gonna do that,
because I find it enjoyable.

184
00:06:19,032 --> 00:06:20,599
Excuse me, I was
looking at this.

185
00:06:20,634 --> 00:06:22,668
Sorry, I've made a decision
to go for that shirt,

186
00:06:22,703 --> 00:06:24,170
and when that happens,
it is on.

187
00:06:24,204 --> 00:06:25,671
Full throttle, man. Pow!

188
00:06:25,706 --> 00:06:27,673
Wow, you're an energetic
little fellow.

189
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,675
I guess your mommy lets
you drink coffee, huh?

190
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,344
Whoa, whoa, I-I don't put
stimulants in my body.

191
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:33,679
You know something?

192
00:06:33,714 --> 00:06:35,214
You kind of remind me
of Tom Cruise.

193
00:06:35,248 --> 00:06:36,215
Boom.

194
00:06:36,249 --> 00:06:37,550
(laughs)

195
00:06:37,584 --> 00:06:39,251
You-you got me, man.

196
00:06:39,286 --> 00:06:41,587
(gasps) Wow,
Tom Cruise.

197
00:06:41,621 --> 00:06:44,590
You look, um...
bigger in the movies.

198
00:06:44,624 --> 00:06:45,925
Wh-What are you doing here?

199
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:48,928
Oh, I get all my clothes from
out-of-the-way toddler stores.

200
00:06:48,962 --> 00:06:50,930
Ooh, uh, you want
an animal cracker?

201
00:06:50,964 --> 00:06:52,598
Sure, you got
a lion in there?

202
00:06:52,632 --> 00:06:54,266
Oh, no,
I eat those first.

203
00:06:54,301 --> 00:06:56,602
I believe eating
the lions gives me power.

204
00:06:56,636 --> 00:06:59,538
Yeah, I hear you believe
in a lot of crazy stuff.

205
00:06:59,573 --> 00:07:01,207
What'd you get there?
A giraffe?

206
00:07:01,241 --> 00:07:02,208
Yeah.

207
00:07:02,242 --> 00:07:03,209
Good, good.

208
00:07:03,243 --> 00:07:04,210
It's good for eyesight.

209
00:07:04,244 --> 00:07:05,544
Well, you're certainly upbeat.

210
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:07,546
Let me ask you,
doesn't it bother you

211
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:09,548
being an adult man
who's that short?

212
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,250
'Cause the doctor says
that's where I'm headed.

213
00:07:11,284 --> 00:07:12,251
Oh, no way, man.

214
00:07:12,285 --> 00:07:14,587
The middle of the word
"short" is "or."

215
00:07:14,621 --> 00:07:16,255
"Or" gives you a choice.

216
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:18,657
And I choose not to be short.

217
00:07:18,692 --> 00:07:21,060
Wow, you need a road map
for that one.

218
00:07:21,094 --> 00:07:22,061
Hey, hey,
I'll tell you what.

219
00:07:22,095 --> 00:07:23,395
You spend the day with me,

220
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,064
you'll see how great
it is to be short.

221
00:07:25,098 --> 00:07:27,399
You'll feel like
you're discovering a new world.

222
00:07:27,434 --> 00:07:29,068
And you know what's in
the middle of the word "world"?

223
00:07:29,102 --> 00:07:30,736
Um... "or"?

224
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:32,071
Yes!

225
00:07:32,105 --> 00:07:34,073
The dots have appeared, man,
let's connect them!

226
00:07:34,107 --> 00:07:35,407
(chuckles
uncomfortably)

227
00:07:35,442 --> 00:07:37,977
You're... you're a weirdo,
but let's do this.

228
00:07:41,782 --> 00:07:43,082
All right, check
it out, Bonnie.

229
00:07:43,116 --> 00:07:45,084
This is how we're
gonna fool Joe's dad.

230
00:07:45,118 --> 00:07:46,752
Oh, my God.

231
00:07:46,787 --> 00:07:48,154
Yeah, looks
real, right?

232
00:07:48,188 --> 00:07:50,489
I put this pair of pants
on the front legs of this horse

233
00:07:50,524 --> 00:07:51,824
and strapped Joe
to the front

234
00:07:51,858 --> 00:07:53,826
with his legs tied
behind the horse's neck.

235
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,495
And then we put Cinnamon's head
up the back of Joe's shirt

236
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,770
and simply hid the rest of the
horse behind this curtain.

237
00:07:58,799 --> 00:08:00,099
(horse whinnies)

238
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:02,034
His breath is very
moist, Peter.

239
00:08:02,068 --> 00:08:05,037
And to induce movement, I'm
gonna snap the horse's balls

240
00:08:05,071 --> 00:08:06,405
with this dampened
kitchen towel.

241
00:08:07,741 --> 00:08:08,707
Aah! Oh, my God!

242
00:08:08,742 --> 00:08:10,042
Holy crap, he's
out of control!

243
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:11,944
Does it look real?

244
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,113
(screams)

245
00:08:14,147 --> 00:08:15,147
Plan B! an B!

246
00:08:26,193 --> 00:08:29,495
(groans) Peter, I'm
afraid this is hopeless.

247
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:30,830
What, I don't know
what else to do.

248
00:08:30,864 --> 00:08:32,164
I mean, we're not
gonna come up

249
00:08:32,199 --> 00:08:33,833
with something better
than the horse.

250
00:08:33,867 --> 00:08:35,835
Yeah, I guess you're just
gonna have to tell your dad

251
00:08:35,869 --> 00:08:37,169
about your handicap.

252
00:08:37,204 --> 00:08:38,838
I can't do that.

253
00:08:38,872 --> 00:08:41,774
If you guys were in my shoes,
you'd understand.

254
00:08:41,808 --> 00:08:43,776
Wait a minute, that's it!

255
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,778
I <i>will</i> get in your shoes.

256
00:08:45,812 --> 00:08:47,413
I'll just pretend to be you.

257
00:08:47,447 --> 00:08:49,081
I mean, your dad ain't
seen you in years.

258
00:08:49,115 --> 00:08:50,416
He won't know
the difference.

259
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,951
What? That's crazy.

260
00:08:51,985 --> 00:08:53,285
(groaning)

261
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,287
Boy, that was a close call.

262
00:08:55,322 --> 00:08:58,023
Is some of this room cold?

263
00:09:01,995 --> 00:09:03,329
All right, Peter,
almost done.

264
00:09:05,665 --> 00:09:07,299
Huh? Huh?

265
00:09:07,334 --> 00:09:08,300
Eh, kind of.

266
00:09:08,335 --> 00:09:10,035
Yeah.
I don't care.

267
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,704
Peter, I don't
know about this.

268
00:09:11,738 --> 00:09:13,038
It seems like
a bad idea.

269
00:09:13,073 --> 00:09:15,708
Look, Lois, Joe is one
of my best friends, all right?

270
00:09:15,742 --> 00:09:17,376
I'm only doing this
to help him.

271
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,044
Besides, wait till you hear
my "Joe" voice.

272
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:22,047
(imitating Joe): Uh, God, I hate
being stuck in this chair.

273
00:09:22,082 --> 00:09:24,884
No, Peter,
that fights it.

00:10:15,268 --> 00:10:16,235
Are you ready, Peter?

296
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:17,236
I think so.

297
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,570
What do you think,
acting coach?

298
00:10:18,605 --> 00:10:22,241
I think you will be
exemplary, Peter.

299
00:10:22,275 --> 00:10:24,576
All good acting coaches
are insane old ladies.

300
00:10:24,611 --> 00:10:26,178
Emote!

301
00:10:26,212 --> 00:10:28,180
(doorbell rings)

302
00:10:28,214 --> 00:10:29,181
Hi, Bud.

303
00:10:29,215 --> 00:10:30,182
Hi, Joe's dad.

304
00:10:30,216 --> 00:10:31,517
Uh, I mean, uh, Dad.

305
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,085
Uh, Joe, I'm Joe;
you're my dad.

306
00:10:33,119 --> 00:10:34,153
Joe?

307
00:10:34,187 --> 00:10:36,288
Wow, I guess it really
has been a long time.

308
00:10:36,323 --> 00:10:37,690
I barely recognize you.

309
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:39,191
Put on a little weight,
haven't you?

310
00:10:39,225 --> 00:10:41,226
Well, I could say
the same for you.

311
00:10:41,261 --> 00:10:42,928
(laughs)
(laughs uneasily)

312
00:10:42,963 --> 00:10:45,898
Sometimes I don't
understand why people laugh.

313
00:10:49,636 --> 00:10:51,503
All right, everyone in the car.

314
00:10:51,538 --> 00:10:53,472
We got a Father's Day
dinner reservation.

315
00:10:53,506 --> 00:10:55,541
Why is Mr. Swanson coming?

316
00:10:55,575 --> 00:10:57,109
And why is he dressed like Dad?

317
00:10:57,143 --> 00:10:58,377
I don't know, kids.

318
00:10:58,411 --> 00:11:01,380
I stopped asking after your
father said he shot a horse.

319
00:11:02,882 --> 00:11:03,882
(siren whoops twice)

320
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:07,786
Thanks for
the ride-along.

321
00:11:07,821 --> 00:11:10,322
I liked when you sentenced those
two girls to kiss each other.

322
00:11:10,357 --> 00:11:12,925
Yeah, all girls are lesbians
when you point a gun at 'em.

323
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,194
Boy, it's been great
spending time with you, son.

324
00:11:15,228 --> 00:11:17,896
It's been great spending
time with you, too...

325
00:11:17,931 --> 00:11:19,098
Dad.

326
00:11:21,668 --> 00:11:23,102
Oh, this'll be fun.

327
00:11:23,136 --> 00:11:24,436
Let's see how long it takes them

328
00:11:24,471 --> 00:11:26,171
to get Gumby over there
into the car.

329
00:11:26,206 --> 00:11:28,107
Yeah, that's our neighbor,
Peter Griffin.

330
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:29,608
That's the guy
who e-mailed me?

331
00:11:29,642 --> 00:11:32,678
Huh, no wonder it was all caps
with tons of typos.

332
00:11:32,712 --> 00:11:33,946
He's a water head, right?

333
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,180
Yeah, he's a mess.

334
00:11:35,215 --> 00:11:36,382
Look at his ugly kids.

335
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,317
Pathetic.

336
00:11:38,351 --> 00:11:39,852
Ugh, he's not fitting.

337
00:11:39,886 --> 00:11:42,955
Just put some of him
in the back like skis.

338
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,627
Hey, Stewie.
What's up?

339
00:11:48,661 --> 00:11:50,162
(chuckling): When you
say it like that,

340
00:11:50,196 --> 00:11:51,430
you sound just
like Tom Cruise.

341
00:11:51,464 --> 00:11:52,765
What?
Oh, yeah,

342
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,033
I've been hanging
with Tom Cruise.

343
00:11:54,067 --> 00:11:55,868
You've been hanging out
with Tom Cruise?

344
00:11:55,902 --> 00:11:56,869
Sure have.

345
00:11:56,903 --> 00:11:58,170
We spent the whole
day together,

346
00:11:58,204 --> 00:11:59,338
and he showed me

347
00:11:59,372 --> 00:12:00,773
there's a lot of
advantages to being short.

348
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:01,940
Oh, yeah? Like what?

349
00:12:01,975 --> 00:12:03,542
You're the last one
to get wet when it rains?

350
00:12:03,576 --> 00:12:04,777
Well, yeah, that.

351
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:06,912
And you can chow
pie standing up.

352
00:12:06,946 --> 00:12:08,781
We didn't do any of that,
but the point is,

353
00:12:08,815 --> 00:12:10,449
I'm at peace
with being short.

354
00:12:10,483 --> 00:12:11,950
Full throttle, man!
Pow!

355
00:12:11,985 --> 00:12:13,485
(phone ringing)

356
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,787
Hello?

357
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:16,722
Oh, hi,
Dr. Hartman.

358
00:12:16,756 --> 00:12:18,590
Mrs. Griffin,
I have some good news.

359
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,959
Turns out your son
is going to be normal height.

360
00:12:20,994 --> 00:12:23,028
I read his chart wrong
yesterday.

361
00:12:23,063 --> 00:12:26,231
Apparently, I have something
called "dislooxia"?

362
00:12:26,266 --> 00:12:28,067
That was the doctor.

363
00:12:28,101 --> 00:12:30,969
Apparently, Stewie's not
gonna be short after all.

364
00:12:31,004 --> 00:12:32,538
What? Really?

365
00:12:32,572 --> 00:12:33,906
That's wonderful news!

366
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,374
Oh, I'm so relieved

367
00:12:35,408 --> 00:12:37,509
my child is spared
some heartache.

368
00:12:37,544 --> 00:12:39,978
Now, come on, Brian, I guess
we should try to make it

369
00:12:40,013 --> 00:12:41,146
over to Meg's
birthday party.

370
00:12:44,017 --> 00:12:46,085
Could I have some bread
while I open my presents?

371
00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:47,786
At this point,
we're gonna have to start

372
00:12:47,821 --> 00:12:49,321
charging you
for the bread.

373
00:12:49,355 --> 00:12:51,223
(doorbell rings)

374
00:12:51,257 --> 00:12:52,224
Hey, Stewie!

375
00:12:52,258 --> 00:12:53,425
You want to check out
the go-kart

376
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,660
I used in <i>Days of Thunder?</i>

377
00:12:54,694 --> 00:12:55,928
Yeah, listen, um...

378
00:12:55,962 --> 00:12:58,363
I just found out I'm
actually going to be tall,

379
00:12:58,398 --> 00:13:01,200
so I'm no longer comfortable
hanging out with someone

380
00:13:01,234 --> 00:13:03,001
whose teeth are bigger
than their fingers.

381
00:13:03,036 --> 00:13:04,036
What?

382
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,370
That's...
that's barely true.

383
00:13:05,405 --> 00:13:07,005
Yeah, so...
see you later.

384
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,841
You are making a big mistake,
Stewie!

385
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:12,211
Nobody walks away
from Tiny Tom Cruise!

386
00:13:12,245 --> 00:13:13,879
Yeah, except for
all three of your wives.

387
00:13:13,913 --> 00:13:15,681
Okay, I'm
shutting this now.

388
00:13:15,715 --> 00:13:18,784
Okay, so... bye!

389
00:13:22,355 --> 00:13:25,958
So now, since I switched
to disposable catheters,

390
00:13:25,992 --> 00:13:29,294
I no longer have those beet-red
infections in my urethra.

391
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:30,329
Oh, no.

392
00:13:30,363 --> 00:13:31,563
I hope it's not genetic.

393
00:13:31,598 --> 00:13:33,165
Chris, he's
not our dad.

394
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:35,234
I can't keep up with this ruse.

395
00:13:35,268 --> 00:13:36,702
Hey, everybody!

396
00:13:36,736 --> 00:13:38,470
Peter, finally,
you're home.

397
00:13:38,505 --> 00:13:40,405
How's it going over there
with my dad?

398
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,241
Awesome. He fell for
the whole thing.

399
00:13:42,275 --> 00:13:44,042
In fact, we've been
having a great time!

400
00:13:44,077 --> 00:13:45,711
Wow, that's
terrific, Peter!

401
00:13:45,745 --> 00:13:48,180
You'll only have to pull it
off for a few more hours.

402
00:13:48,214 --> 00:13:50,883
Then he'll be on a plane
tomorrow and I can go home.

403
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:52,217
Oh, that's
the other good news.

404
00:13:52,252 --> 00:13:53,619
Bud's not leaving!

405
00:13:53,653 --> 00:13:55,287
I told him he can move in
with me and Bonnie.

406
00:13:55,321 --> 00:13:56,288
What?!

407
00:13:56,322 --> 00:13:57,589
Peter, this is crazy!

408
00:13:57,624 --> 00:13:59,224
Na it's gonna
work out fine.

409
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:00,392
Oh, and remember, Joe,

410
00:14:00,426 --> 00:14:01,894
if Lois is feeling
frisky at night,

411
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:04,363
it's index finger
around and clockwise.

412
00:14:04,397 --> 00:14:05,864
And just keep
doing that to yourself

413
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:07,132
until you're good to go.

414
00:14:11,692 --> 00:14:13,660
<i>Peter, this is ridiculous.</i>

415
00:14:13,694 --> 00:14:16,796
You can't live in my house
with my dad and my family!

416
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,165
Your dad got me
super clean in the tub.

417
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,967
Joe's right,
this is idiotic.

418
00:14:21,001 --> 00:14:22,268
What are you thinking?

419
00:14:22,302 --> 00:14:23,536
I'll tell you what I'm thinking.

420
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,204
I'm thinking that
I've had two dads

421
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,674
and neither one cared for me
as much as Bud does.

422
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,042
Peter, I've had
enough of this!

423
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,610
You can't just
take my dad!

424
00:14:30,644 --> 00:14:31,811
Well, he's right
next door.

425
00:14:31,845 --> 00:14:33,613
Nothing's stopping you
from going over there

426
00:14:33,647 --> 00:14:34,947
and telling him the truth:

427
00:14:34,982 --> 00:14:37,483
that his son is a paraplegic
who's stuck in a wheelchair.

428
00:14:37,518 --> 00:14:38,885
You know I
can't do that.

429
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,620
Ah, suit yourself.
But I gotta go.

430
00:14:40,654 --> 00:14:42,422
Me and Bud are
having a blast.

431
00:14:44,124 --> 00:14:45,525
I'm sorry, Joe.

432
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:46,859
A-Are you okay?

433
00:14:46,894 --> 00:14:48,227
Not really.

434
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,996
I'll be honest,
Lois, this hurts.

435
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,764
Hurts like the Dickens.

436
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,733
I've finished
my latest novel.

437
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:54,767
Splendid, Charles!

438
00:14:54,802 --> 00:14:55,768
What is it called?

439
00:14:55,803 --> 00:14:56,969
<i>Oliver Nipple-Twist.</i>

440
00:14:57,004 --> 00:14:58,037
Ow!

441
00:14:58,072 --> 00:14:59,639
Oh, Charles, you bastard!

442
00:14:59,673 --> 00:15:00,873
Yeah! The Dickens!

443
00:15:00,908 --> 00:15:03,042
It hurts like the me!

444
00:15:08,582 --> 00:15:12,018
So, anyone going to
the gerbil's funeral on Friday?

445
00:15:12,052 --> 00:15:13,152
Okay, kids!

446
00:15:13,187 --> 00:15:15,054
Everyone in a circle
for parachute time.

447
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:18,024
Oh, goodie,
I love parachute time!

448
00:15:20,527 --> 00:15:22,729
ALL:
Whee!

449
00:15:22,763 --> 00:15:24,464
Whee!

450
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,933
Whee!

451
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,601
What the hell?

452
00:15:28,635 --> 00:15:30,870
That kid looked like
Tiny Tom Cruise.

453
00:15:30,904 --> 00:15:32,171
Whee!

454
00:15:32,206 --> 00:15:34,307
Huh.
Must've been my imagination.

455
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,476
Aah!

456
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,444
If you think
you're getting away from me,

457
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,179
you've got a crazy laugh
coming, friend.

458
00:15:40,214 --> 00:15:42,582
(laughs crazily)

459
00:15:42,616 --> 00:15:44,083
Aah!

460
00:15:44,118 --> 00:15:46,119
(continues laughing)

461
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,759
(panting)

462
00:15:52,793 --> 00:15:54,127
Hey, what are you doing home
so early?

463
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,128
He's following me, Brian!

464
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,195
Who's following you?

465
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,396
Tom Cruise!

466
00:15:57,431 --> 00:15:59,065
I spend one afternoon
with the guy,

467
00:15:59,099 --> 00:16:00,733
and it's like I signed
an eight-year contract

468
00:16:00,768 --> 00:16:02,201
to show up at events with him

469
00:16:02,236 --> 00:16:03,936
and let him fake-father a child.

470
00:16:03,971 --> 00:16:05,638
Stewie, I would think Tom Cruise

471
00:16:05,672 --> 00:16:07,740
has better things to do
than follow you around.

472
00:16:07,775 --> 00:16:08,741
Oh, really?

473
00:16:08,776 --> 00:16:09,842
Well, explain that!

474
00:16:17,217 --> 00:16:19,452
You know, it's times
like this where I think,

475
00:16:19,486 --> 00:16:21,687
if I didn't talk and
you were a normal baby,

476
00:16:21,722 --> 00:16:23,422
we wouldn't have
any of these problems.

477
00:16:23,457 --> 00:16:24,757
You gotta help me
get rid of him, Brian!

478
00:16:24,792 --> 00:16:26,425
He's creepier
than that guy at the gym

479
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,427
who just does karate
in the mirror.

480
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,297
It's me.

481
00:16:31,331 --> 00:16:32,298
The guy's me.

482
00:16:32,332 --> 00:16:33,733
I'm a gym karate creep.

483
00:16:36,937 --> 00:16:38,037
I'm pretty good, too.

484
00:16:38,071 --> 00:16:39,205
But relax.

485
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:41,240
If I wanted you dead,
you'd be dead.

486
00:16:45,012 --> 00:16:47,280
Hey, Dad, what do you
say we go play catch?

487
00:16:47,314 --> 00:16:48,447
And throw me
some divers.

488
00:16:48,482 --> 00:16:50,983
I want to get grass stains
on my school slacks.

489
00:16:51,018 --> 00:16:52,018
What?

490
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,186
You're a grown man.

491
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,354
I know, it's just so
great having a dad.

492
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,857
Well, it's nice having
reconnected with you, too.

493
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:00,426
All right, let's do it.

494
00:17:06,867 --> 00:17:08,167
Oh, for God's sake.

495
00:17:08,202 --> 00:17:10,169
See, a guy like that
should just stay inside

496
00:17:10,204 --> 00:17:11,504
so we don't have
to look at him.

497
00:17:11,538 --> 00:17:12,738
Joe, go over there

498
00:17:12,773 --> 00:17:14,207
and tell him to get
back in his house.

499
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,676
Don't worry, I'll
take care of it.

500
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,910
Joe, you gotta go inside.

501
00:17:17,945 --> 00:17:19,111
You're upsetting my dad.

502
00:17:19,146 --> 00:17:21,013
<i>Your</i> dad?
That's right!

503
00:17:21,048 --> 00:17:22,415
He loves me
in a way that...

504
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:24,083
Aw, you guys had pizza?

505
00:17:24,117 --> 00:17:25,585
Screw you, Peter!

506
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,186
You know what? This is over!

507
00:17:27,221 --> 00:17:28,387
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

508
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,388
Not a chance.

509
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,723
I like your house better.

510
00:17:30,757 --> 00:17:32,625
I got nothing to hold onto
when I poop at home.

511
00:17:32,659 --> 00:17:35,194
You have no idea how many shower
curtains I've ripped down.

512
00:17:35,229 --> 00:17:36,195
Now get inside.

513
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,930
No, I'm not
gonna do that.

514
00:17:37,965 --> 00:17:39,131
Oh, yes, you are!

515
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,667
Get away from me,
you son of a bitch!

516
00:17:41,702 --> 00:17:43,502
What the hell?

517
00:17:43,537 --> 00:17:45,238
Joe, don't take that
from him!

518
00:17:47,241 --> 00:17:48,241
(Peter grunts)

519
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,542
How do you like that?

520
00:17:49,576 --> 00:17:51,811
You're getting
your ass kicked by a cripple!

521
00:17:51,845 --> 00:17:54,547
A helpless,
spaghetti-legged cripple!

522
00:17:54,581 --> 00:17:55,648
What are you doing?

523
00:17:55,682 --> 00:17:56,782
You're my son!

524
00:17:56,817 --> 00:17:58,117
You can't let yourself
get beat up

525
00:17:58,151 --> 00:17:59,652
by a guy
in a wheelchair!

526
00:17:59,686 --> 00:18:02,889
Your son is a guy
in a wheelchair.

527
00:18:02,923 --> 00:18:04,657
What are you talking about?

528
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,261
(sighs)

529
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,731
(gasps)
(gasps)

530
00:18:11,765 --> 00:18:12,798
Yes.

531
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:13,933
Yes, Dad.

532
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,268
It's me.

533
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,969
(grunting)

534
00:18:17,004 --> 00:18:18,304
Joe!

535
00:18:18,338 --> 00:18:19,605
What the hell
happened to you?

536
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,274
I was shot in
the line of duty.

537
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,609
(laughs)
"Line of duty."

538
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,779
So, this is why you haven't
called me in all these years?

539
00:18:26,813 --> 00:18:28,114
How could I, Dad?

540
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,049
You always made fun
of handicapped people.

541
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:33,552
The only thing I never
understood was... why?

542
00:18:33,587 --> 00:18:35,087
I don't know.

543
00:18:35,122 --> 00:18:36,756
I guess I could
never stand the thought

544
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,257
of something like that
happening to me.

545
00:18:38,292 --> 00:18:41,093
Or even worse, to someone
that I care about.

546
00:18:41,128 --> 00:18:43,229
One time, my legs fell
asleep on the toilet.

547
00:18:43,263 --> 00:18:44,897
I had to crawl
into the living room

548
00:18:44,932 --> 00:18:46,332
and interrupt
Lois's book club.

549
00:18:46,366 --> 00:18:48,734
That was one of the shower
curtains I ripped down.

550
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:51,170
And I suppose, deep down,
I was afraid.

551
00:18:51,204 --> 00:18:52,772
Afraid that, if it did happen,

552
00:18:52,806 --> 00:18:54,607
I wouldn't be strong enough
to handle it.

553
00:18:54,641 --> 00:18:57,310
Well, Dad, I can tell you
from experience

554
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,779
it's only when
your worst fears come true

555
00:18:59,813 --> 00:19:03,049
that you get to find out
how strong you really are.

556
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,618
Then I guess I've got
some learning to do.

557
00:19:05,652 --> 00:19:07,253
I love you, son.

558
00:19:07,287 --> 00:19:08,967
I love you, too, Dad.
I love you, too, Dad.

559
00:19:13,727 --> 00:19:15,194
Hey, Joe, uh,
just one question:

560
00:19:15,228 --> 00:19:17,430
why do you have all those
<i>Wizard of Oz</i> plates?

561
00:19:17,464 --> 00:19:19,298
Because if I finish
my vegetables,

562
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,767
I get to see
the Yellow Brick Road.

563
00:19:21,802 --> 00:19:23,803
All right,
you sold me.

564
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,274
All right, Brian,

565
00:19:28,308 --> 00:19:30,176
Tiny Tom Cruise
is somewhere close.

566
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,777
I can sense
his manic energy.

567
00:19:31,812 --> 00:19:33,112
You remember the plan?

568
00:19:33,146 --> 00:19:34,714
Yup, I got it.

569
00:19:34,748 --> 00:19:37,583
Help, help!
My dog got off his leash!

570
00:19:37,617 --> 00:19:40,186
Is there anyone
who can do a pumpy-arm run?

571
00:19:41,655 --> 00:19:44,490
Running, running, running,
running, running, running, run!

572
00:19:44,524 --> 00:19:47,159
Hey, Stewie. I'm here to help
you for the next billion years.

573
00:19:47,194 --> 00:19:48,427
All right, good to know.

574
00:19:48,462 --> 00:19:50,096
Anyway, my dog ran
around those bushes.

575
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,130
I am on it!

576
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,367
Gotcha!

577
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,268
All right,
off to Zappos with him.

578
00:19:56,303 --> 00:19:57,603
You sure this
is gonna work?

579
00:19:57,637 --> 00:19:59,238
Oh, yeah.
They'll accept any returns.

580
00:19:59,272 --> 00:20:01,173
We don't even
have to pay postage.

581
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,144
Hello, friend.
Your life...

582
00:20:05,178 --> 00:20:06,712
is about to change.

583
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,648
Hey, Tom. It's been
a couple weeks.

584
00:20:13,987 --> 00:20:17,156
Hey, listen, Joe, I'm sorry
I treated you like such a jerk.

585
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,691
Well, that's okay, Peter.

586
00:20:18,725 --> 00:20:21,494
In fact, I got to say, it
was a nice thing you did.

587
00:20:21,528 --> 00:20:24,930
I'm glad I reconnected with
my dad after all these years.

588
00:20:24,965 --> 00:20:26,532
Ah, it was my pleasure.

589
00:20:26,566 --> 00:20:28,467
There's no more important
relationship than...

590
00:20:28,502 --> 00:20:29,802
I'm sorry, Cleveland,
what the hell

591
00:20:29,836 --> 00:20:31,504
is that
Toronto Raptors hat?

592
00:20:31,538 --> 00:20:32,838
It was my
Father's Day present.

593
00:20:32,873 --> 00:20:34,040
I hate it.

594
00:20:34,074 --> 00:20:35,741
I'm just gonna
wear it for a week

595
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,076
then say
I lost it.

596
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,878
Anyway, thanks for
helping me, Peter.

597
00:20:38,912 --> 00:20:40,846
Yeah, it all
worked out great, Joe.

598
00:20:40,881 --> 00:20:43,682
Except I am still missing
that one pair of pants.

599
00:20:45,685 --> 00:20:47,686
(tires screech)

600
00:20:51,134 --> 00:20:54,809
Excuse me,
are those Bugle Boy jeans?

601
