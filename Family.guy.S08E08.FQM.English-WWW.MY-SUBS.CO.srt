11
00:00:35,988 --> 00:00:36,956
Hey, what are you doing
with my laptop?

12
00:00:37,524 --> 00:00:38,591
Going through your stuff.

13
00:00:38,658 --> 00:00:40,459
Why were you getting
MapQuest directions

14
00:00:40,527 --> 00:00:41,760
to Abigail Breslin's house?

15
00:00:42,328 --> 00:00:44,162
I just think she's
a one-of-a-kind spirit,

16
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:45,297
and I don't want to see
her go down the wrong...

17
00:00:45,365 --> 00:00:47,499
What the hell are you doing
going through my personal stuff?

18
00:00:47,567 --> 00:00:49,068
You should really
clear your history.

19
00:00:49,135 --> 00:00:51,604
I noticed you Googled yourself,
you egomaniac.

20
00:00:51,671 --> 00:00:53,038
Whoa, whoa,
th... that wasn't me.

21
00:00:53,106 --> 00:00:54,807
- Maybe Lois got on there.
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

22
00:00:54,874 --> 00:00:57,176
She's fascinated by things that
are going in my life, and...

23
00:00:57,243 --> 00:00:59,211
and... Fine,
I Googled myself, okay?

24
00:00:59,279 --> 00:01:00,913
You got me.
But check this out.

25
00:01:00,981 --> 00:01:03,115
I found a web site
for a group called

26
00:01:03,183 --> 00:01:05,784
the Rhode Island Society
For Special Literary Excellence,

27
00:01:05,852 --> 00:01:08,854
and they happen to have chosen
to read and discuss my book,

28
00:01:08,922 --> 00:01:10,222
<i>Faster Than the Speed of Love</i>.

29
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,625
See? I knew it was
just a matter of time

30
00:01:12,692 --> 00:01:14,460
before somebody would
recognize my genius.

31
00:01:14,527 --> 00:01:15,928
Whoa, take it easy.

32
00:01:15,996 --> 00:01:18,297
You're getting a bigger
head than Chris Matthews.

33
00:01:18,365 --> 00:01:20,633
The economy's in the news today,
and congress is considering

34
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,067
a minimum wage increase.

35
00:01:22,135 --> 00:01:24,036
Live by satellite
to talk about it,

36
00:01:24,104 --> 00:01:25,938
Senator Harry Reid
in Washington.

37
00:01:26,006 --> 00:01:28,374
How about it, Senator Reid...
is this the right move

38
00:01:28,441 --> 00:01:30,042
during the worst recession
since the 1930s?

39
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,411
Look, if we're gonna get
this economy back on track,

40
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,580
we have to get more money in
the pockets of hard-working

41
00:01:34,648 --> 00:01:36,661
- Americans who are the backbone
- Republicans are saying

42
00:01:36,672 --> 00:01:38,718
- of the American economy,
- this increase is gonna, in fact,

43
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,793
- instead of lining the pockets
- put more people out of work

44
00:01:40,794 --> 00:01:42,790
- and make it harder for American employers
- of the ultra-rich who are the people

45
00:01:42,797 --> 00:01:44,194
- who caused this collapse.
- to compete in the global marketplace.

46
00:01:44,217 --> 00:01:45,858
- Wouldn't it? Senator, wouldn't it...
- Chris, if... if I could just...

47
00:01:45,925 --> 00:01:47,993
- Senator, let me finish.
- Chris? If I could j... Chris, if I...

48
00:01:48,061 --> 00:01:50,462
My forehead, my rules.

49
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,964
Let's go to Los Angeles.

50
00:01:52,032 --> 00:01:53,866
Big actor, played the father
in <i>That 70's Show</i>,

51
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:54,900
Kurtwood Smith.

52
00:01:54,968 --> 00:01:56,235
How's it going, Kurtwood?

53
00:01:56,302 --> 00:01:58,037
Good. Thanks for having me.

54
00:02:01,107 --> 00:02:03,842
Quagmire, it's so awesome that you
could come over after work today.

55
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,044
I know.
I'm so psyched.

56
00:02:05,111 --> 00:02:06,111
Hey, let's make
some Kool Aid!

57
00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:08,213
No, we got to wait
for Lois to do it.

58
00:02:08,281 --> 00:02:10,049
No, we don't...
I know how to make Kool Aid.

59
00:02:10,116 --> 00:02:11,884
No, Quagmire!
We're not a'sposed to...

60
00:02:13,153 --> 00:02:15,654
I'm home, Peter!

61
00:02:15,722 --> 00:02:18,190
Oh, hi, Glenn...

62
00:02:18,258 --> 00:02:20,225
Peter, can you
help me with the...

63
00:02:20,293 --> 00:02:22,494
Oh, Peter Griffin!

64
00:02:22,562 --> 00:02:25,431
Peter, you come out here right
now and clean up this mess!

65
00:02:25,498 --> 00:02:27,733
No! You said I could
have two friends over,

66
00:02:27,801 --> 00:02:29,234
and I didn't...
Joe couldn't come!

67
00:02:29,302 --> 00:02:30,936
So I only had
one friend over,

68
00:02:31,004 --> 00:02:32,705
and it was just
me and Quagmire,

69
00:02:32,772 --> 00:02:34,740
and I said we could
make Kool Aid

70
00:02:34,808 --> 00:02:35,974
instead of the
other friend!

71
00:02:36,042 --> 00:02:37,743
You come out here right now!

72
00:02:37,811 --> 00:02:39,244
Bonnie's way
cooler than you!

73
00:02:39,312 --> 00:02:40,913
Joe has
computer games!

74
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,951
Peter, it took me
a half hour

75
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:47,820
to clean up
all that Kool Aid.

76
00:02:47,887 --> 00:02:50,489
I am sick as hell of you
constantly making a mess

77
00:02:50,557 --> 00:02:52,825
of this house and having
to clean up after you.

78
00:02:52,892 --> 00:02:54,326
So I hired a maid.

79
00:02:54,394 --> 00:02:56,161
What, are you nuts? We don't
have the money for that.

80
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:58,097
Oh, really? And what about
the PeterCopter?

81
00:02:58,164 --> 00:03:00,466
Did we not have money
for the PeterCopter?

82
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:02,634
Hey, did I say anything
when you bought that iron?

83
00:03:02,702 --> 00:03:04,937
Whatever. I want you
to meet Consuela.

84
00:03:06,272 --> 00:03:08,607
Consuela,
this is my husband, Peter,

85
00:03:08,675 --> 00:03:10,075
and these are
our children.

86
00:03:10,143 --> 00:03:12,144
Oh. Hello, Mr. Peter.

87
00:03:12,212 --> 00:03:14,413
Hello, Mr. Children.

88
00:03:14,481 --> 00:03:17,116
Consuela's gonna be
our new housekeeper.

89
00:03:17,183 --> 00:03:19,485
Why is she wearing makeup
like she's going out?

90
00:03:19,552 --> 00:03:21,186
Is this "going out" for them?

91
00:03:24,557 --> 00:03:26,892
Hey, where you going
all dressed up?

92
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,093
Oh, nowhere important.

93
00:03:28,161 --> 00:03:29,862
Just this special dinner
in my honor.

94
00:03:29,929 --> 00:03:31,964
It's being thrown
by the Rhode Island Society

95
00:03:32,031 --> 00:03:33,799
For Special Literary Excellence.

96
00:03:35,101 --> 00:03:36,368
What's that?

97
00:03:36,436 --> 00:03:37,970
Nobody said
anything, Brian.

98
00:03:38,037 --> 00:03:40,639
Oh, I thought someone just
asked why they're honoring me.

99
00:03:40,707 --> 00:03:42,841
- No. Nobody asked that.
- Oh, okay.

100
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:44,276
I... it's no big deal...
it's actually,

101
00:03:44,344 --> 00:03:46,178
it's just you remember
the book I wrote,

102
00:03:46,246 --> 00:03:47,646
<i>Faster Than the Speed of Love</i>?

103
00:03:47,714 --> 00:03:49,114
They loved the
book so much,

104
00:03:49,182 --> 00:03:51,283
they want to give me their
most prestigious award.

105
00:03:51,351 --> 00:03:52,384
Mmm.

106
00:03:52,452 --> 00:03:54,086
Look, this is a
really big deal.

107
00:03:54,154 --> 00:03:56,255
It'd be nice to get some
support around here!

108
00:03:56,322 --> 00:03:58,657
Oh, I'm sorry, Brian.
That's great news!

109
00:03:58,725 --> 00:04:01,426
Yeah, what channel
will the awards ceremony be on?

110
00:04:01,494 --> 00:04:03,228
Oh, are they having
an awards ceremony

111
00:04:03,296 --> 00:04:05,497
for how well you did
the dishes last night?

112
00:04:05,565 --> 00:04:08,333
Ha! You got nothing
going on.

113
00:04:13,273 --> 00:04:14,339
Hi, Brian.

114
00:04:14,407 --> 00:04:16,074
I'm Kathy from
the Book Society.

115
00:04:16,142 --> 00:04:17,576
So glad you could come.

116
00:04:17,644 --> 00:04:19,044
Hi there.
Uh, you know,

117
00:04:19,112 --> 00:04:21,013
I wasn't sure I had
the right address.

118
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,381
Pizza parlor, huh?

119
00:04:22,448 --> 00:04:24,650
Yeah.
The group loves this place.

120
00:04:24,717 --> 00:04:26,852
Oh, hey, this is fine.
I... I like this place.

121
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,520
It's... I'm a...

122
00:04:28,588 --> 00:04:31,924
I'm a pizza dawg.

123
00:04:31,991 --> 00:04:33,826
So, how long have
you been a member

124
00:04:33,893 --> 00:04:35,994
of the Rhode Island Society
For Special Literary Excellence?

125
00:04:36,062 --> 00:04:38,697
Oh, no, I'm not a member;
I'm their chaperone.

126
00:04:38,765 --> 00:04:40,365
- Chaperone?
- Yeah, uh-huh.

127
00:04:40,433 --> 00:04:42,100
We're in that section
right over there.

128
00:04:43,703 --> 00:04:45,370
Hey! There he is!

129
00:04:45,438 --> 00:04:46,905
It's Brian Griffin!

130
00:04:46,973 --> 00:04:48,073
Damn it, Randy!

131
00:04:48,141 --> 00:04:49,975
You just spilled
my juice box!

132
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,414
Oh.

133
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:57,649
They absolutely
love your book.

134
00:04:57,717 --> 00:05:01,086
The simplistic writing style
is very graspable to them.

135
00:05:01,154 --> 00:05:04,489
Here's your award...
I made it all by myself.

136
00:05:04,557 --> 00:05:05,691
Thanks.

137
00:05:05,758 --> 00:05:08,093
Hey, Brian!
Smell my finger!

138
00:05:08,161 --> 00:05:10,495
I... I... I... I already can.

139
00:05:16,035 --> 00:05:19,638
Lois was right...
I'm not a writer, I'm a joke.

140
00:05:19,706 --> 00:05:22,507
I'm one big, fat,
ridiculous joke.

141
00:05:22,575 --> 00:05:25,010
Well, maybe you just didn't
try hard enough, Brian.

142
00:05:25,078 --> 00:05:26,879
You know what,
father from "Family Circus"?

143
00:05:26,946 --> 00:05:28,780
All you do is
judge other people.

144
00:05:28,848 --> 00:05:31,216
Every day in the funnies,
all you do is judge.

145
00:05:31,284 --> 00:05:33,752
Why don't you shut your
(bleep) damn mouth for once

146
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,521
and go home and (bleep)
your wife in the face!

147
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:37,956
You know what?

148
00:05:38,024 --> 00:05:41,093
That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

149
00:05:57,911 --> 00:05:58,844
Ah, almost home.

150
00:05:58,912 --> 00:05:59,845
Oh, my God!

151
00:06:02,382 --> 00:06:05,651
Oh, please be okay,
please be okay, please be okay.

152
00:06:05,718 --> 00:06:07,085
Oh, thank God!

153
00:06:07,153 --> 00:06:08,620
Okay, you're gonna be okay,
you're gonna be o...

154
00:06:08,688 --> 00:06:10,389
Oh, my God!

155
00:06:25,972 --> 00:06:28,173
Oh, my God, yes!

156
00:06:28,241 --> 00:06:30,108
Brian killed a dog!

157
00:06:30,176 --> 00:06:32,144
This is fantastic!

158
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:34,479
Oh, Mr. Swanson is
sleep-dragging again.

159
00:06:34,547 --> 00:06:36,081
I'm flying.

160
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:37,749
I'm flying!

161
00:06:44,116 --> 00:06:46,451
- I clean in here?
- Uh, yeah, that's fine.

162
00:06:46,518 --> 00:06:49,954
I'm just reading the funnies,
so keep it down.

163
00:06:50,022 --> 00:06:52,757
This is a very shocking
"Family Circus."

164
00:06:54,726 --> 00:06:57,995
<i>Es el tiempo para muchos hornos!</i>

165
00:06:58,063 --> 00:06:59,764
<i>Muchos hornos!</i>

172
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:33,698
There you are!

173
00:07:33,765 --> 00:07:35,566
- Uh, what?!
- Well, you're jumpy.

174
00:07:35,634 --> 00:07:37,802
So, did you hear
all that noise last night?

175
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,570
I swear to God,
it sounded like

176
00:07:39,638 --> 00:07:42,173
somebody had an accident
and maybe somebody got hurt.

177
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:44,008
What? Wh... what are
you talking about?

178
00:07:44,076 --> 00:07:45,343
Yeah, something
must've gone down.

179
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,911
The cops were poking around.

180
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:48,679
What do you mean,
like... like Joe?

181
00:07:48,747 --> 00:07:50,848
No. Staties, man,
staties.

182
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:54,352
I wouldn't be surprised if there's
something in the paper about it.

183
00:07:59,925 --> 00:08:01,492
Oh, my God!

184
00:08:05,297 --> 00:08:06,631
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Uh, yes, I'm calling

185
00:08:06,698 --> 00:08:08,266
about the ad in the paper?

186
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,401
<i>You seen my dog?
You callin' about my dog?</i>

187
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:12,870
<i>He's all I got,
'cause I'm a young street tough,</i>

188
00:08:12,938 --> 00:08:14,739
<i>and my parents
ain't so good to me.</i>

189
00:08:14,806 --> 00:08:16,841
So, have you heard anything?

190
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:19,477
Did anybody see anything?
Or anybody?

191
00:08:19,545 --> 00:08:21,179
<i>I can see ol' Reggie now,</i>

192
00:08:21,246 --> 00:08:23,281
<i>sittin' there
with a smile on his face,</i>

193
00:08:23,348 --> 00:08:26,484
<i>listenin' to me talk about how
daddy beats me somethin' fierce.</i>

194
00:08:26,552 --> 00:08:28,986
Okay, so sounds like
no leads, then, right?

195
00:08:29,054 --> 00:08:30,388
Oh, no, no.

196
00:08:30,455 --> 00:08:31,923
- Doggy out.
- What?

197
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,624
- Out. <i>Afuera</i>.
- I live here.

198
00:08:33,692 --> 00:08:35,159
No, no. <i>Afuera</i>.

199
00:08:35,227 --> 00:08:36,127
But, look,
I'm trying...

200
00:08:36,195 --> 00:08:37,528
Aah!

201
00:08:37,596 --> 00:08:39,063
<i>¿Hola?</i>

202
00:08:39,131 --> 00:08:40,665
<i>Yes, could you
please put Brian back on?</i>

203
00:08:40,732 --> 00:08:44,202
No, no. Do... Doggy <i>afuera</i>.

204
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:45,436
<i>You're the new housekeeper,
aren't you?</i>

205
00:08:45,504 --> 00:08:46,671
<i>Si</i>.

206
00:08:46,738 --> 00:08:48,172
<i>Listen, I don't want
to point fingers,</i>

207
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,408
<i>but I'm missing about a thousand
dollars in play money.</i>

208
00:08:50,475 --> 00:08:51,542
I take.

209
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,977
<i>Wha... what... You... you took it?</i>

210
00:08:53,045 --> 00:08:53,945
<i>Si</i>.

211
00:08:54,012 --> 00:08:55,079
<i>Well, give it back!</i>

212
00:08:55,147 --> 00:08:57,181
Come get, bitch.

213
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,519
Hey, Brian, you want to see
what I drew in arts and crafts

214
00:09:01,587 --> 00:09:02,987
at day care?

215
00:09:03,055 --> 00:09:04,989
This is called
"Happy Sun."

216
00:09:05,057 --> 00:09:07,458
This one's called
"Silly Space Man."

217
00:09:07,526 --> 00:09:09,360
See? 'cause he's
in the forest.

218
00:09:09,428 --> 00:09:13,864
And this one I call
"Alive Dog Burying Dead Dog."

219
00:09:13,932 --> 00:09:15,199
This is a photograph!

220
00:09:15,267 --> 00:09:16,200
Oh, is it?

221
00:09:16,268 --> 00:09:17,468
Wait a minute.

222
00:09:17,536 --> 00:09:19,503
- You saw the whole thing?
- Yes, indeed.

223
00:09:19,571 --> 00:09:21,839
Oh, boy,
have I been having some fun

224
00:09:21,907 --> 00:09:23,441
at your expense, old man!

225
00:09:23,508 --> 00:09:25,142
How could you
do that to me?

226
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:28,012
Do you have any idea how
upset I am about all this?

227
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,914
I killed one of my
own kind, Stewie.

228
00:09:29,982 --> 00:09:32,016
How would you feel if
you killed a baby?

229
00:09:32,084 --> 00:09:34,018
Well, I've killed seven,
but the point is,

230
00:09:34,086 --> 00:09:36,921
you might feel better if you just
confess to what you've done.

231
00:09:36,989 --> 00:09:39,590
Maybe you're right.

232
00:09:45,097 --> 00:09:48,599
Everyone, I have something
very important to tell you.

233
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:50,568
Is this about Meg's
cervical cancer?

234
00:09:50,636 --> 00:09:51,769
What?!

235
00:09:51,837 --> 00:09:54,238
You always fall for that!

236
00:09:54,306 --> 00:09:56,307
You can't always fall for that!

237
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,142
You... you just can't!

238
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,577
Go ahead, Brian.

239
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:04,682
Hi, Joe.
Thanks for coming.

240
00:10:06,218 --> 00:10:07,952
Okay, now
that Joe's here,

241
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,421
I can say this
in front of all of you.

242
00:10:10,489 --> 00:10:12,757
Everyone...

243
00:10:12,824 --> 00:10:14,525
I am a criminal.

244
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:16,627
A few nights ago,
I committed a murder.

245
00:10:16,695 --> 00:10:19,730
Then I buried the body
and even went out of my way

246
00:10:19,798 --> 00:10:21,065
to cover up the evidence.

247
00:10:21,133 --> 00:10:22,366
Oh, my God!

248
00:10:22,434 --> 00:10:24,669
These are very serious
charges, Brian.

249
00:10:24,736 --> 00:10:26,437
I know, and that's
why I'm prepared

250
00:10:26,505 --> 00:10:29,607
for you to arrest me and
take me to jail where I belong.

251
00:10:29,675 --> 00:10:31,375
I just couldn't take
the stress anymore.

252
00:10:31,443 --> 00:10:32,710
I had to come clean.

253
00:10:32,778 --> 00:10:34,912
I mean, the truth is,
I didn't even stop

254
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,847
to find out if
he had an owner.

255
00:10:36,915 --> 00:10:38,382
- I just completely...
- Wait, wait, owner?

256
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,618
- What are you talking about?
- I just told you.

257
00:10:40,686 --> 00:10:42,720
I hit and killed a
dog with my car!

258
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:47,992
What?

259
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,827
Brian... It's a dog!

260
00:10:49,895 --> 00:10:51,395
That's not a crime!

261
00:10:51,463 --> 00:10:52,496
What do you mean?

262
00:10:52,564 --> 00:10:53,998
Well... I mean,

263
00:10:54,066 --> 00:10:56,334
it's not like
you killed a person.

264
00:10:56,401 --> 00:10:58,903
Or... or even ran over
somebody's mailbox.

265
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:01,005
Killing a dog
is not a crime?

266
00:11:01,073 --> 00:11:03,808
Of... of course not!

267
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,076
Yeah, especially
for you.

268
00:11:05,143 --> 00:11:06,677
An animal killing
another animal?

269
00:11:06,745 --> 00:11:08,179
That happens
all the time.

270
00:11:10,115 --> 00:11:13,584
Hey, sweet-ass,
last night was fantastic.

271
00:11:13,652 --> 00:11:15,886
Hello? Where'd you go?

272
00:11:24,396 --> 00:11:28,332
Oh. Well, then I guess I
worried for nothing.

273
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,434
Yeah, nobody cares
if a dog gets killed.

274
00:11:32,404 --> 00:11:34,205
I could do it, Brian!
I could do it right now!

275
00:11:34,272 --> 00:11:35,773
Nobody would say a thing!

276
00:11:35,841 --> 00:11:38,342
I could blow your brains out
and they'd throw me a parade!

277
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,111
- What?
- I'm just screwing around, Brian.

278
00:11:40,178 --> 00:11:41,245
Nobody cares.

279
00:11:48,854 --> 00:11:50,187
Peter, what are you doing?

280
00:11:50,255 --> 00:11:51,822
She's still here, Lois.

281
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,958
Wasn't she supposed to leave
like two hours ago?

282
00:11:54,025 --> 00:11:56,527
I thought so.
Go ask her what she's doing.

283
00:11:56,595 --> 00:11:58,229
I'm not asking her.
You go ask her.

284
00:12:00,198 --> 00:12:03,834
Uh, Consuela? I thought you
finished cleaning hours ago.

285
00:12:03,902 --> 00:12:05,269
Yeah, what are
you still doing here?

286
00:12:05,337 --> 00:12:07,304
I wait for rain to stop.

287
00:12:07,372 --> 00:12:09,006
It's time for
you to go home.

288
00:12:09,074 --> 00:12:11,242
Is too much rain. I stay.

289
00:12:11,309 --> 00:12:12,777
But it's gonna
rain all night.

290
00:12:12,844 --> 00:12:14,311
I sleep here.

291
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:15,946
Uh, I don't know about that.

292
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:17,415
I sleep here.

293
00:12:19,718 --> 00:12:21,952
Can I get some
covers over here?

294
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:25,923
No. No. You fat
keep you warm.

295
00:12:32,798 --> 00:12:34,732
No, no...

296
00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:46,644
You know, Brian, I love it
here at the ice cream shop.

297
00:12:46,711 --> 00:12:48,712
In fact, this is gonna
be my happy place.

298
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,048
If I ever get molested or raped,
this is the place

299
00:12:51,116 --> 00:12:52,817
I'm gonna think of to make
everything all right.

300
00:12:52,884 --> 00:12:53,851
That's great, Stewie.

301
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:55,553
Hey, what's up your fanny?

302
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,422
Nothing. I'm just... I'm a little
bummed out from the other day.

303
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:01,592
I just can't believe
our society actually values

304
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,595
the life of a dog less than that
of a human. It's infuriating.

305
00:13:04,663 --> 00:13:06,864
That is infuriating.
Maybe you should go bark

306
00:13:06,932 --> 00:13:09,366
at a tree and chew on
your balls for an hour.

307
00:13:09,434 --> 00:13:11,569
You know, that's the problem.
That's usually the way I'd

308
00:13:11,636 --> 00:13:13,404
handle this kind of thing,
but not this time.

309
00:13:13,472 --> 00:13:14,972
I mean, look at
that dog over there.

310
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,107
You think he wants to be tied
to that chair,

311
00:13:17,175 --> 00:13:19,477
waiting in the hot sun while his
owner gets ice cream?

312
00:13:19,544 --> 00:13:21,812
Hell, no! I am gonna
make people see

313
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,949
that an animal's life is just
as important as a human's!

314
00:13:26,485 --> 00:13:29,720
Go, fellow canine,
be free and enjoy life!

315
00:13:31,256 --> 00:13:32,790
Oh, my God!
Help! Help!

316
00:13:32,858 --> 00:13:35,526
It's killing my dog!

317
00:13:35,594 --> 00:13:38,028
He's got my neck!

318
00:13:44,736 --> 00:13:48,973
Oh, my God! My dog is dead!

319
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,542
Maybe that's why
he was tied up.

320
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:57,987
Meg, will you take one of these
and pass it down, please?

321
00:13:58,055 --> 00:14:00,356
- What's this?
- I'm starting a new advocacy group.

322
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:02,725
The Quahog Animal
Equal Rights League.

323
00:14:02,793 --> 00:14:04,327
Our first meeting
is tomorrow night,

324
00:14:04,394 --> 00:14:06,095
and I'd really
appreciate it if you guys

325
00:14:06,163 --> 00:14:07,463
would come and
show your support.

326
00:14:07,531 --> 00:14:10,299
Well, of course we will, Brian.
We'd be happy to come.

327
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:12,134
Terrific. See, I thought I'd
start locally,

328
00:14:12,202 --> 00:14:14,737
and then maybe try to merge
with one of the larger groups.

329
00:14:14,805 --> 00:14:18,040
Oh, that's a great idea, Brian.
Maybe you could join PETA.

330
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:19,108
Join me for what?

331
00:14:19,176 --> 00:14:20,776
No, PETA.
The organization.

332
00:14:20,844 --> 00:14:21,811
What organization?

333
00:14:21,878 --> 00:14:23,179
- PETA.
- What?

334
00:14:23,246 --> 00:14:24,847
PETA is an acronym, Peter.

335
00:14:24,915 --> 00:14:26,148
No, I'm not! I'm Catholic!

336
00:14:26,216 --> 00:14:27,616
Are we really doing this?

337
00:14:27,684 --> 00:14:30,486
No, Peter, I'm just saying,
maybe if this meeting goes well,

338
00:14:30,554 --> 00:14:32,488
Brian could be part
of a PETA rally.

339
00:14:32,556 --> 00:14:33,956
Somebody's having
a rally for me now?

340
00:14:34,024 --> 00:14:34,990
No, for PETA.

341
00:14:35,058 --> 00:14:36,559
That's me! I'm Peter!

342
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:40,029
I'm not talking about you, Peter!
I'm talking about PETA!

343
00:14:40,097 --> 00:14:42,531
Somebody better have something
to say to me pretty damn soon,

344
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:44,367
or I'm gonna have something
to say to them!

345
00:14:44,434 --> 00:14:46,535
I am very busy!

346
00:14:46,603 --> 00:14:48,170
I think Betty White
is in PETA.

347
00:14:48,238 --> 00:14:50,139
That doesn't even
make any sense!

348
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,447
Oh. Hi, Consuela.

349
00:14:58,515 --> 00:15:00,349
Hello, Mr. Peter.

350
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:04,987
No school today,
so I bring my nephew, Mikey.

351
00:15:05,055 --> 00:15:06,889
You want to buy
light-up yo-yo?

352
00:15:06,957 --> 00:15:09,058
Well... kinda.

353
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,462
That's it. Peter,
we have got to get rid of her.

354
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,898
I couldn't agree more.
Just let me see if Mikey sells

355
00:15:15,966 --> 00:15:18,634
those things with batteries or
what the situation is there.

356
00:15:20,537 --> 00:15:23,773
Consuela, I'm sorry.
But this is not working out.

357
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,574
We're asking you to go.

358
00:15:25,642 --> 00:15:28,411
No, I stay. I clean.

359
00:15:28,478 --> 00:15:29,812
You don't understand.
You're fired.

360
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,514
No, I keep job.

361
00:15:31,581 --> 00:15:34,450
Here. Here's $40
if you leave right now.

362
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:36,485
No. I stay.

363
00:15:37,754 --> 00:15:39,989
God, she's more stubborn
than you are.

364
00:15:40,056 --> 00:15:42,291
Daddy, I want a turn
on the swing set.

365
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:43,426
No.

366
00:15:43,493 --> 00:15:44,760
But you've gone
for two turns.

367
00:15:44,828 --> 00:15:45,995
Get lost.

368
00:15:46,062 --> 00:15:47,963
It looks like fun,
and I want to do it.

369
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:50,733
No, I'm doing it.
I'm gonna do a big jump-off.

370
00:15:51,935 --> 00:15:53,969
Aaa! Get Mom!

371
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,172
Mom! Mom! Mom!

372
00:15:59,843 --> 00:16:02,344
Good evening, everyone.
I want to thank you all

373
00:16:02,412 --> 00:16:04,346
for joining me at this
very important event.

374
00:16:04,414 --> 00:16:07,082
Animals are treated
as second-class citizens

375
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,884
everywhere throughout
this nation.

376
00:16:08,952 --> 00:16:12,421
We kill them for food,
we humiliate them as pets,

377
00:16:12,489 --> 00:16:14,924
and we use them for
medical and cosmetic research.

378
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:16,225
Take a look.

Wow. Inspiring stuff.

399
00:17:15,385 --> 00:17:18,220
Now underneath each one of your
chairs you'll find a pamphlet

400
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,789
with a simple list of animal
rights do's and don't's.

401
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,326
Wait a minute, I'm not allowed
to have steak?

402
00:17:24,394 --> 00:17:26,695
Well, no. Steak is made by
killing cattle.

403
00:17:26,763 --> 00:17:28,430
No medical research?

404
00:17:28,498 --> 00:17:31,300
But how are we supposed to find
cures for disease?

405
00:17:31,368 --> 00:17:33,502
Well, there are many more
promising research methods

406
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,504
for curing disease
than animal testing.

407
00:17:35,572 --> 00:17:36,505
Name one.

408
00:17:36,573 --> 00:17:37,606
I want a hamburger.

409
00:17:37,674 --> 00:17:39,074
I have a sudden
craving for quail.

410
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:40,910
No, no,
you're missing the point.

411
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,945
We've got to change our
way of thinking.

412
00:17:43,013 --> 00:17:45,548
Animals are miracles of nature,
just like humans.

413
00:17:45,615 --> 00:17:47,583
But our society
hasn't figured that out.

414
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:49,718
Do you know that
in some Asian countries

415
00:17:49,786 --> 00:17:51,420
they actually cook and eat dogs?

416
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:54,023
What?! Oh no!

417
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,991
Are they... are they good?

418
00:17:56,059 --> 00:17:57,793
Yeah, I wonder
what they taste like.

419
00:17:57,861 --> 00:18:00,429
I would try it... I mean,
if everybody else was.

420
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:02,364
I'm adventurous.

421
00:18:02,432 --> 00:18:04,199
You know what, you know what?
This is driving me crazy.

422
00:18:04,267 --> 00:18:05,501
I wanna eat a dog now.

423
00:18:05,569 --> 00:18:07,169
I say we eat that one!

424
00:18:07,237 --> 00:18:07,736
What?!

425
00:18:07,804 --> 00:18:08,637
Get him!

426
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:20,916
What the hell is this?

427
00:18:20,984 --> 00:18:23,419
Nobody gives a damn
about animals!

428
00:18:23,486 --> 00:18:27,022
I just never realized how
little meaning my life had!

429
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:29,458
Stewie, my life
isn't worth anything!

430
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:32,828
Oh, come on... Hey...

431
00:18:41,638 --> 00:18:45,074
Don't worry, Rupert. I know how
to get him out of his funk.

432
00:18:45,141 --> 00:18:47,710
Poor bastard's more upset
than I was when I read

433
00:18:47,777 --> 00:18:50,446
<i>Curious George Goes to

434
00:18:50,513 --> 00:18:53,816
Monkeys aren't supposed to drink
chardonnay! He's tricking you!

435
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,451
Get out of there!

436
00:18:57,854 --> 00:19:02,024
<i>Abogados! Cinco cinco cinco,

439
00:19:07,797 --> 00:19:11,100
Uh, Consuela, does this rag
smell like chloroform?

440
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:13,302
No, no, is no...

441
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:23,212
I need more Lemon Pledge.

442
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:24,313
Okay.

443
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,420
Is this the Griffin household?

444
00:19:31,488 --> 00:19:32,755
Yes...

445
00:19:32,822 --> 00:19:34,790
There was a fire at
Quahog Liquor last night.

446
00:19:34,858 --> 00:19:36,191
No people were killed,

447
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,594
but the burned body of
a dog was found inside.

448
00:19:38,662 --> 00:19:40,596
The tag on the collar
says he lived here.

449
00:19:40,664 --> 00:19:41,864
I'm sorry.

450
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,833
Oh, my God! Brian!

451
00:19:44,901 --> 00:19:47,002
What the hell happened?

452
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,672
Brian's dead!

453
00:19:51,074 --> 00:19:54,009
Hey, come here. Got something
you'll wanna see.

454
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:02,117
I can't believe
Brian's dead.

455
00:20:02,185 --> 00:20:07,322
My best friend in the whole
world... and he's gone.

456
00:20:09,693 --> 00:20:13,328
You know, Peter, I think
he was also my best friend.

457
00:20:13,396 --> 00:20:15,798
he was the smartest
person I knew.

458
00:20:15,865 --> 00:20:18,367
Nothing will ever
be the same again.

459
00:20:22,505 --> 00:20:25,774
Wow. I guess my life
does have meaning.

460
00:20:25,842 --> 00:20:29,478
I never realized how
important I was to this family.

461
00:20:29,546 --> 00:20:31,747
Wait a second. Just to
prove a point to me,

462
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:34,583
you burned down a liquor store
and murdered a dog?!

463
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,652
Well, a stray.

464
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,986
Thank you.

465
00:20:38,054 --> 00:20:40,022
Well, I guess we should tell
them the truth now.

466
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,490
Well, hold...
Hold on a sec.

467
00:20:41,558 --> 00:20:44,493
We could... Probably let 'em go

00:20:51,901 --> 00:20:55,070
Hi, we here at <i>Family Guy</i>
want you to know that we respect

469
00:20:55,138 --> 00:20:57,506
all living beings and
assure you that no animals

470
00:20:57,574 --> 00:20:59,842
were harmed in
the making of this episode.

471
00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:01,610
But we're about to hurt
the feelings

00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:03,212
of this Italian opera singer

473
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:05,948
by prematurely dropping
the curtain on his performance.

474
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,317

figaro mi, figaro... ♪</i>
