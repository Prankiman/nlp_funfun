1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,700
We now return to
"Little House on the Prairie".

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,500
Mary, you're doing great with your Braille.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,000
I couldn't have done it without you, Pa.

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,800
Why don't you go up to bed
and get some sleep, honey?

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,100
Sh.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,400
Honey! Honey, you remember
where the stool was.

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,600
Oh, Mary, Mary. You're in the kitchen.
You're all disoriented. Let me help you.

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,300
- The ladder's right here.
- Thanks, Pa.

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,600
Jeez, life was a lot tougher back then.

10
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,600
It seems today that all you see

11
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,000
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

12
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,600
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

13
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,100
On which we used to rely?

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,000
Lucky there's a family guy

15
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,100
Lucky there's a man who positively
can do all the things that make us

16
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,700
Laugh and cry

17
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,800
He's a family guy

18
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,300
Listen up. It's time for spring-cleaning.

19
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,600
Spring-cleaning? Oh, not again!

20
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,200
That was weird.
That was weird, too.

21
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,800
If we all pitch in, we'll be done in no time.

22
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,600
You know I swore I'd never clean again. Not
after Bounty dropped me as their spokesman.

23
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,700
Wait a second. Rosie, I've just poured this
glass of warm yellow liquid on the counter,

24
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,100
and you say that Bounty
can pick it up in five seconds?

25
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,500
- What is this? Is that...?
- Four seconds.

26
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,200
- It smells like...
- Clean my pee!

27
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,400
Mom, I can't clean. I got stuff to do.

28
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,400
Sweetheart, we all know
you don't have any stuff to do.

29
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,300
I don't wanna hear any more
excuses from anyone.

30
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,900
Ah, crap!

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We did it again.

32
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,300
Ruth Bader Ginsberg.

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,100
Ooh!

34
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,800
Oh, look, Meg. It's your little baby booties.

35
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,200
Oh, and your little bronzed hat.
And your tail.

36
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,700
- My what?!
- Nothing.

37
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,400
OK. Lois's list says clean the windows,
clear the gutters and wash the siding.

38
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,500
To most folks, that's three chores.

39
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,800
To Peter Griffin and his big hose, it's one.

40
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,300
You're not workin' hard, Peter.
You're workin' smart.

41
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,900
Hey, Chris, gimme the juice.

42
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,700
Peter, there's water and glass and...
It's a disaster in here!

43
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,300
Well, Lois, why don't you put down your
ginger ale and Redbook and get to work?

44
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,600
Lazy.

45
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,900
You're not helping. Look, don't come
near the house. Go do somethin' else.

46
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,500
- Son, this duffel bag is only half zipped.
- Where you goin'?

47
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,200
I'm goin' campin' for the weekend with
Johnny Cut-Corners. Want to come along?

48
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,800
Hm. It would be nice to get out of the house.

49
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,400
This is the time of the month
when Loretta's visited by her Aunt Flo.

50
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,400
Loretta likes to personify
her menses in humorous ways.

51
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,400
Hey, Quagmire, you up for some campin'?

52
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,400
Sorry, bud. The only tent
I'm pitchin' this weekend is...

53
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,500
Well, you see where I'm goin' with this. Oh!

54
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,700
I wanna go. It'll get me away from
the evil monkey that lives in my closet.

55
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,500
Monkey in the closet!

56
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,400
This is gonna be great.

57
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,900
My last male bonding was when
me and Cleveland went to Chinatown.

58
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,800
Look, forget how it happened.
Can you just get us outta this?

59
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,200
I say, Rupert, this paste is quite delicious.

60
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,300
It's almost worth the bowel obstruction.

61
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,200
Are those my books?
What the hell are you doing?

62
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:13,000
Papier-mâché. I used them to make the
houseboat from Surfside Six.  You remember.

63
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,000
Surfside Six

64
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,200
Who lives there?

65
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,000
Surfside Six

66
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,500
Young bachelors.

67
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,300
In Miami Beach

68
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,800
Those are my first editions. You little punk!

69
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,800
Momma, doggy's scary.

70
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:31,100
Brian, have you lost your mind? He's just
a baby. He doesn't know what he's doing.

71
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,100
- This isn't over.
- If you're looking for your Dostoevsky,

72
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,200
I used it to make the fort from F Troop.

73
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,800
Look what I found, Stewie.
An appointment card. You've got a checkup.

74
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,800
Marvellous. A quick weigh-in, stick out your
tongue, and a nice lollipop to cap it all off.

75
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,200
Remind me to ask the doctor
when my other testicle will descend.

76
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,500
Bang! I'm Daniel Boone.
I'm a man. I'm a big man.

77
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,400
Bang! Bang!

78
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,000
Now I'm Pat Boone. Gonna have
a Christmas special with Andy Williams.

79
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,400
Ah, so beautiful.

80
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,200
It's almost as if this world
was created especially for me.

81
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,900
- You think he's onto us, Christof?
- No. He's an idiot.

82
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,000
I dug the latrine 50 feet out.

83
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,300
Great. You want a cookie whenever you
do somethin' right? Get some firewood.

84
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,900
- Yes, sir!
- He's gonna grow up to be quite a man.

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,900
Hmm. That was incredible, Kevin.

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,200
- I'm not here to impress you. Am I, Dad?
- Did I say you could rest yet?

87
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,600
I'm Abe Lincoln. I just chopped some wood.

88
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:44,600
Good for you, son. Hey, where's Chris?
I asked him to fill the canteens an hour ago.

89
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,100
Hey, Dad, look!

90
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,100
I covered my back with honey,
and now the ants are takin' me home.

91
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,600
He does that at home
with Velveeta and cockroaches.

92
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,500
If you turn the light on,
they slam him into the fridge.

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,200
Oh, great! Mirabella.

94
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,300
December's Mirabella!

95
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,900
What's your story?
Get lost on the way to the morgue?

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,800
Seriously, is that yours?
Because if it is, bravo!

97
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,200
You remember that short-lived sitcom Fish?

98
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,300
They should have put that on before CHiPs.
The marketing practically writes itself.

99
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,400
Let's go, Chris. Your dinner won't catch itself.

100
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,100
I don't wanna go.
I had a bad experience with a fish once.

101
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,900
Oh, my God! My fish is gone!

102
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,200
And he robbed me!

103
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,300
- OK. See you, Chris.
- This is none of my business,

104
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,900
but you're turning your boy into a slacker.

105
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,100
How dare you call
my parenting into question?!

106
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,300
If you were a woman, I'd slug you.

107
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,800
You should teach him some responsibility.

108
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,000
I'll show you responsibility.

109
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,600
Chris, you are responsible for
guarding the camp while we fish.

110
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,100
You got it, Dad. You can count on me to...

111
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,000
Chris, pay attention. I want you to...

112
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,200
All right, take a deep breath.

113
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,800
It's cold. Cold!

114
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,500
OK. I'm fine. I'm fine.

115
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,700
Tell me, Dr Hartman,
do all the children fall in love with you?

116
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,400
It's cold! It's cold.

117
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,200
Hm. 29Ib. That's big for your age.

118
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:29,500
Forgive me for not being one of those
anorexic babies from the diaper commercials.

119
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,400
- Time for your immunisations.
- You might wanna hold him.

120
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,600
Hold me for what?

121
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,300
- What the deuce?
- Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.

122
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,500
Back off! Don't come
any closer or I'll cut her.

123
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,500
I... I'll give her...

124
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,000
I'll give her a series
of splinters that could, um...

125
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,600
you know, become infected.

126
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,800
Look, Stewie. Look at the dancin' kitty.

127
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,000
Oh, no! I'll not be taken in by one of your...

128
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,200
Oh, my! That's delightful, isn't it?
What's your name?

129
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,200
Argh! Oh, God!

130
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,400
They call this the "magic hour":

131
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,600
the day's not quite gone,
but the night's not quite here,

132
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,300
and somewhere, Scott Baio
is ploughin' a woman he doesn't love.

133
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,400
I got one, Dad!

134
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,800
Looks like that's the one that got away.

135
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,200
The hell it is! You get in there
and you kick that fish's ass!

136
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,200
God, I love him.

137
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,600
I can't believe how terrible the fishin' was.

138
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,800
Yeah. All we caught was a tyre, a boot,
a tin can and this book of clichés.

139
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,900
Well, thank God we came prepared.
We brought enough food to last us...

140
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,500
Holy crap, Chris. What the hell?
I put you in charge of the food.

141
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,700
The raccoons were here. See?

142
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,500
"We're a bunch of sneaky animals."

143
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,800
"We're gonna wreck this food
and eat it, cos we're naughty!"

144
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:56,000
"And then there's a guy. Let's get him
in trouble with his dad! Ha ha ha!"

145
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,200
Somehow, I'm less than surprised.

146
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,800
I'm sorry, Dad. I messed up the entire trip.

147
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,900
It's not your fault, Chris.
I failed you as a father.

148
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,600
From now on, Joe will be your father.

149
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,400
Cleveland?

150
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,700
I'll teach the boy. Come, my son.
I'll show you the ways of the herd...

151
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,400
Oh, crap.

152
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,200
Why are you sittin' with
the sheets over your head?

153
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,400
- Peter, what's wrong?
- Huh. That obvious?

154
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,300
Well, you always do the skull gag
when you're depressed. Talk to me.

155
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,100
Well, it's just... I've been tryin' to teach
Chris how to be a man, you know?

156
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,600
First I tried teachin' him how to eat an Oreo.

157
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,800
Chris, the way to eat an Oreo
is to twist it, pull it apart and lick it.

158
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,900
Now you.

159
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,300
Then I tried teachin' him
how to get out of payin' a check.

160
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,100
Uh, waiter? There's a dead guy in my soup.

161
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,900
Oh, terribly sorry, sir. Your soup is gratis.

162
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Thank you.

163
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,000
Now your turn.

164
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,100
Waiter, there's a dead guy in my...

165
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,700
Peter, you can't force-feed maturity.
He needs to learn it on his own.

166
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,200
- Why don't you get him a job or somethin'?
- Whoa. Freeze-fame.

167
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,200
That's it! I can teach Chris
responsibility by gettin' him a job.

168
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,100
Isn't she great?
Now you see why I married her.

169
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,000
Go away now. I'm gonna do stuff to her.

170
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,200
I'm sorry Stewie ruined your books.
Here, I brought you some of Peter's.

171
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,100
Mr T by Mr T.

172
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,400
Tand Me by George Peppard.

173
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,800
For the Last Time, I'm not Mr T
by Ving Rhames.

174
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,700
Eurgh!

175
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,600
Oh, Stewie, are you OK?

176
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,700
Must we make small talk every time we pass?

177
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,000
Oh, you're burnin' up. Must be a reaction to
the shots. I'll go get you some baby aspirin.

178
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,600
What are you talking about? You said the
shots were supposed to make me healthy.

179
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,200
You actually believe Lois
had them inject you to make you healthy?

180
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,400
- I mean, you were already healthy.
- Oh, God! You're right.

181
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,800
I was pink as a pistol.

182
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:24,200
Pink as a pistol?! Good Lord!
I can't even form a cogent simile any more.

183
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,900
- What was in those needles?
- I've already said too much.

184
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,600
I should have known.
Her treachery knows no limits. I...

185
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,300
Oh, my. Getting dizzy.

186
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,000
Oh, fight it, Stewie!
"Do not go gentle into that good night."

187
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,000
To quote Bob Dylan.

188
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,200
No, no. Dylan Thomas.

189
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,700
Boys, I'm a miracle worker.
I have used all my parenting skills

190
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,500
to change my son from
a lazy slacker into a workin' man.

191
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,300
- Nice goin', Peter.
- Yeah. Up yours.

192
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,400
- What?
- Thanks. Hey, Chris.

193
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,900
Hey, Dad. I'm workin'. I'm wor...

194
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,800
- Oh!
- Careful. You don't get dental for 60 days.

195
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:10,000
Hey, you that Griffin boy's father?
Paddy Tanninger, the caddy manager.

196
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,800
Yeah, it rhymes. Big whoop.
Wanna fight about it?

197
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,000
Listen, your son is
the best ball-shagger we ever had.

198
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,000
I sold twice as many buckets today
cos everybody wants to hit the fat kid.

199
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,700
Lynne, cancel my meetings.
I gotta hit more balls at this fat kid.

200
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,300
- Peter, do you mind if Kevin and I...?
- Nail Chris? He'd be thrilled.

201
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,300
Hey, this kid here
just knocked the ball 300 yards.

202
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,300
I'm Tiger Woods. I'm Tiger Woods. Weeee!

203
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,900
Cleveland, your kid's a natural.
With help, he could be a pro.

204
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,800
Oh, Peter, I can't make
Cleveland Junior sit still for anything.

205
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,400
Sometimes I wonder if he's got the epilepsy.

206
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,200
But then I just go see what's on the TV.

207
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,300
Well, maybe you're not
as good a father as me, huh?

208
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:00,000
Look what I did with Chris.
I'm better than that dad on Lost in Space.

209
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,700
We need more information
about this new planet.

210
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,800
Don, you take my 16- year-old blonde
daughter out in the chariot for the day.

211
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,000
Penny, you stay here with me. And Will?

212
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,700
You and the robot go out into the wilderness
and take this mincing paedophile with you.

213
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,400
Cleveland Junior's beyond your skills.
He won't respond to you.

214
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,400
Oh, yeah? Hey. Hey, come here,
Cleveland Junior. Come to Peter.

215
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,200
- Over here, Junior.
- Come on.

216
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,300
- Come on, Cleveland Junior.
- Come to Peter.

217
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,600
Huh? You'll see. I'm gonna turn this kid
into the greatest golfer ever.

218
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,200
Fine.

219
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,200
- How'd you get him to come?
- With this.

220
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,000
Oh.

221
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,200
- Love.
- Jealousy.

222
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,400
- Touch.
- Forever.

223
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,000
- Intense.
- Passion.

224
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,100
Obsession. Calvin Klein.

225
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:48,200
Drink this, honey. It'll bring your fever down.
I'm gonna go run you a cool bath.

226
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,500
She's one of them. I'm sure of it.
Tell me what they injected me with!

227
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,900
Huh! You know Mr T always
wanted to be a Broadway dancer?

228
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,200
Answer me! What have they done to me?

229
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,100
It could be any number of things.
Gene manipulation, sterilisation...

230
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,200
- Not my seed!
- But from the look of your pupils,

231
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,900
I'd say it's some kind of mind-control serum.

232
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,600
Or not.

233
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,300
Mind control? But I feel so lucid.

234
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,300
You look spot-on to me.
Thank you. I try to work out.

235
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,800
But who has the time?
Besides trophy wives.

236
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,600
Yes. That's rich.

237
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,500
Agh!

238
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,500
Didn't wanna be a mean guy.
Wanna be a dancer.

239
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,400
Go away! Agh!

240
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,400
- You!
- I am taking your brain.

241
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,400
You are now my slave.

242
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,200
No!

243
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,000
Agh!

244
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:06,000
- Why is he freaking out like that?
- He's having an hallucination from the fever.

245
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,200
Like when you were three,
and you ate those adult brownies

246
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,900
I was saving for the Doobie Brothers concert.

247
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,900
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Ee! Ah-oh!

248
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,700
I'm gonna be on a cereal box.

249
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,000
Honeycomb big, yeah yeah yeah

250
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,000
It's not small, no no no

251
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,900
Pay attention, Junior. You wanna keep
your shoulders straight and your knees bent.

252
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,700
And, uh... just once, for me,

253
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,200
would you call me Mr Drummond?

254
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,500
Hey, Griffin. Down here.

255
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,800
Yeah, a secret tunnel, like Hogan's Heroes.
Big whoop. Wanna fight about it?

256
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,400
Look, here's your first week's pay.

257
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,100
All right, Chris!

258
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,000
- Dad! Dad, look!
- That's great, Chris.

259
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,800
But I'm tryin' to be a good father here.
I'm real proud of you, champ.

260
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,200
- Let's go get a milkshake.
- You got it, Mr Drummond.

261
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,200
Package for Glen Quagmire.

262
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,300
Oh, excuse me.

263
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,700
I got a package for you, too. All right.

264
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,500
Nice try, but I built up an immunity.

265
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,700
- Hey, what's wrong, kid?
- My dad doesn't care about me any more.

266
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,800
Oh. Well, at least you have a dad. When I
was growin' up, it was just me and my mom.

267
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,200
Wah! Wah! Wah!

268
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,600
- Oh, looks like somebody's hungry.
- Wah! Wah!

269
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,400
All right!

270
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,200
I just wanted him to be proud of me.
I even got a job.

271
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,500
Well, there's your problem.
Jobs are for suckers.

272
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,400
You need to learn how
to have a good time. Come on.

273
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,300
- Go ahead, kid. Try it out.
- Um, excuse me.

274
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,400
You dropped something.

275
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,300
My jaw. Ha ha ha ha.

276
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,200
All right.

277
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,600
Nice goin'.

278
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,700
All right.

279
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,100
Oh!

280
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,000
Ohhh!

281
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,600
Ew!

282
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,200
I don't think I like feet as much as you do.

283
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:42,200
Hey, everybody likes feet.
C'mon, the party's just startin'.

284
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,300
I'm gonna grab my girl
and head to the beach

285
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,600
Hic-a-doo-La!

286
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,200
We're gonna all hang ten and maybe then

287
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,800
Hic-a-doo-La!

288
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,000
Cos I'm a hic-a-doo-La boy
And I'm a hic-a-doo-La girl

289
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,000
And together it is a hic-a-doo-La world

290
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,400
Hic-a-doo-La!

291
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,300
Mr Quagmire,
what does "hic-a-doo-La" mean?

292
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,500
What does "hic-a-doo-La" mean?

293
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,200
Hic-a-doo-La's that feeling when
you hold hands with your best gal.

294
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,700
- It's cheerin' for the home team.
- It's catchin' the perfect wave.

295
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,000
It's obeying all the rules.

296
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,200
No way!

297
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,600
Hey, are we in Tiananmen?
Because I see a square.

298
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,400
Hic-a-doo-La!

299
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,000
- Hey, great shot, Cleveland Junior.
- Thanks, Mr Drummond.

300
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:44,100
Listen, for today, can you switch
and call me Mr Papadapolis?

301
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,600
- You got it.
- Would you hate me if I called you Webster?

302
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,300
- That's a lie.
- OK. Sorry.

303
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,400
Hi. Tom Tucker, local news anchor.
And on my days off, a golf enthusiast.

304
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,600
The club's having a man-boy tournament.
You should enter.

305
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,400
A tournament, eh?

306
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,800
That gives me an idea.
Come on. I'll explain in the car.

307
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:07,400
This is the perfect way to show what a great
father figure I've been to Cleveland Junior.

308
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,200
I'll do it!

309
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,100
- Where shall we sit?
- That's not up to me, kid.

310
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,700
I follow the old divining rod. Whoa!

311
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,900
Whoa-ho!

312
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,800
- How old are you?
- Old enough to know you're a whore.

313
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,700
Whoa!

314
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,600
Whoa ho-ho!

315
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,000
Whoa ho-ho-ho ho-ho!

316
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,000
Come on, talk to me, sweetie.
You look a little down.

317
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:50,100
I always thought I'd go to my first nudie bar
with my dad. He doesn't have time for me.

318
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,600
Well, sweetie, part of growing up
is learning that adults aren't perfect.

319
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,700
- Your dad deserves another chance.
- Wow! You are smart.

320
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,100
All right.

321
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,800
Oh, no. No, it's not all right.
I'm outta cash. You take bank cards?

322
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,600
Sure.

323
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,300
Can I get stamps, too?

324
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,800
We are at the 17th hole, where Peter Griffin
and Cleveland Junior are five strokes ahead,

325
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,300
making victory all but a certainty.

326
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,000
I said I could mould
your son into a champion.

327
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:31,900
This is gonna be my greatest victory ever.
Except for the time I defeated my evil twin.

328
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,600
Not me, Lois. Shoot him. I'm the real Peter.

329
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,400
- I don't know.
- Lois, look at me.

330
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,100
You know your own husband, don't you?

331
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,700
Thank God!
You made the right choice, honey.

332
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,700
- What was that?
- Nothing.

333
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:56,700
One more hole, and that man-boy trophy
is ours. Here you go, little buddy.

334
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,200
Hey, look at me. I'm Pelé. I'm Pelé.

335
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,200
Goal!

336
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,400
Where the hell's he goin'?

337
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,900
He's gone. Maybe you better
stick to lookin' after your own son.

338
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,600
Oh, my God!

339
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,900
- Is she dead?
- She's still alive...

340
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,800
No, that did it.

341
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,000
