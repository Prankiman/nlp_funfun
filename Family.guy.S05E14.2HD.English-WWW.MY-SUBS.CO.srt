00:00:36,127 --> 00:00:38,524
I just don't think
you're being fair, Tyra.

4
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,483
You don't know what it's like
to grow up the way I grew up.

5
00:00:41,484 --> 00:00:45,196
You know what? How dare you?!
You don't know me.

6
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:49,122
You have no idea where
I come from, where I've been,

7
00:00:49,155 --> 00:00:51,269
how long I've been there,

8
00:00:51,308 --> 00:00:56,790
what I had to do to get from
where I was to where I am now!

9
00:01:03,713 --> 00:01:05,746
- Hey there, Mort.
- Hi, Lois.

10
00:01:05,764 --> 00:01:08,573
Neil's doing a report
on Christianity at school.

11
00:01:08,598 --> 00:01:11,013
Do you have any crucifixes I can borrow?

12
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,260
Preferably one without
the little fellow on it?

13
00:01:13,278 --> 00:01:15,863
Oh, of course, there's one
in the den. Help yourself.

14
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,321
God, I'm sick of Mort
always borrowing our stuff.

15
00:01:20,338 --> 00:01:22,930
He's a bigger mooch than
the Mexican Super Friends.

16
00:01:29,425 --> 00:01:32,273
Hey, Mexican Superman,
can I talk to you for a sec?

17
00:01:32,287 --> 00:01:34,463
When you signed the lease,
you said there was going to be like

18
00:01:34,476 --> 00:01:35,653
five of you living here.

19
00:01:35,676 --> 00:01:38,863
Oh, no, they're not all living here.
They're just visiting.

20
00:01:41,917 --> 00:01:45,303
Hey, Mexican Superman,
I got the keys made.

21
00:01:45,316 --> 00:01:47,381
Hey, Mexican Batman, get out of here.

22
00:01:47,397 --> 00:01:50,183
- What? I got like 60 keys.
- Siléncio!

23
00:01:50,197 --> 00:01:51,603
- Jefe aquí!
- ¿Qué?

24
00:01:51,635 --> 00:01:52,993
Evición.

25
00:01:56,348 --> 00:01:58,282
That ought to keep Mort away.

26
00:01:58,307 --> 00:02:00,003
Peter, what the hell is that?

27
00:02:00,018 --> 00:02:02,260
Lois, I'm tired of Mort
always mooching off us,

28
00:02:02,276 --> 00:02:03,490
so I made a scare-Jew.

29
00:02:03,507 --> 00:02:06,020
Peter, we're not gonna have
this in our front yard.

30
00:02:06,046 --> 00:02:09,233
It's racist, and for God's sake,
you ruined your best suit.

31
00:02:09,256 --> 00:02:10,933
Now we're gonna have
to get you a new one...

32
00:02:10,935 --> 00:02:12,420
Shh. Lois Lois, look.

33
00:02:12,526 --> 00:02:15,063
Hey, guys, I just wanted
to return your...

34
00:02:15,067 --> 00:02:18,193
Oh! Oh, my God, it's Hitler! He's back!

35
00:02:18,227 --> 00:02:20,531
He's back! Hurry, protect Jon Stewart!

36
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,662
He's our most important Jew!

37
00:02:26,225 --> 00:02:27,930
Why do wo get me a suit here?

38
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:31,552
Well, since you keep ruining them, I'm
not going to buy you a brand-new one.

39
00:02:32,398 --> 00:02:35,690
Yes, I'll take this teddy bear,
this ruler,

40
00:02:35,715 --> 00:02:39,302
this piece of string and
this cardboard box.

41
00:02:42,627 --> 00:02:45,431
Oh, look, an "On The Raggedy Ann" doll.

42
00:02:45,647 --> 00:02:48,040
<i>It's water weight, you bastard!</i>

43
00:02:48,077 --> 00:02:50,341
<i>Get off me! I'm not your whore.</i>

44
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:54,003
<i>I'm sorry, I'm just so sad.</i>

45
00:02:54,016 --> 00:02:56,891
Well, I guess I can still play with it
three weeks out of the month.

46
00:02:57,557 --> 00:03:00,570
- Hi, there. See anything you like?
- Oh, I'm just browsing.

47
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:03,492
Say, you look like you
could use an activity book

48
00:03:03,505 --> 00:03:05,310
with half the activities done.

49
00:03:05,806 --> 00:03:08,833
- That would save me half the time.
- Connect the dots?

50
00:03:08,858 --> 00:03:11,930
Ha! More like set the book down
and have a beer.

51
00:03:11,955 --> 00:03:13,701
You got yourself a deal.

52
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:20,100
What... are those?!

53
00:03:20,138 --> 00:03:22,813
Oh, that's a pair of
red flannel feety pajamas.

54
00:03:22,825 --> 00:03:23,762
Good Lord.

55
00:03:23,797 --> 00:03:26,271
See, they've got a flap
that opens up in the back.

56
00:03:26,298 --> 00:03:28,953
Are you telling me I could be
pooping and warm?

57
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:30,091
Exactly.

58
00:03:30,118 --> 00:03:33,272
No longer would I have to make
a choice between the two.

59
00:03:33,368 --> 00:03:35,760
Sir, here is a check with my name on it.

60
00:03:35,788 --> 00:03:38,930
Write down any number on
this piece of paper, and I will pay it.

61
00:03:43,065 --> 00:03:44,422
All right, so we roll the dice

62
00:03:44,435 --> 00:03:46,743
and then we both have to yell
"Yahtzee" really loud.

63
00:03:46,766 --> 00:03:47,780
- At the same time?
- Yeah.

64
00:03:47,788 --> 00:03:49,563
And you have to flap
your wrists like this.

65
00:03:49,568 --> 00:03:50,512
And you'll do it, too?

66
00:03:50,528 --> 00:03:52,221
- Of course, that's how it's done.
- Okay.

67
00:03:52,236 --> 00:03:54,031
- All right, ready?
- Okay, you gonna do with me?

68
00:03:54,047 --> 00:03:54,741
Oh, yeah.

69
00:03:55,288 --> 00:03:56,590
Yahtzee!

70
00:03:56,615 --> 00:03:57,792
- Gay.
- You suck!

71
00:03:57,865 --> 00:03:59,713
Hey, everybody, I'm home from work.

72
00:03:59,737 --> 00:04:02,740
My God, Peter, you wore
those pajamas to your office?

73
00:04:02,757 --> 00:04:04,433
Hey, at least
I'm mixing it up a little bit.

74
00:04:04,446 --> 00:04:06,963
Green shirt, tan pants,
that's refreshing.

75
00:04:07,027 --> 00:04:10,063
Oh, boy does it feel good
to undo my butt flap.

76
00:04:10,095 --> 00:04:13,482
Ew, Dad! We don't want to
sit here and look at your ass.

77
00:04:13,516 --> 00:04:16,302
Yes, I'd rather look at Meg
toweling off after a shower

78
00:04:16,305 --> 00:04:18,273
when she does that butt floss thing.

79
00:04:19,187 --> 00:04:20,853
Ew, ew, that's so disgusting.

80
00:04:20,866 --> 00:04:23,663
Ugh, ugh, I hope I don't ever
accidentally use that towel.

81
00:04:24,537 --> 00:04:26,883
Lois, I have never been more comfortable

82
00:04:26,898 --> 00:04:29,183
as a person than I am
in these feety pajamas.

83
00:04:29,207 --> 00:04:30,670
All warm and furry.

84
00:04:30,735 --> 00:04:32,651
This is what it feels like to be a bear.

85
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:34,962
You remember what I used to say,
Lois, when we first got married?

86
00:04:34,977 --> 00:04:37,340
You remember? I used to say :
"What would it feel like to be a bear?"

87
00:04:37,715 --> 00:04:39,430
Well, this is it. This is it.

88
00:04:39,585 --> 00:04:41,803
- I'm living it, baby.
- No, you're not.

89
00:04:41,826 --> 00:04:43,953
You've been wearing
those things for three days.

90
00:04:43,955 --> 00:04:46,620
You can wear them to bed, but
tomorrow we're getting rid of them.

91
00:04:47,107 --> 00:04:48,021
Fine.

92
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,953
Screw up all my fuzziness.

93
00:04:52,768 --> 00:04:54,770
What the hell was that?

94
00:04:55,855 --> 00:04:56,911
Oh, my God.

95
00:04:57,285 --> 00:04:59,053
Lois, don't get alarmed, but

96
00:04:59,285 --> 00:05:01,051
I think I might be Jesus.

97
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,442
I'm Jesus.

98
00:05:02,475 --> 00:05:04,052
Peter, that's a static shock.

99
00:05:04,068 --> 00:05:06,380
Your pajamas created
a charge of electricity

100
00:05:06,408 --> 00:05:08,130
when you dragged your feet
across the carpet,

101
00:05:08,158 --> 00:05:10,122
and when you touched Chris,
you passed it on.

102
00:05:10,148 --> 00:05:11,692
Kneel before Christ!

103
00:05:22,546 --> 00:05:23,341
Dad!

104
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,710
I am not your dad.

105
00:05:25,178 --> 00:05:27,210
I am Electric Man.

106
00:05:36,678 --> 00:05:38,180
Damn it, Peter, stop it!

107
00:05:38,195 --> 00:05:39,623
I got to tell you, you're pissing me off

108
00:05:39,638 --> 00:05:42,402
worse than when I watched the
O.J. verdict with my old roommate.

109
00:05:42,558 --> 00:05:46,403
<i>We the jury find the defendant
Orenthal James Simpson,</i>

110
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,550
<i>not guilty...</i>

111
00:05:47,575 --> 00:05:48,813
- Yes!
- What the hell?!

112
00:05:49,256 --> 00:05:50,121
- What?!
- What?!

113
00:05:51,275 --> 00:05:54,282
- Maybe we should get new roommates.
- Yeah, maybe we should.

114
00:05:57,408 --> 00:05:58,381
Peter.

115
00:05:58,437 --> 00:05:59,993
I know you're in here.

116
00:06:00,007 --> 00:06:01,493
Yes, I am, Lois.

117
00:06:02,027 --> 00:06:03,940
But where?

118
00:06:03,968 --> 00:06:07,131
Peter, if you shock me,
I swear to God I'm leaving you.

119
00:06:07,157 --> 00:06:09,170
You'll have to find me first, Lois.

120
00:06:09,185 --> 00:06:10,891
Where could I be?

121
00:06:10,906 --> 00:06:14,241
Well, there's a Quonset hut that
I've never seen in this room before.

122
00:06:14,278 --> 00:06:16,732
- I got to figure you're in there.
- How do you know, Lois?

123
00:06:16,746 --> 00:06:19,790
I could be in that New York
style magazine kiosk.

124
00:06:19,808 --> 00:06:22,173
Peter, this all looks very expensive.

125
00:06:22,198 --> 00:06:24,320
Yes, you might say it was...

126
00:06:24,345 --> 00:06:26,251
shockingly expensive.

127
00:06:26,276 --> 00:06:28,180
I'm going to try the Quonset hut.

128
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,410
I was in the bathroom.

129
00:06:30,426 --> 00:06:33,842
The hut and the kiosk...
decoys, Lois, decoys!

130
00:06:37,418 --> 00:06:40,940
Glen, thank you so much
for helping me tear up my carpet.

131
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:42,900
Well, you know, Lois, I got to confess,

132
00:06:42,925 --> 00:06:45,663
when you called me I sort of
misunderstood what you were asking for.

133
00:06:45,678 --> 00:06:47,262
That's why I rushed over.
But, uh...

134
00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:50,072
Well, it's fine, it's fine,
whatever, I'm happy to help.

135
00:06:50,096 --> 00:06:51,721
What the hell is this?

136
00:06:51,736 --> 00:06:53,770
Peter, I've had it with
all your shocking.

137
00:06:53,805 --> 00:06:56,973
Since you won't get rid of those
pajamas, I'm getting rid of the carpets.

138
00:06:56,997 --> 00:06:59,203
Hey, Lois, you want me to leave
a little strip in this thing?

139
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,650
Maybe a lightning bolt, unicorn,
something like that?

140
00:07:01,678 --> 00:07:05,453
- No, I want it all gone, Glen.
- All right, we're going Brazilian.

141
00:07:06,245 --> 00:07:07,460
Hey, what's this?

142
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:10,236
- Some kind of really old coin.
- Huh. Let me see that.

143
00:07:10,414 --> 00:07:12,403
Wait a minute, do you know what this is?

144
00:07:12,438 --> 00:07:15,033
This is an 18th-century
Rhode Island ship token.

145
00:07:15,049 --> 00:07:16,821
This thing's got to be worth 50 grand.

146
00:07:16,847 --> 00:07:19,291
50 grand?! Oh, my God!

147
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,190
I can finally afford that operation

148
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,671
to swap my vocal cords
with Patrick Stewart.

149
00:07:23,765 --> 00:07:28,182
Hey, Lois, I spent the afternoon
making a list of famous Armenians.

150
00:07:28,237 --> 00:07:31,083
Eric Bogosian, Andre Agassi,

151
00:07:31,156 --> 00:07:33,411
Jerry "The Shark" Tarkanian.

152
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:34,690
That is all.

153
00:07:37,508 --> 00:07:40,561
Peter, you've been sleeping
with that money for the past week.

154
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,811
Don't you think it's time
we did something with it?

155
00:07:42,825 --> 00:07:44,703
Buy a bolt and shut that trap of yours?

156
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:45,500
- What?
- What?

157
00:07:45,515 --> 00:07:46,913
'Cause I had an idea.

158
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,342
Remember when we first got married...

159
00:07:48,356 --> 00:07:50,223
And I said, "I wonder what it
would be like to be a bear"?

160
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:53,342
No, no, no, I'm talking about
that dream we had, Peter.

161
00:07:53,367 --> 00:07:55,921
Remember? We tried
to open that restaurant,

162
00:07:55,937 --> 00:07:57,873
and we never quite got it going.

163
00:07:57,888 --> 00:08:00,823
Yeah, we got shut down
'cause of my exploding cupcakes.

164
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:03,852
Mmm, I hope these taste
as good as they look.

165
00:08:05,237 --> 00:08:06,670
Gerald!

166
00:08:07,506 --> 00:08:09,563
The secret is in the frosting.

167
00:08:09,575 --> 00:08:11,743
But I'll never tell.

168
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:14,922
Well, here's another chance
to open a restaurant.

169
00:08:14,945 --> 00:08:16,121
You're right.

170
00:08:16,147 --> 00:08:18,442
- And I'll make my special cupcakes.
- No, Peter...

171
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,240
Oh, yeah, right, that was the problem.

172
00:08:24,608 --> 00:08:27,102
All right, everybody,
only three hours till opening.

173
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,650
Oh, this is going to be
the coolest place in Quahog.

174
00:08:29,665 --> 00:08:32,710
All the movers and shakers
and bigwigs are going to eat here...

175
00:08:32,737 --> 00:08:34,933
but not the small wigs.

176
00:08:34,976 --> 00:08:37,301
Hey, I'm hungry.

177
00:08:37,338 --> 00:08:39,211
I got a credit card.

178
00:08:39,236 --> 00:08:42,491
Oh, God, I'm so nervous.
I hope it goes well.

179
00:08:42,517 --> 00:08:46,132
Oh, yes, I'm sure it will go as well
as Liza Minnelli's Playboy shoot.

180
00:08:46,387 --> 00:08:48,861
Oh, God, please put
your clothes back on.

181
00:08:48,886 --> 00:08:50,823
Mama... Mama...

182
00:08:51,287 --> 00:08:53,151
Do you love me now, Mama?

183
00:08:53,747 --> 00:08:55,840
Please love me, Mama!

184
00:08:59,985 --> 00:09:02,391
Good evening. Welcome to
Big Pete's House of Munch.

185
00:09:02,426 --> 00:09:05,320
- May I help you?
- Yes, do you accept the Discover card?

186
00:09:05,766 --> 00:09:08,590
Hey, Lois, Diamond Jim Brady over here

187
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:11,132
just asked if we accept
the Discover card.

188
00:09:11,857 --> 00:09:15,080
They're in an exclusive club
called anybody.

189
00:09:15,116 --> 00:09:17,442
Yeah.
No, no, no, I don't think so.

190
00:09:17,537 --> 00:09:20,771
You know, you know,
I would rather take two live chickens

191
00:09:20,787 --> 00:09:22,842
than your fly-by-night credit card.

192
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:25,660
I would rather take a jar of pennies

193
00:09:25,675 --> 00:09:28,180
that's value was less
than that of your bill.

194
00:09:28,196 --> 00:09:30,282
- Look, you don't have to insult me.
- No, no, no.

195
00:09:30,297 --> 00:09:33,241
You are going to sit there
and listen to the funny things

196
00:09:33,256 --> 00:09:35,323
I would take instead
of your credit card.

197
00:09:37,296 --> 00:09:41,590
The guy at table 7 complained there's
not enough juice on his prime rib.

198
00:09:41,617 --> 00:09:42,851
Oh, did he, now?

199
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,653
Let me take care of that for him.

200
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:50,222
Tell him, bon appétit, douchebag.

201
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:55,293
Oh, look, it's one of those
early Maude episodes

202
00:09:55,308 --> 00:09:57,442
with the really long opening
credit sequence.

203
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:04,162
<i>Lady Godiva was a freedom rider</i>

204
00:10:04,207 --> 00:10:07,252
<i>She didn't care if
the whole world looked</i>

205
00:10:07,456 --> 00:10:11,080
<i>Joan of Arc with the Lord to guide her</i>

206
00:10:11,175 --> 00:10:13,833
<i>She was a sister who really cooked</i>

207
00:10:14,475 --> 00:10:18,073
<i>Madame Curie was a
strong woman character</i>

208
00:10:18,097 --> 00:10:21,300
<i>Working all day in a science lab, yeah</i>

209
00:10:21,415 --> 00:10:24,601
<i>Clara Barton was a famous nurse</i>

210
00:10:24,628 --> 00:10:27,950
<i>Who was rapping with
the soldiers and bandages, too</i>

211
00:10:28,287 --> 00:10:32,013
<i>Susan B. Anthony always out doin' stuff</i>

212
00:10:32,038 --> 00:10:34,893
<i>Marching around and holding up signs...</i>

213
00:10:34,907 --> 00:10:36,043
<i>And then there's Maude.</i>

214
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:39,200
<i>- Pocahontas had it all goin' on
- What the hell?</i>

215
00:10:39,246 --> 00:10:42,652
<i>An Indian guide
with lots of Indian pride</i>

216
00:10:42,747 --> 00:10:46,310
<i>Indira Gandhi ran a whole big country</i>

217
00:10:46,366 --> 00:10:49,401
<i>That isn't easy even if you're a guy...</i>

218
00:10:49,428 --> 00:10:50,830
And then there's Maude?

219
00:10:50,878 --> 00:10:54,122
<i>- Babe Zaharias was a really good athlete
- Aw, come on!</i>

220
00:10:54,158 --> 00:10:57,110
<i>Good at track and field
and professional golf, too</i>

221
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,423
And then there's Maude!

222
00:10:58,466 --> 00:11:01,871
<i>Amelia Earhart flew a lot of airplanes</i>

223
00:11:01,918 --> 00:11:05,190
<i>Except for that one time
when she didn't come back</i>

224
00:11:05,238 --> 00:11:08,953
<i>- Cleopatra lived way out in the desert
- And then there's Maude! Come on!</i>

225
00:11:08,987 --> 00:11:12,363
<i>But still found a way
to keep herself looking fine</i>

226
00:11:12,946 --> 00:11:14,920
<i>And then there's Maude...</i>

227
00:11:16,088 --> 00:11:17,372
There we go!

228
00:11:17,407 --> 00:11:18,960
That was an ordeal.

229
00:11:19,055 --> 00:11:21,561
Well, Peter, this has been
an amazing week.

230
00:11:21,585 --> 00:11:24,770
You and I own a restaurant.
Can you believe it?

231
00:11:24,788 --> 00:11:26,560
I know. I feel like I'm dreaming.

232
00:11:26,578 --> 00:11:27,301
Wait.

233
00:11:27,315 --> 00:11:28,913
Maybe I am dreaming.

234
00:11:28,935 --> 00:11:31,991
That means I can do whatever
I want without consequences.

235
00:11:34,358 --> 00:11:35,811
What are you doing?

236
00:11:35,837 --> 00:11:38,003
I just adopted 30 puppies!

237
00:11:52,766 --> 00:11:54,702
You guys, I have some bad news.

238
00:11:54,707 --> 00:11:56,252
I just finished going over the books,

239
00:11:56,265 --> 00:11:58,473
and this restaurant is
hemorrhaging money.

240
00:11:58,476 --> 00:12:00,960
What? Well, how is that possible?

241
00:12:00,977 --> 00:12:03,262
Isn't it obvious?
We're not getting enough customers.

242
00:12:03,276 --> 00:12:05,451
This place is like a
ghost town half the time.

243
00:12:05,467 --> 00:12:07,663
Yeah. Maybe somebody
should have asked me.

244
00:12:07,678 --> 00:12:10,931
After all, I'm the only one in this
family with any business experience.

245
00:12:10,987 --> 00:12:12,492
All right, Violet and Pigpen,

246
00:12:12,585 --> 00:12:15,361
you've been seeing each other a few
weeks now. What seems to be the problem?

247
00:12:15,365 --> 00:12:18,260
I keep getting bladder infections,
and I don't know why.

248
00:12:18,307 --> 00:12:19,422
Really?

249
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:21,031
You don't know why?

250
00:12:24,017 --> 00:12:25,501
I don't know what to do, guys.

251
00:12:25,505 --> 00:12:27,682
The House of Munch is
going down the tubes.

252
00:12:27,696 --> 00:12:30,641
Maybe you need to do
a little advertising, Peter.

253
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:31,642
Well, I tried.

254
00:12:31,648 --> 00:12:34,752
I even hired M. Night Shyamalan
to direct my TV commercial.

255
00:12:35,095 --> 00:12:37,233
I have a secret to tell you.

256
00:12:37,348 --> 00:12:39,322
- What is it?
- Come closer.

257
00:12:39,938 --> 00:12:43,293
I see good food at competitive prices.

258
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:46,280
At Big Pete's House of Munch!
Stop on by!

259
00:12:46,345 --> 00:12:47,920
Unfortunately, they couldn't air it,

260
00:12:47,926 --> 00:12:50,920
'cause it turns out M. Night Shyamalan
was involved with September 11.

261
00:12:50,945 --> 00:12:54,592
You know, Peter, my buddies and I
have been looking for a new hangout.

262
00:12:54,615 --> 00:12:57,401
Our usual doughnut shop
has gotten a little...

263
00:12:57,478 --> 00:12:59,160
Puerto Ricany.

264
00:12:59,186 --> 00:13:02,042
What if we made your place our new spot?

265
00:13:02,058 --> 00:13:03,911
Joe, that's a great idea!

266
00:13:03,925 --> 00:13:05,962
Fantastic! We'll see you tonight.

267
00:13:05,988 --> 00:13:07,300
This is awesome!

268
00:13:07,337 --> 00:13:10,501
Bunch of cops in uniform
hanging out in my restaurant?

269
00:13:10,518 --> 00:13:12,142
This is going to be cooler
than that time

270
00:13:12,156 --> 00:13:14,380
Ben Stiller taught me how to be myself.

271
00:13:14,777 --> 00:13:17,532
But how can you leave me now,
Ben Stiller,

272
00:13:17,555 --> 00:13:19,461
when I need you more than ever?

273
00:13:19,475 --> 00:13:22,160
I've taught you everything
you need to know, Peter.

274
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,623
Now it's time for me
to go help another child.

275
00:13:24,656 --> 00:13:28,673
I guess I just fooled myself into
thinking you'd always be with me.

276
00:13:28,686 --> 00:13:29,941
I will, Peter.

277
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,150
I will always be with you.

278
00:13:41,266 --> 00:13:43,722
His movies are terrible...

279
00:13:48,805 --> 00:13:52,250
Lois, roll out the red carpet.
Here comes Joe and his cop buddies.

280
00:13:52,277 --> 00:13:54,381
You got tables for 30?

281
00:13:58,336 --> 00:14:01,933
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Joe! I thought you
were bringing your cop friends over.

282
00:14:01,945 --> 00:14:03,912
What are all these
parallelograms doing here?

283
00:14:03,938 --> 00:14:07,011
You mean paraplegics.
These are my friends, Peter.

284
00:14:07,036 --> 00:14:08,650
Come on, guys. Let's eat.

285
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:12,691
Oh, God. I hope there's not one of
those angry, handicapped Vietnam guys

286
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:15,032
with the bandana on his head.
Oh! There he is.

287
00:14:15,047 --> 00:14:18,262
I've seen some things, man,
and some stuff.

288
00:14:18,326 --> 00:14:19,953
I wouldn't recommend it.

289
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:30,471
Peter, isn't this wonderful?
The place is packed.

290
00:14:30,508 --> 00:14:32,231
Uh... Lois, uh...

291
00:14:32,335 --> 00:14:34,121
aren't you a little freaked out by this?

292
00:14:34,138 --> 00:14:36,600
Why? Everybody's having a great time.

293
00:14:36,615 --> 00:14:38,831
Besides, think of the
money we're making.

294
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,400
I don't care about that.
I wanted a cool restaurant,

295
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:43,811
not the cafeteria at the
veteran's hospital.

296
00:14:43,827 --> 00:14:46,571
This is weirder than that
rap video by M.C. Escher.

297
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:49,771
<i>Going up the stairs
and going down the stairs</i>

298
00:14:49,815 --> 00:14:51,951
<i>And going up the stairs
and going down the stairs</i>

299
00:14:51,996 --> 00:14:54,201
<i>And going up the sideways stairs.</i>

300
00:14:56,717 --> 00:15:00,320
And, in local news, a new restaurant
is taking Quahog by storm.

301
00:15:00,337 --> 00:15:02,110
That's right, Diane.
If you're handicapped,

302
00:15:02,127 --> 00:15:05,341
or know someone who's handicapped, or
just happen to be a fan of the circus,

303
00:15:05,377 --> 00:15:07,721
then come on down
to Big Pete's House of Munch,

304
00:15:07,725 --> 00:15:10,050
where the elite without feet
meet to eat.

305
00:15:10,107 --> 00:15:13,223
Lois, this is insanity. I think we
should shut down the restaurant.

306
00:15:13,236 --> 00:15:15,860
But... why? We're doing so well.

307
00:15:15,895 --> 00:15:19,630
Lois, let me explain something to you,
all right? Cripples are not cool.

308
00:15:19,665 --> 00:15:22,352
- Hang on. I'm going to get the picture.
- Oh, Peter, don't...

309
00:15:24,095 --> 00:15:26,182
- What do you see here, Lois?
- Do we have to...?

310
00:15:26,195 --> 00:15:27,661
What do you see?!

311
00:15:28,187 --> 00:15:31,800
- A picture of Mark Harmon.
- A picture of Mark Harmon,

312
00:15:31,818 --> 00:15:34,001
the greatest actor who ever lived.

313
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:35,900
Do you see a wheelchair
under Mark Harmon?

314
00:15:35,907 --> 00:15:36,981
- Peter...
- Lois,

315
00:15:37,506 --> 00:15:38,750
do you...

316
00:15:38,836 --> 00:15:40,681
see a wheelchair...

317
00:15:41,256 --> 00:15:43,071
under Mark Harmon?

318
00:15:43,137 --> 00:15:45,040
- No.
- No, you do not,

319
00:15:45,067 --> 00:15:47,133
because Mark Harmon is cool.

320
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:50,622
I know what you're thinking. "Peter,
this is just like your Gil Gerard speech."

321
00:15:50,635 --> 00:15:53,271
And you can stop right in
your tracks, because it is not.

322
00:15:53,326 --> 00:15:55,981
Granted, it is similar to the
Gil Gerard speech, but it...

323
00:15:56,005 --> 00:15:58,291
Peter, I like our restaurant
the way it is,

324
00:15:58,316 --> 00:16:00,643
and if you don't, that's your problem.

325
00:16:01,005 --> 00:16:03,663
Fine. Then I'll deal with this myself.

326
00:16:06,447 --> 00:16:08,041
All right, here they come.

327
00:16:10,898 --> 00:16:13,210
Hey, Peter, we're here for dinner.

328
00:16:13,235 --> 00:16:16,030
Oh no, you're not, Joe.
We have a new policy.

329
00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:17,222
Can't you read the sign?

330
00:16:19,948 --> 00:16:21,932
Peter, what the hell is that all about?

331
00:16:21,967 --> 00:16:23,432
It's a message, Joe.

332
00:16:23,445 --> 00:16:25,991
I don't want you and your
kind eating here anymore.

333
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:28,892
You're ruining what was supposed
to be a cool establishment.

334
00:16:28,908 --> 00:16:30,843
Peter, you're one of my closest friends.

335
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:34,360
Are you... you telling me that you have
a problem with me being handicapped?

336
00:16:34,376 --> 00:16:37,041
As a matter of fact, Joe, yes.
I think it's immoral.

337
00:16:37,068 --> 00:16:39,711
It's a lifestyle choice
you're forcing on America.

338
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,572
We handicapped are a proud people!

339
00:16:42,587 --> 00:16:45,141
Yeah, when you're not drinking and
gambling on your reservations,

340
00:16:45,155 --> 00:16:46,930
which we gave you.

341
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,441
Fine, if that's the way you want it,

342
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,913
but we're not going to go down easy.

343
00:16:52,718 --> 00:16:54,090
Okay, that was easy.

344
00:16:54,116 --> 00:16:56,793
But I'll be back with
more handicapped guys!

345
00:17:02,106 --> 00:17:04,373
Dad, look! Here they come!

346
00:17:09,178 --> 00:17:12,563
Peter, we'll give you
one last chance to let us in!

347
00:17:12,946 --> 00:17:15,540
What are you going to do, Joe?
I'm up here.

348
00:17:16,025 --> 00:17:19,032
And you're down there.

349
00:17:19,116 --> 00:17:21,950
Very well, Peter,
you leave us no choice.

350
00:17:22,067 --> 00:17:24,801
Men, form up Crippletron!

351
00:18:14,618 --> 00:18:17,682
Help! Help! Somebody help me!

352
00:18:19,146 --> 00:18:21,250
Ben Stiller, help me.

353
00:18:21,325 --> 00:18:24,002
No, Peter. I heard what
you said about my movies.

354
00:18:24,017 --> 00:18:24,960
How did you hear?

355
00:18:25,015 --> 00:18:26,081
Hello!

356
00:18:26,107 --> 00:18:28,902
Go to hell, you mutant offspring
of comedy people.

357
00:18:31,806 --> 00:18:34,781
Mrs. Griffin, I'm afraid
he'll never walk again...

358
00:18:34,967 --> 00:18:36,910
without remembering how lucky he is

359
00:18:36,926 --> 00:18:39,130
that he'll only be in this
wheelchair for two weeks.

360
00:18:39,146 --> 00:18:41,193
That leg should heal up just fine.

361
00:18:41,206 --> 00:18:44,552
Peter, you do realize you deserve this
for the way you treated Joe.

362
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:46,643
I think you owe him an apology.

363
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,703
Are you kidding, Lois?

364
00:18:47,716 --> 00:18:49,861
It ain't my fault that him
and all his gimpy friends

365
00:18:49,877 --> 00:18:51,732
don't fit in with regular society.

366
00:18:51,796 --> 00:18:53,060
But I'm going to be different.

367
00:18:53,087 --> 00:18:56,731
I'll be a dignified cripple,
and I'll show them all how it's done!

368
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,082
<i>Don't wish it away</i>

369
00:19:11,456 --> 00:19:15,552
<i>Don't look at it like it's forever</i>

370
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:21,420
<i>Between you and me</i>

371
00:19:22,517 --> 00:19:24,593
<i>I could honestly say</i>

372
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:27,523
<i>That things can only get better</i>

373
00:19:30,915 --> 00:19:33,311
<i>And while I'm away</i>

374
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:39,313
<i>Dust out the demons inside</i>

375
00:19:40,307 --> 00:19:45,280
<i>And it won't be long
before you and me run</i>

376
00:19:45,737 --> 00:19:48,311
<i>To the place in our hearts</i>

377
00:19:49,126 --> 00:19:51,421
<i>Where we hide</i>

378
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:59,120
<i>And I guess that's why
they call it the blues</i>

379
00:20:03,806 --> 00:20:08,381
<i>And I guess that's why
they call it the blues.</i>

380
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:10,522
Joe, uh...

381
00:20:10,705 --> 00:20:12,681
- you got a minute?
- What is it, Peter?

382
00:20:12,698 --> 00:20:13,612
I, uh...

383
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:15,533
just wanted to apologize.

384
00:20:15,566 --> 00:20:18,731
I thought you and your friends
were just a bunch of gross cripples,

385
00:20:18,897 --> 00:20:21,973
but I've been in a wheelchair
for 45 minutes now,

386
00:20:21,985 --> 00:20:23,491
and I see how tough it is.

387
00:20:23,566 --> 00:20:26,772
Well, Peter, it's been a
rough week for both of us,

388
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:29,733
but it means a lot to me
to hear you say that.

389
00:20:29,775 --> 00:20:32,402
So what do you say?
Can we put all this behind us?

390
00:20:32,435 --> 00:20:34,012
I'd like nothing better.

391
00:20:34,085 --> 00:20:37,833
Hey, Bonnie and I are watching
Grey's Anatomy if you want to come in.

392
00:20:37,855 --> 00:20:40,460
Oh, boy, Joe, I...
I got to tell you, that... that...

393
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,330
that sounds awful.
