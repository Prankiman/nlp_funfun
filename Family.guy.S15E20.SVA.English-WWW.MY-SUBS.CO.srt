<i>This program is brought
to you by Fruit Bouquets.</i>

12
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:40,120
<i>Got a birthday coming up for
someone you absolutely hate?</i>

13
00:00:40,121 --> 00:00:41,956
<i>Why not tell them to go screw themselves</i>

14
00:00:41,957 --> 00:00:43,926
<i>by sending a giant Fruit Bouquet?</i>

15
00:00:43,927 --> 00:00:45,728
<i>With just a few clicks, you'll be able</i>

16
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:48,798
<i>to send someone 14 pounds of
unwanted decorative produce</i>

17
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,400
<i>that will go bad within
an hour of arrival!</i>

18
00:00:51,401 --> 00:00:53,636
Hungry for a strangely-warm strawberry?

19
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:57,040
How about a hard green wedge
or a slime-glazed melon ball?

20
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:58,974
Well, we have all these gross things.

21
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,876
Order now and make someone feel guilty

22
00:01:00,877 --> 00:01:03,245
about throwing it straight into
the trash six hours later.

23
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:06,548
Fruit Bouquets: the rotting
gift with flies on it!

24
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:09,118
Okay, I'm heading out for ladies' night.

25
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,920
There's a casserole in the refrigerator.

26
00:01:10,921 --> 00:01:12,454
I'll be home at 11:00.

27
00:01:12,455 --> 00:01:13,889
- Hey, Lois?
- Yeah?

28
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,392
How would you find out the
name of the actual actress

29
00:01:16,393 --> 00:01:18,260
who plays the AT&T chick?

30
00:01:18,261 --> 00:01:20,396
I left a list of hot commercial girls

31
00:01:20,397 --> 00:01:21,798
on the refrigerator.

32
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:24,067
What is this "refrigerator"
you keep mentioning?

33
00:01:24,068 --> 00:01:25,902
Are you talking about
the sandwich house?

34
00:01:25,903 --> 00:01:28,103
I guess I'm not the only person

35
00:01:28,104 --> 00:01:29,406
with a useless husband.

36
00:01:29,407 --> 00:01:31,549
I mean, look at Mrs. Butterworth.

37
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,152
I still don't understand why
we couldn't take my last name.

38
00:01:34,153 --> 00:01:37,222
Well, my last name helps
keep a roof over our head

39
00:01:37,223 --> 00:01:38,991
and pays for your hobby.

40
00:01:38,992 --> 00:01:40,158
Hobby?

41
00:01:41,327 --> 00:01:42,727
Oh, look at that.

42
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:44,896
My business line is ringing.

43
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:47,232
Hello? Lamps That Look
Like Soccer Balls.

44
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:48,900
Yes?

45
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:51,636
Okay. How many would you like to return?

46
00:01:51,637 --> 00:01:55,173
Yeah, just send them here, care of...

47
00:01:55,174 --> 00:01:57,294
Mr. Butterworth.

48
00:02:02,582 --> 00:02:04,849
Ah, it's so nice getting
out of the house.

49
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,087
If I had to change one more
diaper, I was gonna lose it.

50
00:02:08,088 --> 00:02:09,955
I'm in exactly the same boat.

51
00:02:09,956 --> 00:02:11,856
I mean, what would our husbands do

52
00:02:11,857 --> 00:02:13,825
if they had to change their own diapers?

53
00:02:13,826 --> 00:02:16,327
Different boat, Bonnie.
Much different boat.

54
00:02:16,328 --> 00:02:18,129
Hey, I got an idea.

55
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,464
Let's crank call them.

56
00:02:19,465 --> 00:02:21,533
Me first.

57
00:02:21,534 --> 00:02:24,035
You're weak, Cleveland!

58
00:02:24,036 --> 00:02:25,937
You're worthless and weak!

59
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:28,606
You found Brown.

60
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:29,874
Hello, Cleveland.

61
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:31,176
This is Michelle Obama.

62
00:02:31,177 --> 00:02:32,378
<i>It is?!</i>

63
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:34,712
Yes. I received all your letters,

64
00:02:34,713 --> 00:02:36,981
and I<i> do</i> like your mustache.

65
00:02:36,982 --> 00:02:40,051
Oh. I've been doing all
your arm exercises.

66
00:02:40,052 --> 00:02:43,289
<i>Thank you, but those won't
work on your fat arms.</i>

67
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,156
How do you know my arms are fat?

68
00:02:45,157 --> 00:02:47,625
I deliberately left them
out of all the photos.

69
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:50,728
<i>You're eating a pie on the
toilet, aren't you, Cleveland?</i>

70
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:53,398
Who is this? Is this a Jerky Boy?!

71
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:55,066
It's your wife, you big dummy!

72
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:02,740
I used to have my own show.

73
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,812
Hello?

74
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,515
Hello. Is this Joe Swanson?

75
00:03:09,516 --> 00:03:11,049
Wait. You can talk normal?

76
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,517
What do you mean?

77
00:03:12,518 --> 00:03:13,818
Never mind.

78
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,688
We're calling from WQHG,

79
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:17,088
Quahog's Hottest Hits.

80
00:03:17,089 --> 00:03:19,924
And we'll give you $500 if
you can sing Britney Spears'

81
00:03:19,925 --> 00:03:22,227
"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman."

82
00:03:22,228 --> 00:03:23,828
You've got ten seconds to...

83
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:27,265
♪<i> I'm not a girl, not yet a woman</i> ♪

84

♪<i> All I need is time...</i> ♪

85
00:03:30,035 --> 00:03:32,203
Oh, but you have to be able to walk.

86
00:03:32,204 --> 00:03:33,605
<i>Aw, nuts.</i>

87
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:37,041
Okay, my turn! My turn!

88
00:03:39,745 --> 00:03:42,180
Hello. Don't say anything
about the 1998 Oscars.

89
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:43,615
I'm watching it now.

90
00:03:43,616 --> 00:03:45,950
<i>Hello, is this Peter Griffin?</i>

91
00:03:45,951 --> 00:03:48,453
If this is the fracking
people, I have made it clear

92
00:03:48,454 --> 00:03:50,588
that I am 100% on board.

93
00:03:50,589 --> 00:03:52,857
<i>No, my name is Rebecca.</i>

94
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,592
<i>You've never met me before</i>

95
00:03:54,593 --> 00:03:58,815
<i>and probably don't even know I
exist, but you're my father.</i>

96
00:03:59,815 --> 00:04:01,467
Hello?

97
00:04:01,468 --> 00:04:03,968
<i>How'd you get this number? Don't
you ever call here again!</i>

98
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:05,738
What the hell?!

99
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:07,640
He just got mad and hung up.

100
00:04:07,641 --> 00:04:09,307
He what? Why?

101
00:04:09,308 --> 00:04:11,142
I don't know. He sounded weird.

102
00:04:11,143 --> 00:04:13,711
Like when he was an NFL
announcer and had to pretend

103
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:16,481
he cared about the shows after the game.

104
00:04:16,482 --> 00:04:18,651
Patriots calling their
third and final timeout.

105
00:04:18,652 --> 00:04:20,585
Hey, after the game, keep it here

106
00:04:20,586 --> 00:04:22,553
for an all-new <i>Madam Secretary.</i>

107
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,222
Tonight, Madam Secretary faces

108
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:26,391
an international crisis in Pakistan,

109
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:28,894
while her teenage daughter
faces her own crisis

110
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:30,462
finding a date for the prom.

111
00:04:30,463 --> 00:04:32,264
<i>Madam</i> Secretary, tonight on CBS.

112
00:04:33,633 --> 00:04:36,286
Is this the longest
time-out of all time?

113
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,407
Hey, Peter.

114
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:45,176
So, um, anything interesting
happen tonight?

115
00:04:45,177 --> 00:04:48,447
Yup. I finally peed that chunk
of poo off the side of the bowl.

116
00:04:48,448 --> 00:04:50,782
You know the one you've
been yelling at me about?

117
00:04:50,783 --> 00:04:52,851
Nobody... called or anything?

118
00:04:52,852 --> 00:04:55,120
Nope. So, hey, uh, are you tipsy enough

119
00:04:55,121 --> 00:04:57,588
to let me have lazy Tony Soprano sex?

120
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,524
You know, where-where I just lie there

121
00:04:59,525 --> 00:05:02,360
and arch my hips a little bit
and breathe like a dying whale?

122
00:05:02,361 --> 00:05:03,695
Uh, I don't know.

123
00:05:03,696 --> 00:05:05,798
All right, well, just in
case, I'll be upstairs

124
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:09,033
getting into my boxers and black socks.

125
00:05:24,332 --> 00:05:25,651
Do you think it's possible

126
00:05:25,652 --> 00:05:28,187
he actually has an illegitimate child?

127
00:05:28,188 --> 00:05:30,055
I don't know, but something's going on,

128
00:05:30,056 --> 00:05:32,657
because I'm telling you,
he lied right to my face.

129
00:05:32,658 --> 00:05:35,727
Sometimes friends put
wine out for each other.

130
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:37,062
I just don't understand it.

131
00:05:37,063 --> 00:05:39,298
I mean, we don't keep
secrets in this house.

132
00:05:39,299 --> 00:05:42,085
We didn't even keep the
Pop Secret's secret.

133
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:46,070
Psst. Hey, did you hear?

134
00:05:46,071 --> 00:05:47,238
Hear what?

135
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:49,240
Orville Redenbacher is gay.

136
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:50,808
But he has a son.

137
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,144
He's in the commercial.

138
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:54,680
His son's gay, too. They're both gay.

139
00:05:54,681 --> 00:05:57,548
They have sex parties
in the Hollywood Hills.

140
00:05:57,549 --> 00:05:59,884
It sounds like you're
just making up stories

141
00:05:59,885 --> 00:06:01,419
about your competitors.

142
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,920
You're gay, too.

143
00:06:02,921 --> 00:06:04,555
What?

144
00:06:04,556 --> 00:06:07,492
Aah! You're a psycho!

145
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:09,394
Dad, you're never gonna believe what...

146
00:06:09,395 --> 00:06:12,614
Chris, meet Orville Redenbacher
and his son. Watch.

147
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,603
And that's where we get the expression

148
00:06:18,604 --> 00:06:21,240
"gay as a bag of popcorn."

149
00:06:21,241 --> 00:06:22,841
All right, I'll see you later.

150
00:06:22,842 --> 00:06:24,243
What? Where are you going?

151
00:06:24,244 --> 00:06:27,044
Laser tag orientation.

152
00:06:27,045 --> 00:06:28,846
Well, that's obviously not true.

153
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,782
Yeah, that boy got lie-arrhea.

154
00:06:30,783 --> 00:06:32,617
Oh, my God. I-I got to follow him,

155
00:06:32,618 --> 00:06:34,252
find out where he's really going.

156
00:06:34,253 --> 00:06:35,788
Good idea. If I was you,

157
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:37,423
I'd stick to him like glue-arrhea.

158
00:06:37,424 --> 00:06:40,793
Okay, I think I'm starting
to crack your code.

159
00:06:40,794 --> 00:06:42,628
Quick, Brian, I need your car.

160
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:43,961
I don't know, Lois.

161
00:06:43,962 --> 00:06:46,031
You're not on the insurance,
and I don't think that...

162
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,974
Fruit Bouquet for Brian Griffin?

163
00:06:55,975 --> 00:06:58,242
Happy birthday, buddy.

164
00:07:17,847 --> 00:07:19,916
What the hell?

165
00:07:21,183 --> 00:07:23,401
Peter, what are you doing here?

166
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:24,769
Lois! Uh, uh...

167
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,805
I was... I'm just, uh, shopping.

168
00:07:26,806 --> 00:07:29,106
Yeah, I'll-I'll take a
large sperm, please.

169
00:07:29,107 --> 00:07:31,008
Nice going, now you've ruined Christmas.

170
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:34,278
Peter Griffin, you tell me
what's going on right now.

171
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:37,582
Okay, fine, I'll be honest with you.

172
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:41,019
A long while back, just
before we got married,

173
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,753
I was a little short of cash.

174
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,423
What, to buy our rings?

175
00:07:44,424 --> 00:07:47,693
No, I wanted to pay for dial-up
modem impression classes. See?

176
00:07:59,287 --> 00:08:01,673
Wow, that's pretty good. I...

177
00:08:01,674 --> 00:08:03,508
You've got mail.

178
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:06,210
Okay, but hang on. You
were a sperm donor?

179
00:08:06,211 --> 00:08:07,879
Yeah, I'd-I'd almost forgotten about it,

180
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,681
but then last night, I get
this call from a woman

181
00:08:10,682 --> 00:08:12,049
who says she's my daughter.

182
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,553
Peter, that was me. I
was prank calling you.

183
00:08:14,554 --> 00:08:15,721
You what?!

184
00:08:15,722 --> 00:08:17,622
I can't believe you would do that to me!

185
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:19,123
Can you guys argue elsewhere?

186
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,058
You're making it tough
to finish in here.

187
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:23,461
No, fight louder! Call her a bitch!

188
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:24,862
But I don't understand.

189
00:08:24,863 --> 00:08:26,397
Why did you come here today?

190
00:08:26,398 --> 00:08:28,299
'Cause that call last
night gave me a scare.

191
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,468
I figured if I do have a kid out there,

192
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,904
I want to make sure they're not
giving out my information.

193
00:08:32,905 --> 00:08:34,806
They're not supposed
to; I signed a form.

194
00:08:34,807 --> 00:08:36,008
Hold on, Peter.

195
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:37,409
I'm sorry I tricked you,

196
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,912
but if you do have a child out there,

197
00:08:39,913 --> 00:08:42,414
isn't it only fair to let
him or her meet you?

198
00:08:42,415 --> 00:08:45,250
Eh, maybe you're right.

199
00:08:45,251 --> 00:08:46,717
I mean, as long as we're here,

200
00:08:46,718 --> 00:08:48,920
maybe you should sign a consent form.

201
00:08:48,921 --> 00:08:50,254
Okay, yeah.

202
00:08:50,255 --> 00:08:52,223
All right, I'll do it.

203
00:08:52,224 --> 00:08:53,424
You know what?

204
00:08:53,425 --> 00:08:55,726
It feels good doing
something nice for others.

205
00:08:55,727 --> 00:08:58,096
Like when I was a mentor for Kid Rock.

206
00:08:58,097 --> 00:09:00,566
Okay, I took a leak into
this can of Busch Light

207
00:09:00,567 --> 00:09:01,866
without spilling.

208
00:09:01,867 --> 00:09:03,101
You're ready.

209
00:09:03,102 --> 00:09:04,937
You don't need me anymore.

210
00:09:04,938 --> 00:09:06,404
Will I see you again, Peter?

211
00:09:06,405 --> 00:09:08,941
Wherever a father weighs
less than his daughter,

212
00:09:08,942 --> 00:09:10,241
I'll be there.

213
00:09:10,242 --> 00:09:12,677
Wherever someone has a
banner for a football team

214
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:15,246
as a curtain, I'll be there.

215
00:09:15,247 --> 00:09:17,682
Wherever there's a fight
in a Waffle House,

216
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:19,451
I'll be there.

217
00:09:19,452 --> 00:09:20,434
Now go.

218
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:23,472
People need a concert to go
to after the water park.

219
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:37,535
Hi, is, uh, is Peter Griffin here?

220
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,303
Oh, my God.

221
00:09:39,304 --> 00:09:40,771
Is everything okay?

222
00:09:40,772 --> 00:09:43,240
Yes, it's just... you look just like...

223
00:09:43,241 --> 00:09:45,576
What's going on? Who's this supermodel?

224
00:09:45,577 --> 00:09:47,379
I'm Katie.

225
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,879
I'm your daughter.

226
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,314
You're what?

227
00:09:50,315 --> 00:09:51,415
Holy crap!

228
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,150
Yeah, I hope you don't mind the drop-in,

229
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,153
but the, uh, the sperm bank said
it was okay to contact you.

230
00:09:56,154 --> 00:09:59,323
Wow, I guess, I guess I just
didn't expect this so soon.

231
00:09:59,324 --> 00:10:01,392
Well, we were all pretty
excited to meet you.

232
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,112
What do you mean "we"?

233
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,302
Hi, Dad!

234
00:10:11,303 --> 00:10:14,139
We're all your children.
We came from your semen.

235
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,073
"Semen."

236
00:10:17,809 --> 00:10:19,459
- "Semen."
- "Semen."

237
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,178
Ha-ha!

238
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:23,447
Oh, sorry. Wrong house.

239
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:25,449
Look, Eddie's at the wrong house.

240
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,267
- Ha-ha!
- Ha-ha!

241
00:10:27,268 --> 00:10:28,705
- Ha-ha!
- Ha-ha!

242
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:40,064
Peter, how many times
were you a sperm donor?

243
00:10:40,065 --> 00:10:43,602
Only once, but I had just seen
Uma Thurman in<i> Beautiful Girls,</i>

244
00:10:43,603 --> 00:10:45,171
so it was kind of a ka-blamo.

245
00:10:45,172 --> 00:10:48,273
You ever seen those videos where
they put Mentos in Diet Coke?

246
00:10:48,274 --> 00:10:50,275
Uh, listen, I want all of you to know

247
00:10:50,276 --> 00:10:52,044
how happy we are to meet you.

248
00:10:52,045 --> 00:10:55,529
In fact, this calls for a celebration.

249
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,365
Can you all stay for dinner?

250
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:59,634
Aw, we'd love that. Wouldn't we, guys?

251
00:10:59,635 --> 00:11:00,735
Yeah, absolutely.

252
00:11:00,736 --> 00:11:01,736
You said it, babe.

253
00:11:01,737 --> 00:11:03,804
Yeah, Chinese Peter very hungry.

254
00:11:03,805 --> 00:11:05,439
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down there, Lois.

255
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,742
Just 'cause they're my kids
and they all look like me

256
00:11:07,743 --> 00:11:09,644
doesn't mean we have anything in common.

257
00:11:16,151 --> 00:11:17,653
Daddy.

258
00:11:31,684 --> 00:11:36,089
I've never felt proud of any
of my children until now.

259
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:41,676
This is so exciting.

260
00:11:41,677 --> 00:11:45,079
For years, I have dreamed of
one day traveling from Bavaria

261
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,448
to play the accordion
for my birth family.

262
00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:48,449
May I?

263
00:11:53,251 --> 00:11:55,114
I have just one question for you.

264
00:11:55,857 --> 00:11:58,159
What are those?!

265
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,161
Oh, I get that because this comedy

266
00:12:00,162 --> 00:12:02,029
has just made it to Germany.

267
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,665
Wow, you look exactly like me.

268
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,534
Yes, I'm not actually part

269
00:12:06,535 --> 00:12:08,202
of sperm donation thing.

270
00:12:08,203 --> 00:12:09,837
I'm your secret clone.

271
00:12:09,838 --> 00:12:13,359
We have been<i> Orphan Black-ed</i>
and you soon will be dead.

272
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,015
Meg, where are you?

273
00:12:20,016 --> 00:12:21,700
I'm right here, Mom.

274
00:12:22,734 --> 00:12:24,852
Well, look at your fine ass.

275
00:12:24,853 --> 00:12:26,355
Are you talking to me?

276
00:12:26,356 --> 00:12:27,621
Damn right.

277
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,057
I've been looking
around this whole house

278
00:12:29,058 --> 00:12:30,158
for something to nibble on.

279
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,459
I think I just found it.

280
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,362
So many confusing feelings!

281
00:12:34,363 --> 00:12:35,731
- Dad.
- Sex.

282
00:12:35,732 --> 00:12:36,865
Black woman.

283
00:12:36,866 --> 00:12:39,134
Historically-low mortgage rates.

284
00:12:39,135 --> 00:12:42,069
Ah! I got to go buy a house.

285
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,237
Lois, Lois.

286
00:12:43,238 --> 00:12:45,072
Can I keep the little person Peter?

287
00:12:45,073 --> 00:12:46,808
No. They're too much work.

288
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:48,543
But I'll take care of it. I promise.

289
00:12:48,544 --> 00:12:50,911
You always say that, and
I'm the one who ends up

290
00:12:50,912 --> 00:12:53,247
feeding him and walking him
and doing all the clean up.

291
00:12:53,248 --> 00:12:55,183
Excuse me, I'm a candidate

292
00:12:55,184 --> 00:12:57,552
for a doctorate in Classics at Wesleyan.

293
00:12:57,553 --> 00:12:59,739
It talks! Lois, it talks!

294
00:13:04,843 --> 00:13:06,394
Whoa, that was close.

295
00:13:06,395 --> 00:13:08,896
You almost dipped one of
your yabbos in the marinara.

296
00:13:08,897 --> 00:13:10,164
Let me help you with those.

297
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:12,433
Well, thank you. That's so sweet.

298
00:13:12,434 --> 00:13:14,903
You're the first person who
looks anything like my husband

299
00:13:14,904 --> 00:13:16,605
who's offered to help in any way.

300
00:13:16,606 --> 00:13:18,173
Oh, you must be Peter's wife, Lois.

301
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:19,173
I'm Larry.

302
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:21,776
It's nice to meet you, Larry.

303
00:13:21,777 --> 00:13:24,463
Weird hands-full pinky shake?

304
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:28,350
I got to tell you, it's so strange,

305
00:13:28,351 --> 00:13:31,285
you look so much like Peter
when I first met him.

306
00:13:31,286 --> 00:13:33,587
Well, I'm guessing you look
exactly the same, too.

307
00:13:33,588 --> 00:13:34,923
You're in such great shape.

308
00:13:34,924 --> 00:13:38,427
Well, I do have tiny blue
weights in my garage.

309
00:13:47,552 --> 00:13:49,036
Oh, hi, Larry.

310
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,638
Hi, Lois. Is Peter here?

311
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,707
Larry, it's only 2:00 in the afternoon.

312
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,809
Peter's still sleeping
off last night's party.

313
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,913
Then why... why are you still
in your pajamas and bathrobe?

314
00:13:57,914 --> 00:14:00,148
Oh, that's because I'm depressed.

315
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:02,650
Is that why that sad
Shel Silverstein blob

316
00:14:02,651 --> 00:14:03,818
is following you around?

317
00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:06,654
Who would ever me?

318
00:14:06,655 --> 00:14:08,088
Anyway, we didn't really get a chance

319
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:09,924
to finish our conversation yesterday,

320
00:14:09,925 --> 00:14:12,092
and I thought maybe we could
grab some lunch together.

321
00:14:12,093 --> 00:14:15,896
Huh. That would give me a
reason to get dressed today.

322
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:18,666
Oh. Would you, uh, like to join us?

323
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:21,836
That didn't sound like
a real invitation.

324
00:14:21,837 --> 00:14:25,358
See, this is why no one
ever wants to you.

325
00:14:29,427 --> 00:14:31,413
Thank you again for lunch, Larry.

326
00:14:31,414 --> 00:14:34,014
Sorry I drew so many Nazi
symbols on the place mat.

327
00:14:34,015 --> 00:14:35,951
- I was just nervous.
- That's okay.

328
00:14:35,952 --> 00:14:38,752
I just wish we hadn't gone
to a kosher restaurant.

329
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,087
Ugh, but look at me.

330
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,789
I got ice cream all over my fingers.

331
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,124
Do you have a napkin?

332
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,545
No, but let me help you clean it off.

333
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:57,606
Larry, are you turned on or starving?

334
00:14:57,607 --> 00:14:59,025
Can't it be both?

335
00:15:10,051 --> 00:15:11,452
- Mm.
- Mm.

336
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:14,021
Wow, Larry, that was unexpected.

337
00:15:14,022 --> 00:15:15,723
Shh, we'll discuss this later.

338
00:15:15,724 --> 00:15:17,958
- I have to get back to my high school...
- Oh.

339
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,493
- Where I work...
- Oh.

340
00:15:19,494 --> 00:15:20,794
- As a janitor...
- Oh.

341
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:23,063
- To pay for medical school...
- Oh.

342
00:15:23,064 --> 00:15:25,066
- That I'm building...
- Oh!

343
00:15:25,067 --> 00:15:27,086
- Out of Popsicle sticks.
- Oh.

344
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:37,569
That big one doesn't
blink a lot, does he?

345
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,736
Hey, Lois, where's your purse?

346
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,564
Me and some of my kids
are going to the movies.

347
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,507
By the way, Dwarf Peter died.

348
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,568
I didn't know what he ate,
so I gave him nothing.

349
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,611
His name was Tyler.

350
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,779
He had a name.

351
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,115
Everything you say, you say with pride.

352
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,283
I like that about you.

353
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,534
Anyway, where's Larry?

354
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:53,827
Maybe he wants to go to the movie.

355
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:54,828
Larry?

356
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,872
Why would I know where Larry is?

357
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:57,914
And who is Larry?

358
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:58,957
Well, never mind.

359
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,542
All right, everybody bring your phones

360
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,570
so we can text each
other during the movie.

361
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,201
Wow, you want to tell me what that was?

362
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:12,937
Oh, Brian, Larry and I sort
of crossed a line yesterday.

363
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:15,274
I don't know, he's just
so sweet and fun-loving,

364
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:16,349
and for God's sake,

365
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,584
he looks just like Peter
did when he was his age.

366
00:16:18,585 --> 00:16:19,752
Yeah, but...?

367
00:16:19,753 --> 00:16:23,289
Well, he kissed me and
I kind of let him.

368
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:26,193
I told him it could never
happen again and that...

369
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:27,693
What are you doing?

370
00:16:27,694 --> 00:16:30,930
Oh, I-I thought that was kind of
like, "I'm open for business."

371
00:16:30,931 --> 00:16:33,766
No! I'm confiding in a friend.

372
00:16:33,767 --> 00:16:36,636
Oh! You're the safe friend.

373
00:16:36,637 --> 00:16:39,872
Look, I feel awful about it,
but I told Larry that was it,

374
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,108
and we couldn't be anything
more than friends.

375
00:16:42,109 --> 00:16:43,309
So, you're still gonna see him?

376
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,745
Yes, of course; he's a nice young man

377
00:16:45,746 --> 00:16:47,446
and he's practically family.

378
00:16:47,447 --> 00:16:48,948
Lois!

379
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:51,217
No! Zoloft Blob, don't!

380
00:16:58,925 --> 00:17:00,259
Is everything okay?

381
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,928
Yeah, I-I'm fine, I just
hurt my neck this morning

382
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:05,631
vigorously nodding
approval to<i> Judge Judy.</i>

383
00:17:05,632 --> 00:17:07,933
Okay, all right, the doctor is in.

384
00:17:07,934 --> 00:17:09,669
Come on, back it up over here.

385
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,404
Somebody's got a neck massage coming.

386
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,638
Ah, right there.

387
00:17:12,639 --> 00:17:14,908
Okay, but let's keep this friendly.

388
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,910
You can choke me for just a second.

389
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,445
You know, maybe I should just go
ahead and do your whole back.

390
00:17:19,446 --> 00:17:21,782
Yeah, your bra strap is
getting in the way here.

391
00:17:21,783 --> 00:17:23,801
I'll just bite it off with my teeth.

392
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,987
Lois, is a president
stronger than a king?

393
00:17:27,988 --> 00:17:28,988
What the hell?!

394
00:17:28,989 --> 00:17:30,156
Oh, Peter.

395
00:17:30,157 --> 00:17:32,659
L-Look, calm down. We're just friends.

396
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,760
H-He's just giving me
a friendly massage.

397
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:36,529
A friendly massage?!

398
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,197
Yeah, and what do you care?

399
00:17:38,198 --> 00:17:40,534
When's the last time you
did anything nice for me?

400
00:17:40,535 --> 00:17:42,968
I ate that gross pasta you made.

401
00:17:42,969 --> 00:17:44,870
I might as well just tell you, Peter.

402
00:17:44,871 --> 00:17:46,640
I'm in love with Lois.

403
00:17:46,641 --> 00:17:48,541
I knew it the moment we kissed.

404
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:49,543
Kissed?!

405
00:17:49,544 --> 00:17:50,677
Is that true?!

406
00:17:50,678 --> 00:17:51,678
Yes, Peter, but I...

407
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,679
You son of a bitch!

408
00:18:17,404 --> 00:18:19,839
Everybody says, "We don't need
a homeowners' association.

409
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,173
That's stupid, Quagmire."

410
00:18:21,174 --> 00:18:23,860
Well, this is why a
homeowners' association.

411
00:18:50,103 --> 00:18:51,270
What the hell?!

412
00:18:51,271 --> 00:18:52,371
Lois?!

413
00:18:52,372 --> 00:18:53,739
What'd you do that for?

414
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,008
I thought you and him were
girlfriend and boyfriend.

415
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,043
He was not my boyfriend, Peter.

416
00:18:58,044 --> 00:19:00,913
And I wasn't about to stand by
and watch him kick your ass.

417
00:19:00,914 --> 00:19:02,415
I was holding my own there.

418
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,583
You were getting beat up.

419
00:19:03,584 --> 00:19:05,718
No, no, I meant I was
holding my own nuts

420
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:06,895
so he wouldn't kick them.

421
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:09,165
But if he's not your
boyfriend, why'd you kiss him?

422
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,733
He kissed me.

423
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:12,301
And I should've told you.

424
00:19:12,302 --> 00:19:14,970
I'm sorry if I hurt you, Peter.

425
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:18,174
I guess Larry just reminded me
of a younger version of you,

426
00:19:18,175 --> 00:19:19,675
and the truth is,

427
00:19:19,676 --> 00:19:22,577
I liked that he was paying
me a little attention,

428
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,647
the way you used to.

429
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,782
Maybe I have been
taking you for granted,

430
00:19:27,783 --> 00:19:29,584
but I promise I'll make it up to you.

431
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,419
I'll be the best husband ever.

432
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,988
You already are.

433
00:19:32,989 --> 00:19:34,990
For God's sakes, when
push came to shove,

434
00:19:34,991 --> 00:19:38,360
you stood toe-to-toe with a much
younger man and fought for me.

435
00:19:38,361 --> 00:19:40,495
Oh, hey, by the way, uh,
thanks, all my kids,

436
00:19:40,496 --> 00:19:41,863
for stepping in to help.

437
00:19:41,864 --> 00:19:43,165
Really, really appreciate that.

438
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,433
But you're right, Lois.
I'm gonna change.

439
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,170
I'm gonna do all the stuff for
you that Larry was doing.

440
00:19:48,171 --> 00:19:50,505
No, Peter, I don't need any of that.

441
00:19:50,506 --> 00:19:53,108
At our age, all I'm really
looking for in a husband

442
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,878
is someone who wants to watch
TV with me on a Saturday night

443
00:19:55,879 --> 00:19:58,046
and isn't afraid to
pop a zit on my back.

444
00:19:58,047 --> 00:20:00,048
"Afraid"? I love doing that.

445
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:01,216
It's like bubble wrap

446
00:20:01,217 --> 00:20:03,385
you get to have sex with
every now and then.

447
00:20:03,386 --> 00:20:06,455
I got a pretty good one
going right now, Peter.

448
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:08,056
You always do, Lois.

449
00:20:08,057 --> 00:20:09,692
I love you.

450
00:20:09,693 --> 00:20:11,712
Mm.

451
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:17,232
<i> From that day forward, Peter
and Lois never again...</i>

452
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:20,220
<i>Ooh, nope, sorry, there's
still another scene left.</i>

453
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,175
Well, Peter, turns out your
initial instinct was right.

454
00:20:27,176 --> 00:20:29,711
You never should've let any
of your children contact you.

455
00:20:29,712 --> 00:20:30,745
You said it.

456
00:20:30,746 --> 00:20:33,215
From now on, I'm making sure my sperm

457
00:20:33,216 --> 00:20:36,685
stays right where it belongs:
in the bathroom sink.

458
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:44,153

459
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,357
We have fun down here.
