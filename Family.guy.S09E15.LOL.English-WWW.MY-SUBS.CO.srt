<i>TV ANNOUNCER: We now return to
a later-season episode of Family Ties.</i>

13
00:00:37,986 --> 00:00:41,422
<i>Elise, have you noticed how
puberty has changed Jennifer?</i>

14
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:43,891
<i>Shh!
Keep your voice down.</i>

15
00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:48,529
<i>- I have a date with my boyfriend.
- Well, uh, have fun.</i>

16
00:00:48,597 --> 00:00:50,064
<i>You are to gather
grapes for wine</i>

17

<i>and prepare victuals
for my return.</i>

(phone rings)

19
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:58,973
- Griffin residence.
- Oh, hi, Peter.

20
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,774
Who is this?
How do you know my name?

21
00:01:00,842 --> 00:01:02,142
Give me back my son!

22
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:04,845
Peter, it's Carol,
your sister-in-law.

23
00:01:04,913 --> 00:01:06,480
Carol, how the hell are you?

24
00:01:06,548 --> 00:01:09,216
Not too good.
Jason left me.

25
00:01:09,284 --> 00:01:11,685
(choking up):
It's going to be my ninth divorce.

26
00:01:11,753 --> 00:01:14,371
- Oh, you know, just hanging out.
- Peter, give me the phone.

27
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:16,774
Carol, hi. What's up?

28
00:01:16,841 --> 00:01:19,093
Oh, my God, that's terrible.

29
00:01:19,144 --> 00:01:22,213
Well, you know, Carol sweetie,
we are always here for you.

30
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,431
Boy, Carol's lucky
to have a sister like Lois.

31
00:01:24,499 --> 00:01:25,633
You're telling me.

32
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,201
I always wanted a
brother or sister,

33
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:28,852
but instead I got a bro-ster.

34
00:01:28,937 --> 00:01:31,889
Hey, Peter,
you want to see my peginas?

35
00:01:31,957 --> 00:01:35,593
Uh... I... I...
I don't know.

36
00:01:39,147 --> 00:01:40,898
I'm just saying
that if you read somewhere

37
00:01:40,966 --> 00:01:42,616
that Gwen Stefani
was a grandmother,

38
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:44,535
you might not even bat an eye.

39
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:46,036
What the devil?
What's going on?

40
00:01:46,121 --> 00:01:47,671
Oh, I'm sorry, Stewie.

41
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:49,590
Your Aunt Carol's going
to be staying with us

42
00:01:49,658 --> 00:01:51,675
for a little while,
so she's going to need your room.

43
00:01:51,743 --> 00:01:53,310
Who the hell
do you think you are?

44
00:01:53,378 --> 00:01:54,561
Stop it this instant!

45
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:56,046
We're not going
to fit through there.

46
00:01:56,131 --> 00:01:58,515
Only circles can fit through
that rectangular doorway.

47
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,684
Oh, my God,
it's going right through.

48
00:02:00,769 --> 00:02:02,736
I... I got to get better at shapes.

49
00:02:04,472 --> 00:02:06,790
Hey, Stewie.
You going to sleep in here with us?

50
00:02:06,858 --> 00:02:08,659
Is this how you spend
your free time, fat-ass?

51
00:02:08,727 --> 00:02:10,978
Lying half-naked
on a bed in black socks

52
00:02:11,046 --> 00:02:12,379
at 11:30
in the morning?

53
00:02:12,447 --> 00:02:14,681
You want to play
with one of Daddy's socks?

54
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:16,233
What... Do I want to...
No, what...

55
00:02:16,301 --> 00:02:18,085
No, what...
What an odd request.

56
00:02:18,153 --> 00:02:20,387
Ah, the first one's always hard.

57
00:02:20,455 --> 00:02:22,373
There we go.

58
00:02:22,457 --> 00:02:24,792
The second one's easier,
'cause... toes.

59
00:02:24,859 --> 00:02:26,076
Ah, come on, fella.

60
00:02:26,978 --> 00:02:28,746
That's it.

61
00:02:28,813 --> 00:02:30,197
(yells)

62
00:02:30,265 --> 00:02:31,649
There you go.

63
00:02:31,716 --> 00:02:33,617
Create an adventure with that.

64
00:02:38,807 --> 00:02:41,875
- Carol, you're here.
- Hi, Lois.

65
00:02:41,943 --> 00:02:44,144
Oh, it's so wonderful
to see you.

66
00:02:44,212 --> 00:02:45,779
QUAGMIRE: Hey, need
some help with those bags?

67
00:02:45,847 --> 00:02:47,965
Ooh, well, yes.
Thank you so much.

68
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:50,884
Oh, it's my pleasure,
Lois's recently divorced sister.

69
00:02:50,952 --> 00:02:52,553
When I heard you
were coming to town,

70
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,954
I figured I should
introduce myself.

71
00:02:54,022 --> 00:02:55,422
(chuckles)
How you doing?

72
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,591
Well, not so good.

73
00:02:57,659 --> 00:02:59,560
You may have heard
that my husband left me.

74
00:02:59,627 --> 00:03:01,412
Oh, I'm so depressed.

75
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:04,848
- I mean, it can't always be my fault, right?
- Uh-huh.

76
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,984
- You know, at first I thought what I needed...
- Uh-huh.

77
00:03:07,052 --> 00:03:09,653
- Was the immediate loving physical touch of a new man.
- Uh-huh, yeah.

78
00:03:09,721 --> 00:03:12,256
But now I know what I
really need is a friend

79
00:03:12,324 --> 00:03:14,892
- to just sit and listen to my problems.
- Mm-hmm, uh-huh, uh-huh.

80
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,927
- I don't think that's too much to ask.
- No, uh...

81
00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:20,497
I mean, how come men always feel
like they can just use a woman?

82
00:03:20,565 --> 00:03:21,598
- You know?
- Yeah.

83
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,200
- I mean, we have feelings.
- Uh-huh.

84
00:03:23,268 --> 00:03:24,902
- We're people.
- Uh-huh, right.

85
00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:27,104
- It's like they all have the same mindset.
- Mm-hmm, uh-huh.

86
00:03:27,172 --> 00:03:29,640
- It's all about sex, sex, sex.
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

87
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,726
And there's so much
more to life than that.

88
00:03:32,794 --> 00:03:35,529
Twenty feet that way, please.

89
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:40,634
Oh, it's so great
to see you kids.

90
00:03:40,702 --> 00:03:43,270
Here. I brought you
all gifts from Texas.

91
00:03:43,338 --> 00:03:46,507
Meg, this is a bar of soap
with a scorpion in it.

92
00:03:46,574 --> 00:03:49,777
Stewie, this is a lollipop
with a desert spider in it.

93
00:03:49,844 --> 00:03:53,613
And Chris, this is a comb
made out of an armadillo shell.

94
00:03:53,665 --> 00:03:55,766
Now, just don't use it
to comb your hair

95
00:03:55,834 --> 00:03:58,135
and make promises
to women you won't keep.

96
00:03:58,203 --> 00:03:59,837
I probably just won't use it.

97
00:03:59,904 --> 00:04:01,538
Well, if you all don't mind,

98
00:04:01,606 --> 00:04:03,340
I'm going to freshen up
before dinner.

99
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,578
Mom, she's so sad and lonely.

100
00:04:07,645 --> 00:04:09,046
Look who the (bleep)'s talking.

101
00:04:09,114 --> 00:04:10,514
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

102
00:04:10,582 --> 00:04:12,549
It... It's just that
she's my sister.

103
00:04:12,617 --> 00:04:14,451
No wonder her husbands
all left her.

104
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,120
Well, that's what
her problem is.

105
00:04:16,187 --> 00:04:18,856
She has such low self-esteem
that every time a man shows her

106
00:04:18,923 --> 00:04:20,657
the slightest glimmer
of attention,

107
00:04:20,725 --> 00:04:22,459
she rushes
into something serious

108
00:04:22,527 --> 00:04:24,928
and gets her heart broken
like a teenage girl.

109
00:04:24,996 --> 00:04:27,164
Hey, Tyler.
You on your way to algebra?

110
00:04:27,232 --> 00:04:28,449
Yeah, I'll see you there.

111
00:04:28,516 --> 00:04:30,334
(sobbing loudly)

112
00:04:34,122 --> 00:04:37,341
You're awful!

113
00:04:37,425 --> 00:04:39,993

116
00:04:47,485 --> 00:04:50,220
Lois, thanks again for
letting me stay here.

117
00:04:50,288 --> 00:04:51,855
You can't imagine how it feels

118
00:04:51,923 --> 00:04:54,224
to have your heart
broken so many times.

119
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:57,494
Aunt Carol, Mom says you'd
make a great Florida whore.

120
00:04:57,562 --> 00:04:58,896
What does that mean?

121
00:04:58,963 --> 00:05:01,465
(forced laughing)

122
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:04,551
Oh, Chris,
I said that about Kate Hudson.

123
00:05:04,619 --> 00:05:07,237
You know, I always thought
I'd be a good Florida whore.

124
00:05:07,322 --> 00:05:11,892
Thanks to you, my hair stays
like this when we stop.

125
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,427
(doorbell rings)

126
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,448
Mayor West?
What are you doing here?

127
00:05:17,515 --> 00:05:18,949
I'm being a rascal

128
00:05:19,017 --> 00:05:21,919
and ringing people's doorbells
and running away.

129
00:05:21,986 --> 00:05:23,620
Then, what are you
still doing here?

130
00:05:23,688 --> 00:05:26,657
It's my first house.
I'm not very good at this.

131
00:05:26,724 --> 00:05:28,058
Hello.

132
00:05:28,126 --> 00:05:30,727
Well, dot dot dot, hello.

133
00:05:30,795 --> 00:05:32,563
Lois, aren't you
going to introduce me

134
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,764
to your handsome friend?

135
00:05:33,832 --> 00:05:34,998
Handsome?

136
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:37,584
(sputtering excitedly)
Wow!

137
00:05:37,652 --> 00:05:39,386
Oh, uh, sure.

138
00:05:39,454 --> 00:05:42,322
Carol, this is our town's mayor,
Adam West.

139
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,324
Mayor West,
this is my sister Carol.

140
00:05:44,392 --> 00:05:48,095
Well, hubba-hubba ding-ding,
who invented this thing?

141
00:05:48,163 --> 00:05:50,264
(giggles)

142
00:05:50,331 --> 00:05:52,366
I bet you say that
to all the girls.

143
00:05:52,433 --> 00:05:55,736
Only the ones I'm about to ask
to Friendly's for a Fribble.

144
00:05:55,803 --> 00:05:58,772
Well, I don't really have
any plans this afternoon.

145
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,391
Uh, Carol,
given your present situation,

146
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:02,926
it's possible that dating

147
00:06:02,994 --> 00:06:05,362
might not be such
a good idea right now.

148
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,265
Actually, Lois,
I think it's exactly what I need.

149
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,234
Hooray, it's a date!

150
00:06:10,301 --> 00:06:13,170
But we mustn't let
the local nobleman find out.

151
00:06:13,238 --> 00:06:16,373
Otherwise, he'll assert
his right of <i>prima noctus.</i>

152
00:06:16,441 --> 00:06:17,824
Oh, no, we're too late.

153
00:06:17,892 --> 00:06:20,727
Ah! I must bless this coupling
with my soggy English penis.

154
00:06:20,795 --> 00:06:23,947
Oh, no!

155
00:06:24,032 --> 00:06:26,650
Come hither,
that I may sire thee a dreary Brit!

156
00:06:30,288 --> 00:06:33,707
You ever wonder what
a seagull tastes like?

157
00:06:33,774 --> 00:06:35,942
You know, I actually have.

158
00:06:35,994 --> 00:06:38,078
I used to wonder,
but now I know.

159
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:39,413
And it's not good.

160
00:06:39,464 --> 00:06:40,947
It's great!

161
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:43,500
Wow, Adam.
I just have to tell you,

162
00:06:43,585 --> 00:06:45,802
I'm... I'm having
a terrific time.

163
00:06:45,887 --> 00:06:48,555
Me, too, Carol.
That was a great idea you had,

164
00:06:48,623 --> 00:06:50,624
about walking parallel
to the water.

165
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:52,726
It makes for a longer walk.

166
00:06:52,793 --> 00:06:56,296
See? We're already making
each other better people.

167
00:06:56,347 --> 00:07:00,367
Carol, I want to make this
a night you'll never forget.

168
00:07:01,636 --> 00:07:03,570
(gunshot)
(groans)

169
00:07:03,638 --> 00:07:05,872
- Oh, my.
- Right?

170
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:23,790
Oh, by the way,
I should tell you I've got aides.

171
00:07:23,858 --> 00:07:26,393
- What?
- Yeah, they're right over there waiting for me.

172
00:07:26,461 --> 00:07:28,262
Ready to go when you are, sir!

173
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:30,631
Poor guys.
They both have AIDS.

174
00:07:30,682 --> 00:07:32,783
Not okay!

175
00:07:36,771 --> 00:07:39,723
(laughing heartily)

176
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:42,259
Now let's hear your fake laugh.

177
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:43,727
How was your date, you guys?

178
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:46,146
Oh, Lois, it was wonderful.

179
00:07:46,214 --> 00:07:47,648
I wish it didn't have to end.

180
00:07:47,715 --> 00:07:49,232
Well, it's not over yet.

181
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,517
What do you mean?

182
00:07:50,568 --> 00:07:53,220
You're right, Carol.
It was a wonderful date.

183
00:07:53,288 --> 00:07:55,222
And I want to have
a million more,

184
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,158
every night of the week
for the rest of my life.

185
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:01,144
Carol Yastrzemski...

186
00:08:01,212 --> 00:08:03,480
Oh, please,
let that be your last name...

187
00:08:03,548 --> 00:08:05,449
Will you marry me?

188
00:08:05,516 --> 00:08:07,184
- What?
- Oh, Adam.

189
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:09,586
Yes, yes! Adam, I will!

190
00:08:09,654 --> 00:08:11,104
Carol, what are you doing?

191
00:08:11,172 --> 00:08:12,539
Are you crazy?

192
00:08:12,607 --> 00:08:13,840
You can't just jump
right back into...

193
00:08:13,908 --> 00:08:15,809
Lois, this is my life.

194
00:08:15,877 --> 00:08:17,477
And this is what I want.

195
00:08:17,545 --> 00:08:19,997
I will marry you,
Mayor Adam West!

196
00:08:20,064 --> 00:08:21,398
Oh, great!

197
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:24,201
I can't wait to tell
the gals at my singles group.

198
00:08:24,268 --> 00:08:27,137
Ah, come on.
This is the goal, isn't it?

199
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:32,859
Carol, I'm really not sure

200
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,028
you should be rushing into
another marriage right now.

201
00:08:35,126 --> 00:08:37,494
Well, Lois,
I appreciate your input,

202
00:08:37,562 --> 00:08:39,796
but I'm capable of
making my own decisions.

203
00:08:39,864 --> 00:08:41,181
Are you sure?

204
00:08:41,249 --> 00:08:42,616
I mean,
look at your track record.

205
00:08:42,684 --> 00:08:44,084
Nine divorces.

206
00:08:44,152 --> 00:08:45,852
Do you really enjoy being

207
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,121
Carol Pewterschmidt-Johnson-
Carrington-Stone-O'Craggity...

208
00:08:48,189 --> 00:08:51,191
Canseco-Shteinholtz-
Washington-Proudfoot-Fong?

209
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:53,593
Look, I know I have a bit
of a checkered past,

210
00:08:53,661 --> 00:08:56,263
but I believe in
love at first sight.

211
00:08:56,314 --> 00:08:58,715
Hey, Lois, I didn't flush.
I want you to come see it.

212
00:08:58,783 --> 00:08:59,950
Looks like the
Starbucks mermaid.

213
00:09:00,018 --> 00:09:02,219
Peter, Carol
is marrying Mayor West.

214
00:09:02,286 --> 00:09:04,788
- You serious?
- That's right, Peter.

215
00:09:04,856 --> 00:09:07,124
Say hello to your
future brother-in-law.

216
00:09:07,191 --> 00:09:08,592
Brother?

217
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,193
I don't know those other two words,
but brother?

218
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:11,728
I'm going to have a brother?

219
00:09:11,796 --> 00:09:14,097
Well, what we're discussing
is whether or not marriage

220
00:09:14,165 --> 00:09:17,067
is a smart move for Carol
at this point in time.

221
00:09:17,135 --> 00:09:19,369
I was hoping you might
be able to weigh in.

222
00:09:19,437 --> 00:09:20,937
I'm going to have a brother!

223
00:09:21,005 --> 00:09:22,889
Hey Adam,
want to go get in a fight

224
00:09:22,957 --> 00:09:25,042
- over the rules of a game we made up?
- Yep!

225
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,594
PETER:
Five points. I win.

226
00:09:27,662 --> 00:09:29,429
MAYOR WEST: That's not fair.
You weren't touching the bush.

227
00:09:29,497 --> 00:09:32,632
PETER: I was too touching the bush...
Oh, cool, this rock has mica.

228
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,900
MAYOR WEST:
Let me see!

229
00:09:33,968 --> 00:09:35,369
PETER: Don't touch it.
It's worth money!

230
00:09:37,638 --> 00:09:40,807
- I didn't know you rode bikes.
- I didn't know <i>you</i> rode bikes.

231
00:09:40,858 --> 00:09:42,225
Let's go butts-up and fast.

232
00:09:44,195 --> 00:09:45,979
Oh, no!
Patch of sand.

233
00:09:50,868 --> 00:09:52,519
Oh, my God!
Are you all right?

234
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,122
I'm fine.
Let's just keep riding bikes.

235
00:09:55,189 --> 00:09:56,973
Are you sure?
That was a wicked wipeout.

236
00:09:57,041 --> 00:10:00,293
(trying not to cry): I'm fine.
Can we just keep riding bikes, please?

237
00:10:04,098 --> 00:10:06,099
Thanks for coming
to dinner, Lois.

238
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:08,268
I know you have mixed
feelings about this.

239
00:10:08,336 --> 00:10:09,836
I was worried you'd say no.

240
00:10:09,904 --> 00:10:13,140
Actually, I was worried you'd
say "Beetlejuice" three times.

241
00:10:13,207 --> 00:10:15,375
'Cause if you say
"Beetlejuice" three times,

242
00:10:15,443 --> 00:10:19,179
then Beetle...
Oh, that was a close call.

243
00:10:19,247 --> 00:10:20,547
Oh, Carol.

244
00:10:20,615 --> 00:10:23,417
I would never miss any
of your meet-the-fiancé dinners.

245
00:10:23,484 --> 00:10:25,018
This is the tenth one.

246
00:10:25,086 --> 00:10:26,653
Oh, Lois.

247
00:10:26,721 --> 00:10:28,889
Well, Carol,
I'm just saying it's a big decision.

248
00:10:28,956 --> 00:10:30,390
Life is full of big decisions.

249
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,858
Like deciding whether or not

250
00:10:31,926 --> 00:10:33,260
you're going to have time
to masturbate.

251
00:10:33,327 --> 00:10:35,295
Peter, I'm going to run
and pick up Stewie.

252
00:10:35,363 --> 00:10:36,963
I'll be back in five
or ten minutes.

253
00:10:37,031 --> 00:10:38,498
Well, which is it?

254
00:10:38,566 --> 00:10:40,133
It's like I told you, Lois.

255
00:10:40,201 --> 00:10:41,902
This time it's different.

256
00:10:41,969 --> 00:10:45,338
Adam is the most kind and
attentive man I've ever known.

257
00:10:45,406 --> 00:10:46,907
Oh, that's interesting.

258
00:10:46,974 --> 00:10:49,876
'Cause I remember you saying
the same exact thing about Evan.

259
00:10:49,944 --> 00:10:51,344
Isn't that right, Evan?

260
00:10:51,412 --> 00:10:54,581
Yeah. Yeah, I do remember
her saying that about me.

261
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:56,233
Evan. What are
you doing here?

262
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,601
I brought him.

263
00:10:57,668 --> 00:10:59,870
Lois, you didn't tell me
you were bringing Evan here.

264
00:10:59,937 --> 00:11:01,671
We bonded over
the Red Sox one time,

265
00:11:01,739 --> 00:11:03,857
and now he's got to bring it up
every time I see him.

266
00:11:03,925 --> 00:11:05,375
How about those Red Sox, Peter?

267
00:11:05,443 --> 00:11:07,360
Yeah, how about 'em, Evan?
They exist.

268
00:11:07,428 --> 00:11:08,795
How about last season, huh?

269
00:11:08,863 --> 00:11:10,330
- Yep.
- How about next season?

270
00:11:10,398 --> 00:11:11,665
We'll see.

271
00:11:11,732 --> 00:11:13,500
Ho ho, I'm going
to hold you to that.

272
00:11:13,568 --> 00:11:16,203
Look, I see what you're
trying to do, Lois.

273
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,505
And then there was your
second husband, Randall,

274
00:11:18,573 --> 00:11:19,973
who you called your soul mate.

275
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,625
Oh, God, not that guy.

276
00:11:21,692 --> 00:11:23,960
He always comes bearing
really inconvenient gifts.

277
00:11:24,028 --> 00:11:25,395
Hey, you guys.

278
00:11:25,463 --> 00:11:28,431
Peter, I brought you some
saltwater tropical fish.

279
00:11:28,499 --> 00:11:30,300
Now, you got to feed
'em every two hours,

280
00:11:30,368 --> 00:11:31,668
and I fed 'em an hour ago.

281
00:11:31,736 --> 00:11:33,203
Uh, all right.
You got the food?

282
00:11:33,271 --> 00:11:34,554
No, I don't have the food.

283
00:11:34,622 --> 00:11:36,223
You get that at a
tropical fish store.

284
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:39,559
- It's 9:30 at night.
- Well, you better get going.

285
00:11:39,627 --> 00:11:41,645
Son of a bitch.

286
00:11:41,712 --> 00:11:44,181
And then there was your
third husband, Doggie Daddy,

287
00:11:44,248 --> 00:11:45,549
but you couldn't make it work

288
00:11:45,616 --> 00:11:47,934
'cause he had that son
from a previous marriage.

289
00:11:48,002 --> 00:11:50,370
- Hey, Carol.
- Oh, hey.

290
00:11:50,438 --> 00:11:51,872
Just want to let you know,

291
00:11:51,939 --> 00:11:54,040
Auggie's all grown up now,
out of the house.

292
00:11:54,108 --> 00:11:55,976
So... You know...

293
00:11:56,043 --> 00:11:58,211
Anyway, I'm around.

294
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:00,680
This is really insensitive
of you, Lois.

295
00:12:00,748 --> 00:12:02,916
Do you have any idea
how difficult it is

296
00:12:02,984 --> 00:12:04,284
for me to see
my ex-husbands?

297
00:12:04,352 --> 00:12:06,119
That's my point, Carol.

298
00:12:06,187 --> 00:12:08,388
This is the kind of pain
I'm trying to spare you

299
00:12:08,456 --> 00:12:09,990
from experiencing
all over again.

300
00:12:10,057 --> 00:12:13,026
Why can't you just let me be
happy with the man I love?

301
00:12:13,094 --> 00:12:17,330
Carol, if you marry him,
you're just going to get hurt again.

302
00:12:17,398 --> 00:12:18,732
Is that what you want?

303
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:21,001
Well... No.

304
00:12:21,068 --> 00:12:22,752
Look at these men.

305
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,554
Are you psychologically able

306
00:12:24,622 --> 00:12:26,473
to deal with this pain
a tenth time?

307
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,909
Oh, my God.

308
00:12:28,976 --> 00:12:31,011
Lois, you're right.

309
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:33,230
Adam... I'm sorry.

310
00:12:33,297 --> 00:12:34,798
I can't marry you.

311
00:12:34,866 --> 00:12:36,216
What?

312
00:12:36,284 --> 00:12:37,918
B... But, Carol...

313
00:12:37,985 --> 00:12:41,238
I'm so sorry, Adam.
(sobbing)

314
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:46,526
(sobbing)

315
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:51,264
I think you sh...
should go now, Lois.

316
00:12:51,332 --> 00:12:52,699
I... I can't.

317
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:54,100
My husband took the car.

318
00:12:57,355 --> 00:12:59,222
Hey... No, yeah.
No, I know it's late.

319
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,640
I just need some
tropical fish food.

320
00:13:02,126 --> 00:13:04,077
Come on, where the hell
am I supposed to go?!

321
00:13:04,145 --> 00:13:05,395
You're in there!

322
00:13:06,948 --> 00:13:08,415
Don't worry, fish.

323
00:13:08,482 --> 00:13:10,033
I'm going to take care of you,

324
00:13:10,101 --> 00:13:12,586
'cause I know one day
you'll do the same for me.

325
00:13:12,653 --> 00:13:15,438
I'm sorry, but your friend
doesn't have insurance.

326
00:13:15,523 --> 00:13:18,541
I don't care what it costs.
Just make this man well again.

327
00:13:18,609 --> 00:13:20,143
Thank you, fish.

328
00:13:23,867 --> 00:13:27,670
<i>MAN (over TV): We now return to
Germany's most popular late-night talk show,</i>

329
00:13:27,685 --> 00:13:29,586
<i>Still Awake with Otto von Stade.</i>

330
00:13:29,654 --> 00:13:31,889
<i>Some weather we're having.</i>

331
00:13:31,956 --> 00:13:34,558
<i>Okay.
I was recently in Munich.</i>

332
00:13:34,626 --> 00:13:36,827
<i>Did you ever notice how
the government buildings there</i>

333
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,662
<i>are quite well-maintained?</i>

334
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,464
<i>Okay.
We have no guest.</i>

335
00:13:40,531 --> 00:13:41,765
<i>Good night.</i>

336
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,268
Oh, how you holding up, Carol?

337
00:13:44,335 --> 00:13:45,702
Not so good.

338
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,522
Look, I know you're
depressed about Mayor West,

339
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:51,425
but I promise you made
the right decision.

340
00:13:51,492 --> 00:13:52,793
Just give yourself some time,

341
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,028
and I'm sure you'll feel
much better about it.

342
00:13:55,096 --> 00:13:57,464
STEWIE: She says that to Meg a lot,
so that's not good.

343
00:13:57,532 --> 00:13:58,799
You're probably right.

344
00:13:58,866 --> 00:14:00,634
(sighs)
Oh, well.

345
00:14:00,702 --> 00:14:03,337
I guess I just better
go call all my friends

346
00:14:03,404 --> 00:14:05,505
and tell them
the wedding is off.

347
00:14:05,573 --> 00:14:07,457
(knocking)

348
00:14:09,794 --> 00:14:11,295
Oh, hi, Mayor West.

349
00:14:11,362 --> 00:14:12,496
Hi, Lois.

350
00:14:12,563 --> 00:14:14,865
I just wanted to return
Peter's Bedazzler.

351
00:14:14,933 --> 00:14:19,202
Tell him I never even
opened the box.

352
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,470
Wait, Mayor West.

353
00:14:20,521 --> 00:14:22,372
Okay, I might have
opened the box.

354
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,557
But listen,

355
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:26,476
could you also say good-bye
to Carol for me?

356
00:14:26,544 --> 00:14:28,645
Good-bye?
Where are you going?

357
00:14:28,713 --> 00:14:31,181
As of today,
I'm stepping down as mayor

358
00:14:31,249 --> 00:14:33,150
and leaving Quahog forever.

359
00:14:33,217 --> 00:14:34,418
Because of Carol?

360
00:14:34,485 --> 00:14:35,886
That's right.

361
00:14:35,954 --> 00:14:38,689
I've decided to move to Alaska
and become an Eskimo.

362
00:14:38,756 --> 00:14:40,190
Alaska?

363
00:14:40,258 --> 00:14:41,959
But that's so far away.

364
00:14:42,026 --> 00:14:43,360
And the summers are so short.

365
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:45,963
- Yay.
- Summer's here.

366
00:14:46,014 --> 00:14:47,714
Awesome.

367
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,433
- Best summer ever.
- Let's stay friends.

368
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,167
- I lost my virginity.
- Yeah, right. To who?

369
00:14:51,219 --> 00:14:53,053
You don't know her.
I met her at camp.

370
00:14:56,457 --> 00:14:58,175
Peter, what are you doing?

371
00:14:58,242 --> 00:15:00,127
- I'm running away.
- Why?

372
00:15:00,194 --> 00:15:02,095
Because you took away
my brother!

373
00:15:02,163 --> 00:15:03,730
You ruined my life!

374
00:15:03,798 --> 00:15:05,365
Adam and I were going
to be brothers forever,

375
00:15:05,433 --> 00:15:06,800
and now he's gone!

376
00:15:06,868 --> 00:15:09,603
All you got there is toys
and cans of tuna fish.

377
00:15:09,671 --> 00:15:11,905
Well, I got to eat.
And I got to have fun.

378
00:15:11,973 --> 00:15:13,273
Peter, you're just acting out.

379
00:15:13,341 --> 00:15:14,675
No, I'm not.
I'm acting in.

380
00:15:14,742 --> 00:15:16,443
Okay, now you're just saying
the opposite of what I say.

381
00:15:16,511 --> 00:15:18,328
No, I'm not. I'm saying
the same as what you say.

382
00:15:18,396 --> 00:15:19,313
- Peter.
- Lois.

383
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,781
- God.
- Allah.

384
00:15:20,848 --> 00:15:23,550
Look, I'm not sacrificing
my sister's happiness

385
00:15:23,618 --> 00:15:25,185
so you can have a playmate.

386
00:15:25,253 --> 00:15:26,953
She and Mayor West
never would've made it.

387
00:15:27,021 --> 00:15:28,488
Oh, yeah?
Well, nobody believed we'd make it,

388
00:15:28,573 --> 00:15:29,906
and look at us now.

389
00:15:29,957 --> 00:15:31,825
I drink, and you use
sex as a weapon.

390
00:15:31,893 --> 00:15:34,061
That seems to me like a
successful New England marriage.

391
00:15:34,128 --> 00:15:35,495
Oh, come on, Peter.

392
00:15:35,563 --> 00:15:37,531
My parents may have been
against our relationship,

393
00:15:37,598 --> 00:15:39,333
but a lot of people
supported us.

394
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,334
Oh, yeah? Like who?

395
00:15:40,401 --> 00:15:42,636
Well, like... Like Carol.

396
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,571
God, if it wasn't
for her support,

397
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,824
I don't know that I would've had
the confidence to marry you.

398
00:15:47,892 --> 00:15:50,143
And now that she
needs my support,

399
00:15:50,228 --> 00:15:52,162
here I am abandoning her.

400
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,630
Oh, my God.

401
00:15:53,681 --> 00:15:55,949
Peter, I've made
a terrible mistake.

402
00:15:56,017 --> 00:15:57,451
Well, that's what
I tried to tell you,

403
00:15:57,518 --> 00:15:59,786
but you were as stubborn as
a pigeon at an ad agency.

404
00:15:59,854 --> 00:16:01,505
(all talking)

405
00:16:01,572 --> 00:16:06,326
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys,
these are all good ideas,

406
00:16:06,394 --> 00:16:08,595
but I think what people
really get excited about

407
00:16:08,663 --> 00:16:10,414
is dropped museum popcorn.

408
00:16:10,481 --> 00:16:12,749
But this is an ad campaign
for a Nissan SUV.

409
00:16:12,817 --> 00:16:16,620
- How does that possibly...?
- Phil, Phil, Phil, Phil.

410
00:16:16,687 --> 00:16:18,789
I was put in charge
of this meeting.

411
00:16:18,856 --> 00:16:22,025
And we're going with
dropped museum popcorn.

412
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:31,251
I'd like one ticket
to Alaska, please.

413
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:32,419
One-way.

414
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:44,414
(sighs)

415
00:16:44,482 --> 00:16:46,283
(tires squealing)

416
00:16:49,654 --> 00:16:52,906
Has the... Has the 4:10 flight
to Alaska left yet?

417
00:16:52,974 --> 00:16:54,207
I'm afraid so.

418
00:16:54,292 --> 00:16:55,709
That... That's it right there.

419
00:17:00,181 --> 00:17:02,983
(sobbing):
Oh, no, we're too late.

420
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,518
I'm sorry, Carol.

421
00:17:04,585 --> 00:17:07,604
But if it helps, you're not the
first person to get a bum deal.

422
00:17:07,672 --> 00:17:11,541
Mr. Edison, we're going to use
your invention to power the world.

423
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:13,610
And Mr. Tesla,
we're going to use yours

424
00:17:13,678 --> 00:17:15,228
in the background
of Frankenstein movies.

425
00:17:15,296 --> 00:17:16,663
Aw, I wanted that one.

426
00:17:20,468 --> 00:17:22,803
I am so sorry, you guys.

427
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,504
This is all my fault.

428
00:17:24,572 --> 00:17:26,106
It's okay, Lois.

429
00:17:26,174 --> 00:17:28,742
I know you tried your best
to make things right.

430
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,278
Well, since I ain't got no
brother to play army guys with,

431
00:17:31,345 --> 00:17:32,879
I might as well go to the Clam.

432
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,701
Hey, Quagmire, it's me.
Meet me at the Clam in twenty.

433
00:17:37,768 --> 00:17:39,636
<i>That sounds great, Peter,
but I can't right now.</i>

434
00:17:39,704 --> 00:17:41,104
Oh, crap. Why not?

435
00:17:41,172 --> 00:17:42,172
'Cause I'm working.

436
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,557
I'm flying a plane to Alaska.

437
00:17:43,624 --> 00:17:45,242
Alaska? What the hell?

438
00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:47,127
I never even heard
of this place an hour ago,

439
00:17:47,211 --> 00:17:48,044
and now everybody's
flying there.

440
00:17:48,112 --> 00:17:49,212
What did you say?

441
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,964
Quagmire's flying to Alaska?

442
00:17:51,032 --> 00:17:53,116
Peter, that's the plane
Mayor West is on!

443
00:17:53,184 --> 00:17:55,152
Oh, I get what
you're driving at.

444
00:17:55,219 --> 00:17:57,737
If Carol can't have Mayor West,
no one can.

445
00:17:57,805 --> 00:17:59,473
Quagmire, I want you
to crash that plane.

446
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,707
No survivors, you hear me?

447
00:18:00,775 --> 00:18:02,576
Peter, for God sakes, no.

448
00:18:02,643 --> 00:18:04,478
Tell him
to turn the plane around.

449
00:18:04,545 --> 00:18:05,879
Oh, hey, listen, Quagmire,

450
00:18:05,947 --> 00:18:07,647
turn the plane around
and bring it back here.

451
00:18:07,715 --> 00:18:09,049
Peter, I can't do that.

452
00:18:09,116 --> 00:18:10,550
The FAA would be
all over my ass.

453
00:18:16,824 --> 00:18:18,859
Um, hey Quagmire,
you know that stray cat

454
00:18:18,926 --> 00:18:21,077
- we got in our neighborhood?
- The pregnant one?

455
00:18:21,145 --> 00:18:22,946
Yep, she's having
her kittens right now.

456
00:18:23,014 --> 00:18:24,898
(gasps)
Oh, no way.

457
00:18:24,966 --> 00:18:26,299
Yeah, making all those
high-pitched

458
00:18:26,367 --> 00:18:30,020
- "mew mew" noises and everything.
- I love them already.

459
00:18:30,087 --> 00:18:32,355
- Yeah, but Brian's been eyeing them pretty good.
- What?

460
00:18:32,423 --> 00:18:34,224
Yeah, and I got to go
to work now.

461
00:18:34,292 --> 00:18:35,926
So I hope he's not, like,
hungry or nothing.

462
00:18:37,078 --> 00:18:38,345
This is your captain speaking.

463
00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:39,779
We've discovered a shoe bomb
on board.

464
00:18:39,847 --> 00:18:41,431
We're going to have to return
to the terminal.

465
00:18:52,677 --> 00:18:55,862
Hello, Alaska!

466
00:18:55,947 --> 00:18:56,947
Adam!

467
00:18:57,014 --> 00:18:58,248
Carol?

468
00:19:04,005 --> 00:19:06,606
I don't know
what I was thinking.

469
00:19:06,691 --> 00:19:08,208
I made nine mistakes,

470
00:19:08,276 --> 00:19:10,944
and I was afraid that I was
going to make another one.

471
00:19:11,012 --> 00:19:13,530
And you know what?
I almost did.

472
00:19:13,597 --> 00:19:17,067
Adam, I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

473
00:19:17,134 --> 00:19:19,002
Oh, Carol.

474
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,904
Nothing would make me happier.

475
00:19:28,746 --> 00:19:31,414
Hey, you know,
when it's your turn to say, "I do,"

476
00:19:31,482 --> 00:19:33,483
you should say,
"I do the Dew," and then...

477
00:19:33,551 --> 00:19:35,385
and then we both pull
out a Mountain Dew,

478
00:19:35,453 --> 00:19:36,786
and then I'll... I'll...
And then I do,

479
00:19:36,854 --> 00:19:38,588
like, a radical skateboard
jump off the altar.

480
00:19:38,656 --> 00:19:40,490
Well, obviously, yeah.

481
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:43,727
("Bridal Chorus" playing)

482
00:19:48,032 --> 00:19:50,000
Good luck.

483
00:19:50,067 --> 00:19:51,468
I hope you like weird boobs.

484
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,608
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here

485
00:19:58,676 --> 00:20:02,045
to join this man and
this woman in holy matrimony.

486
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:04,681
The bride and groom
have written their own vows.

487
00:20:04,749 --> 00:20:07,817
Adam, from the first
day I met you,

488
00:20:07,885 --> 00:20:10,353
I knew that we were
meant to be together.

489
00:20:10,421 --> 00:20:12,055
I know I've said that before...

490
00:20:12,123 --> 00:20:13,323
a lot of times...

491
00:20:13,391 --> 00:20:15,292
and it's always
blown up in my face.

492
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:16,326
QUAGMIRE:
Giggity.

493
00:20:16,394 --> 00:20:17,560
But this time it's different.

494
00:20:17,628 --> 00:20:19,462
I know it's going to work.

495
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,664
I love you...

496
00:20:20,731 --> 00:20:23,133
and I'll be proud
to be your wife.

497
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,722
That was lovely.

498
00:20:24,812 --> 00:20:25,745
Adam?

499
00:20:26,914 --> 00:20:29,449
Milk. Butter. Cat food.

500
00:20:29,517 --> 00:20:32,118
Those new potato chips
in the snack aisle.

501
00:20:32,186 --> 00:20:35,722
Beer. Deodorant.
Garbage bags. Toothpaste.

502
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,691
Adam, I think that's
your shopping list.

503
00:20:37,758 --> 00:20:39,726
No. These are my vows.

504
00:20:39,794 --> 00:20:42,462
They're all the reasons
why I'll always love you.

505
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,197
Oh, Adam.

506
00:20:44,265 --> 00:20:46,399
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

507
00:20:46,467 --> 00:20:48,602
You may kiss the bride.

508
00:20:51,289 --> 00:20:53,857
Oh, Peter, I'm so happy
for the both of them.

509
00:20:53,925 --> 00:20:56,934
Hey, I just realized...
I have a sister.

510
00:20:59,229 --> 00:21:00,671
Ha. Stand much?

511
00:21:00,696 --> 00:21:04,496
