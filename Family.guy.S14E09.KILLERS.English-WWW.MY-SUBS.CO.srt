00:00:34,108 --> 00:00:35,841
Hey, great idea bringing
the couch out here

13
00:00:35,876 --> 00:00:37,576
from your den, Peter.
Yeah, Lois and I

14
00:00:37,611 --> 00:00:39,878
dragged it out here last night
for a little hump sesh,

15
00:00:39,913 --> 00:00:41,480
so I figured I'd let it dry.

16
00:00:41,515 --> 00:00:43,448
"Couch." That's
one of those words

17
00:00:43,484 --> 00:00:46,585
that if you say it over and over
it starts to sound silly.

18
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,920
Joe, you need to take
a class on small talk.

19
00:00:48,956 --> 00:00:51,590
You're not gonna believe
this-- I'm in one.

20
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,825
It sure is cloudy today.

21
00:00:53,861 --> 00:00:56,361
Good. You could have
also responded to Janet,

22
00:00:56,397 --> 00:00:58,397
who said her son died.

23
00:00:58,432 --> 00:01:02,234
I'm sorry your son died
on such a cloudy day.

24
00:01:07,274 --> 00:01:09,207
All right, kids,
here's your bacon.

25
00:01:09,243 --> 00:01:11,610
I call the paper towel!
Aw, damn it!

26
00:01:11,645 --> 00:01:14,646
Ha-ha! You got to move fast
when Meg's at the table, Brian.

27
00:01:14,681 --> 00:01:17,582
All right, well, I get the box
when we have pizza for dinner.

28
00:01:17,618 --> 00:01:19,384
(muffled): Uh-uh. It
doesn't work that way.

29
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,520
You got to call it
when it's happening.

30
00:01:21,555 --> 00:01:23,155
Good morning, family.
I'll be out front

31
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,823
with the guys
if anybody needs me.

32
00:01:24,858 --> 00:01:26,491
Peter, I thought
we were gonna try

33
00:01:26,527 --> 00:01:28,393
to get the garden going
again today.

34
00:01:28,429 --> 00:01:31,930
I know, sweetie, but then
I realized how stupid that is.

35
00:01:31,965 --> 00:01:34,766
Okay, bye. You guys
are my everything.

36
00:01:34,802 --> 00:01:36,301
Why'd you ever marry him?

37
00:01:36,336 --> 00:01:39,771
Believe it or not, he used to
look like a young Gene Hackman.

38
00:01:39,807 --> 00:01:42,707
That's... that-that's
not even good.

39
00:01:42,743 --> 00:01:43,909
It's gone!

40
00:01:43,944 --> 00:01:45,243
What? What's gone?

41
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:47,779
Our drinking couch!
Somebody must've stole it!

42
00:01:47,815 --> 00:01:49,481
You left a couch
out on the curb?

43
00:01:49,516 --> 00:01:51,883
Well, somebody probably thought
it was trash and took it.

44
00:01:51,919 --> 00:01:54,252
You said you were gonna bring
the couch right back in!

45
00:01:54,288 --> 00:01:56,922
What were you thinking?
I'll tell you what I was thinking.

46
00:01:56,957 --> 00:01:59,091
I was thinking we lived
in a safe neighborhood.

47
00:01:59,126 --> 00:02:00,725
But apparently,
I was wrong!

48
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:03,728
Wait, you're saying
you were wr-wr...

49
00:02:03,764 --> 00:02:04,996
wr-wro...

50
00:02:05,032 --> 00:02:06,264
wr-wrrr...

51
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,934
Oh, I get it--
the Fonz can't say "wrong."

52
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:12,237
No, Peter, he's 70--
he's having a stroke.

53
00:02:17,044 --> 00:02:18,910
Wow, Peter, I think
starting a community watch

54
00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:19,818
is a great idea.

55
00:02:19,843 --> 00:02:21,701
Yeah, I even got shirts
made up for us.

56
00:02:22,382 --> 00:02:23,648
This is quality work.

57
00:02:23,684 --> 00:02:25,984
Where did you get these?
Via the Web?

58
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:27,185
Hey, listen, Joe, um,

59
00:02:27,221 --> 00:02:29,187
you think you
can get us all guns?

60
00:02:29,223 --> 00:02:30,689
No, Peter,
they're too dangerous.

61
00:02:30,724 --> 00:02:32,991
Besides, you can't
just go<i> get</i> a gun,

62
00:02:33,026 --> 00:02:35,193
you have to be certified
in gun safety,

63
00:02:35,229 --> 00:02:37,377
go through an extensive
background screening process.

64
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:38,064
Got 'em.

65
00:02:38,065 --> 00:02:40,031
Whoa. How'd you
get 'em so quick?

66
00:02:40,067 --> 00:02:42,367
Eh, it was easy-- like
pressing that "easy" button

67
00:02:42,402 --> 00:02:44,202
at the office
supply store.

68
00:02:44,238 --> 00:02:46,037
Hey, thanks for all your help.
No problem.

69
00:02:46,073 --> 00:02:47,800
Why don't you go ahead
and hit the "easy" button.

70
00:02:47,824 --> 00:02:49,104
Okay.

71
00:02:50,077 --> 00:02:53,011
What did I just do?
Don't worry about it.

72
00:02:56,917 --> 00:02:59,484
Hey, Quagmire,
you're a sex guy.

73
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,687
You watch any good,
uh... pornos lately?

74
00:03:02,723 --> 00:03:04,956
I mean...
I-I guess.

75
00:03:04,992 --> 00:03:06,525
So what's your pleasure?

76
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,193
What kind of
movies you like?

77
00:03:08,228 --> 00:03:10,529
I don't know.
MILF stuff's kind of cool.

78
00:03:10,564 --> 00:03:12,464
What-what about you?

79
00:03:12,499 --> 00:03:14,933
Me? I have very
particular tastes.

80
00:03:14,968 --> 00:03:17,402
I like a soapy bottom.
What?

81
00:03:17,437 --> 00:03:19,070
Soft-core
soaped-up butts,

82
00:03:19,106 --> 00:03:21,072
like from a PG-13
camp movie.

83
00:03:21,108 --> 00:03:23,508
I can't get enough of it.
Drives me wild.

84
00:03:23,544 --> 00:03:25,343
Okay, let's talk
about something else.

85
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:28,446
All right. Uh...

86
00:03:28,482 --> 00:03:30,615
it's kind of too cool
for the air-conditioner

87
00:03:30,651 --> 00:03:32,584
and too warm for
the heater, huh?

88
00:03:32,619 --> 00:03:33,885
(groans)

89
00:03:33,921 --> 00:03:36,721
Ah, got to walk
that boner off, huh?

90
00:03:36,757 --> 00:03:38,356
Yeah.

91
00:03:41,295 --> 00:03:43,161
Hey, guys, you
better come with me.

92
00:03:43,197 --> 00:03:45,597
There's some weird, big-nose
guy hiding in the bushes

93
00:03:45,632 --> 00:03:47,566
outside some
chick's house.

94
00:03:47,601 --> 00:03:48,934
(whispering
inaudibly)

95
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:51,436
"My heart always
timidly hides itself

96
00:03:51,471 --> 00:03:53,071
behind my mind."

97
00:03:53,106 --> 00:03:54,272
(whispers)

98
00:03:54,308 --> 00:03:56,274
"I set out
to bring down stars

99
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,542

100
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:00,278
(punches landing)
"Ow. Ow.

101
00:04:00,314 --> 00:04:03,148
"Oh, my God,
four men are beating me.

102
00:04:03,183 --> 00:04:05,550

I think it is broken.

103
00:04:05,586 --> 00:04:07,052
"Who are you guys?

104
00:04:07,087 --> 00:04:08,587

"I'll give you anything if
you would only stop hitting me.

00:04:12,092 --> 00:04:14,059
"Please stop pulling my nose.

107
00:04:14,094 --> 00:04:15,460
"It is not fake.

108
00:04:15,495 --> 00:04:17,295
"I think I am dying.

109
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:19,931
Please take me to the hospital."

110
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:21,600
Your words have bewitched me.

111
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:23,602
I need your arms around me.

112
00:04:23,637 --> 00:04:25,470
(whispers): Come to
my chamber at once.

113
00:04:25,505 --> 00:04:27,005
"Come to my chamber
at once."

114
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,642
And bring pound cake.
"And bring pound cake."

115
00:04:34,514 --> 00:04:35,947
Peter, please
come to bed.

116
00:04:35,983 --> 00:04:37,482
Enough of the
community watch.

117
00:04:37,517 --> 00:04:39,818
We live on a very
safe street.

118
00:04:39,853 --> 00:04:42,254
Lois, you wouldn't believe
the things we see out there.

119
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:45,290
There was a kid riding his bike
while holding a tennis racket.

120
00:04:45,325 --> 00:04:47,792
For real.
Come on! Let's fool around,

121
00:04:47,828 --> 00:04:49,261
or watch a movie,

122
00:04:49,296 --> 00:04:52,197
or finally click that
"Crackle" icon on the TV.

123
00:04:52,232 --> 00:04:54,532
Lois, I am
an unelected vigilante,

124
00:04:54,568 --> 00:04:56,801
and I take my job
very seriously.

125
00:04:56,837 --> 00:04:58,803
Like Serious George.

126
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,705
Hey, George, want
to go to the park?

127
00:05:00,741 --> 00:05:02,540
Uh, thank you, but no.

128
00:05:02,576 --> 00:05:05,076
It's a beautiful day--
lots of mischief to get into.

129
00:05:05,112 --> 00:05:06,344
I don't doubt that,

130
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,380
but as you can see,
I'm pretty busy.

131
00:05:08,415 --> 00:05:10,849
I'm trying to get
a head start on my taxes.

132
00:05:10,884 --> 00:05:13,351
Oh, I see-- trying
to figure out a way

133
00:05:13,387 --> 00:05:15,053
to deduct<i> bananas?</i>

134
00:05:15,088 --> 00:05:17,822
Ah. 'Cause I eat
bananas. Terrific.

135
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:20,392
Hey, your inside,
so don't wear a hat.

136
00:05:20,427 --> 00:05:23,828
Unless you're leaving,
which would be terrific also.

00:06:25,974 --> 00:06:27,407
to help me
remember them.

157
00:06:27,443 --> 00:06:30,077
No, it's okay.
Our last name is Brown.

158
00:06:30,112 --> 00:06:31,378
(exhales):
Oh, okay. Phew.

159
00:06:31,413 --> 00:06:34,214
Ah, then this must be
"Chubster Dumb-Dumb."

160
00:06:34,249 --> 00:06:35,549
(loud clattering)

161
00:06:35,584 --> 00:06:37,384
NURSE:
I'm sorry, sir. No visitors.

162
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:40,454
Excuse me, I'll have you know
I'm the shooter!

163
00:06:40,489 --> 00:06:42,022
So, uh, how's he doing?

164
00:06:42,057 --> 00:06:44,257
"How's he doing"?!
How do you think he's doing!

165
00:06:44,293 --> 00:06:45,926
You shot my son!

166
00:06:45,961 --> 00:06:47,427
Look, Cleveland,
I-I'm real sorry.

167
00:06:47,463 --> 00:06:50,530
I thought someone was breaking
into your house, and I panicked.

168
00:06:50,566 --> 00:06:52,332
It was dark. I-I...
I don't know why

169
00:06:52,368 --> 00:06:53,867
he didn't just say
it was him.

170
00:06:53,902 --> 00:06:55,936
I couldn't hear you.
I was listening to music,

171
00:06:55,971 --> 00:06:58,705
I went to turn it down,
and the next thing I know.

172
00:06:58,741 --> 00:07:00,181
you shot me!

173
00:07:00,205 --> 00:07:01,509
Why the hell were you
climbing in the window

174
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,909
of your own house
anyway?

175
00:07:02,945 --> 00:07:04,711
My dad says opening the door

176
00:07:04,747 --> 00:07:06,646
lets out too much
air-conditioning.

177
00:07:06,682 --> 00:07:08,648
I already have a bullet
in my son,

178
00:07:08,684 --> 00:07:10,517
I don't need one
in my wallet.

179
00:07:10,552 --> 00:07:13,153
You wouldn't have fired
that gun if he was white!

180
00:07:13,188 --> 00:07:14,855
That's not true--
I'll shoot anybody.

181
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,256
Joe, give me
your gun.

182
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,657
Here you go...
Hey, wait a second!

183
00:07:17,693 --> 00:07:19,659
Look, let's all just calm down.

184
00:07:19,695 --> 00:07:20,761
Calm down?!

185
00:07:20,796 --> 00:07:22,596
I want this racist
out the room,

186
00:07:22,631 --> 00:07:24,164
and I want him arrested!

187
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:26,433
Racist? I put these
gloves on for everybody.

188
00:07:26,468 --> 00:07:28,135
Oh, oh, you're
talking to him.

189
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,904
Look, the police department has
deemed the shooting accidental.

190
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:33,540
Given the circumstances,
Peter was within his rights

191
00:07:33,575 --> 00:07:34,975
to fire his weapon.

192
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,245
And what about my son's rights
not to be<i> shot?!</i>

193
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,746
Look, Cleveland...

194
00:07:39,782 --> 00:07:41,448
Lat... Latisha?

195
00:07:41,483 --> 00:07:43,316
I thought he had a gun.

196
00:07:43,352 --> 00:07:46,086
I'd never want to do anything
to hurt you or your family.

197
00:07:46,121 --> 00:07:47,154
You're my friend.

198
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:48,321
I<i> was</i> your friend.

199
00:07:48,357 --> 00:07:49,556
Now, get out of here!

200
00:07:49,591 --> 00:07:51,925
You're nothing but
a worthless bigot!

201
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,930
Wow, I really messed up.

202
00:07:56,965 --> 00:08:00,200
I haven't felt this bad since
I drove by that speed sign.

203
00:08:08,076 --> 00:08:09,609
Aw...

204
00:08:20,088 --> 00:08:22,155
Hey, does anybody know
if Cleveland's coming by?

205
00:08:22,191 --> 00:08:24,558
I was hoping to apologize
and collect his deposit

206
00:08:24,593 --> 00:08:27,394
for the community watch shirts.
I talked to him earlier.

207
00:08:27,429 --> 00:08:30,030
He, uh, he doesn't want
to be anywhere near you.

208
00:08:30,065 --> 00:08:32,332
Hey, look-- they're talking
about the shooting.

209
00:08:32,367 --> 00:08:33,633
Good evening.
Two nights ago

210
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:36,403
there was a shooting right here
in our own backyard.

211
00:08:36,438 --> 00:08:39,773
The victim: a 14-year-old boy
named Cleveland Brown Jr.

212
00:08:39,808 --> 00:08:42,309
Joining me tonight is
his father, Cleveland Brown.

213
00:08:42,344 --> 00:08:45,412
So that's not really Quahog?
It's just a big picture?

214
00:08:45,447 --> 00:08:48,081
Now, Mr. Brown, I understand
you're trying to get the police

215
00:08:48,116 --> 00:08:49,583
to reopen the investigation.

216
00:08:49,618 --> 00:08:51,985
That's right, Tom.
My family and I believe

217
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:55,355
this shooting was a hate crime,
and we'd like to see Mr. Griffin

218
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,357
held accountable
for his actions.

219
00:08:57,392 --> 00:08:58,959
Hate crime? That's crazy!

220
00:08:58,994 --> 00:09:00,360
I love<i> all</i> people!

221
00:09:00,395 --> 00:09:02,362
I love blacks, I love Asians...

222
00:09:02,397 --> 00:09:04,731
hell, I even love
gay Aborigines.

223
00:09:04,766 --> 00:09:05,899
(blowing deep tone)

224
00:09:06,902 --> 00:09:09,035
(blowing deep tone)

225
00:09:09,071 --> 00:09:12,072
(electronic dance beat playing)

226
00:09:16,745 --> 00:09:19,212
Wow, this is
just great, Peter.

227
00:09:19,248 --> 00:09:21,448
Everyone in town
hates us now.

228
00:09:21,483 --> 00:09:24,150
The cashier at the grocery store
told her to "push on,"

229
00:09:24,186 --> 00:09:25,652
and then
she snapped her fingers,

230
00:09:25,687 --> 00:09:28,822
and now I think she's my new
favorite lady in the world.

231
00:09:28,857 --> 00:09:31,391
I don't understand.
I'm not a racist.

232
00:09:31,426 --> 00:09:33,693
It's well documented
that my dream three-way

233
00:09:33,729 --> 00:09:36,796
is S. Epatha Merkerson
and CCH Pounder.

234
00:09:36,832 --> 00:09:38,265
S., this is CCH.

235
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,633
CCH, this is S.

236
00:09:39,668 --> 00:09:41,868
It is my intention
that we conduct this

237
00:09:41,904 --> 00:09:44,304
with both sexiness
and dignity.

238
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:46,006
Peter, this is a
hot-button issue.

239
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,074
I mean, you shot an
African-American kid.

240
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,477
Of<i> course</i> this isn't
just gonna go away.

241
00:09:50,512 --> 00:09:53,046
Well, there's got to be something
I can do to make things right.

242
00:09:53,081 --> 00:09:55,582
I'll just have to prove to everybody
that I'm not a racist.

243
00:09:55,617 --> 00:09:57,817
How are you gonna do that?
Well, for starters,

244
00:09:57,853 --> 00:09:59,619
I'm gonna head over
to the YMCA.

245
00:09:59,655 --> 00:10:01,488
There's nothing
black guys like more

246
00:10:01,523 --> 00:10:04,724
than out-of-shape
indoor-basketball white guys.

247
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,359
(derisive laughter)

248
00:10:06,395 --> 00:10:09,162
Hey! I'm trying
my best here.

249
00:10:09,197 --> 00:10:11,798
And trying is
what matters most of all.

250
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:12,966
You're right, Peter.

251
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:14,701
We need to give
you a chance,

252
00:10:14,736 --> 00:10:16,503
no matter what
color your skin is.

253
00:10:16,538 --> 00:10:18,405
Come on, let's
play some ball.

254
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:23,209
"...and then Peter and his
new friends went for ice cream."

255
00:10:23,245 --> 00:10:24,844
The end.

256
00:10:26,048 --> 00:10:28,715
Okay, kids, are your parents
out of the room?

257
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,953
Good. Let's get back
to<i> Sloppy Floppers</i> magazine.

258
00:10:37,526 --> 00:10:38,992
What are you doing?

259
00:10:39,027 --> 00:10:41,194
Lois, to show I'm in touch
with what it's like

260
00:10:41,229 --> 00:10:43,496
to be African-American,
I am gonna go to the middle

261
00:10:43,532 --> 00:10:46,433
of the town square, get naked
and paint myself brown.

262
00:10:46,468 --> 00:10:48,501
No, no, that's
offensive.

263
00:10:48,537 --> 00:10:50,103
You can't pretend
to be black.

264
00:10:50,138 --> 00:10:51,438
That's a stupid idea.

265
00:10:51,473 --> 00:10:53,206
What?
It's a stupid idea!

266
00:10:53,241 --> 00:10:56,876
You're a stupid man!
A stupid, stupid man!

267
00:10:56,912 --> 00:10:59,713
Ow, you're hurting me!
Stop it, stop it, Lois!

268
00:10:59,748 --> 00:11:02,549
No! I'm so sick
of your crap.

269
00:11:02,584 --> 00:11:04,918
Why do you always
do these stupid things?

270
00:11:04,953 --> 00:11:08,188
And why do you always announce
them to me before you do them?

271
00:11:08,223 --> 00:11:10,757
Are you trying
to get a rise out of me?

272
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:14,361
Are you happy now?
Is this what you want?

273
00:11:14,396 --> 00:11:15,996
Oh, no,
it's not what I want!

274
00:11:16,031 --> 00:11:19,532
It's not what I want.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

275
00:11:19,568 --> 00:11:20,900
(Peter sobbing)

276
00:11:20,936 --> 00:11:23,603
It's never been this bad before.
What do we do?

277
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:26,039
What we always do.

278
00:11:26,074 --> 00:11:29,843
I'm in charge of my head--
that much I know!

279
00:11:35,017 --> 00:11:37,017
What the hell
are you doing on my property?

280
00:11:37,052 --> 00:11:39,085
Look, it's time we
bury the hatchet.

281
00:11:39,121 --> 00:11:40,654
So I brought a bottle
of your favorite booze.

282
00:11:40,689 --> 00:11:43,089
Now let's just have a drink
and put this all behind us.

283
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,758
I don't want
nothing from you.

284
00:11:44,793 --> 00:11:46,559
Well, hold on,
I got something else.

285
00:11:46,595 --> 00:11:48,995
Cigars. We can smoke 'em
together, all happy,

286
00:11:49,031 --> 00:11:51,164
like a bunch of douche bags
outside a wedding.

287
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:52,465
Peter, get out of here.

288
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:54,768
I'm never gonna forgive you
for what you did.

289
00:11:54,803 --> 00:11:56,803
Aw, come on.
This'll change your mind.

290
00:11:59,641 --> 00:12:01,641
Oh, my God!
Quick, do something!

291
00:12:04,413 --> 00:12:06,413
It's not working.
Get rid of it!

292
00:12:07,949 --> 00:12:09,249
(all murmuring)

293
00:12:12,921 --> 00:12:13,987
(all gasp)

294
00:12:14,022 --> 00:12:15,655
Get your family
out of that house!

295
00:12:15,691 --> 00:12:17,490
If they don't leave,
they'll die.

296
00:12:17,526 --> 00:12:19,392
Round up your family
and get out

297
00:12:19,428 --> 00:12:20,527
or you're all
gonna be sorry.

298
00:12:20,562 --> 00:12:22,062
Get out, now!

299
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:23,363
(all gasp)

300
00:12:23,398 --> 00:12:25,432
See, kids, I told you
we'd make friends here.

301
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:28,268
I guess me getting transferred
by the Xerox Corporation

302
00:12:28,303 --> 00:12:30,704
wasn't the worst thing
after all.

303
00:12:30,739 --> 00:12:32,405
(loud, overlapping shouting)

304
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:33,907
(siren toots)

305
00:12:33,942 --> 00:12:38,311
(loud, overlapping shouting)

306
00:12:38,346 --> 00:12:40,346
Oh, thank God, Joe.

307
00:12:40,382 --> 00:12:42,982
Are you here to give me the
deposit for the shirts?

308
00:12:43,018 --> 00:12:44,951
No, Peter, I'm here to place you
under arrest

309
00:12:44,986 --> 00:12:47,253
for the attempted murder
of Cleveland Junior.

310
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:49,622
What are you talkin' about?
You know it was an accident.

311
00:12:49,658 --> 00:12:52,225
Yeah, but let's just say,
public opinion has shifted.

312
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,861
And the boys upstairs said
they can no longer ignore it.

313
00:12:54,896 --> 00:12:56,830
Who the hell are
the "boys upstairs?"

314
00:12:56,865 --> 00:12:58,631
I have no idea.
There's no elevator.

315
00:12:58,667 --> 00:12:59,899
But whoever they are,

316
00:12:59,935 --> 00:13:01,801
they're pretty steamed
about this whole thing.

317
00:13:03,105 --> 00:13:04,437
Peter, what-what's
going on?

318
00:13:04,473 --> 00:13:06,039
They're taking me to jail!

319
00:13:06,074 --> 00:13:07,207
Oh, my God!

320
00:13:07,242 --> 00:13:08,541
Don't worry, Dad!

321
00:13:08,577 --> 00:13:11,277
I'll send you a cake
with a file in it!

322
00:13:12,781 --> 00:13:15,648
These are just the owner manuals
for all our kitchen appliances.

323
00:13:15,684 --> 00:13:17,383
Well, guess I finally have time

324
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:20,019
to learn to reset the clock
on the coffee maker.

325
00:13:20,055 --> 00:13:22,489
MORGAN FREEMAN:
<i>He never did.</i>

326
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:30,908
You're-you're, uh...

327
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:32,643
you're not gonna
rape me, are you?

328
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,378
Of course I'm not
gonna rape you.

329
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,714
I'm gonna make you
fall in love with me.

330
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,983
Then... we'll
see what happens.

331
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:42,620
Oh, no.
It's already working.

332
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,755
Griffin, you have a visitor.

333
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,757
Carter? What are
you doing here?

334
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:48,059
Hello, Griffin.

335
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:50,194
I'd like to talk to you
about these charges

336
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,629
that have been
brought against you.

337
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,631
Why don't we go somewhere
a little more private?

338
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,734
I, uh, guess I'll see you
in a little bit?

339
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,836
It's gonna feel
like an eternity.

340
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:02,607
How is it that I'm only
just now meeting you?

341
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:06,277
Look, Carter, you
got to believe me.

342
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,846
I didn't shoot Cleveland
Junior because he was black!

343
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,748
Hey, you don't have
to tell me that.

344
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,451
But the media's out there
making you look like a monster,

345
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:16,354
all for exercising
your constitutional rights.

346
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,688
Grover's a monster.

347
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:19,857
But don't worry.
We're gonna get you out of this.

348
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,525
I'll be damned
if I'm gonna sit back

349
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:23,594
and let them do this
to one of my own.

350
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,663
What, you mean your family?
Huh?

351
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,198
Oh, yeah, yeah, that.
Yeah, right.

352
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,000
Look, I'm gonna
bail you out of here,

353
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,535
set you up with my lawyer,
and get these charges dropped.

354
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:32,803
Well, how you gonna do that?

355
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:34,538
Don't worry.
I'll come up with a good story,

356
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:35,773
and they'll eat it up.

357
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,009
Not like when I read
my<i> JAG</i> fan fiction

358
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,578
at the<i> NCIS</i> convention.

359
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,113
"JAG stood up and yelled,

360
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,515
"'Objection, Your Honor,
by Navy law.'

361
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,417
"He then turned
to the lady lawyer,

362
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:48,486
"the gal from the October<i> Maxim,</i>

363
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:49,887
"who still managed to be hot

364
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,456
"despite her sexless,
pageboy haircut.

365
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,125
Or perhaps because of it."

366
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,593
Boo!
Terrible!

367
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,896
Right branch of the military,
wrong investigative arm!

368
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,534
(loud crowd chatter)

369
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,537
And I was trying to
get back into my house,

370
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,907
and my neighbor,
Mr. Griffin, shot me.

371
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,876
He said
he felt threatened by me,

372
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,478
and that hurt even worse
than getting shot!

373
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:16,080
GALLERY:
Aw!

374
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,049
Your Honor, permission
to hug the witness?

375
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,617
Granted.

376
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,153
(crying)

377
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:23,621
Don't worry,
Mr. Griffin.

378
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:24,955
You're every bit
as sympathetic

379
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:26,791
as this chubby-cheeked
cocoa angel.

380
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:29,060
I haven't been listening.
What's goin' on?

381
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,761
I don't think it's
lost on any of us

382
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:32,697
that the laws are
written on white paper.

383
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:35,166
Yeah, white paper.
Check your jacket pocket.

384
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,335
"I don't think it's
lost on any of us

385
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,236
that the laws are
written on white paper."

386
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,671
Hey, look,
I'm just saying,

387
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:43,307
it's no surprise that
justice isn't colorblind.

388
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:45,076
Check your other
jacket pocket.

389
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,477
"Hey, look, I'm just saying

390
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,579
it's no surprise that
justice isn't colorblind."

391
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,847
Stewie, you're a jerk!

392
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,282
Check Chris' pocket.

393
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,757
What? There's nothing
in here, and...

394
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,286
Oh, God, the bottom of the
pocket's been cut out!

395
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:56,554
Thanks, Brian!

396
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:59,824
I was the mastermind
behind this whole thing!

397
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:01,759
Your witness.

398
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,327
All right, watch this.

399
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:06,297
This is where we take control
of the situation.

400
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,666
Mr. Brown, you testified
that you were listening to music

401
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,067
at the time of the shooting.

402
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:11,268
That's right.

403
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:14,271
And isn't Jay-Z music?
Yes.

404
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:17,708
And doesn't he have the lyrics,
"I put the gun to you.

405
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:19,877
"I'll kill ya, I'll chop ya up,

406
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,646
put ya inside the mattress
like drug money"?

407
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:23,981
(gallery gasping)

408
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:27,485
I was listening
to Neil Sedaka's Hanukkah album.

409
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,086
And isn't true
that your last name

410
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:30,821
is the same
as Chris Brown's?

411
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:32,790
Yes, but I don't see what--

412
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,892
And what did Chris Brown
do to Rihanna?

413
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,461
He hit her, like,
a hundred times.

414
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,363
Your Honor, I'd like
to enter into evidence

415
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,766
this photo of a
badly beaten Rihanna

416
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:44,435
as well as this print ad
for the<i> Entourage</i> movie.

417
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,470
Why?!

418
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,871
I can't unsee this!

419
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:48,139
Who is this for?!

420
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,407
What's he doing?

421
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:51,409
He's making Cleveland Jr.
look like a thug.

422
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:52,777
I know.
That's the idea.

423
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:54,912
You don't want to go
back to jail, do you?

424
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,619
I don't know.

425
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,354
Maybe.

426
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:06,056
Mr. Brown, please
pick up this knife.

427
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:07,691
Aah!
He's got a knife!

428
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:09,059
(crowd gasping)

429
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:11,095
(grunting)

430
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,570
This isn't fair!

431
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:22,006
They're making my son
look like a common hoodlum!

432
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,441
Joe, you're a cop!

433
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:24,742
Do something!

434
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,844
No, the soap
covers everything.

435
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,713
You might see, like, the
very top of the crack,

436
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:32,516
but that's-that's
not what it's about.

437
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:39,290
How do you sleep
at night?

438
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:41,525
Propped up on pillows,
on account of my fat throat.

439
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,661
If I lay flat on
my back, I die.

440
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:46,230
I need pillows
between my thighs myself.

441
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,432
And this friendship
is over!

442
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,736
(crowd clamoring in anger)

443
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,778
Thanks for letting me
sit in the back.

444
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,346
I was flipping people
off the whole way.

445
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,815
(laughs)

446
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:06,851
Get out of here,
all of you!

447
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:10,488
My son didn't do
anything wrong!

448
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:13,491
(crowd clamoring in anger)

449
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:16,794
Carter, I think this has
all kind of gone too far.

450
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:17,795
What do you think
you're doing?

451
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,097
I'm gonna make this right.

452
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:22,833
Everyone!
Everyone!

453
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:24,902
Listen, I have
something to say.

454
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,638
Cleveland Jr. doesn't
deserve any of this.

455
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,940
All those things you heard
about Cleveland Jr. were lies.

456
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:32,343
He didn't do anything to me.

457
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:34,612
He's a good kid,
from a good family.

458
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:37,948
I just got scared,
and I did something stupid.

459
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:40,224
I swear, it had nothing to do
with the color of his skin,

460
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:43,454
but... I did shoot him.

461
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:48,192
I deserve to be held
responsible for my actions.

462
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,661
Even if that means
going to jail.

463
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:51,829
You heard him,
other cops.

464
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,597
Let's take him in.

465
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,065
He doesn't know
our names, does he?

466
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:56,700
I don't think he does.

467
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:01,605
Wait a minute.

468
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,607
Peter didn't shoot my son.

469
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,175
I did.

470
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:06,343
(crowd gasps)

471
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:08,312
Peter was just taking
the blame for me.

472
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:11,048
He's a good friend.

473
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,385
Eh, Mr. Brown,
what exactly are you saying?

474
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,420
I'm saying that I,
Cleveland Brown,

475
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:17,888
a black man,

476
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:19,523
shot Cleveland Brown, Jr.,

477
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,825
another black man.

478
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:26,630
Wait, wh-where
did everybody go?

479
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,399
You want to make
the media go away?

480
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:31,168
Just mention
black-on-black crime.

481
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:33,337
Boy, the world
we live in, huh?

482
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:35,739
Brian, reach into
Meg's pocket.

483
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:37,141
Go ahead, Brian.

484
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,843
I-I-I don't want to.

485
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:42,079
Cleveland,
why did you do that?

486
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:45,182
Peter, since this is about
racism, why don't we take

487
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:49,119
a slow, hands-clasped-behind-
the-back walk together?

488
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:51,322
Listen, I know you wouldn't
have shot Cleveland Jr.

489
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,257
on account of his race.

490
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,225
You shot him because
you're stupid.

491
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:57,661
That's all
I'm trying to say!

492
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,763
And I know you don't
have hate in your heart.

493
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,299
You were willing to go to jail
for shooting my son.

494
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:04,535
You took responsibility.

495
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,870
That's what's important.

496
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:09,239
So... you forgive me?

497
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:11,408
Of course I do.

498
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:14,678
Oh, thanks, Cleveland.

499
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,447
Hey, how you
feeling there, champ?

500
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:17,681
I'm good.

501
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,183
Getting better
every day.

502
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,684
Aw, I'm happy
to hear that.

503
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,754
Look, I-I hope
you know I'm sorry.

504
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,556
Hey, these things happen.

505
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,458
That's my boy.

506
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:31,362
Mr. Griffin?
Yeah?

507
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,596
Just so you know,

508
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:34,531
I'm gonna be coming
for your ass.

509
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,133
Wh-What's that now?

510
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,635
I'm saying it's on!

511
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,637
You ever feel the cool steel

512
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:42,673
of a switchblade
pressed against your temple?

513
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:45,943
(laughs)
He Mr. Griffin,

514
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,444
I'm just kidding.

515
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,612
Or am I?

516
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:51,015
You're gonna wonder about that,
you fat bitch.

517
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:51,906
See you later!

518
00:20:51,907 --> 00:20:55,407
