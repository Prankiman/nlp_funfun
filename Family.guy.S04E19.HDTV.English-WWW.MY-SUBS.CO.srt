1
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:36,286
How did you sleep, Peter?

2
00:00:36,373 --> 00:00:40,286
Last night I had this crazy dream I was
eating a sheep and now my pillow's gone.

3
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:43,285
Wait. Here it is.
What the hell was I eating?

4
00:00:47,053 --> 00:00:48,930
Sorry.

5
00:01:03,453 --> 00:01:06,604
See you, Lois.
And like I tell you every day,

6
00:01:06,693 --> 00:01:10,971
if I come back in the afternoon and you're
having sex with somebody, I'll kill you both.

7
00:01:11,053 --> 00:01:15,763
"Thanks to effective treatments,
Magic Johnson down to one AID."

8
00:01:16,693 --> 00:01:20,288
Oh, God. Did I hit that deaf kid again?
They ought to put a bell on that guy.

9
00:01:22,773 --> 00:01:25,810
The nurse says Brian
won't be out of surgery for three hours.

10
00:01:25,893 --> 00:01:28,327
- I hope he's gonna be OK.
- Me too.

11
00:01:28,413 --> 00:01:30,722
I know we're not here to place blame,

12
00:01:30,813 --> 00:01:34,203
but I can't help feeling like
this is somehow Meg's fault.

13
00:01:34,293 --> 00:01:36,932
I just can't stand the thought
of losing Brian.

14
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:40,244
If he dies, I'll have to start hanging out
with The Rock again.

15
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:45,168
One's a baby
and the other's black, I think.

16
00:01:45,253 --> 00:01:48,962
At least part black. Or Hispanic.

17
00:01:49,053 --> 00:01:53,808
I think, possibly there's some Filipino
in there. Yeah, possibly some Filipino.

18
00:01:53,893 --> 00:01:57,886
I mean, if he's black, it's definitely diluted.

19
00:01:57,973 --> 00:02:00,646
I mean, one of his parents must be white.

20
00:02:00,733 --> 00:02:04,328
What the hell is Jessica Alba, for that matter?

21
00:02:04,413 --> 00:02:08,167
If I were 40 years younger,
I would plough that till next July.

22
00:02:10,493 --> 00:02:16,204
<i>Today I'm going to show you this fascinating
episode of Nova that I taped at home for you.</i>

23
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:21,767
- Are you coming back to bed, Rob?
- Hang on, honey. My jaw keeps locking up.

24
00:02:21,853 --> 00:02:25,004
<i>Well, that's not Nova at all, is it?</i>

25
00:02:25,093 --> 00:02:27,163
That's a sex tape I made with my wife.

26
00:02:27,253 --> 00:02:30,882
Of course, nobody here
is interested in seeing that. Are they?

27
00:02:30,973 --> 00:02:34,886
Probably not. No. OK. You kind of
looked like you were nodding. No? OK.

28
00:02:34,973 --> 00:02:38,761
OK, we should get back to work.
Next up, does everyone have a lab partner?

29
00:02:38,853 --> 00:02:39,922
- I don't.
- Me neither.

30
00:02:40,013 --> 00:02:42,846
- She can be my partner.
- Sarah, that's irresponsible.

31
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:45,401
- Meg is awful.
- You wanna be my lab partner?

32
00:02:45,493 --> 00:02:47,484
- Really?
- Sure. You seem nice.

33
00:02:47,573 --> 00:02:50,371
- Do you wannajoin my after-school club?
- Sure.

34
00:02:50,453 --> 00:02:54,969
Now open your books to page... I'm sorry.
Can I show this video of me doing my wife?

35
00:02:57,173 --> 00:03:00,768
- Here we are, Brian, safe and sound.
- I don't need to be in a wheelchair.

36
00:03:00,853 --> 00:03:05,085
No arguments. I already went through
the trouble of borrowing this ramp from Joe.

37
00:03:05,173 --> 00:03:09,166
- I'll see you, honey. I'll be back in a...
- Joe, are you all right?

38
00:03:09,253 --> 00:03:12,643
Don't help me up.
I need to retain my independence.

39
00:03:13,453 --> 00:03:16,172
- You need anything from the market?
- Power bar!

40
00:03:18,653 --> 00:03:23,090
What's wrong, Brian? You've just been
sitting on the couch ever since you got back.

41
00:03:23,173 --> 00:03:26,768
- You need to get out of the house.
- I don't know. I'm a little depressed.

42
00:03:26,853 --> 00:03:31,244
The accident got me thinking about life
and how suddenly it can be taken away.

43
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:34,803
You're gonna feel back to normal
in no time. Here, have some food.

44
00:03:34,893 --> 00:03:37,726
- I'm not hungry.
- Here comes the gravy.

45
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:43,049
You messy beast.

46
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:47,922
Well, hello there, Meg.

47
00:03:48,013 --> 00:03:50,163
I can't be seen talking to you any more.

48
00:03:50,253 --> 00:03:52,813
I have friends now,
and some of them very popular.

49
00:03:52,893 --> 00:03:55,487
I know. I heard Sarah is your lab partner.

50
00:03:55,573 --> 00:03:58,531
All those years of you rejecting me
finally make sense.

51
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,205
What do you mean?

52
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:05,888
Oh, my God!

53
00:04:11,453 --> 00:04:13,205
Meg. There you are.

54
00:04:13,293 --> 00:04:15,602
Everybody, this is our newest member, Meg.

55
00:04:15,693 --> 00:04:19,686
- Hi, Meg.
- Hi, you gays... guys... girls.

56
00:04:19,773 --> 00:04:23,288
Listen, Sarah. I can't be in your club.
I'm not a lesbian.

57
00:04:23,373 --> 00:04:26,365
You can't be serious.
We had a whole party planned for you.

58
00:04:26,453 --> 00:04:28,569
Really? A party? For me?

59
00:04:28,653 --> 00:04:30,803
But I guess if you're not a lesbian...

60
00:04:30,893 --> 00:04:36,172
Wait, wait! You didn't let me finish. I'm not
a lesbian. I'm a super huge mega-lesbian!

61
00:04:36,253 --> 00:04:39,006
Oh, good!
You'll fit in with the other mega-lesbians.

62
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:56,129
Wow! I feel so socially accepted.

63
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:59,205
Do you have any other friends
to invite to your party?

64
00:04:59,293 --> 00:05:02,603
No, most of my friends are out of town.

65
00:05:02,693 --> 00:05:06,527
This is going to be great.
We'll stay up late, trade stories...

66
00:05:06,613 --> 00:05:11,129
Let's watch the video
of my ballet recital.

67
00:05:11,213 --> 00:05:12,965
Here it is.

68
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,722
Sunshine Bear! Wait!

69
00:05:27,893 --> 00:05:29,884
- Hey, how's it going?
- Good.

70
00:05:29,973 --> 00:05:34,967
Those are huge! Those are huge boobs.
And you know what's nice?

71
00:05:35,053 --> 00:05:40,047
That you don't have that blue vein up there
that some of the bigger ones get.

72
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:42,886
What? I said you don't have that.

73
00:05:42,973 --> 00:05:47,410
- Hey, buddy. You're not looking so good.
- Who cares how I look? Nothing matters.

74
00:05:47,493 --> 00:05:49,643
We could all die tomorrow, every one of us.

75
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:52,406
Isn't that a damn good reason
to live it up today?

76
00:05:52,493 --> 00:05:54,563
Come on. It can't be that simple.

77
00:05:54,653 --> 00:05:57,451
Excuse me. I got a thing to do.

78
00:05:57,533 --> 00:06:00,127
All right,
we have a very special guest tonight.

79
00:06:00,213 --> 00:06:04,650
Please welcome the member of the board,
Frank Sinatra Jr.

80
00:06:40,613 --> 00:06:43,411
All this singing is contagious. I'll sing too.

81
00:06:43,493 --> 00:06:46,007
Adam West...

82
00:06:49,053 --> 00:06:50,611
A little bit softer now.

83
00:06:58,773 --> 00:07:01,446
I'll come out when they're all gone.

84
00:07:05,413 --> 00:07:08,485
Wow, you actually got to sing
with Frank Sinatra Jr?

85
00:07:08,573 --> 00:07:13,044
It was amazing. I got to tell you, he said some
things that were exactly what I needed to hear

86
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:17,411
and I was just inspired to get up on that
stage. Gotta live life for today, you know.

87
00:07:17,493 --> 00:07:21,088
Brian, don't you think
it's a little too early to be hitting the booze?

88
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:24,085
Why wait? You gotta live life
while you can and live it hard.

89
00:07:24,173 --> 00:07:27,324
- The Chris Farley method? Good.
- Frank invited me back tonight.

90
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:31,122
I feel more exhilarated
than Peter did when he swam with the bulls.

91
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:57,201
Yeah, that's fair.
That's totally a fair score.

92
00:08:01,693 --> 00:08:07,882
Brian, when you wear that suit, it looks like
you're taking a white poop. But it stuck.

93
00:08:07,973 --> 00:08:13,969
Lois asked me to baby-sit you, so stay here
and be quiet. I'll be back after my first set.

94
00:08:15,213 --> 00:08:17,727
What the hell am I supposed to do
to kill time?

95
00:08:17,813 --> 00:08:20,281
Maybe I'll play 52 pickup.

96
00:08:21,173 --> 00:08:23,323
This game's better with someone else.

97
00:08:23,413 --> 00:08:26,246
Then they can say,
"I'm not going to pick up those cards. "

98
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:29,405
Then I say, "You have to, it's 52 pickup. "

99
00:08:29,493 --> 00:08:32,212
And they say,
"Well, what if I just leave them there?"

100
00:08:32,293 --> 00:08:34,488
And I say, "Those are my father's cards. "

101
00:08:34,573 --> 00:08:38,851
"You can't leave them there.
He's gonna be mad. " Where am I?

102
00:08:49,413 --> 00:08:50,892
Get outta here!

103
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:04,488
Whoa, easy, kid. These people
paid good money to get in here.

104
00:09:04,573 --> 00:09:07,963
How much are you charging them to get out?

105
00:09:25,293 --> 00:09:29,286
That was sensational. We'll be
the biggest thing since Edison and electricity.

106
00:09:31,573 --> 00:09:34,246
Look at Edison over there
with his damn electricity.

107
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,006
Edison! How about sharing
some of those light bulbs?

108
00:09:37,093 --> 00:09:40,972
- Figure it out for yourself.
- We're freezing our asses off over here.

109
00:09:41,053 --> 00:09:46,411
How do you think I feel? You get to look at
my great house. I look at that dark thing!

110
00:09:46,493 --> 00:09:50,964
- What is that? A candle over there?
- Yeah, it's a candle. We're freezing over here.

111
00:09:51,053 --> 00:09:53,487
No one in my family's
taken a bath in a month.

112
00:09:53,573 --> 00:09:55,609
We stink! It stinks over here, you jerk!

113
00:09:55,693 --> 00:09:58,253
- I can't hear you over my central heating.
- Go to hell!

114
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:03,043
<i>Bite me, man! You seen The Office?
Guess you haven't, cos you don't have a TV!</i>

115
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:05,124
How about I come over and kick your ass?

116
00:10:05,213 --> 00:10:07,090
Ooh, yeah, come on over.

117
00:10:16,413 --> 00:10:21,089
- What is this, Lois?
- It's jambalaya. It's a new recipe.

118
00:10:22,813 --> 00:10:24,485
Peter.

119
00:10:24,573 --> 00:10:26,450
Eat your food, mister.

120
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:31,607
All right, if you don't want it, put it
in your napkin. Peter! Put it in your napkin.

121
00:10:31,693 --> 00:10:34,332
Put it in your napkin. I'm not gonna...

122
00:10:34,413 --> 00:10:38,247
Peter! You know, some people
would be very happy to have this food.

123
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,164
Like John Goodman's family.

124
00:10:40,813 --> 00:10:42,883
- Please, Daddy.
- I told you.

125
00:10:42,973 --> 00:10:45,203
When I'm finished, you can have what's left!

126
00:10:45,293 --> 00:10:49,081
There won't be any left.
There's never any left.

127
00:10:53,213 --> 00:10:55,204
Happy Thanksgiving.

128
00:10:58,893 --> 00:11:03,489
- Mom, why is the cable guy here?
- It's me. And I have something to tell you all.

129
00:11:03,573 --> 00:11:07,612
Mom, Dad, I am a lesbian.

130
00:11:08,373 --> 00:11:10,523
That is awesome.

131
00:11:10,613 --> 00:11:13,127
Peter! Meg, you are not a lesbian.

132
00:11:13,213 --> 00:11:18,810
I don't care what you think. All my lesbian
friends accept me and that's all that matters.

133
00:11:18,893 --> 00:11:23,728
You're my daughter. I would accept you if you
were gay, blind or retarded, but you're not.

134
00:11:23,813 --> 00:11:27,601
You guys don't care about me
and my struggle. I hate you!

135
00:11:27,693 --> 00:11:31,322
I think you're trying to fit in
by pretending to be something you're not.

136
00:11:31,413 --> 00:11:34,849
Like the time Peter pretended
to be racist to get out ofjury duty.

137
00:11:37,493 --> 00:11:39,882
Awful lot of honkies in here.

138
00:12:16,373 --> 00:12:19,524
Brian! There you are.
Do you have any idea what time it is?

139
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,649
Stewie was meant
to be in bed two hours ago.

140
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:27,569
Oh, yeah. He's... He was right here,
right next to me, like, four hours ago.

141
00:12:27,653 --> 00:12:30,884
What?
Brian, you were supposed to watch him.

142
00:12:30,973 --> 00:12:32,645
My little sweetie.

143
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:38,444
Brian, remember me? I'm the guy you
left standing at the counter at McDonald's.

144
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:44,972
It's funny. I tried to walk home. A lot
of hungry deer walking around at this hour.

145
00:12:45,053 --> 00:12:48,887
Here's where the story gets fun.
You may have noticed I'm missing an ear.

146
00:12:48,973 --> 00:12:53,171
Managed to pull it out of the deer's mouth
and put it in some ice I got at a 7-Eleven.

147
00:12:53,253 --> 00:12:56,165
When you're ready to apologise,
just talk into this cup.

148
00:12:56,253 --> 00:13:00,007
- Brian, this is inexcusable.
- What if something had happened to Stewie?

149
00:13:00,093 --> 00:13:05,292
- My ear's in a cup. I guess that doesn't count.
- I'm not his baby-sitter. I have my own life.

150
00:13:05,373 --> 00:13:07,967
This is cos you've been
with that Frank Sinatra Jr.

151
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:11,568
I am gonna call his mother Mia Farrow
and give her a piece of my mind.

152
00:13:11,653 --> 00:13:15,043
You're gonna stop singing at that club.
Operator, Mia Farrow.

153
00:13:15,133 --> 00:13:17,169
You stay out of my life!

154
00:13:19,053 --> 00:13:21,044
What the hell is happening to you?

155
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:25,490
Don't worry. I don't need to go to the hospital.
I'll just use this Mr Potato Head piece.

156
00:13:29,413 --> 00:13:33,725
- He bit me, Lois. The bastard bit me.
- Honey, I'm sure he didn't mean it.

157
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:39,683
Brian's going through some heavy stuff
right now. He almost died.

158
00:13:39,773 --> 00:13:42,003
Listen, Peter...

159
00:13:42,093 --> 00:13:47,167
I just want to apolo... You know what?
Forget it. I don't need this. I'm outta here.

160
00:13:47,253 --> 00:13:49,403
- Look what you did, Peter.
- I can't help it.

161
00:13:49,493 --> 00:13:52,246
I haven't been so scared
since I was mugged by Gene Shalit.

162
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:56,963
<i>Don't Panic Room.
I'm not going to William Hurt you.</i>

163
00:13:57,053 --> 00:14:00,045
<i>I only want your Tango & Cash.</i>

164
00:14:00,133 --> 00:14:04,968
<i>So just Pay It Forward
and we'll all be Happy Gilmore.</i>

165
00:14:05,773 --> 00:14:06,603
What?

166
00:14:10,773 --> 00:14:13,731
So how's my
suddenly lesbian daughter doing?

167
00:14:13,813 --> 00:14:18,603
Great. We're checking out naked girls.
I am so into girls.

168
00:14:18,693 --> 00:14:20,888
Come on, Meg, you can stop the charade.

169
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:23,362
My God, you're as transparent
as your father was

170
00:14:23,453 --> 00:14:26,126
when he pretended
to be a Hassidic Jew to get off work.

171
00:14:26,213 --> 00:14:30,126
Good morning, Hebrews and Shebrews.
What a glorious Jewish day.

172
00:14:30,213 --> 00:14:34,604
How about all those coupons in the
Sunday paper, huh? Some good deals there.

173
00:14:34,693 --> 00:14:38,242
I went into a store last week
and they wanted 800 bucks for a TV,

174
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,972
but I ussed them down to 500.

175
00:14:42,613 --> 00:14:47,289
It's not a charade, Mom. I am a lesbian.
What do I have to do to prove this to you?

176
00:14:47,373 --> 00:14:49,807
Maybe if I'd seen you kiss your girlfriend.

177
00:14:49,893 --> 00:14:53,886
- Fine.
- What was that? Is she your grandmother?

178
00:14:53,973 --> 00:14:56,646
That's no kiss. Watch this.

179
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:05,169
I can't tell you how to lead your life.

180
00:15:05,253 --> 00:15:09,565
If you don't wanna face the truth,
there's nothing I can do about it.

181
00:15:09,653 --> 00:15:12,645
Chris, I'm all out of digital audio tape.
Oh, he's gone.

182
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:14,724
Can I get you to sign these release forms?

183
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:20,282
- Where the hell is Brian?
- I don't know, but I'd better go find him.

184
00:15:20,373 --> 00:15:22,762
We can't sit watching infomercials all night.

185
00:15:22,853 --> 00:15:26,926
Hello. How come I rich and you not?
How come you not sell real estate like I do?

186
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:31,131
How come I sleep with your wife while you at
work then pee in your toilet and don't flush?

187
00:15:31,213 --> 00:15:35,001
And sometimes I open the back part and pee
there, so when you flush, pee come out.

188
00:15:35,093 --> 00:15:38,847
You know why? Cos I'm smart.
I'm smart, you stupid. Call now.

189
00:15:38,933 --> 00:15:42,846
Brian!

190
00:15:43,053 --> 00:15:45,362
Brian!

191
00:15:45,453 --> 00:15:47,569
Bri...

192
00:15:47,653 --> 00:15:51,692
Who am I kidding? All those buttons,
I'll look like Steve Harvey. Brian!

193
00:15:54,813 --> 00:15:57,407
I'll ask the cashier
if I can put this up in the window.

194
00:15:57,493 --> 00:15:59,643
I definitely need a breath freshener.

195
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:02,042
But that's going to give me 11 items.

196
00:16:02,133 --> 00:16:05,808
- That's fine.
- No, no, no. Rules is rules.

197
00:16:05,893 --> 00:16:11,172
Let's see what I'm going to put back. I need
the Reynolds Wrap and the bathroom tissue.

198
00:16:11,253 --> 00:16:15,610
I could do without the Triscuits,
but they sure are good.

199
00:16:15,693 --> 00:16:18,685
7UP's the whole reason
I came down here in the first place.

200
00:16:18,773 --> 00:16:21,207
You know what?
I'm not going to need the V8

201
00:16:21,293 --> 00:16:24,808
cos I can just get some tomato juice
at the mini-mart down the street.

202
00:16:24,893 --> 00:16:28,932
It's a little more expensive, but that's OK.
I like to help out a small business.

203
00:16:29,013 --> 00:16:31,686
I hope it's OK if I pay you in pennies.

204
00:16:35,573 --> 00:16:39,202
- Oh, God. A gutter? How cliché.
- I don't know what went wrong.

205
00:16:39,293 --> 00:16:41,807
I was just trying
to live for the moment, you know?

206
00:16:41,893 --> 00:16:46,171
Because life can end so abruptly
and there's nothing you can do to stop it.

207
00:16:46,253 --> 00:16:49,245
Is that why you've been
on this path to self-destruction?

208
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,211
You know, Brian, as smart as you are,
you've got to accept

209
00:16:52,293 --> 00:16:55,444
that there are some things in life
that you just can't control.

210
00:16:55,533 --> 00:16:59,242
You mean the way you can't control
the messed-up way that you laugh

211
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,927
when you think something's
really, really funny?

212
00:17:02,013 --> 00:17:05,528
I don't understand why these cookies
are giving us all the fits.

213
00:17:05,613 --> 00:17:11,131
Well, no wonder, Faith. That's not
baking powder. It's sneezing powder.

214
00:17:15,453 --> 00:17:19,571
But I already brought a whole batch
to the church bake sale.

215
00:17:22,493 --> 00:17:26,008
No wonder that priest
kept saying "bless you".

216
00:17:31,253 --> 00:17:36,725
Yes, I accept that. Your problem is you think
that if you're not in control, nothing matters.

217
00:17:36,813 --> 00:17:40,772
That you don't matter.
But you know what? You matter to someone.

218
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:43,651
You matter big time.

219
00:17:44,973 --> 00:17:49,683
- Hey, Meg. What are you doing here?
- Sarah, I gotta get something off my chest.

220
00:17:49,773 --> 00:17:50,888
Yes!

221
00:17:50,973 --> 00:17:53,362
- I need to open up.
- Sweet.

222
00:17:53,453 --> 00:17:57,731
So get ready cos here it is.
My mom was right.

223
00:17:57,813 --> 00:17:59,929
- What do you mean?
- I'm not gay.

224
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:04,131
What? So all those rounds of golf
we played, those were all lies?

225
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:08,092
I'm so sorry. For the first time in my life,
I felt like I belonged.

226
00:18:08,173 --> 00:18:12,246
And I wanted it to be true,
so I pretended to be something I'm not.

227
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:15,803
- You choose to be heterosexual?
- I thought being gay wasn't a choice.

228
00:18:15,893 --> 00:18:20,091
- Well, not for guys.
- It was wrong to mislead you. I should go.

229
00:18:20,173 --> 00:18:23,210
That was awful. That was just awful.
What do you think, Mark?

230
00:18:23,293 --> 00:18:25,761
I don't know, man.
We didn't get the shots we need.

231
00:18:25,853 --> 00:18:29,607
What do you think, Mike? I mean,
if you saw action going on in front of you,

232
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,809
would you know instinctively to centre it?

233
00:18:31,893 --> 00:18:36,205
I don't know. Can someone take my soda out
of the ice box, please, so it doesn't freeze?

234
00:19:16,493 --> 00:19:18,370
- Lady!
- You're fired.

235
00:19:54,013 --> 00:19:56,481
- Frank, there you are.
- Mia Farrow?

236
00:19:56,573 --> 00:19:59,770
What's this I hear about you up all night
with a baby and a dog?

237
00:19:59,853 --> 00:20:02,845
- Leave me alone.
- Get over here, young man.

238
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:04,525
Oh, damn it all.

239

241

All right, all bets are in.
Rupert, bad idea trusting the Celtics.

242
00:21:20,254 --> 00:21:22,927
Worse than when I trusted Brian
to pack my parachute.

243
00:21:36,614 --> 00:21:40,732
<i>Hey, Brian. Care to place a wager?
Tomorrow night on Fox's Celebrity Boxing</i>

244
00:21:40,814 --> 00:21:43,567
I've got Carol Channing beating Mike Tyson.

245
00:21:43,654 --> 00:21:48,648
You've got Carol Channing the actress
beating Mike Tyson the boxer?

246
00:21:48,734 --> 00:21:50,326
Give me $50 on Tyson.

247
00:21:50,414 --> 00:21:53,212
You're in good company.
Betting Freddy bet the same.

248
00:21:55,654 --> 00:21:59,727
Bet! Wait a minute.
There's nothing funny about an addiction.

249
00:21:59,814 --> 00:22:02,282
Vote "no" on Indian gaming laws.

250

with Mike Tyson and Carol Channing.</i>

How Carol Channing outlasted that barrage
in the second round, we'll never know.
