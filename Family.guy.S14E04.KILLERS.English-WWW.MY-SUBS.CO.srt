12
00:00:33,975 --> 00:00:36,610
Aw, man, I've been dying
to see <i>Maniac Pope 2.</i>

13
00:00:36,644 --> 00:00:37,945
The first one
was awesome.

14
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:39,613
Is this one
of those theaters

15
00:00:39,647 --> 00:00:41,615
where they bring your beef stew
right to your seat?

16
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:42,950
What? That's
not a thing.

17
00:00:42,984 --> 00:00:44,284
Sure is.

18
00:00:44,319 --> 00:00:47,154
Don't get mad at me 'cause
you don't know nothing fancy.

19
00:00:57,832 --> 00:00:59,466
I feel like I'm
being watched.

20
00:00:59,501 --> 00:01:01,135
Of course
you are, silly.

21
00:01:01,169 --> 00:01:03,170
The Lord is always
watching us.

22
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:14,715
(suspenseful music plays)

23
00:01:14,749 --> 00:01:17,451
May the sword
be with you.

24
00:01:18,486 --> 00:01:19,453
(screams)

25
00:01:19,487 --> 00:01:21,955
And also with you!

26
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,957
Geez, this movie sucks.

27
00:01:23,992 --> 00:01:25,292
I know,
it's terrible.

28
00:01:25,326 --> 00:01:26,960
(whispering): Excuse me,
who had the stroganoff

29
00:01:26,995 --> 00:01:28,295
with the roasted
potatoes?

30
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:29,730
CLEVELAND:
Right here.

31
00:01:32,434 --> 00:01:35,135
Thank you for seeing me,
Your Excellency.

32
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,303
Of course.

33
00:01:36,337 --> 00:01:38,238
What did you say your
name was, my child?

34
00:01:38,273 --> 00:01:40,841
Lucy.

35
00:01:41,776 --> 00:01:44,111
You've been "Lucified."

36
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:50,217
That was awful.

37
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:52,219
I know, they just redid
all the same stuff

38
00:01:52,253 --> 00:01:53,887
from the first
<i>Maniac Pope.</i>

39
00:01:53,922 --> 00:01:55,222
Yeah, like in the first
<i>Maniac Pope,</i>

40
00:01:55,256 --> 00:01:57,891
he says to Bruce,
"You've been Brucified."

41
00:01:57,926 --> 00:01:58,892
Like, that's
smart, right?

42
00:01:58,927 --> 00:02:00,227
That's a smart line.

43
00:02:00,261 --> 00:02:02,229
But he did the same thing
twice in this movie.

44
00:02:02,263 --> 00:02:04,898
Once to Lucy and once earlier
when he found that wild goose.

45
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:06,300
It's just
bad writing.

46
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,335
Yeah, I mean, we could write
a better horror movie than that.

47
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:10,003
Really? You
think we could?

48
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:13,974
Absolutely, I'm as creative as
the first spider to spin a web.

49
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,642
Hey, you know how
we always dreamed

50
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,644
about having a house
that comes out of our butts?

51
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,679
Uh, what?

52
00:02:18,713 --> 00:02:19,680
Eh?

53
00:02:19,714 --> 00:02:20,681
Yeah.

54
00:02:20,715 --> 00:02:21,849
Butt-house.

55
00:02:26,654 --> 00:02:28,622
I found your cigarettes.

56
00:02:28,656 --> 00:02:30,290
That's all I'm gonna say.

57
00:02:30,325 --> 00:02:31,625
Morning, everybody.

58
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:33,627
And the crisis
continues.

59
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:34,628
(chuckling):
What, these?

60
00:02:34,662 --> 00:02:35,629
Come on.

61
00:02:35,663 --> 00:02:37,631
Last thing I want
is attention.

62
00:02:37,665 --> 00:02:39,633
It's just that when you've
read as many books as I have,

63
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:41,301
it-it takes a toll,
you know?

64
00:02:41,336 --> 00:02:42,636
You sure it's not
from watching

65
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,638
too much close-up
porn on your phone?

66
00:02:44,672 --> 00:02:46,306
(chuckling): You know,
I wouldn't be surprised

67
00:02:46,341 --> 00:02:47,641
if they have that now.

68
00:02:47,675 --> 00:02:49,643
Brian, what do you
want for breakfast?

69
00:02:49,677 --> 00:02:51,011
Uh, hold on.

70
00:02:53,982 --> 00:02:56,617
What do I want?

71
00:02:56,651 --> 00:02:57,618
You're so full of it.

72
00:02:57,652 --> 00:02:58,952
You don't need
those things.

73
00:02:58,987 --> 00:03:00,621
Wait, who said that?

74
00:03:00,655 --> 00:03:01,955
Oh, Stewie.

75
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,290
You are just horrible.

76
00:03:03,324 --> 00:03:04,625
You're even worse
than those people

77
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:06,193
who take dumps
in the shower.

78
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:08,529
What?

79
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,863
W-Why are you cutting to me?

80
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,198
What did somebody say?

81
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,734
Whatever they said I do,
I don't do.

82
00:03:17,372 --> 00:03:19,673
All right, I got a
horror movie idea.

83
00:03:19,707 --> 00:03:21,174
It's called
<i>Cereal Killer.</i>

84
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:24,745
A serial killer who only
kills people who eat cereal.

85
00:03:24,779 --> 00:03:27,414
Wait, what... what if God
is a serial killer?

86
00:03:27,448 --> 00:03:31,084
He lowers the average lifespan
of humans to 65,

87
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:34,588
but there are many exceptions
based on genetics and diet.

88
00:03:34,622 --> 00:03:37,925
That's stupid-- I ain't never
heard of somebody lived to 65.

89
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:39,927
Look, I think the problem is
this is a bar.

90
00:03:39,961 --> 00:03:41,261
We can't get
inspired here.

91
00:03:41,296 --> 00:03:42,729
We have to go someplace
scary, you know?

92
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,064
To put us in the mood.

93
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:46,533
I got it: the old Quahog Asylum.

94
00:03:46,568 --> 00:03:47,534
What?!

95
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:48,702
We can't go there.

96
00:03:48,736 --> 00:03:50,370
That place has been
abandoned for years.

97
00:03:50,405 --> 00:03:52,706
And they say it's haunted
by a ghost with a hook-hand.

98
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,374
That's why it's
the perfect place.

99
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:55,709
If we want to write
a scary movie,

100
00:03:55,743 --> 00:03:57,044
we need to do it
somewhere scary.

101
00:03:57,078 --> 00:03:58,712
Well, I guess
we could try it.

102
00:03:58,746 --> 00:04:01,214
We have sort of just been
spinning our wheels here.

103
00:04:01,249 --> 00:04:02,549
No offense, Joe.

104
00:04:02,584 --> 00:04:04,551
(sighs) I guess
Cleveland's right.

105
00:04:04,586 --> 00:04:06,553
So far, this has been
a bigger waste of time

106
00:04:06,588 --> 00:04:08,922
than an acceptance speech
at the Asperger's Awards.

107
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,924
I'd like to thank
everyone I've ever met,

108
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,260
in the order that I met them,
last name first,

109
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:16,263
and if anyone interrupts me,
I'll have to start over.

110
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,241

111

113
00:04:49,097 --> 00:04:50,397
This place

114
00:04:50,431 --> 00:04:51,732
Are you kidding?

115
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:53,367
It's the perfect place
to write a horror movie.

116
00:04:53,401 --> 00:04:54,701
All right, well,
I got an idea.

117
00:04:54,736 --> 00:04:56,036
You know, I like
them horror movies

118
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,038
where you got a couple
of teenagers getting busy

119
00:04:58,072 --> 00:05:00,040
in their car
at Makeout Point,

120
00:05:00,074 --> 00:05:02,009
but there's a killer
on the loose.

121
00:05:07,782 --> 00:05:11,051
He Stacy, what do you say
we go all the way tonight?

122
00:05:11,085 --> 00:05:13,387
And then I unload
on the sun visors.

123
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:15,055
Is that all
you ever think about?

124
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:17,057
And besides, Richie,
aren't you worried

125
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:19,593
about what the man on the radio
is saying right now?

126
00:05:19,627 --> 00:05:22,596
TOM TUCKER: Another dead teenage couple
was found at Makeout Point,

127
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,498
clawed beyond recognition.

128
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,666
You see?

129
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,334
There's a dangerous
creature out there.

130
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:30,003
Oh, what, you mean the
big, rabid, slobbery cat

131
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,672
what's been scratching
people to death?

132
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,340
I don't believe
it exists, Stacy.

133
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,676
Now, help me get the right
angle and lower the visor.

134
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,678
(cat yowls in distance)

135
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,012
Richie,
did you hear that?

136
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,347
Will you calm down?

137
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,682
We're the only
ones out here...

138
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:42,916
(screams)

139
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,418
Rrrawwwr!

140
00:05:44,452 --> 00:05:45,419
(screaming)

141
00:05:45,453 --> 00:05:47,020
(screams)

142
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,188
Oh, my God!

143
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,790
(screaming)

144
00:05:49,824 --> 00:05:50,857

00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,266
Wait, you were the guy
<i>and</i> the cat?

148
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,934
And what's with
that visor stuff?

149
00:06:00,968 --> 00:06:02,669
Did Richie achieve
release?

150
00:06:02,704 --> 00:06:04,004
Okay, of the three
of you,

151
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:05,439
Cleveland's the only one
who gets it.

152
00:06:05,473 --> 00:06:07,441
That's an awful idea.
Well, I got one.

153
00:06:07,475 --> 00:06:09,643
We should write one
of them zombie movies

154
00:06:09,677 --> 00:06:12,312
where a guy wakes up in a
comfortable cotton hospital gown

155
00:06:12,346 --> 00:06:15,315
with the back open so there's
a nice breeze on your behind,

156
00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:17,317
and he's like, "This ain't bad."

157
00:06:17,351 --> 00:06:20,353
But then he notices
the hospital's empty.

158
00:06:25,393 --> 00:06:28,729
Nurse, I'm ready
for my sponge bath.

159
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,397
Hmm.

160
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,732
What happened to this place?

161
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,366
Everybody up and gone.

162
00:06:36,404 --> 00:06:38,672
(electrical crackling)

163
00:06:38,706 --> 00:06:40,707
Hmm, that's annoying.

164
00:06:40,742 --> 00:06:42,743
(static hissing)

165
00:06:44,345 --> 00:06:46,646
Maybe it's a loose filament.

166
00:06:46,681 --> 00:06:47,647
(rattling)

167
00:06:47,682 --> 00:06:50,183
Nope, that's a busted bulb.

168
00:06:53,387 --> 00:06:55,021
These are all 145s.

169
00:06:55,056 --> 00:06:56,423
I need a 180.

170
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,795
Well, now, maybe I did
need a 145.

171
00:07:03,865 --> 00:07:05,732
There we go.

172
00:07:07,435 --> 00:07:08,735
(pops)

173
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,271
Damn it, I guess
it's a wiring issue.

174
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,606
That's it?

175
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,441
What the hell? When do
the zombies show up?

176
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:15,776
That's the thing.

177
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,878
Their shuttle was <i>late.</i>

178
00:07:17,912 --> 00:07:19,546
I-I don't know,
I-I was thinking

179
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,881
we'd write a movie
where something

180
00:07:20,915 --> 00:07:23,216
that's not supposed
to be scary becomes scary.

181
00:07:23,251 --> 00:07:24,551
Like an evil doll.

182
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:26,887
Yeah, or-or like an
evil bar of soap.

183
00:07:26,921 --> 00:07:28,301
Peter, I don't think
that's such a good id...

184
00:07:28,325 --> 00:07:29,473
Too late.

185
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,961
Oh, yeah, that's nice.

186
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:38,565
Time to wash my body
with this harmless bar of soap.

187
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:40,600
(dramatic music plays)

188
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,305
Hey, Ambassador Mumbasa,

189
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,307
are you enjoying
that new soap I bought you

190
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,975
from that mysterious Chinese man

191
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,344
whose store was weirdly
not there the next day?

192
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,414
Ambassador Mumbasa?

193
00:07:54,448 --> 00:07:57,918
Oh, my God, Ambassador Mumbasa!

194
00:07:57,952 --> 00:08:00,487
(dramatic music plays)

195
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,125
(screams)

196
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,964
Ambassador Mumbasa?

197
00:08:10,998 --> 00:08:12,899
Assistant Ambassador Armstrong?

198
00:08:12,934 --> 00:08:14,601
Everything okay up there
with the bath?

199
00:08:17,672 --> 00:08:19,005
(screams)

200
00:08:29,851 --> 00:08:31,484
(gasps)

201
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:35,121
I wonder if everything's okay
up at the old embassy.

202
00:08:35,156 --> 00:08:37,424
(wind howling, door slams)

203
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,759
All right, maybe coming here
wasn't such a great idea.

204
00:08:39,794 --> 00:08:41,428
Is anybody else getting
a little freaked out

205
00:08:41,462 --> 00:08:43,163
by all these
scary stories?

206
00:08:43,197 --> 00:08:45,599
Yeah, even my
spine is tingling.

207
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:46,867
You guys, I'm scared.

208
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,068
You remember
that movie, <i>The Blob?</i>

209
00:08:48,102 --> 00:08:49,269
What if the Blob?

210
00:08:49,303 --> 00:08:50,503
Let's get out of here.

211
00:08:52,807 --> 00:08:54,107
Aw, damn it, it's locked!

212
00:08:54,141 --> 00:08:56,109
Oh, my God, somebody
must have locked us in.

213
00:08:56,143 --> 00:08:57,777
We're gonna
die in here!

214
00:08:57,812 --> 00:08:59,479
(female screams)

215
00:09:00,815 --> 00:09:03,116
Sorry, guys,
somebody e-mailed me a video

216
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,718
of a sheep screaming.

217
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,820
(screams)

218
00:09:12,694 --> 00:09:13,661
It was him.

219
00:09:13,695 --> 00:09:15,196
It was the hook-handed killer.

220
00:09:15,251 --> 00:09:16,918
He locked us in!

221
00:09:16,953 --> 00:09:18,887
All the windows
have bars on 'em.

222
00:09:18,921 --> 00:09:21,623
I think the only way out of here
is through this duct system.

223
00:09:21,658 --> 00:09:24,626
Guys, do the words
"dead by dawn" scrawled

224
00:09:24,661 --> 00:09:26,962
in feces over there
mean we're in trouble?

225
00:09:26,996 --> 00:09:28,296
Did you do it?
I did.

226
00:09:28,331 --> 00:09:29,464
Then no.

227
00:09:34,337 --> 00:09:36,638
Still sticking with
the glasses, huh?

228
00:09:36,673 --> 00:09:37,639
What? Oh, right.

229
00:09:37,674 --> 00:09:39,307
Right,
I have glasses.

230
00:09:39,342 --> 00:09:41,309
They're such a part of me now,
I-I forgot all about 'em.

You're gross.

You know, it's funny,

233

I-I've gotten an awful
lot of writing done

234
00:09:47,351 --> 00:09:49,319
You're a writer?
(Stewie groans)

235
00:09:49,353 --> 00:09:51,321
I-I like to consider
myself an observer.

236

breasts, for instance.

237

You want to join me?

238

Griffin," I barely heard them.

That's it, I'm putting
an end to this.

243
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:08,004
I'm gonna destroy those glasses
if it's the last thing I do.

244
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,673
You should
really check out

Damn it, why can't
I get any reception?

00:13:11,222 --> 00:13:12,856
I was a soldier.

323
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:16,459
I lost my hand
saving six men in Korea.

324
00:13:16,494 --> 00:13:18,661
Oh, God, he's
a war hero.

325
00:13:18,696 --> 00:13:20,763
(exhales)

326
00:13:20,798 --> 00:13:22,365
He's dead.

327
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:23,700
What have we done?

328
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:25,869
We killed
an innocent man.

329
00:13:30,441 --> 00:13:33,877
Well, if this doesn't justify
a McFlurry, nothing does.

330
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:45,192
Oh, my God,
we killed an innocent man.

331
00:13:45,226 --> 00:13:46,693
We-we've got
to report this!

332
00:13:46,728 --> 00:13:48,061
We gotta turn
ourselves in!

333
00:13:48,096 --> 00:13:49,229
No way.

334
00:13:49,264 --> 00:13:50,864
If we do that,
we'll all go to jail.

335
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:52,065
And I'm a cop.

336
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,067
Do you know what they
do to cops in jail?

337
00:13:54,102 --> 00:13:55,168
Hey, man?

338
00:13:55,203 --> 00:13:56,503
When you were
a cop, did they--

339
00:13:56,537 --> 00:13:57,938
did they let you
use the siren?

340
00:13:57,972 --> 00:13:59,740
Yeah, it's part
of the job.

341
00:13:59,774 --> 00:14:00,741
That's so cool!

342
00:14:00,775 --> 00:14:01,842
Hey, hey, when
you were a cop,

343
00:14:01,876 --> 00:14:03,076
when you were going
to a crime scene,

344
00:14:03,111 --> 00:14:05,145
did you go "chung Chung,"
like <i>Law & Order?</i>

345
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:06,947
No, that would be
very unprofessional.

346
00:14:06,981 --> 00:14:08,215
All right,
all right.

347
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:10,183
Oh, hey, check it out,
man, when you were a cop,

348
00:14:10,218 --> 00:14:12,185
did you ever, you know,
use your handcuffs

349
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,121
when you were getting
kinky with your girl?

350
00:14:14,155 --> 00:14:15,355
No, it's city property,

351
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,057
so you're not really
supposed to take those home.

352
00:14:17,091 --> 00:14:18,191
Oh, for sure, for sure.

353
00:14:18,226 --> 00:14:19,393
Oh, hey, by the way,

354
00:14:19,427 --> 00:14:21,728
a bunch of us are gonna kill
you in the shower later.

355
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,934
Okay, so we're all on
the same page, right?

356
00:14:27,969 --> 00:14:29,169
We bury the body,

357
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:30,570
we never speak
of this again.

358
00:14:30,605 --> 00:14:32,372
Deal. - Got it.
Yup.

359
00:14:39,147 --> 00:14:41,815
Wow, that was exhausting.

360
00:14:41,849 --> 00:14:44,117
Wait a minute, is-is that--
is that his car?

361
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:56,963
(car alarm wailing)

362
00:14:56,998 --> 00:14:58,632
Aw, crap, it's still alive!

363
00:15:08,076 --> 00:15:11,411
It does not feel
like a Wednesday.

364
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:19,219
Peter, I'm glad
you're up.

365
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:21,355
I need to talk to you
about something.

366
00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:23,390
I know what you did
last night.

367
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:25,692
You do?

368
00:15:25,727 --> 00:15:28,061
How could you do
something so heinous?

369
00:15:28,096 --> 00:15:30,263
Last night,

370
00:15:30,298 --> 00:15:32,199
you left your dirty dishes
in the sink.

371
00:15:32,233 --> 00:15:34,434
It's disgusting.

372
00:15:34,469 --> 00:15:37,270
So I did half, and I left
the other half for you.

373
00:15:38,973 --> 00:15:39,973
Ah, forget it.

374
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:40,974
You'll just do it wrong.

375
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:42,209
I'll wash 'em myself.

376
00:15:42,243 --> 00:15:44,378
Why don't you just go
in the other room and relax?

377
00:15:44,412 --> 00:15:46,079
I'll call you
when breakfast is ready.

378
00:15:46,114 --> 00:15:47,347
Okay.

379
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:51,151
LOIS: Oh, my God, Peter,
come look at the newspaper!

380
00:15:51,185 --> 00:15:52,652
"Janitor dead."

381
00:15:52,687 --> 00:15:53,487
(gasps)

382
00:15:53,521 --> 00:15:54,788
What? No!

383
00:15:54,822 --> 00:15:57,791
Right here.
My college roommate, Jan Itter.

384
00:15:57,825 --> 00:15:59,926
She passed away yesterday.

385
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:01,361
Are-are we really
doin' this?

386
00:16:01,396 --> 00:16:03,130
'Cause I didn't get, like,
any sleep last night.

387
00:16:03,164 --> 00:16:04,598
What are you
freaking out about?

388
00:16:04,632 --> 00:16:05,999
You didn't even know her.

389
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:08,101
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
y-you're right, you're right.

390
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,205
LOIS: You and the guys
killed and buried a man?!

391
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,907
Ah, I knew
you'd find out!

392
00:16:13,941 --> 00:16:15,575
Find out what?

393
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,910
I just got
David Sedaris' new book,

394
00:16:16,944 --> 00:16:19,212
<i>You and the Guys Killed</i>
<i>and Buried a Man.</i>

395
00:16:19,247 --> 00:16:20,881
Okay, I am
really on edge

396
00:16:20,915 --> 00:16:23,049
and this thing we're doin',
I'm not happy about it,

397
00:16:23,084 --> 00:16:25,385
and that's a very odd title
for a humorist's book.

398
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,720
Peter, you're acting
very weird.

399
00:16:26,754 --> 00:16:27,854
Just go in
the other room.

400
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:29,356
I don't want to go
in the other room,

401
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,358
I want to stay here and
see what you're seeing,

402
00:16:31,392 --> 00:16:33,560
because you're saying
things that I think are

403
00:16:33,594 --> 00:16:35,262
somethin' totally different
than what they are.

404
00:16:35,296 --> 00:16:37,030
Peter, you're gonna
have a heart attack.

405
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:40,434
I won't say anything,
I'll let you relax.

406
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:43,503
LOIS: "They found a body
of a war hero

408
00:16:45,373 --> 00:16:47,207
Okay, that has to be something.

00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:27,180
Yeah? Aah!
Damn it! Aah!

422

There's glass in my eye!

(groaning)

428
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:44,798
Guys, I'm kind of freaking out
about killing that guy.

429
00:17:44,832 --> 00:17:47,033
Anybody else have
a hard time sleeping?

you're not gonna
(bleep) believe.

432
00:17:50,805 --> 00:17:51,938
Wait, w-what's
all this stuff

433
00:17:51,973 --> 00:17:53,406
about you guys
killing someone?

434
00:17:53,441 --> 00:17:54,841
Last night,
at the asylum.

435
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:55,909
We killed
that war hero.

436
00:17:55,943 --> 00:17:57,077
Whoa, whoa, what?!

437
00:17:57,111 --> 00:17:58,712
You-you really
killed someone?

438
00:17:58,746 --> 00:18:01,147
Holy moly, I don't think
I want to hear this.

439
00:18:01,182 --> 00:18:03,083
Quagmire, you were
there with us.

440
00:18:03,117 --> 00:18:04,417
You're so weird.

441
00:18:04,452 --> 00:18:05,785
Last night, I was
in St. Louis.

442
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,053
I even have
a picture.

443
00:18:07,088 --> 00:18:08,355
See that?

444
00:18:08,389 --> 00:18:09,723
That's yesterday's date
on that newspaper.

445
00:18:09,757 --> 00:18:11,191
On <i>The Quahog Informant?</i>

446
00:18:11,225 --> 00:18:14,160
They sell <i>The Quahog</i>
<i>Informant</i> in St. Louis?

447
00:18:14,195 --> 00:18:15,829
Well, probably, but good
luck with that whole

448
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:18,732
"you three and not me
killed a guy" thing.

449
00:18:18,766 --> 00:18:20,634
Damn it, that bastard
is bailing on us.

450
00:18:20,668 --> 00:18:23,637
He's a worse accomplice
than Johnny Wind Chimes.

451
00:18:23,671 --> 00:18:25,972
(chimes chiming)

452
00:18:26,007 --> 00:18:27,240
Hey! Shh!

453
00:18:27,275 --> 00:18:28,341
(loudly):
Sorry!

454
00:18:28,376 --> 00:18:29,976
It's my chimes.

455
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:40,654
I hate to frame you like this,
Quagmire, but I gotta.

456
00:18:40,688 --> 00:18:42,088
I can't go to jail!

457
00:18:42,123 --> 00:18:44,558
They'll razz me good
on account of my belly.

458
00:18:48,596 --> 00:18:50,030
Cleveland?

459
00:18:50,064 --> 00:18:51,064
What are you
doing here?

460
00:18:51,098 --> 00:18:52,499
What are you
both doing here?

461
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:54,301
Joe?
What the hell?

462
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,702
QUAGMIRE:
You backstabbers.

463
00:18:57,405 --> 00:18:59,205
What the hell's
going on?

464
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,473
I'll tell you
what's going on.

465
00:19:00,508 --> 00:19:02,142
Cleveland's tryin' to frame me.

466
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:04,544
He's got my miniature
portraits of cool guys.

467
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:06,179
Peter, those are baseball cards.

468
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:08,315
Whatever. He's using it
to frame me for murder!

469
00:19:08,349 --> 00:19:09,916
Well, I'm not
the only one.

470
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:12,819
Joe's got my <i>Sports Illustrated</i>
football phone.

471
00:19:12,853 --> 00:19:15,689
He was using this
as his main phone.

472
00:19:15,723 --> 00:19:17,324
It is a mess over there.

473
00:19:17,358 --> 00:19:18,892
Look at all
you pathetic people,

474
00:19:18,926 --> 00:19:20,393
bringing stuff
to frame each other.

475
00:19:20,428 --> 00:19:21,728
You're supposed
to be friends.

476
00:19:21,762 --> 00:19:23,163
Hey, that's
my shovel!

477
00:19:23,197 --> 00:19:24,164
Damn right!

478
00:19:24,198 --> 00:19:25,165
That's how smart I am,

I only had to bring one thing!

This way I can dig the hole
and just throw this in!

But once you throw
it in there,

how you gonna get
the dirt back on top?

483

Give me your shovel!

484
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,675
You're gonna have
to kill me first!

485
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,744
Not with my shovel!
That's brand-new!

486
00:19:37,778 --> 00:19:40,080
Give me back
my rattle-y plastic phone!

Boy, that sucked.

Yeah, I guess writing a movie

isn't as easy as Joseph
Gordon-Levitt makes it look.

Hey, at least
we gave it a shot.
