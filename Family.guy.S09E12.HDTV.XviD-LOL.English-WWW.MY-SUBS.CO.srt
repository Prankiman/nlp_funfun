00:00:34,084 --> 00:00:35,351
(doorbell ringing)

12
00:00:37,087 --> 00:00:39,055
Oh, hi, Bonnie.
What's up?

13
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:41,741
Hi, Lois, um,
I hate to bother you,

14
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:44,210
but I'm going out
of town for a few days

15
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:45,929
to visit my father
in the hospital.

16
00:00:45,996 --> 00:00:47,797
I was hoping that
while I was gone,

17
00:00:47,865 --> 00:00:49,749
you could look in
on Susie and Joe.

18
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:51,384
And go have sex with Quagmire.

19
00:00:51,452 --> 00:00:52,619
Quagmire!
Quagmire!

20
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:54,554
Aw, shucks, you can't
blame a guy for trying.

21
00:00:54,622 --> 00:00:56,656
Giggity-giggity-giggity!

22
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:58,908
(squeaking)

23
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:01,661
Well, of course, Bonnie.
I'd love to help.

24
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,112
Meg, sweetie?

25
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,330
Yeah, Mom?

26
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,282
Bonnie wants you to look
after Susie and Joe

27
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:08,117
while she's out of town.

28
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:09,786
What?! Why me?!

29
00:01:09,853 --> 00:01:11,504
I don't want to
have to do that.

30
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,740
And Bonnie said
you are very pretty.

31
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:15,808
But I... How did
that come up?

32
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:17,076
Oh, y-you know...

33
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:18,811
we were talking
about pretty people.

34
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,546
And... and I said
Rachel Maddow,

35
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:23,716
and she kind of took the baton
from there and said Meg Griffin.

36
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:25,251
Who's Rachel Maddow?

37
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:27,387
A model.

38
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:28,554
Oh.

39
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:30,523
Yeah.

40
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:32,258
Okay, I'll do it.

41
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:37,630
(laughing)

42
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:39,148
Whoops.

43
00:01:39,216 --> 00:01:41,133
Oh, hey, uh, excuse me, fella?

44
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:43,186
Yeah, what do you want, shrimp?

45
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,971
Oh, just a few moments
of your time.

46
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,138
Hang on.

47
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,940
Let me just get
this little guy assembled.

48
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:50,476
♪ Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,
doo, doo, doodie, doo. ♪

49
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:51,761
So where you from?

50
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:53,680
Newburyport.
What's it to you?

51
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:56,416
Oh, I'm just always interested
in where people are from.

52
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,551
Everybody's got a story,
that's what I believe.

53
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,152
All right, I think
we're all set here.

54
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,690
(laughing)

55
00:02:05,175 --> 00:02:08,511
Wow. Never seen
that happen before.

56
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:09,812
What the devil happened here?

57
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,314
I've assembled that
rifle a million times.

58
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:13,282
Well, I don't know
if it's just the rifle.

59
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,384
What are you talking about?

60
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:15,902
I think you're going soft.

61
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,137
I mean, when was the last time
you tried to blow something up,

62
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:19,422
or take over the world,

63
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:20,957
or even used the phrase,
"Damn you"?

64
00:02:21,025 --> 00:02:22,959
Hey, I got a lot
on my plate, man.

65
00:02:23,027 --> 00:02:25,662
I'm learning to use the toilet,
I'm learning what shapes are.

66
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,197
I-I spent half an hour laughing
at my own feet yesterday.

67
00:02:28,265 --> 00:02:30,500
Yeah, you're losing it, man.
You're losing your edge.

68
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,135
Well, I don't care
for your tone

69
00:02:32,202 --> 00:02:35,271
and I'd say you deserve a good
kick in the... (laughing)

70
00:02:35,339 --> 00:02:36,372
Oh, look!

71
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,807
Oh, Brian, look at them!

72
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:44,981
JOE:
Come in.

73
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:48,418
Drop it, creep-o!

74
00:02:48,485 --> 00:02:50,853
Don't move, Catherine Deneuve!

75
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,723
Freezerino, Paul Sorvino!

76
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,441
What are you doing,
Mr. Swanson?

77
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,694
I'm tryin' out
some cop entrances.

78
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:01,714
Oh, well, I'm here to help
you out while Bonnie's gone.

79
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:03,383
Oh, great.

80
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,717
Uh, do you have any experience

81
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:06,386
helping out people
with special needs?

82
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:09,122
Well, I did work for that
old lady down the street.

83
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,992
Meg, could you come
here, please?

84
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,394
What is it?

85
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:17,230
Could you see if I'm getting
a bed sore on my back?

86
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,532
Sure.

87
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,033
It looks fine to me, ma'am.

88
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:22,668
Thank you, dear.

89
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,821
I must have just
slept on it wrong.

90
00:03:24,888 --> 00:03:25,855
(laughing)

91
00:03:25,923 --> 00:03:27,223
I stole Meg's cutaway.

92
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,548
(whooshing)
What the hell is going on in here?

93
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:37,316
Well, Brian, I thought
about what you said

94
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,951
at the park, and I've
decided you're right.

95
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:40,219
I have gone soft.

96
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:42,338
I've lost my sadistic streak.

97
00:03:42,406 --> 00:03:44,724
So I've built a concentrated
neural enhancement device,

98
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,309
designed to boost my evil side.

99
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:48,861
All right, shall we take
this thing for a spin?

100
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:50,913
Now, when I say so,
hit that button.

101
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:55,601
Okay, hit it.

102
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:56,969
(electronic whirring)

103
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,705

(whooshing)

105
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,535
Well, how do you feel?

106
00:04:12,603 --> 00:04:13,719
I don't know.

107
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:15,354
I don't feel any different.

108
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,173
Well, why don't you
try insulting me?

109
00:04:17,241 --> 00:04:18,274
Yeah, okay.

110
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:21,144
Um, sometimes you
chase helicopters.

111
00:04:21,211 --> 00:04:22,445
That's kind of lame.

112
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:23,930
Yeah. Um...

113
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,998
Besides, I do that
to protect the house.

114
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:28,801
Helicopters are going to hurt
us, and I make them stay away.

115
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,670
You know what?
Didn't look at it that way.

116
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,371
Thank you for protecting us.

117
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,840
Look, your machine
obviously didn't work.

118
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,508
It just needs a few
adjustments, that's all.

119
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:37,777
Come on, help me get
some of Peter's tools out

120
00:04:37,828 --> 00:04:39,195

what Lady Gaga is?

Is that a band, or a
soda, or a store, or...

152
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,746
one of those terms
like "donkey punch"?

153
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:21,714
No.

154
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:23,349
Is it a douche?

155

Is Lady Gaga a douche?

156
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:29,221
I don't think so.

157

Well, it's no picnic.

162
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,652
Unless your version of a picnic
is being the basket.

163
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,737
Well, you seem like you have
a good attitude about it.

164
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:47,707
Yeah, you know, it's like we
handicapped people say:

165
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,743
"When life ruins your legs,
you just gotta make legonade."

166
00:06:50,794 --> 00:06:53,112
I can sort of relate to that.

167
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,280
You know, sometimes
it's really hard being me,

168
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,383
and I guess I just
make Megonade.

169
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,784
That sounds disgusting.

170
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,002
All right, we're here.

171
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,689
This is my school.

172
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,142
Yeah, isn't that where
you wanted to go?

173
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:07,843
Well, y-yeah, but...

174
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:10,146
most times people just
drop me off a block away

175
00:07:10,213 --> 00:07:11,981
so they don't have
to be seen with me.

176
00:07:12,049 --> 00:07:13,149
Aw, that's gay.

177
00:07:13,216 --> 00:07:14,517
I don't mind being
seen with you.

178
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,501
You don't?

179
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:16,702
Of course not.

180
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,638
Wow.

181
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,923
Well, I-I better go,
I don't want to be tardy.

182
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:23,225
Ah, that's not going to happen
from missing one class.

183
00:07:23,293 --> 00:07:24,760
People are born that way.

184
00:07:24,828 --> 00:07:26,112
Now run along,
or you'll be late.

185
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:32,752
Hey, who's that,
your boyfriend?

186
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,537
(cackling)

187
00:07:34,604 --> 00:07:36,372
Yeah.

188
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,008
Yeah, that's my boyfriend.

189
00:07:43,892 --> 00:07:46,544
Meg, you're here early.

190
00:07:46,612 --> 00:07:48,413
Oh yeah, I just
wanted to make sure

191
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,265
you got a nice hot breakfast
before you head off to work.

192
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,601
Oh. Well, thanks.

193
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:54,836
What's with the getup?

194
00:07:54,903 --> 00:07:56,037
Oh, nothing.

195
00:07:56,105 --> 00:07:58,439
I just wanted
to look sexy for Susie.

196
00:07:58,507 --> 00:08:00,591
How are your eggs, Joe?

197
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:03,494
<i>MEG: If he doesn't say anything
about me calling him "Joe,"</i>

198
00:08:03,562 --> 00:08:05,496
<i>that means we're truly in love.</i>

199
00:08:05,564 --> 00:08:07,348
<i>JOE:
She just called me "Joe."</i>

200
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:08,566
<i>That's kind of weird.</i>

201
00:08:08,634 --> 00:08:10,101
<i>But I'll just let it slide.</i>

202
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:11,636
<i>She's got nothing going on.</i>

203
00:08:11,704 --> 00:08:13,705
<i>Besides, what harm could it do?</i>

204
00:08:13,756 --> 00:08:15,540
They're delicious,
Meg. Thanks.

205
00:08:15,607 --> 00:08:17,642
You're welcome, Joe.

206
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,977
<i>JOE: Ah, (bleep), I should have
said something.</i>

207
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:21,612
<i>MEG:
He let me say it twice now.</i>

208
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,348
<i>It's like we're married.</i>

209
00:08:23,415 --> 00:08:25,516
<i>PATRICK STEWART:
This is Patrick Stewart.</i>

210
00:08:25,584 --> 00:08:27,885
<i>How are you liking
the program so far?</i>

211
00:08:43,936 --> 00:08:46,971
Aah! Oh, geez, you scared me.

212
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:49,107
What happened to your clothes?

213
00:08:49,174 --> 00:08:50,258
Hey, what are you doing?

214
00:08:53,545 --> 00:08:55,413
(screaming)

215
00:08:55,464 --> 00:08:57,215
(gagging)

216
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:04,972
(labored breathing)

217
00:09:05,057 --> 00:09:06,107
Brian, have you seen...?

218
00:09:06,175 --> 00:09:07,759
Whoa, what the hell
happened to you?

219
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:11,128
Easy, easy, man, easy.
(whimpering)

220
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,865
(gasps)

221
00:09:13,932 --> 00:09:15,566
What the hell is your problem?!

222
00:09:15,634 --> 00:09:17,034
Me? What did I do?

223
00:09:17,102 --> 00:09:18,836
You're the one going all
Michael Hutchence over here.

224
00:09:18,904 --> 00:09:20,722
You just stay away
from me, you psychopath.

225
00:09:20,789 --> 00:09:22,156
Hey, ow.

226
00:09:22,224 --> 00:09:23,941
Look, I don't know
what's going on here,

227
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:25,877
but don't be throwing things,
because that's just not safe.

228
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,331
(gasps)
What?

229
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,583
Oh... my... God.

230
00:09:32,651 --> 00:09:35,486
Good Lord!

231
00:09:35,554 --> 00:09:38,022
I... am a genius.

232
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,057
What... what is it?

233
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,225
Don't you see, Brian?

234
00:09:41,293 --> 00:09:42,794
My machine did work.

235
00:09:42,861 --> 00:09:45,062
It created an evil clone of me.

236
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,431
That's why I didn't
feel more evil...

237
00:09:46,498 --> 00:09:48,032
all the evil energy
went into him.

238
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,084
Well, kill it.
It almost choked me to death.

239
00:09:50,152 --> 00:09:51,686
I shall do
no such thing, Brian.

240
00:09:51,754 --> 00:09:53,187
It must be studied.

241
00:09:53,255 --> 00:09:55,690
If I can decode the genetic
puzzle of this being,

242
00:09:55,758 --> 00:09:57,592
perhaps I can determine
how to apply it

243
00:09:57,659 --> 00:09:59,110
to my own neurological makeup.

244
00:09:59,177 --> 00:10:00,912
Evil Stewie, come with me.

245
00:10:00,979 --> 00:10:03,030
We're going to run
a few tests on...

246
00:10:03,098 --> 00:10:04,482
(bone crunches)
(yelling)

247
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,901
(grunting)

248
00:10:09,688 --> 00:10:10,655
(gasps)

249
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:15,192
(whimpering)

250
00:10:15,244 --> 00:10:16,461
(yelling)

251
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:18,446
(screaming)

252
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,400
(grunting)

253
00:10:22,468 --> 00:10:23,868
(coughs)
(Brian screaming)

254
00:10:27,205 --> 00:10:28,956
(screaming continues)

255
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:36,213
(tires squealing)

256
00:10:36,265 --> 00:10:38,266
Oh, my God, a baby!

257
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,450
Are you okay?!

258
00:10:44,606 --> 00:10:46,440
(tires squealing)

259
00:10:50,112 --> 00:10:51,412
Hi, honey.

260
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,480
What?

261
00:10:52,548 --> 00:10:53,548
What'd you say?

262
00:10:53,615 --> 00:10:55,116
I just said hi.

263
00:10:55,184 --> 00:10:58,219
Is that, uh... is that
Bonnie's dress?

264
00:10:58,287 --> 00:11:00,087
Oh, yeah.
Susie spit up on me,

265
00:11:00,155 --> 00:11:02,590
and I didn't want
to go all the way home,

266
00:11:02,658 --> 00:11:03,758
so I just threw this on.

267
00:11:03,826 --> 00:11:04,959
I hope that's okay.

268
00:11:05,027 --> 00:11:07,361
Yeah, it's fine, I guess.

269
00:11:07,429 --> 00:11:09,797
Oh, here's that
juice box you asked for.

270
00:11:09,865 --> 00:11:11,516
Oh, thanks, Meg.

271
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,084
Oh...
What's wrong?

272
00:11:13,151 --> 00:11:14,385
Oh, nothing.

273
00:11:14,453 --> 00:11:17,154
It's just that I like
to put the straw in myself.

274
00:11:17,222 --> 00:11:20,124
Oh, I-I'm sorry. Here.

275
00:11:20,192 --> 00:11:22,310
Yeah.
It's not the same now.

276
00:11:22,394 --> 00:11:24,762
I'll, uh, I'll just get
another one.

277
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,963
(phone rings)

278
00:11:26,031 --> 00:11:27,031
I'll get it!

279
00:11:27,098 --> 00:11:28,716
Hello.

280
00:11:28,784 --> 00:11:30,117
Oh, hi, Meg, it's Bonnie.

281
00:11:30,185 --> 00:11:32,053
How is everything going there?

282
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,087
Oh, great.

283
00:11:33,155 --> 00:11:34,155
Has Joe died?

284
00:11:34,223 --> 00:11:35,590
What? No.

285
00:11:35,657 --> 00:11:37,124
That's good.

286
00:11:37,192 --> 00:11:39,694
I was just calling to tell him
my father is recovering well

287
00:11:39,761 --> 00:11:41,729
and the doctors say
he'll be fine.

288
00:11:41,797 --> 00:11:43,764
That's great. I'll tell him.

289
00:11:43,832 --> 00:11:46,367
I'll be flying back
first thing in the morning.

290
00:11:46,435 --> 00:11:48,035
That's great, too.

291
00:11:48,103 --> 00:11:51,339
Okay, bye, Bonnie.
See ya tomorrow.

292
00:11:51,406 --> 00:11:52,356
Bye.

293
00:11:52,424 --> 00:11:53,624
Who was that?

294
00:11:53,675 --> 00:11:55,376
Oh, uh, prank call.

295
00:11:55,444 --> 00:11:57,845
Oh, yeah, I, uh, get
a lot of those.

296
00:11:57,913 --> 00:12:00,214
I can never figure
out who it is.

297
00:12:00,282 --> 00:12:01,949
Who is this?

298
00:12:02,017 --> 00:12:04,352
PETER: Wheely-wheely stupid head,
but you wish that you were dead.

299
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:05,987
Listen, I don't know who
this is,

300
00:12:06,054 --> 00:12:08,389
but you better cut it out!
I'm a cop, you know!

301
00:12:08,457 --> 00:12:10,925
Oh, what, are you gonna report
me on your can't walkie-talkie?

302
00:12:10,993 --> 00:12:12,460
I'm gonna hang up now.

303
00:12:12,527 --> 00:12:13,861
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait!

304
00:12:13,929 --> 00:12:15,596
I got three more of these
I wrote on a napkin.

305
00:12:15,664 --> 00:12:17,732
(sighs) All right, three more.

306
00:12:23,772 --> 00:12:25,806
(snoring)

307
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,320
(jet engines roar)

308
00:13:10,886 --> 00:13:13,137
(beeping)

309
00:13:13,205 --> 00:13:15,656
Ma'am, is this your bag?

310
00:13:15,724 --> 00:13:18,159
I don't know how that cocaine
got in there.

311
00:13:18,226 --> 00:13:20,294
Ma'am, this bag contains
a concealed weapon.

312
00:13:20,362 --> 00:13:22,430
I'm gonna have to place you
under arrest.

313
00:13:22,497 --> 00:13:25,099
Oh, my goodness,
how did that get in there?

314
00:13:25,183 --> 00:13:27,101
You're gonna have
to come with us, ma'am.

315
00:13:27,185 --> 00:13:28,452
(handcuffs click)
What happened to the coke?

316
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,021
There's no coke in here.

317
00:13:30,088 --> 00:13:32,089
Oh, (bleep),
Ricardo's gonna kill me.

318
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,386
This is nice, Joe.

319
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:45,373
A night out, a good dinner.
Thank you so much.

320
00:13:45,441 --> 00:13:46,841
Well, I wanted to do
something special.

321
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,109
Show you how much I appreciate

322
00:13:48,177 --> 00:13:49,678
all the hard work
you've been doing.

323
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:50,979
Oh, it's been my pleasure.

324
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:52,414
So, listen, there's something

325
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,399
I wanted to talk to you about.

326
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:55,600
What's that?

327
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,203
Do you ever think
about having another baby?

328
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,105
I don't know.

329
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,339
I guess I'm open to it.

330
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:03,208
Really? Oh, that's great!

331
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:04,676
So, I'll get off the pill...

332
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:05,977
What do you mean?

333
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,146
Nothing. Nothing. Forget it.

334
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,615
I-I think I'm just
a little scattered tonight.

335
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,484
I'm probably just PMS-ing.

336
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:13,818
Oh, grody.

337
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,687
Hey, this is supposed
to be a fun night.

338
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:16,788
What's wrong with you?

339
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,057
You know, I could ask
the same of you.

340
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,560
We haven't made love
in two weeks.

341
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,311
We haven't made love ever!

342
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,579
(crying)

343
00:14:24,647 --> 00:14:27,515
Oh, great!
Now you've upset the baby!

344
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:34,189
(gasping) Oh, God! Oh!

345
00:14:34,257 --> 00:14:38,176
<i>PATRICK STEWART: This feels right, but
it tastes like a dirty penny.</i>

346
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,664
This is ridiculous.

347
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,798
Evil Stewie could be anywhere.

348
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,517
You know, this really
is all your fault.

349
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:47,469
If you hadn't told me
I was going soft

350
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,770
I wouldn't have
created Evil Stewie,

351
00:14:48,837 --> 00:14:50,138
he wouldn't have escaped

352
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,274
and we wouldn't be trying
to track down a murderer.

353
00:14:52,341 --> 00:14:54,826
For all we know he could be
killing someone else right now.

354
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:55,827
(normal pitched):
Oh, no.

355
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,828
(deep voice):
Oh, no.

356
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:57,729
(high-pitched):
Oh, no!

357
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,047
Oh, yeah!

358
00:14:59,115 --> 00:14:59,965
(groaning)

359
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:09,341
Listen, guys, I got
something to tell you.

360
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,643
And I don't really know
how to break it to you,

361
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:14,145
so I'm just going to come
right out and say it.

362
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:15,680
Meg has a crush on me.

363
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:19,784
(both laughing)

364
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:22,587
Oh, my God!
Get over yourself!

365
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:25,256
Well, look, all I'm saying is,

366
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,026
I remember when Brian had
a similar difficulty with Meg.

367
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:31,296
Maybe she's prone to quick
and severe infatuation.

368
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:32,964
Yeah, with a dog,
not a cripple.

369
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,799
Hey, easy there.

370
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,568
All right,
look, maybe I'm wrong.

371
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:39,237
Maybe I misread a few
of Meg's signals.

372
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:41,740
Sorry I bothered you.

373
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:46,861
Excuse me, Lois, I have
to go make a phone call.

374
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:48,296
(phone dialing)

375
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,664
Hey, wheely stupid head,

376
00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:51,366
I heard you think
Meg likes you.

377
00:15:51,434 --> 00:15:52,600
JOE:
Who is this?!

378
00:15:52,668 --> 00:15:54,469
How are you getting
this information?!

379
00:15:55,671 --> 00:15:57,105
(sniffs)

380
00:15:57,173 --> 00:15:59,474
Oh, my God, Joe was here.

381
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:00,642
Yeah, he just left.

382
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,511
I know. I can feel him.

383
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:05,263
I can smell him.

384
00:16:05,348 --> 00:16:07,082
Mm, I can taste him.

385
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:09,484
Okay, I get the smell part.

386
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,920
But, Meg, I think we
have to have a talk.

387
00:16:11,987 --> 00:16:13,988
Sweetheart, you don't...

388
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,091
you don't have a crush
on Joe, do you?

389
00:16:16,158 --> 00:16:18,927
Um... I don't know.

390
00:16:18,994 --> 00:16:22,097
Oh, my God, you do have
a crush on him.

391
00:16:22,164 --> 00:16:24,282
What, Mom?
Why shouldn't I like him?

392
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,401
When I'm with him,
he makes me happy.

393
00:16:26,469 --> 00:16:28,169
And he needs me.

394
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,538
Oh, Meg,
you're fooling yourself.

395
00:16:30,606 --> 00:16:33,074
It's classic
Florence Nightingale Syndrome.

396
00:16:33,142 --> 00:16:35,343
You're taking care of him
and you're feeling a closeness

397
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,113
that you're misinterpreting
as a romantic connection.

398
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,647
But think about it, Meg.

399
00:16:39,715 --> 00:16:41,182
You two have nothing in common.

400
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,385
You know, you're right, Mom.

401
00:16:43,452 --> 00:16:46,054
I hear you loud and clear.

402
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,484
(thumping)
(screaming)

403
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:03,054
(tires squealing)

404
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,173
Meg, what the hell did you do?!

405
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:07,442
I made us the same, Joe.

406
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:10,078
We're exactly alike, you and I.

407
00:17:10,146 --> 00:17:12,714
Now we can be together.

408
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,516
My God, we have to get you
to the hospital.

409
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,806
(siren wailing)
(tires squealing)

410
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,142
No, but I mean after
soccer practice.

411
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,977
You got anything
planned for then?

412
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,295
(siren wailing)

413
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,463
I mean, nothing, nothing.

414
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,064
Keep walking.
You don't know me.

415
00:17:36,939 --> 00:17:38,757
The doctor says
you're going to be fine.

416
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,391
And your family's on the way.

417
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,994
But that was a crazy
thing you did, Meg.

418
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,195
I know.

419
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,498
I'm... I'm so sorry.

420
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,333
I just wanted us to be closer.

421
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,201
Look, Meg, I do care for you,

422
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:53,138
but I care for you like
I... I would a niece

423
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:54,906
or a good friend's daughter.

424
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:57,575
(sighs)
I feel like such an idiot.

425
00:17:57,643 --> 00:18:00,311
Don't. I'm lucky
to have you as a neighbor,

426
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:03,081
and even luckier
to have you as a friend.

427
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:07,018
Thanks. I'm lucky
to have you as a friend, too.

428
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,220
(sighs)
When is Bonnie coming home?

429
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:11,222
I have to apologize to her.

430
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,224
Well, you can
apologize right now.

431
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:14,476
Hi, Meg.

432
00:18:14,543 --> 00:18:16,911
Bonnie, I'm so sorry
I got you arrested.

433
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:18,780
No, it's all right, Meg.

434
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:23,017
Look, I was a teenage girl
with a crush at one time myself.

435
00:18:23,085 --> 00:18:26,054
I know sometimes
it makes you lose touch.

436
00:18:26,121 --> 00:18:27,388
Thanks for being
so understanding.

437
00:18:27,456 --> 00:18:29,791
I-I hope I didn't get you
into too much trouble.

438
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,477
I mean, you're not gonna go
to jail or anything, are you?

439
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,379
No, I'll be around.

440
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:38,082
I need these voice-over checks to
support my gambling addiction.

441
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,739
Evil Stewie?

442
00:18:44,807 --> 00:18:46,875
Wherever you are,
if you can hear me,

443
00:18:46,942 --> 00:18:48,810
I'm completely
defenseless right now.

444
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,533
Okay, there you are.

445
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,769
Well, this is a gift, Brian.

446
00:18:57,837 --> 00:19:00,605
Thank you for making it so easy.

447
00:19:00,689 --> 00:19:02,941
Hey, well, you know,
you're doing me a favor.

448
00:19:03,025 --> 00:19:05,660
I've had enough; I can't live
with that stupid family anymore.

449
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,696
Do me a favor and end it
all for me, will ya?

450
00:19:08,764 --> 00:19:10,932
Delighted to oblige, Brian.

451
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,187
Aah!

452
00:19:23,879 --> 00:19:26,748
(blows landing loudly)

453
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,907
(weapon blasting)

454
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,472
(blows landing loudly)

455
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:28,509
Oh, come on,
not this thing! Really?

456
00:20:28,577 --> 00:20:29,978
Brian, it's me, Stewie.

457
00:20:30,045 --> 00:20:32,046
<i>Shoot him!
No! Brian, you know me.</i>

458
00:20:32,114 --> 00:20:33,581
<i>Look at me.
Shoot him.</i>

459
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,917
All right, there's
only one way to settle this.

460
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,218
Look at your feet.

461
00:20:37,286 --> 00:20:38,653
Why? They're just feet.

462
00:20:38,721 --> 00:20:39,821
(giggling)

463
00:20:39,888 --> 00:20:41,356
Wh-What are they
doing down there?

464
00:20:41,423 --> 00:20:42,790
They're like leg hands!

465
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:47,545
(sizzling)

466
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,182
Nice job, man!

467
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,450
Wow!

468
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:53,952
That was really brilliant.

469
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,887
Thanks. Just glad
this nightmare is over.

470
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:58,506
And I'm really glad I
didn't kill the wrong Stewie.

471
00:20:58,574 --> 00:20:59,741
Yeah, me, too.

472
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:01,376
Hey, come on,
I'll take you home.

473
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:07,548
(deep, echoing, evil laughter)

474
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:13,885
