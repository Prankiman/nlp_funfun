1
00:00:33,123 --> 00:00:35,836
<i>We now return to Rodney King of Queens.</i>

2
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:39,614
- Rodney, did you take out the trash?
- Um, I forgot.

3
00:00:42,093 --> 00:00:44,007
Oh, no she di-in't.

4
00:00:45,405 --> 00:00:46,903
Pizza for Adam West.

5
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:50,897
No. You gave me Canadian bacon
instead of bacon?

6
00:00:50,898 --> 00:00:53,673
This misdeed cannot go unpunished.

7
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:59,580
Pizza delivery man, prepare to meet your
maker at the hands of my cat launcher.

8
00:01:18,153 --> 00:01:21,734
Hey, look, somebody tried to break
into the dirty movie store.

9
00:01:21,769 --> 00:01:24,681
Quick, grab as many as you can
before someone sees us.

10
00:01:26,568 --> 00:01:28,107
Damn, I lost him.

11
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:31,000
All right, cats, back in the bag.
Come on, Fluffy.

12
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:33,550
Come on, Mittens. Come on, Paul.

13
00:01:33,608 --> 00:01:37,510
What a ridiculous name for a cat.

14
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:41,051
Paul! That's a person's name.

15
00:01:41,087 --> 00:01:43,482
A person's name.

16
00:01:45,267 --> 00:01:46,792
Oh, Paul.

17
00:01:49,797 --> 00:01:51,901
Oh, man, this is going to be great.

18
00:01:51,906 --> 00:01:54,753
- Oh, are we watching a movie?
- The lab results are back.

19
00:01:54,756 --> 00:01:57,282
You've tested positive for nymphomania.

20
00:01:57,285 --> 00:01:59,231
Oh, no, what should I do?

21
00:01:59,237 --> 00:02:01,852
Take two of these and call us
in the morning.

22
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:05,463
Oh, now that's not going
to help her nymphomania.

23
00:02:05,465 --> 00:02:07,311
It's only going to exacerbate it.

24
00:02:07,788 --> 00:02:11,283
Oh, my God, what are you kids doing?
Out. Everybody out.

25
00:02:12,547 --> 00:02:13,680
That's bogus.

26
00:02:13,915 --> 00:02:17,102
- Chris, what is this?
- Genital Hospital.

27
00:02:17,105 --> 00:02:19,902
Yes, and it's inappropriate
for someone your age.

28
00:02:19,908 --> 00:02:22,972
Now, if you're curious about sex,
you should talk to your sex ed teacher.

29
00:02:22,975 --> 00:02:26,793
We don't have one. The principal
cut sex ed class to save money.

30
00:02:26,796 --> 00:02:29,121
What? Well, that's crazy.

31
00:02:29,126 --> 00:02:32,370
Without sex ed, kids can wind up
sexually confused.

32
00:02:32,378 --> 00:02:34,303
Just look at Michael Jackson.

33
00:02:34,337 --> 00:02:36,382
The kid in me likes the frosted side...

34
00:02:36,386 --> 00:02:38,822
but the grown-up in me
likes the kid in me.

35
00:02:39,937 --> 00:02:43,153
Peter, do you know they're not teaching
sex ed at Chris' school?

36
00:02:43,168 --> 00:02:45,381
Eh, let them figure it out the way
I had to.

37
00:02:45,385 --> 00:02:49,043
With a can of Crisco and a shot glass.
That's the natural way, Lois.

38
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:50,361
That's the natural way.

39
00:02:50,367 --> 00:02:52,193
Well, somebody's got to step in.

40
00:02:52,197 --> 00:02:54,223
Tomorrow, I'm going down to
James Woods High

41
00:02:54,235 --> 00:02:55,962
and offer to teach the class myself.

42
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:57,780
Hey, you could really make a difference.

43
00:02:57,785 --> 00:03:00,571
Like I did when I taught money
management to those drug addicts.

44
00:03:00,585 --> 00:03:02,580
There's a lot of ways for you guys
to save money.

45
00:03:02,587 --> 00:03:05,650
For example, you're all shooting up,
why not share needles?

46
00:03:05,657 --> 00:03:09,152
That's a no-brainer. More money in
your wallet, more drugs in your veins.

47
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:12,682
My second piece of advice:
have as many kids as you can,

48
00:03:12,685 --> 00:03:15,532
'cause that makes it more likely
that one of those kids'll grow up

49
00:03:15,535 --> 00:03:17,993
and make it big in Hollywood.

50
00:03:18,147 --> 00:03:20,220
Then who's paying the bills, eh?

51
00:03:20,506 --> 00:03:22,213
Hollywood kid.

52
00:03:22,516 --> 00:03:23,652
Class dismissed.

53
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:28,790
Good morning, everyone.

54
00:03:28,796 --> 00:03:31,813
I'm Mrs. Griffin,
your new sex ed teacher.

55
00:03:31,816 --> 00:03:34,001
Now, you've probably heard all those rumors

56
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:36,312
that condoms make sex less pleasurable.

57
00:03:36,315 --> 00:03:39,691
While that is a fact,
they also make sex safer.

58
00:03:39,706 --> 00:03:40,940
Sorry I'm late, Lois.

59
00:03:40,947 --> 00:03:42,441
Peter, what are you doing here?

60
00:03:42,446 --> 00:03:44,553
Lois, you think I'm going
to miss a chance to share

61
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,313
my knowledge with these
fresh young minds?

62
00:03:46,317 --> 00:03:48,653
Forget it, I've missed too many
other opportunities.

63
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,693
- There he is.
- Took you long enough.

64
00:03:50,705 --> 00:03:53,442
- Just what we need.
- Hey, guys, I'm coming in.

65
00:03:53,807 --> 00:03:55,971
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God.

66
00:03:55,975 --> 00:03:58,720
Oh, boy.
I am not going to hear the end of this.

67
00:03:58,725 --> 00:04:00,203
- You jackass.
- Now you've done it.

68
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:01,080
Idiot.

69
00:04:01,085 --> 00:04:04,500
I know I don't fit here,
but I'm just going to settle right in.

70
00:04:04,615 --> 00:04:08,191
All right, Peter, you can stay,
but remember, this is my class.

71
00:04:08,196 --> 00:04:11,953
Now, there are a number of natural ways
that males and females interact.

72
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,940
That's right, allow me to demonstrate.

73
00:04:13,947 --> 00:04:16,890
Hey, Rainbow Brite.
Hello, Shakespeare.

74
00:04:16,898 --> 00:04:19,720
I am all done writing plays for the day,

75
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:22,341
perhaps we could have sexual intercourse?

76
00:04:22,448 --> 00:04:23,773
Count me in.

77
00:04:30,856 --> 00:04:34,023
I say, look at this.
This toy has small parts.

78
00:04:34,028 --> 00:04:36,683
Why the devil would they include
small parts?

79
00:04:36,687 --> 00:04:37,613
Unless...

80
00:04:37,616 --> 00:04:40,771
I'm supposed to eat them.
Of course, it all adds up!

81
00:04:42,055 --> 00:04:44,301
Oh, dear God, I've lost a tooth.

82
00:04:44,307 --> 00:04:45,640
Dude, you're lucky.

83
00:04:45,645 --> 00:04:47,251
If you put that under your pillow,

84
00:04:47,257 --> 00:04:49,580
the Tooth Fairy will come
and give you a dollar.

85
00:04:49,587 --> 00:04:52,352
What?
Did you say the Tooth Fairy comes here?

86
00:04:52,357 --> 00:04:55,542
To our house?
She just breaks in like some hood?

87
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:59,090
Yeah, she creeps into your house at night
and comes into your room while you sleep.

88
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:00,073
Oh, my God!

89
00:05:00,076 --> 00:05:01,850
And sometimes, just for the hell of it,

90
00:05:01,856 --> 00:05:04,300
she cuts off a piece of her armpit hair

91
00:05:04,308 --> 00:05:06,333
and places it gently on your tongue.

92
00:05:06,345 --> 00:05:09,250
Oh, oh, God! Oh, God, I got to get
out of here! I got to get out of here!

93
00:05:09,258 --> 00:05:10,981
Stewie, calm down.
Get a hold of yourself.

94
00:05:10,987 --> 00:05:12,493
Here, Brian, let me handle this.

95
00:05:12,496 --> 00:05:15,242
Calm down.
Everything's going to be all right.

96
00:05:15,246 --> 00:05:16,752
Chris, you're wanted on the phone.

97
00:05:16,758 --> 00:05:19,172
Everything's going to be all right.

98
00:05:27,297 --> 00:05:29,710
Hey, Lois, I wanted to get some K-Y Jelly

99
00:05:29,717 --> 00:05:32,522
for the class today, but they were
all out so I got Smucker's.

100
00:05:32,525 --> 00:05:34,260
Peter, I don't know
what you think you're doing,

101
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:37,670
but you ruined my sex ed class. There's
no way you're coming with me again.

102
00:05:37,675 --> 00:05:38,353
Fine,

103
00:05:38,356 --> 00:05:41,590
but without my advice, those kids are
going to be as hopeless as Liam Neeson

104
00:05:41,597 --> 00:05:43,543
when he tries to play an
American cowboy.

105
00:05:43,548 --> 00:05:45,980
But, Montana, when will you be back?

106
00:05:45,986 --> 00:05:49,723
That's none of your concern.
You got to take care of the offspring.

107
00:05:49,738 --> 00:05:54,182
Gonna take a fortnight at least to get
this herd down to St. Louis on Mississippi.

108
00:05:54,196 --> 00:05:56,332
This glen's gonna be tough to traverse,

109
00:05:56,335 --> 00:05:59,653
and that river's got to be 50,
60 meters wide.

110
00:05:59,657 --> 00:06:01,493
And God knows how many fathoms.

111
00:06:01,498 --> 00:06:05,261
To hell with parliamentary procedure.
We've got to wrangle up some cattles.

112
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,803
What is going on here?

113
00:06:09,805 --> 00:06:13,113
We're all protesting the sex ed class
that's being taught to our children.

114
00:06:13,115 --> 00:06:15,330
Mrs. Griffin, I'm sorry to have
to tell you this,

115
00:06:15,336 --> 00:06:18,572
but the school board has voted
to cancel your sex ed class.

116
00:06:18,575 --> 00:06:22,011
Look, Principal Shepherd, I know
my husband acted inappropriately...

117
00:06:22,018 --> 00:06:23,572
Oh, it's not because of your husband.

118
00:06:23,577 --> 00:06:26,671
It's because you're teaching those kids
about condoms.

119
00:06:26,717 --> 00:06:29,633
What? That's ridiculous.

120
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:33,020
These students have the
right to information about safe sex.

121
00:06:33,036 --> 00:06:35,120
Well, these parents don't think so.

122
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,542
I'm sorry, Mrs. Griffin. You're fired.

123
00:06:37,578 --> 00:06:39,800
Fired?! Oh, no.

124
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,702
I can't believe they fired you.

125
00:06:48,705 --> 00:06:50,821
Can't you go down the school
and try to reason with them?

126
00:06:50,826 --> 00:06:53,080
No, I'm banned from school property.

127
00:06:53,098 --> 00:06:55,333
The PTA doesn't want me around
their children.

128
00:06:55,335 --> 00:06:57,020
Well, Lois, I think you did
the right thing

129
00:06:57,027 --> 00:06:59,262
by trying to inform these kids
about safe sex.

130
00:06:59,265 --> 00:07:01,661
And if the parents don't like it,
that's their loss.

131
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:05,480
That's the problem, though.
It isn't their loss, it's the kids' loss.

132
00:07:05,485 --> 00:07:08,103
I just hope they're getting
the information they need.

133
00:07:09,406 --> 00:07:11,960
All right, students,
we have a special speaker today

134
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:13,693
who's going to educate you about sex.

135
00:07:13,758 --> 00:07:16,512
Please welcome from the
First Evangelical Church,

136
00:07:16,546 --> 00:07:19,600
the Reverend Jerry Kirkwood
and the Opal Ring Crusade.

137
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,870
Hey, kids, put your Walkmans down
and listen up.

138
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:25,182
'Cause we're going to talk about sex.

139
00:07:25,188 --> 00:07:27,982
<i>Sex? Hang on there, Jerry.</i>

140
00:07:27,988 --> 00:07:30,340
God, what are you doing here?

141
00:07:30,353 --> 00:07:33,824
<i>I was just passing through on my way
to see The Matrix.</i>

142
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:36,451
- We can relate to that.
- No fake.

143
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:40,047
Well, God, I am here to talk to
these kids about sex.

144
00:07:40,049 --> 00:07:41,522
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

145
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:43,610
And why they shouldn't be having it.

146
00:07:43,618 --> 00:07:44,952
<i>That is boss.</i>

147
00:07:44,955 --> 00:07:47,071
Hey, you kids like Mad TV?

148
00:07:47,076 --> 00:07:49,472
Well, we've got something almost as good.

149
00:07:49,475 --> 00:07:52,340
Here they are... The Opal Ring Players.

150
00:07:52,558 --> 00:07:55,331
Boy, I sure had fun
at the pizza parlor tonight, Debbie.

151
00:07:55,346 --> 00:07:58,232
Yeah, Matthew,
that pizza pie was delicious.

152
00:07:58,235 --> 00:08:00,141
Hey, watch out, crazy driver.

153
00:08:00,148 --> 00:08:02,320
That joker must have been
from Jefferson High.

154
00:08:03,008 --> 00:08:04,162
They're our rivals.

155
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:06,731
Well, here we are at the make-out point.

156
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,880
Yeah. You want to go all the way?

157
00:08:08,885 --> 00:08:12,683
Freeze! Now, who can tell me
what Matthew just did wrong?

158
00:08:12,718 --> 00:08:16,082
I mean, besides not running over
that yahoo from Jefferson High.

159
00:08:16,776 --> 00:08:17,901
They're our rivals.

160
00:08:17,906 --> 00:08:20,882
He's wrong 'cause he wants to have sex
and he's not married.

161
00:08:20,886 --> 00:08:23,233
- Bingo.
- Wow, you're pretty smart.

162
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,723
- Thanks. My name's Doug.
- I'm Meg.

163
00:08:30,545 --> 00:08:32,903
Now, look, let's rap for a second.

164
00:08:32,906 --> 00:08:35,663
He's sitting informally like us.
Let's hear what he has to say.

165
00:08:35,676 --> 00:08:37,052
Jefferson High is our rival.

166
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:41,010
Sure, sex if fun, but you can't have it
before you're married,

167
00:08:41,027 --> 00:08:42,853
even if you use a condom.

168
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:46,191
Because not only to condoms fail
100% of the time,

169
00:08:46,196 --> 00:08:48,383
they're also majorly unsafe.

170
00:08:48,388 --> 00:08:52,320
Hey, you wouldn't put a plastic bag
over your grandmother's head, would you?

171
00:08:52,337 --> 00:08:53,311
No.

172
00:08:53,326 --> 00:08:56,290
And that's why we're gonna be
handing out these opal rings.

173
00:08:56,296 --> 00:08:58,472
These rings are a symbol of
your commitment

174
00:08:58,477 --> 00:09:00,703
to refrain from sex until you're married.

175
00:09:00,717 --> 00:09:02,853
So what do you say?
Who wants to be joyful?

176
00:09:02,858 --> 00:09:06,801
Who wants to be pure?
Who wants to be... abstinent?

177
00:09:08,898 --> 00:09:13,101
- Wow, he makes so much sense.
- I know, he's a visionary,

178
00:09:13,118 --> 00:09:15,772
like Gandhi or Mozart or Picasso.

179
00:09:15,778 --> 00:09:18,383
Ladies and gentlemen, my newest work.

180
00:09:18,388 --> 00:09:20,371
Now, I know this person looks
a little mixed up,

181
00:09:20,378 --> 00:09:23,261
but, watch carefully.
If I move this down here,

182
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:25,130
and this over here,

183
00:09:25,276 --> 00:09:27,362
and this part here...

184
00:09:27,475 --> 00:09:29,573
Anyone tell who it is yet?
No?

185
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:33,543
Okay, well, what if I move this here
and this here...

186
00:09:33,718 --> 00:09:35,463
Then it's Dianne Wiest.

187
00:09:38,425 --> 00:09:40,923
All right, men, your mission tonight
is to stave off

188
00:09:40,927 --> 00:09:42,781
the invading forces of the Tooth Fairy.

189
00:09:42,786 --> 00:09:44,521
SpongeBob, you watch the East.

190
00:09:44,527 --> 00:09:46,312
StarScream, you take the West.

191
00:09:46,318 --> 00:09:50,230
And Man-E-Faces, you take center patrol
since you have many faces.

192
00:09:56,856 --> 00:09:59,170
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.
It's morning.

193
00:09:59,228 --> 00:10:00,161
Is it?

194
00:10:00,168 --> 00:10:02,291
Ha! I knew it! I scared her off.

195
00:10:02,295 --> 00:10:04,471
Uh, you might want to check
under your pillow.

196
00:10:05,575 --> 00:10:06,882
How did she get in?

197
00:10:06,885 --> 00:10:09,753
She must have been quieter than
Britney Spears' dietician.

198
00:10:10,508 --> 00:10:12,872
Ea-Easy on those trans fats.

199
00:10:13,728 --> 00:10:16,191
N- Not everything needs gravy.

200
00:10:16,915 --> 00:10:20,300
You know, there's some carrots
down at the other end.

201
00:10:21,568 --> 00:10:24,430
That-that cheesecake was for everyone.

202
00:10:24,438 --> 00:10:26,630
Her hand was right beneath my pillow.

203
00:10:26,638 --> 00:10:28,830
She could have snapped my neck
if she had a mind to.

204
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:31,790
Don't worry about it. I'm sure it will be
a while before you lose another tooth.

205
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:32,883
I can't wait for that.

206
00:10:32,888 --> 00:10:36,193
I have to lure her back on my terms
and kill her myself!

207
00:10:36,227 --> 00:10:39,683
But to catch a fairy,
I have to think like a fairy.

208
00:10:40,156 --> 00:10:43,310

<i>We now return to Laguna Beach.</i>

218
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,400
- Like, right?
- I know.

219
00:11:10,407 --> 00:11:12,501
- Whatever, because "duh!"
- I know, right?

220
00:11:12,508 --> 00:11:14,943
Whatever, because I mean,
like, totally full out.

221
00:11:14,947 --> 00:11:16,361
- Full on.
- Right?

222
00:11:16,367 --> 00:11:18,821
I guess it's not easy growing up
anywhere.

223
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:22,961
Hey, Dad, check out my abstinence ring.
It means I made a pledge not to have sex.

224
00:11:22,977 --> 00:11:26,313
That's crazy! You can't give up sex.
You've got a responsibility.

225
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:29,221
You see, Meg, you're what they call
a "practice girl. "

226
00:11:29,227 --> 00:11:31,833
Dad, look at the facts about sex.

227
00:11:31,926 --> 00:11:36,322
"If you have sex, your penis will fall
off and land in another dimension"

228
00:11:36,327 --> 00:11:39,483
"populated entirely by dogs
who will eat it. "

229
00:11:39,486 --> 00:11:43,002
Well, that's something I'd like to avoid.
Well, this changes everything.

230
00:11:43,008 --> 00:11:45,571
From now on, I, too, will be obstinate.

231
00:11:45,577 --> 00:11:46,921
- Abstinent.
- Absinthe.

232
00:11:46,926 --> 00:11:48,522
- Abstinent.
- You're grounded.

233
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:52,131
All right, getting a tooth to lure

234
00:11:52,138 --> 00:11:54,611
that damn fairy back shouldn't be
too difficult.

235
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:08,030
I'd love to dance, Fred Savage.

236
00:12:14,028 --> 00:12:17,760
Gosh, Meg, I really wish we could take
our relationship to the next level.

237
00:12:17,775 --> 00:12:21,871
I know, I feel the same way,
but we made a decision to be abstinent.

238
00:12:21,888 --> 00:12:25,362
Of course, there are ways
we could keep our pledge

239
00:12:25,365 --> 00:12:27,591
and still do other things.

240
00:12:27,605 --> 00:12:30,483
You're right.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

241
00:12:30,485 --> 00:12:31,513
Uh-huh.

242
00:12:32,688 --> 00:12:34,232
Oh, there it is. I see it.

243
00:12:34,238 --> 00:12:37,143
You know, Roy, I hope you play
squash better than you pass.

244
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:38,991
Well, we'll find out this Saturday.

245
00:12:43,508 --> 00:12:46,810
All right, Peter,
you ready for role-playing night?

246
00:12:46,815 --> 00:12:51,353
Here comes, Grimace.
You got some burgers I can steal, huh?

247
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:53,783
Lois, the Hamburglar steals hamburgers.

248
00:12:53,785 --> 00:12:56,341
Grimace is
Ronald McDonald's autistic friend.

249
00:12:56,348 --> 00:13:00,270
Oh, come on, you love the
dirty-talking Grimace.

250
00:13:00,276 --> 00:13:02,352
You... Peter, what the hell is this?

251
00:13:02,355 --> 00:13:05,110
- My chastity belt.
- A chastity belt?

252
00:13:05,115 --> 00:13:08,263
- What in God's name is that for?
- I'm abstinent, Lois.

253
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:10,562
It's all in these pamphlets
Meg brought home from school.

254
00:13:10,565 --> 00:13:13,391
Sex turns straight people gay
and turn gays into Mexicans.

255
00:13:13,407 --> 00:13:15,073
Everyone goes down a notch.

256
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:18,191
This is nonsense.
You can't force abstinence on kids.

257
00:13:18,205 --> 00:13:20,861
Lois, what possible harm
can abstinence do?

258
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:23,160
Meg Griffin, we need to have a talk.

259
00:13:23,758 --> 00:13:24,853
Mom!

260
00:13:25,495 --> 00:13:27,902
Oh, my God!

261
00:13:28,026 --> 00:13:29,841
You kids were doing it...

262
00:13:29,847 --> 00:13:31,332
in the ear!

263
00:13:31,338 --> 00:13:34,062
Hey, my sandwich tastes funny. Is there
something wrong with the Smucker's?

264
00:13:34,065 --> 00:13:35,861
Yeah, it's been on my crotch.

265
00:13:39,075 --> 00:13:42,463
Meg, I still cannot believe
what you and Doug did last night.

266
00:13:42,478 --> 00:13:45,720
Mom, you don't understand.
Doug and I are abstinent,

267
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:48,193
but if we have sex in the ear,
it doesn't count.

268
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:50,601
We're still pure in the eyes of the Lord.

269
00:13:50,608 --> 00:13:53,893
Meg, when I was your age,
my parents tried to feed me

270
00:13:53,898 --> 00:13:57,641
the same nonsense about premarital sex.
You're lying to yourself.

271
00:13:57,647 --> 00:13:59,200
Well, I don't care what you think!

272
00:13:59,218 --> 00:14:01,562
Doug and I are part of the
Opal Ring Crusade,

273
00:14:01,565 --> 00:14:03,530
and this is how we choose
to express our love.

274
00:14:03,538 --> 00:14:07,073
Look, Meg,
A) ear sex is just unnatural,

275
00:14:07,087 --> 00:14:09,481
and B)...
How do I say this?

276
00:14:09,485 --> 00:14:12,253
Vaginal intercourse is...

277
00:14:12,755 --> 00:14:14,871
it's just tops.

278
00:14:14,877 --> 00:14:17,162
It's the bee's knees, Meg.

279
00:14:17,168 --> 00:14:20,142
Oh, when you rattle it around
just right...

280
00:14:20,148 --> 00:14:21,741
oh, my God!

281
00:14:21,745 --> 00:14:24,751
I mean, you remember when we had
that old car with the bad shocks

282
00:14:24,758 --> 00:14:27,492
and I used to take the old dirt road
on purpose?

283
00:14:27,495 --> 00:14:29,423
Meg... Meg?

284
00:14:30,178 --> 00:14:31,432
I love you.

285
00:14:35,147 --> 00:14:38,922
In local news, a sexy new trend
has emerged at James Woods High.

286
00:14:38,926 --> 00:14:42,781
That's right, Tom. It appears that
students have taken to having ear sex

287
00:14:42,787 --> 00:14:44,561
in lieu of traditional intercourse.

288
00:14:44,578 --> 00:14:47,932
Over 200 reports of ear sex
have been confirmed so far,

289
00:14:47,936 --> 00:14:50,430
prompting a new slogan:
"Once you go black,"

290
00:14:50,437 --> 00:14:51,580
"you go deaf. "

291
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:54,770
Brian, I'll be right back.
I'm going to use the little girl's room.

292
00:14:54,776 --> 00:14:55,902
All right, baby.

293
00:14:57,835 --> 00:15:00,113
An entire week and still no teeth.

294
00:15:00,116 --> 00:15:03,193
And it turns out these teeth I got
from the old man are phony.

295
00:15:03,197 --> 00:15:05,731
Brian, Brian, look, I'm Gary Busey.

296
00:15:05,737 --> 00:15:09,642
I'm frequently aggressive
in situations that don't call for it.

297
00:15:11,555 --> 00:15:14,711
- What the hell is that?
- Ah, it's Jillian. She's, uh...

298
00:15:14,806 --> 00:15:17,572
she has this eating disorder.
She's bulimic.

299
00:15:17,575 --> 00:15:20,223
- My God, that's horrible!
- I know, it really is.

300
00:15:20,228 --> 00:15:23,502
I mean, her hair is falling out.
Last week she lost a tooth.

301
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,332
Really?

302
00:15:24,338 --> 00:15:29,110
But man, I'll tell ya, all that purging
just makes her body look fantastic.

303
00:15:29,247 --> 00:15:31,243
I mean, that's what the supermodels do.

304
00:15:31,326 --> 00:15:34,201
And so many of them just look so great.

305
00:15:36,196 --> 00:15:37,832
Karen Carpenter over did it,

306
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:39,982
but I think Jillian's found
a good balance.

307
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:45,632
I'm really surprised
you invited me out for dinner, Stevie.

308
00:15:45,648 --> 00:15:48,413
Oh, well, you know, I just wanted
to touch base, see how everything's...

309
00:15:48,418 --> 00:15:49,440
It's "Stewie," by the way.

310
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,702
Just to check in, make sure everything's
going well with you and Brian.

311
00:15:52,706 --> 00:15:54,492
It's going kickass!

312
00:15:54,498 --> 00:15:56,361
Well, you look fantastic.

313
00:15:56,366 --> 00:15:58,752
Got some meat on your bones,
which is great.

314
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:00,690
- What?
- Just saying you look jolly,

315
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:03,732
like Ruben Studdard
or John Goodman or Santa.

316
00:16:03,736 --> 00:16:06,590
Oh, my God. Are you saying I'm fat?

317
00:16:06,595 --> 00:16:09,493
No, I'm saying Santa's thin.
Get in there and throw up!

318
00:16:11,026 --> 00:16:13,900
Excellent. Now I'm prepared
to fight the Tooth Fairy

319
00:16:13,918 --> 00:16:17,013
just like Gerri fought comedy
on The Facts of Life.

320
00:16:17,027 --> 00:16:19,271
Hey, Blair, did you find
a purse at the mall?

321
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:21,341
Actually, I found seven.

322
00:16:22,605 --> 00:16:25,163
One for every day of the week.

323
00:16:30,348 --> 00:16:32,563
I'm wide awake, Peter.

324
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:36,413
- You want to mess around?
- Lois, you know I'm abstinent.

325
00:16:36,415 --> 00:16:39,801
Come on. Can't you break
your stupid pledge for one night?

326
00:16:39,806 --> 00:16:42,553
Well, I guess we do both have needs.

327
00:16:44,387 --> 00:16:45,983
Peter.

328
00:16:47,895 --> 00:16:51,001
Wh-What are you doing? What?
Peter, what are you doing to my ear?!

329
00:16:51,005 --> 00:16:52,413
Get off of me!

330
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,241
What the hell is wrong with you?!

331
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:56,360
This is all I can do, Lois.
I'm abstinent.

332
00:16:56,368 --> 00:16:57,480
That is it.

333
00:16:57,488 --> 00:17:00,552
I am going to have regular sex with you
whether you like it or not.

334
00:17:00,557 --> 00:17:01,131
No!

335
00:17:01,135 --> 00:17:03,750
I wasn't asking your permission.

336
00:17:05,846 --> 00:17:07,970
No, no, no! I'm abstinent!

337
00:17:07,977 --> 00:17:09,650
This is an affront to the Lord!

338
00:17:09,656 --> 00:17:12,003
No!

339
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,311
No!

340
00:17:16,598 --> 00:17:18,470
Oh, I see what you're driving at.

341
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,490
Oh, that was fantastic.

342
00:17:22,498 --> 00:17:24,591
Hey, when'd you get that tattoo
on your lower back?

343
00:17:24,596 --> 00:17:26,903
I don't know, Peter.
Meth is a hell of a drug.

344
00:17:26,906 --> 00:17:27,372
What?

345
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,510
I'm just glad to have you back
on my side.

346
00:17:29,528 --> 00:17:32,530
I only wish I could convince Meg
and her classmates, too.

347
00:17:32,537 --> 00:17:34,102
We'll show 'em somehow, Lois.

348
00:17:34,105 --> 00:17:37,592
I'll be more convincing than Mel Gibson
when he apologized to the Jews.

349
00:17:37,627 --> 00:17:41,301
I'm really, really sorry about
your big noses.

350
00:17:41,345 --> 00:17:44,341
I'm really sorry about how
greedy you are.

351
00:17:44,376 --> 00:17:47,950
But most of all, I'm really sorry
about your dirty,

352
00:17:47,955 --> 00:17:50,361
underhanded, backstabbing ways.

353
00:17:50,365 --> 00:17:53,540
Your number-one dirty Jew fan,
Mel Gibson.

354
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,861
All right, Tooth Whore, do your worst.

355
00:18:04,508 --> 00:18:06,700
Stewie, what the hell?
Get me down from here.

356
00:18:06,707 --> 00:18:09,612
No, way, man! How do I know
you're not the Tooth Fairy in disguise?

357
00:18:09,615 --> 00:18:11,261
- Your middle name is Gilligan.
- Not good enough!

358
00:18:11,267 --> 00:18:13,352
- You think my girlfriend's a moron.
- So does everyone!

359
00:18:13,357 --> 00:18:15,233
You have a picture of Chris Noth
in your wallet.

360
00:18:15,245 --> 00:18:15,811
Okay.

361
00:18:16,786 --> 00:18:19,672
Stewie, this is ridiculous.
There's something I have to tell you.

362
00:18:19,677 --> 00:18:21,831
The Tooth Fairy isn't real.

363
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:22,692
What?!

364
00:18:22,696 --> 00:18:25,761
Look, I didn't want to burst your
bubble since you're just a kid, but,

365
00:18:25,765 --> 00:18:27,651
yeah, she's all smoke and mirrors

366
00:18:27,668 --> 00:18:29,100
just like Harry Houdini.

367
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,680
But I don't want to play bridge
with the Petersons tonight.

368
00:18:31,697 --> 00:18:34,371
Harry, we agreed weeks ago,
and we're going.

369
00:18:34,378 --> 00:18:36,541
All right, fine, let me get my coat.

370
00:18:37,978 --> 00:18:40,000
Oh, wait a second!

371
00:18:40,366 --> 00:18:43,023
Damn it! I am not going by myself!

372
00:18:43,116 --> 00:18:44,393
Ah, you bitch.

373
00:18:44,626 --> 00:18:45,923
Oh, very well then.

374
00:18:45,927 --> 00:18:49,591
I suppose that bile-spewing skirt
of yours can have her tooth back.

375
00:18:52,877 --> 00:18:54,551
What? It's gone!

376
00:18:54,556 --> 00:18:56,641
Whoa, I wonder what happened to it?

377
00:19:14,205 --> 00:19:16,601
Peter, how are we going to get
past the guard?

378
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:19,850
Lois, I think I just got an idea.

379
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:23,771
You see that guy with the overcoat?

380
00:19:23,777 --> 00:19:26,513
He's tall enough for us to
sneakin behind him. Come on!

381
00:19:26,518 --> 00:19:30,280
So remember, sex is bad, immoral,
and wrong.

382
00:19:30,287 --> 00:19:33,563
And if you have sex,
you're automatically in Al Qaeda.

383
00:19:33,848 --> 00:19:36,370
Kids, do not listen to this man.

384
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:39,231
He is wrong, he is feeding you lies.

385
00:19:39,236 --> 00:19:43,510
Now, look, it's true. You shouldn't
have sex until you're ready.

386
00:19:43,518 --> 00:19:45,971
You should wait until you're in love.

387
00:19:46,197 --> 00:19:48,821
But I mean, hey, we're all human, huh?

388
00:19:48,908 --> 00:19:52,310
We have urges,
and they are perfectly natural.

389
00:19:52,348 --> 00:19:55,383
And if you do make the choice
to act on them,

390
00:19:55,388 --> 00:19:58,080
make sure you protect yourselves,

391
00:19:58,088 --> 00:19:59,612
use a condom.

392
00:20:00,855 --> 00:20:03,001
- I'm going to use condoms.
- Me, too!

393
00:20:03,018 --> 00:20:05,260
Maybe I'll use two condoms
at the same time.

394
00:20:05,266 --> 00:20:07,810
- Why would you do that?
- Oh, I mean, just one, just one.

395
00:20:07,818 --> 00:20:09,782
Doug, my mom's right.

396
00:20:09,787 --> 00:20:13,162
If we really care about each other,
it's okay to have sex.

397
00:20:13,176 --> 00:20:15,772
We'll be safe. We'll use a condom,

398
00:20:15,777 --> 00:20:17,393
and it'll be wonderful.

399
00:20:17,397 --> 00:20:19,722
Wow! Does this mean I'll see you naked?

400
00:20:19,725 --> 00:20:22,112
- Yeah.
- Oh, boy, I can't wait.

401
00:20:22,146 --> 00:20:25,902
- I'm sorry Doug dumped you, honey.
- It's all your fault!

402
00:20:27,556 --> 00:20:29,903
- I'm proud of you, sweetheart.
- Me, too, Lois.

403
00:20:29,906 --> 00:20:31,601
You stood up for what you believe in.

404
00:20:31,608 --> 00:20:33,970
I just wish I could have been there
to hear the speech you made.

405
00:20:33,978 --> 00:20:35,662
You think you could give me
a little taste?

406
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:39,353
<i>If you want to hear Lois' speech,
text-message FAMGUY1.</i>

407
