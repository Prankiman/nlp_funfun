00:00:36,073 --> 00:00:38,973
Oh, I love shopping
at Christmastime.

13
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:41,543
Ugh, mall food courts
are so depressing.

14
00:00:41,578 --> 00:00:43,678
You can always tell
which fathers are disappointed

15
00:00:43,714 --> 00:00:46,948
in their sons because they eat
lunch with their coats still on.

16
00:00:46,983 --> 00:00:48,450
How's that food,
dum-dum?

17
00:00:48,485 --> 00:00:49,951
Too bad eating
ain't math,

18
00:00:49,986 --> 00:00:51,820
'cause then I'd have something
to be proud of.

19
00:00:51,855 --> 00:00:53,488
I want to go
live with Mom.

20
00:00:53,523 --> 00:00:55,657
I know. So do I.

21
00:00:55,692 --> 00:00:58,059
Welcome to
Tommy Bahama.

22
00:00:58,128 --> 00:01:00,161
Yeah, you got anything
for a poor fat person

23
00:01:00,197 --> 00:01:02,030
who wants to look
like a rich fat person?

24
00:01:02,065 --> 00:01:03,231
Of course.

25
00:01:03,266 --> 00:01:05,166
Now, I'll mostly be
hitting on waitresses

26
00:01:05,202 --> 00:01:07,635
who are too young and thin
to ever be interested in me.

27
00:01:07,671 --> 00:01:10,038
Hitting on them in a
kindly, genial way?

28
00:01:10,073 --> 00:01:11,706
No, in a threatening,
creepy,

29
00:01:11,742 --> 00:01:13,641
I'm-joking-but-I'm-not-
really-joking way.

30
00:01:13,677 --> 00:01:15,276
Y-You have anything
for that?

31
00:01:15,312 --> 00:01:18,213
Sir, what you're describing is
precisely Mr. Bahama's vision.

Hey, sorry to bother you,
but would you like to work here?

34
00:01:25,622 --> 00:01:27,922
Me?
Yeah, you'd be perfect.

35
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:31,559
All right, now let me just take
off these security tags for you.

36
00:01:33,563 --> 00:01:35,663
It's a living.

00:01:40,437 --> 00:01:42,570
So random!

39
00:01:42,606 --> 00:01:45,106
That's a comment on us.

40
00:01:45,142 --> 00:01:47,275
Hey, check that out.

41
00:01:50,046 --> 00:01:52,781
Oh, wow. This is awesome!

42
00:01:52,816 --> 00:01:55,617
You know Jeff Garlin has
one of these in his house.

43
00:01:55,652 --> 00:01:58,286
Ah, I love this chair.

44
00:01:58,321 --> 00:02:01,322
Dog in a Jets jersey,
get in here!

45
00:02:01,358 --> 00:02:04,092
God, I have the best basement.

46
00:02:04,127 --> 00:02:07,262
Peter, this chair
costs $3,000.

47
00:02:07,297 --> 00:02:08,730
That's not so
much, Lois.

48
00:02:08,765 --> 00:02:11,800
It's only infinity times what
you bring home every week.

49
00:02:11,835 --> 00:02:12,835
Peter, look over there.

50
00:02:12,836 --> 00:02:16,237
Is that...
is that Jesus?

51
00:02:16,273 --> 00:02:18,106
Whoa, yeah, wow.

52
00:02:18,141 --> 00:02:19,908
It's been a while
since we've seen him.

53
00:02:19,943 --> 00:02:20,975
Hey, Jesus!

54
00:02:21,011 --> 00:02:22,143
Oh, hey, guys.

55
00:02:22,179 --> 00:02:24,412
Hey, buddy.
What are you doing in Quahog?

56
00:02:24,447 --> 00:02:26,014
Actually,
I never left.

57
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:27,916
Really?
Why didn't you call us?

58
00:02:27,951 --> 00:02:30,418
Well, I felt kind of bad
about how we left things.

59
00:02:30,453 --> 00:02:32,220
I wasn't sure you'd
want to hear from me.

60
00:02:32,255 --> 00:02:33,255
Oh, that's silly.

61
00:02:33,256 --> 00:02:35,390
We could never
stay mad at you.

62
00:02:35,425 --> 00:02:37,192
Yeah, I've never been one
to hold grudges.

63
00:02:37,227 --> 00:02:39,894
I even forgave the man
who murdered my son.

64
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,231
And although I will never
get over the pain

65
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:47,068
of what you did to my son,
I forgive you,

66
00:02:47,103 --> 00:02:51,239
because I believe you are sick
and in need of help.

67
00:02:51,274 --> 00:02:53,341
Mr. Griffin, this is
the Office of City Planning.

68
00:02:53,376 --> 00:02:55,877
You requested a variance to
build a hot tub off your garage.

69
00:02:55,912 --> 00:02:57,879
Oh, yeah.
Did I get it?

70
00:02:57,914 --> 00:02:59,047
No.

71
00:02:59,082 --> 00:03:00,181
I will kill your son!

72
00:03:00,217 --> 00:03:01,683
Your son is dead!

73
00:03:01,718 --> 00:03:03,952
I'm so glad there's
no hard feelings.

74
00:03:03,987 --> 00:03:05,486
Listen, Peter, we
should catch up.

75
00:03:05,522 --> 00:03:07,555
Why don't you come over to my
place for a beer or something?

76
00:03:07,591 --> 00:03:08,591
Aw, that sounds great!

77
00:03:08,592 --> 00:03:10,191
Hey, you want me
to pick anything up

78
00:03:10,227 --> 00:03:11,826
on the way over
or no, you're good?

79
00:03:11,862 --> 00:03:12,994
Oh, uh...

80
00:03:13,029 --> 00:03:15,230
I-I guess we could maybe
just order something.

81
00:03:15,265 --> 00:03:17,665
Yeah, I don't have any cash,
but we'll figure it out.

82
00:03:22,138 --> 00:03:24,639
Hey, Peter.
Come on in.

83
00:03:24,674 --> 00:03:26,908
<i>Mi casa es,</i> uh...

84
00:03:26,943 --> 00:03:28,409
I-I don't know Spanish.

85
00:03:28,445 --> 00:03:32,347
Huh, I think half the world
would be surprised to know that.

86
00:03:32,382 --> 00:03:34,082
Hey, nice place here.

87
00:03:34,117 --> 00:03:36,084
This is not too... too...

88
00:03:36,119 --> 00:03:38,686
it's not... it's not too...
not too good.

89
00:03:38,722 --> 00:03:40,655
Yeah, I know it's
nothing fancy,

90
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,358
but, you know, I'm not really
into material possessions.

91
00:03:43,393 --> 00:03:44,692
Geez, this place
is depressing.

92
00:03:44,728 --> 00:03:46,328
Hey, how come you aren't
with your family

93
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:47,562
during Christmas, anyway?

94
00:03:47,597 --> 00:03:50,064
I can't deal with my family
during the holidays.

95
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,833
And besides, my dad
always spends Christmas

96
00:03:51,868 --> 00:03:54,469
at his time-share in Coral
Gables with his girlfriend.

97
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:58,973
Great, here comes that couple
with the adult disabled kid.

98
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:00,608
Hey, can we join you?

99
00:04:00,644 --> 00:04:04,445
I-I'm Ken, this is Pam,
and this right here is Scott.

100
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:06,514
We really want to thank
you, God, for testing us.

101
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:08,016
It's been such
a blessing.

102
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:11,619
Can't wait to see what
that "bigger plan" is.

103
00:04:11,655 --> 00:04:12,887
Well, I can't
tell you that.

104
00:04:12,923 --> 00:04:14,022
But the good news is,

105
00:04:14,057 --> 00:04:16,591
this little guy's
gonna make it to 74.

106
00:04:16,626 --> 00:04:19,460
Oh, look, Jesus, you shouldn't
be alone during Christmas.

107
00:04:19,496 --> 00:04:20,795
And if I remember
correctly,

108
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,597
isn't your birthday
sometime soon, too?

109
00:04:22,632 --> 00:04:24,299
Ah, whatever,
I'm fine.

110
00:04:24,334 --> 00:04:26,501
I'll probably just reheat some
ramen and watch<i> Grey's Anatomy.</i>

111
00:04:26,536 --> 00:04:28,803
No way. I'm not gonna
let my pal Jesus

112
00:04:28,838 --> 00:04:29,998
spend his birthday like that.

113
00:04:30,006 --> 00:04:31,239
Hey, you know what?

114
00:04:31,274 --> 00:04:33,508
I am throwing you
the best birthday party ever.

115
00:04:33,543 --> 00:04:34,876
Are you sure
about that?

116
00:04:34,911 --> 00:04:36,577
Yeah, I'm great
at throwing parties.

117
00:04:36,613 --> 00:04:38,613
I was in charge
of planning Woodstock.

118
00:04:38,648 --> 00:04:40,281
All right, guys, here's
what I'm thinking--

119
00:04:40,317 --> 00:04:42,817
a whole festival
of muddy boobs.

120
00:04:42,852 --> 00:04:44,619
Well, don't you want
to have music?

121
00:04:44,654 --> 00:04:45,954
Oh, yeah.

122
00:04:45,989 --> 00:04:48,222
That's a good way to get
those muddy boobs moving.

123
00:04:52,462 --> 00:04:55,697
All right, you guys, Jesus's
birthday party is gonna be epic.

124
00:04:55,732 --> 00:04:57,332
Hey, since it's
also Christmas,

125
00:04:57,367 --> 00:04:59,200
maybe we could make it,
like, a Christmas theme.

126
00:04:59,235 --> 00:05:00,635
What about
Secret Santa?

127
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,836
That's always fun.

128
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:03,738
Okay, but five dollar limit.

129
00:05:03,773 --> 00:05:05,306
Why don't we
just say no gifts?

130
00:05:05,342 --> 00:05:07,822
Come on, guys, we don't have to
make such a big thing about it.

131
00:05:07,844 --> 00:05:09,777
It's not like I'm a woman
who's about to turn 30.

132
00:05:09,813 --> 00:05:12,046
You guys, I don't care
what we do for my birthday,

133
00:05:12,082 --> 00:05:13,681
as long as it lasts
the whole week

134
00:05:13,717 --> 00:05:16,384
and is very expensive and
inconvenient for all my friends.

135
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:18,119
Oh, and I'm gonna
dress like a slut

136
00:05:18,154 --> 00:05:19,754
and be rude to everyone
for no reason.

137
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:20,955
But, Maya...

138
00:05:20,991 --> 00:05:22,357
I don't care that
your dad's dying,

139
00:05:22,392 --> 00:05:24,792
we're all going to
Montreal for the week.

140
00:05:24,828 --> 00:05:25,828
Wait, wait, hold on.

141
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:27,261
If we're planning a party,

142
00:05:27,297 --> 00:05:29,130
we haven't even talked about
the most important thing.

143
00:05:29,165 --> 00:05:31,666
A hydration plan for
people who overheat?

144
00:05:31,701 --> 00:05:34,002
It could be as simple
as an ice bath.

145
00:05:34,037 --> 00:05:35,503
No, no, I'm talking
about women.

146
00:05:35,538 --> 00:05:37,705
Oh, yeah, we definitely need
some women there.

147
00:05:37,741 --> 00:05:39,221
Jesus, what kind
of girls do you like?

148
00:05:39,242 --> 00:05:40,441
Women?

149
00:05:40,477 --> 00:05:42,577
Uh, all types,
I guess.

150
00:05:42,612 --> 00:05:43,711
"All types"?

151
00:05:43,747 --> 00:05:45,046
Come on, Jesus.

152
00:05:45,081 --> 00:05:47,348
Even Martin Lawrence when he
used to dress up like Shenehneh?

153
00:05:47,384 --> 00:05:49,250
CLEVELAND:
(laughs) Shenehneh!

154
00:05:49,285 --> 00:05:50,551
No, you know
what I mean.

155
00:05:50,587 --> 00:05:52,653
Uh, like, uh,
hot ladies.

156
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:54,789
Horny ones who
sex on you.

157
00:05:54,824 --> 00:05:55,824
What?

158
00:05:55,825 --> 00:05:57,125
Yeah, you know.

159
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,061
They come back to your house
and sit on your... butt.

160
00:06:00,096 --> 00:06:01,362
Wait a minute.

161
00:06:01,398 --> 00:06:04,766
Jesus, have you ever
been with a woman?

162
00:06:04,801 --> 00:06:07,802
Are you...
are you a virgin?

163
00:06:07,837 --> 00:06:09,771
(sighs)
Yeah, I am.

164
00:06:09,806 --> 00:06:11,372
How the hell
does that happen?

165
00:06:11,408 --> 00:06:14,675
Well, in high school, my best
friend was this hot prostitute,

166
00:06:14,711 --> 00:06:16,744
and I just kind of got
into the friend zone.

167
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,546
She's all like,
"Oh, there's all these guys

168
00:06:18,581 --> 00:06:19,814
having sex with me for money."

169
00:06:19,849 --> 00:06:21,449
And I'm all like,
"Oh, you deserve better."

170
00:06:21,484 --> 00:06:22,484
And then I die.

171
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,951
Well, sex is
overrated.

172
00:06:23,987 --> 00:06:25,086
Stay out
of this, Joe.

173
00:06:25,121 --> 00:06:26,320
All right, look,
forget the party.

174
00:06:26,356 --> 00:06:28,056
We got a more
important mission now.

175
00:06:28,091 --> 00:06:32,026
Your 2,000-year-long cold streak
is about to come to an end.

176
00:06:32,062 --> 00:06:33,461
What do you mean?

177
00:06:33,496 --> 00:06:36,964
I'm saying, Jesus, we are gonna
help you lose your virginity.

178
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,399
(squeals)

179
00:06:38,435 --> 00:06:39,867
God, I love sex!

180
00:06:45,226 --> 00:06:46,826
All right, me and
the guys are off

181
00:06:46,861 --> 00:06:48,194
to help Jesus lose
his virginity.

182
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:50,663
Just put it in the oven
for half an hour at 350.

183
00:06:50,698 --> 00:06:51,698
What?
I don't know.

184
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:52,699
That's what you
always say

185
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,700
when you leave
the house.

186
00:06:53,735 --> 00:06:55,468
Oh, Peter,
just be careful.

187
00:06:55,503 --> 00:06:57,436
Losing your virginity
is a big deal.

188
00:06:57,472 --> 00:06:59,672
I'm sure Jesus doesn't want
some gross quickie.

189
00:06:59,707 --> 00:07:01,541
No, no, no, it's gonna
be nothing like that.

190
00:07:01,576 --> 00:07:03,676
Just some random slut
to maul in a bar

191
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:05,111
back where the
payphones used to be.

192
00:07:05,146 --> 00:07:07,013
Peter, that's
what I'm talking about.

193
00:07:07,048 --> 00:07:08,614
You're making
this whole thing crude.

194
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,283
It's his first time.

195
00:07:10,318 --> 00:07:11,651
You need to be
more sensitive.

196
00:07:11,686 --> 00:07:12,785
Don't worry, Lois.

197
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,620
I swear, I'll be
sensitive and gentle.

198
00:07:14,656 --> 00:07:17,423
Like the Tasmanian Devil
tucking in his kids.

199
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,459
(soothing Tasmanian Devil
gibbering)

200
00:07:29,037 --> 00:07:30,736
(gibbering)

201
00:07:39,614 --> 00:07:40,614
All right, Jesus,

202
00:07:40,648 --> 00:07:42,315
these speed date nights
are the best way

203
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,983
to meet a lot of chicks fast.

204
00:07:44,018 --> 00:07:45,051
Now go get 'em.

205
00:07:45,086 --> 00:07:46,452
So, where
do you live?

206
00:07:46,487 --> 00:07:48,120
Everywhere, all places.

207
00:07:48,156 --> 00:07:49,388
Hopefully, inside you.

208
00:07:49,424 --> 00:07:50,424
(buzzer sounds)

209
00:07:50,425 --> 00:07:51,924
This is kind of
embarrassing,

210
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,560
but are you okay
with someone who smokes?

211
00:07:53,561 --> 00:07:54,860
Oh, yeah.

212
00:07:54,896 --> 00:07:56,629
A-Are you okay with someone
who wanders the desert,

213
00:07:56,664 --> 00:07:57,730
lecturing people
on how to act?

214
00:07:57,765 --> 00:07:58,765
(buzzer sounds)

215
00:07:58,766 --> 00:08:00,199
So, are you having
a good Friday?

216
00:08:00,235 --> 00:08:01,567
Oh, is that supposed
to be funny?

217
00:08:01,603 --> 00:08:02,603
Shut your mouth, bitch.

218
00:08:02,604 --> 00:08:03,636
(buzzer sounds)

219
00:08:03,671 --> 00:08:05,338
How's the wine?
It's terrific.

220
00:08:05,373 --> 00:08:06,572
That's my blood,
you know.

221
00:08:06,608 --> 00:08:07,608
(buzzer sounds)

222
00:08:07,609 --> 00:08:09,375
Where are you from?
Israel.

223
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,410
(buzzer sounds)

224
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,779
All right, Jesus,

225
00:08:13,815 --> 00:08:15,748
nowadays, everything is done
on the Internet.

226
00:08:15,783 --> 00:08:17,817
All right? So, we got
to get you on Facebook.

227
00:08:17,852 --> 00:08:19,986
Uhp, let me just close
a couple of these windows.

228
00:08:20,021 --> 00:08:21,087
There we go.

229
00:08:21,122 --> 00:08:22,888
Sorry, I was up late last night.
(chuckles)

230
00:08:22,924 --> 00:08:24,290
Had the house to myself.

231
00:08:24,325 --> 00:08:25,725
Sorry. Sorry.

232
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,226
Lot of POV stuff.

233
00:08:27,262 --> 00:08:29,262
Yeah, I like to pretend
it's mine down there

234
00:08:29,297 --> 00:08:30,930
what's doing all the slapping.

235
00:08:30,965 --> 00:08:33,432
Peter, how old
is that girl?

236
00:08:33,468 --> 00:08:34,967
Excuse me, won't you?

237
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:09,702
Ar... lot of scumbags out today.

238
00:09:13,007 --> 00:09:15,541
Well, no luck getting
Jesus laid yet.

239
00:09:15,576 --> 00:09:16,676
I don't get it.

240
00:09:16,711 --> 00:09:18,477
Jewish guys are supposed
to be swimming in tail.

241
00:09:18,513 --> 00:09:21,947
Peter, Jesus is never gonna find
a woman going about it your way.

242
00:09:21,983 --> 00:09:24,216
I think it's time I had
a little talk with him

243
00:09:24,252 --> 00:09:26,185
so he knows what
a woman really wants.

244
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,720
All right,
knock yourself out.

245
00:09:27,755 --> 00:09:29,755
Don't look! Don't look!
Don't look!

246
00:09:34,362 --> 00:09:36,128
Jesus, I asked you
to lunch

247
00:09:36,164 --> 00:09:38,497
because I think you've
been getting bad advice

248
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:40,433
about finding
a special someone.

249
00:09:40,468 --> 00:09:42,001
Well, Peter's been
doing his best,

250
00:09:42,036 --> 00:09:44,303
but lately he seems more
focused on marketing

251
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:46,238
his erotic
Advent calendar.

252
00:09:46,274 --> 00:09:48,808
All right, kids, let's see
what's under Christmas...

253
00:09:48,843 --> 00:09:51,177
Ugh, another puckered anus.

254
00:09:51,212 --> 00:09:52,445
Look, Jesus,

255
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,914
just forget whatever
Peter's been telling you.

256
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:56,749
You just have
to be yourself

257
00:09:56,784 --> 00:09:59,285
and let a sweet girl
see that side of you.

258
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,620
Well, you're easy to talk to.

259
00:10:01,656 --> 00:10:03,889
I just get all tongue-tied
with other girls.

260
00:10:03,925 --> 00:10:06,359
Plus, being myself
isn't that impressive.

261
00:10:06,394 --> 00:10:07,626
What do you mean?

262
00:10:07,662 --> 00:10:08,961
You're sensitive,

263
00:10:08,996 --> 00:10:11,364
you died for our sins
and ascended into Heaven,

264
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,798
and you got nice skin.

265
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:15,234
Don't be afraid
to be honest with a girl

266
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:16,469
and show her who you are.

267
00:10:16,504 --> 00:10:18,270
Wow, thanks, Lois.

268
00:10:18,306 --> 00:10:20,973
That's the second best advice
anyone's ever given me.

269
00:10:21,008 --> 00:10:22,041
I don't know, man.

270
00:10:22,076 --> 00:10:24,243
Jesus Hitler Christ
sounds weird.

271
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:26,412
So just go with "H"?
Yeah.

272
00:10:30,251 --> 00:10:32,118
All right, guys,
let's not get discouraged, okay?

273
00:10:32,153 --> 00:10:34,887
We just got to be more creative
about getting Jesus laid.

274
00:10:34,922 --> 00:10:37,590
I just tell folks to go down
to the Happy Handy Smile Massage

275
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,091
and get it over with.

276
00:10:39,127 --> 00:10:40,393
I sometimes go down there,

277
00:10:40,428 --> 00:10:42,461
and when they tell me
I'm done, I leave.

278
00:10:42,497 --> 00:10:44,196
Hey, guys. Uh, Peter,

279
00:10:44,232 --> 00:10:45,965
can I talk to you for a sec?
Sure.

280
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,633
Peter, listen.

281
00:10:47,668 --> 00:10:50,403
I've found the woman who I'd
like to lose my virginity to.

282
00:10:50,438 --> 00:10:52,104
It's someone
who understands me

283
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,806
and someone I feel
very close to.

284
00:10:53,841 --> 00:10:55,341
Oh, wow.
Jesus, that's great!

285
00:10:55,376 --> 00:10:56,909
Hey, is it
Carrie Underwood?

286
00:10:56,944 --> 00:10:58,711
Somebody told me you
guys went out once.

287
00:10:58,746 --> 00:11:01,414
Yeah, we did.
But it was a disaster.

288
00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:02,782
Jesus, take the wheel.

289
00:11:02,817 --> 00:11:03,817
What?

290
00:11:03,851 --> 00:11:05,851
I want to kill
these (bleep) cops!

291
00:11:07,522 --> 00:11:10,890
Actually, Peter, I want
my first time to be with...

292
00:11:10,925 --> 00:11:11,957
Lois.

293
00:11:11,993 --> 00:11:14,093
Lois, my partner
at the law firm?

294
00:11:14,128 --> 00:11:15,661
No, Peter. It's your Lois.

295
00:11:15,696 --> 00:11:17,129
Lois Griffin.

296
00:11:17,165 --> 00:11:19,765
What?! I am outraged!

297
00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:21,167
But probably not as outraged

298
00:11:21,202 --> 00:11:23,569
as the ten million
Christians watching.

299
00:11:23,604 --> 00:11:25,671
Please write
to this address quickly.

300
00:11:25,706 --> 00:11:28,307
Maybe we can both stop
these Hollywood Jew writers

301
00:11:28,342 --> 00:11:30,943
from wrecking my marriage
and your religion.

302
00:11:35,882 --> 00:11:37,581
You want to lose your
virginity to Lois?!

303
00:11:37,617 --> 00:11:38,783
No way!

304
00:11:38,818 --> 00:11:40,584
Look, Peter, I know
it's a lot to ask.

305
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,753
But if it wasn't okay,
I wouldn't suggest it.

306
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:44,288
Well, you make
a good point.

307
00:11:44,324 --> 00:11:46,324
But this is my wife
you're talking about!

308
00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:47,525
Please, Peter?

309
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,560
I just know Lois would
make my first experience

310
00:11:49,595 --> 00:11:51,629
as special and memorable
as it should be.

311
00:11:51,664 --> 00:11:53,864
Plus, I can make it
worth your while.

312
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,633
After all, I'm Jesus.

313
00:11:55,668 --> 00:11:57,535
I could give you
anything you want.

314
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,803
Anything?

315
00:11:58,838 --> 00:12:00,972
Like... like anything
in the universe?

316
00:12:01,007 --> 00:12:02,073
Absolutely.

317
00:12:02,108 --> 00:12:03,140
Brookstone massage chair.

318
00:12:03,176 --> 00:12:04,176
Really?

319
00:12:04,177 --> 00:12:05,576
Are-are you sure?

320
00:12:05,611 --> 00:12:08,012
Yup. Never been more sure
of anything in my life.

321
00:12:08,047 --> 00:12:09,613
Well, except one thing.

322
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:10,681
Good evening, sir.

323
00:12:10,717 --> 00:12:12,350
Would you like to
hear our specials?

324
00:12:12,385 --> 00:12:14,285
No! Pizza!

325
00:12:17,924 --> 00:12:19,357
Let me get
this straight.

326
00:12:19,392 --> 00:12:22,159
You want me to have
sex with another man?

327
00:12:22,195 --> 00:12:23,694
Oh, not just any man, Lois.

328
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,196
This is Jesus
we're talking about.

329
00:12:25,231 --> 00:12:26,430
He's a savior.

330
00:12:26,466 --> 00:12:28,032
He could even save
our marriage.

331
00:12:28,067 --> 00:12:30,267
Why? What's wrong
with our marriage?

332
00:12:30,303 --> 00:12:31,869
"What's wrong
with our marriage?"

333
00:12:31,904 --> 00:12:34,138
You're sitting around, talking
about sleeping with other guys!

334
00:12:34,173 --> 00:12:35,873
Peter, this was
your idea!

335
00:12:35,908 --> 00:12:37,775
Lois, let's not play
the blame game.

336
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,844
Clearly, there's been a lot
of cheating on both sides,

337
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:42,146
but the point is
where do we go from here?

338
00:12:42,181 --> 00:12:43,481
Huh, I don't know.

339
00:12:43,516 --> 00:12:45,816
Sleeping with Jesus
just feels wrong.

340
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:48,486
Doesn't the Bible say not to
covet thy neighbor's wife?

341
00:12:48,521 --> 00:12:49,720
Oh, come on, Lois,
the Bible's

342
00:12:49,756 --> 00:12:50,988
just a bunch
of general guidelines.

343
00:12:51,024 --> 00:12:52,923
None of the commandments
are written in stone.

344
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,291
You're really
okay with this?

345
00:12:54,327 --> 00:12:55,327
Of course.

346
00:12:55,361 --> 00:12:57,395
Look, there really is
no downside to this.

347
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,631
It's one of those things that
seems bad, but really is good.

348
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:03,300
Like that fracking company
we let drill in the backyard.

349
00:13:04,704 --> 00:13:06,971
Well, I guess
it is kind of an honor

350
00:13:07,006 --> 00:13:08,973
that out of all the people
in the world,

351
00:13:09,008 --> 00:13:10,541
Jesus chose me.

352
00:13:10,576 --> 00:13:12,376
I mean, he could've had anyone.

353
00:13:12,412 --> 00:13:16,147
Elizabeth Perkins, Patricia
Richardson, Katey Sagal...

354
00:13:16,182 --> 00:13:18,616
Yeah! I-I mean, maybe not them,
but somebody else.

355
00:13:18,651 --> 00:13:21,552
And-and the Son of God's
first time should be special.

356
00:13:21,587 --> 00:13:23,788
Even divine.

357
00:13:23,823 --> 00:13:26,023
Maybe I'd actually be
doing a good thing.

358
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:28,025
You sure about
this, Peter?

359
00:13:28,061 --> 00:13:29,061
You bet.

360
00:13:29,095 --> 00:13:32,129
As sure as I was
when I created Lady Gaga.

361
00:13:32,165 --> 00:13:34,031
All right, listen, fella,
your game is confusion.

362
00:13:34,067 --> 00:13:35,132
Zip! Zam! Zoop!

363
00:13:35,168 --> 00:13:37,234
Nobody gets a straight
look at nothing!

364
00:13:42,141 --> 00:13:43,841
Boy, this must be
killing you.

365
00:13:43,876 --> 00:13:44,876
You're an atheist,

366
00:13:44,877 --> 00:13:46,477
and the one guy
you don't believe in

367
00:13:46,512 --> 00:13:48,345
is getting to bang
the woman of your dreams.

368
00:13:48,381 --> 00:13:50,981
You know what? I don't have
to sit here and take this.

369
00:13:51,017 --> 00:13:52,750
I'm out of here.

370
00:13:53,886 --> 00:13:56,454
Can-can you let me outside?

371
00:13:56,489 --> 00:13:58,456
(doorbell rings)

372
00:13:58,491 --> 00:13:59,924
Hi, Peter.

373
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:01,625
Well, hello, young man.

374
00:14:01,661 --> 00:14:03,160
Don't you look nice?

375
00:14:03,196 --> 00:14:04,662
She's almost ready.

376
00:14:06,566 --> 00:14:10,134
♪ There she goes ♪

377
00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:14,338
♪ There she goes again ♪

378
00:14:14,373 --> 00:14:18,175
♪ Pulsing through my veins ♪

379
00:14:18,211 --> 00:14:21,245
♪ And I just can't contain... ♪

380
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,314
I'm sorry, I was just
coming down the stairs

381
00:14:23,349 --> 00:14:25,149
at the same time.

382
00:14:28,821 --> 00:14:31,622
Wow, Mom.
You look beautiful.

383
00:14:31,657 --> 00:14:33,224
Well, we know he's circumcised,

384
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:35,126
so she won't have to deal
with that nonsense.

385
00:14:35,161 --> 00:14:37,061
Oh, and don't worry
about not hittinbottom.

386
00:14:37,096 --> 00:14:40,164
I've only grazed it once and
that was with a running start.

387
00:14:43,736 --> 00:14:45,769
Hey, Jerome, give me
another Pawtucket Pat.

388
00:14:45,805 --> 00:14:48,973
I'll take it over here
on my Brookstone massage chair.

389
00:14:49,008 --> 00:14:50,641
That's a nice
chair, Peter.

390
00:14:50,676 --> 00:14:52,910
Hey, do you think if I let
Jesus sleep with Bonnie,

391
00:14:52,945 --> 00:14:54,812
he'd give me back
the use of my legs?

392
00:14:54,847 --> 00:14:57,214
Joe, I don't speak for Jesus.
I just get him trim.

393
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,518
Now to take this thing
out for a spin.

394
00:15:00,553 --> 00:15:02,153
(chair vibrating)

395
00:15:02,188 --> 00:15:04,188
(sighs)

396
00:15:09,395 --> 00:15:11,395
(birds squawking)

397
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:17,601
Ah, time for a relaxing,
sponsored daydream.

398
00:15:23,576 --> 00:15:25,476
Oh, Jesus!

399
00:15:25,511 --> 00:15:28,412
Jesus! Jesus!

400
00:15:28,447 --> 00:15:29,914
(screams)

401
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:31,749
God, I love
massage chairs.

402
00:15:31,784 --> 00:15:33,083
Are you in one, too?

403
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,585
Yes, but it's horrible!

404
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,588
It was bought for me by Jesus,
but now he's doing my wife!

405
00:15:37,623 --> 00:15:40,357
Oh. I'm just trying
mine out in the store.

406
00:15:41,827 --> 00:15:44,128
Guys! I think I might've
made a terrible mistake

407
00:15:44,163 --> 00:15:45,963
with this whole
Lois and Jesus thing!

408
00:15:45,998 --> 00:15:47,364
I don't blame you, Peter.

409
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,733
I always thought it was
sort of a strange choice

410
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:52,636
to let Jesus have
relations with your wife.

411
00:15:52,672 --> 00:15:55,739
I'm sorry, did you say Jesus
is sleeping with your wife?

412
00:15:55,775 --> 00:15:57,007
Great, now everybody knows

413
00:15:57,043 --> 00:15:59,210
my wife is taking
Jesus's virginity.

414
00:15:59,245 --> 00:16:01,512
Listen, pal,
Jesus ain't no virgin.

415
00:16:01,547 --> 00:16:03,781
He did the same thing
to me last Christmas.

416
00:16:03,816 --> 00:16:04,982
He what?!

417
00:16:05,017 --> 00:16:06,417
Yeah, Jesus did
the same thing

418
00:16:06,452 --> 00:16:08,185
to my wife
Christmas before last

419
00:16:08,221 --> 00:16:10,354
and my buddy's wife
the year before that.

420
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:11,389
What the hell?

421
00:16:11,424 --> 00:16:12,756
But he's so lonely.

422
00:16:12,792 --> 00:16:15,326
Nah, he just acts lonely
and lies about being a virgin

423
00:16:15,361 --> 00:16:17,294
so he can get with guys' wives.

424
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,096
Did he show you
that sad little apartment?

425
00:16:19,131 --> 00:16:20,431
He doesn't really live there.

426
00:16:20,466 --> 00:16:23,367
He just uses it to store art
he bought on cruises.

427
00:16:23,402 --> 00:16:25,536
Oh, my God, what have I done?!

428
00:16:25,571 --> 00:16:27,371
Peter, maybe there's still time!
Maybe you can stop them!

429
00:16:27,406 --> 00:16:28,672
Where are they?

430
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,808
They're at the Barrington Hotel!
Let's go, guys!

431
00:16:30,843 --> 00:16:33,510
I just ordered nachos,
but good luck, Peter.

432
00:16:33,546 --> 00:16:37,481
Now for a slippy, no-boots run
through the snow to my car.

433
00:16:37,516 --> 00:16:39,516
(gasping)

434
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,630
(screams) Aw, crap!

435
00:16:52,665 --> 00:16:54,531
I just pulled
a thousand muscles!

436
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:56,567
(grunting)

437
00:17:03,576 --> 00:17:04,975
(screams)

438
00:17:05,011 --> 00:17:07,011
(grunting)

439
00:17:09,148 --> 00:17:10,714
Ow! That was a loud crack!

440
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,249
Ah, yeah, that was all bone!

441
00:17:12,285 --> 00:17:14,351
Oh! Aw! Son of a whore!

442
00:17:14,387 --> 00:17:16,453
Oh, this is bad.
This is real bad.

443
00:17:16,489 --> 00:17:18,322
I'm not gonna go
to the doctor though.

444
00:17:19,892 --> 00:17:21,091
(ignition sputters)

445
00:17:21,127 --> 00:17:22,259
Damn it!

446
00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:25,362
(tires screech)

447
00:17:25,398 --> 00:17:26,964
Get out!
I need this car!

448
00:17:26,999 --> 00:17:28,198
What are you, a cop?

449
00:17:28,234 --> 00:17:31,035
No! Jesus is about to
have sex with my wife!

450
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,037
Oh, then here! Take it!

451
00:17:33,072 --> 00:17:34,605
Get out!
I need this car!

452
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,873
So do I!

453
00:17:35,908 --> 00:17:37,975
Jesus Christ is about
to have sex with my wife!

454
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,477
Lenny Kravitz is about
to have sex with my daughter!

455
00:17:40,513 --> 00:17:41,979
Oh! Oh, my God!

456
00:17:42,014 --> 00:17:45,082
Here, take the car!
Take the car!

457
00:17:45,117 --> 00:17:46,317
Get out of here!
What are you doing?!

458
00:17:46,352 --> 00:17:48,185
Go, go, go!

459
00:17:49,221 --> 00:17:50,854
Hey, kid, I need
that toboggan!

460
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,257
Jesus Christ is gonna
have sex with my wife!

461
00:17:53,292 --> 00:17:55,025
Um, okay.

462
00:17:55,061 --> 00:17:56,794
And I need
your little hat.

463
00:17:56,829 --> 00:17:59,063
And those Spider-Man mittens--
I'll need those, too.

464
00:17:59,098 --> 00:18:01,065
And what's in
your pockets?

465
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,767
A rabbit's foot, a penknife,
a bottle cap, a compass...

466
00:18:03,803 --> 00:18:05,803
All of it, all of it.

467
00:18:12,378 --> 00:18:14,378
(tires screeching)

468
00:18:17,216 --> 00:18:19,350
Aw, crap. I'm out of hill.

469
00:18:21,921 --> 00:18:23,454
You there! Boy!

470
00:18:23,489 --> 00:18:24,955
What does that sign say?

471
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,890
I ain't much
for book reading, sir.

472
00:18:26,926 --> 00:18:29,526
But I seen our Lord and Savior
bring a lady in there

473
00:18:29,562 --> 00:18:31,495
for a Christmas rodgering,
I did.

474
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,563
You're a good boy.

475
00:18:32,598 --> 00:18:33,997
Here's a goose.

476
00:18:34,033 --> 00:18:35,599
(goose honks)

477
00:18:36,969 --> 00:18:38,535
What room is Jesus in?

478
00:18:38,571 --> 00:18:39,970
What room is
Lenny Kravitz in?

479
00:18:40,005 --> 00:18:42,439
Aw, you were coming here, too?
We could've carpooled.

480
00:18:42,475 --> 00:18:44,074
(elevator bell dings)

481
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,210
Lois! Lois!

482
00:18:46,245 --> 00:18:47,945
You son of a bitch!

483
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,013
What have you done
to my marriage?!

484
00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:51,181
Peter?

485
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:52,316
Lois, don't do this!

486
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:55,085
I think I had, like,
a Christmas miracle.

487
00:18:55,121 --> 00:18:57,254
I realized I don't
want other people

488
00:18:57,289 --> 00:18:59,223
humping my wife
for a chair.

489
00:18:59,258 --> 00:19:00,424
It's okay, Peter.

490
00:19:00,459 --> 00:19:01,525
Nothing happened.

491
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,560
It didn't?

492
00:19:02,561 --> 00:19:04,528
No, I couldn't
sleep with him.

493
00:19:04,563 --> 00:19:06,330
Not that I wasn't tempted.

494
00:19:06,365 --> 00:19:09,266
He put actual strawberries
in a glass of champagne,

495
00:19:09,301 --> 00:19:12,369
which was about the classiest,
sexiest thing I'd ever seen.

496
00:19:12,405 --> 00:19:13,405
But...

497
00:19:13,439 --> 00:19:15,839
I couldn't go through with it.

498
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,375
Our marriage is
too important to me.

499
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,413
I love you, Lois.

500
00:19:22,448 --> 00:19:25,582
I don't know what
I was thinking.

501
00:19:25,618 --> 00:19:29,453
But you!
You're a liar, Jesus!

502
00:19:29,488 --> 00:19:31,555
Bravo, Peter, Lois.

503
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,958
Seems like you folks learned
the lesson I intended.

504
00:19:34,994 --> 00:19:36,093
What lesson?

505
00:19:36,128 --> 00:19:38,128
Oh, you know, uh...

506
00:19:38,164 --> 00:19:41,064
that, uh, this holiest
of days is about,

507
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,667
uh, appreciating...

508
00:19:43,702 --> 00:19:48,672
our loved ones and, uh,
resisting... temptation.

509
00:19:48,707 --> 00:19:50,874
Oh, so it was a test.

510
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:53,777
Like when your father told
Abraham to sacrifice Isaac?

511
00:19:53,813 --> 00:19:54,945
Yes! That!

512
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,847
That's exactly right!

513
00:19:56,882 --> 00:19:59,149
Uh, well, I can see
my work here is done.

514
00:19:59,185 --> 00:20:01,819
Well taught, Jesus.
Well taught.

515
00:20:01,854 --> 00:20:03,220
Yeah, I guess.
Who cares?

516
00:20:03,255 --> 00:20:06,190
I'm not even real.
Merry Christmas.

517
00:20:11,697 --> 00:20:13,297
Well, Lois, I'm sure glad

518
00:20:13,332 --> 00:20:14,998
you didn't have sex
with the Messiah.

519
00:20:15,034 --> 00:20:16,333
Me, too, Peter.

520
00:20:16,368 --> 00:20:18,602
Now let's open
your presents, kids.

521
00:20:18,637 --> 00:20:20,971
Oh, Rupert, you're
such a sneak.

522
00:20:21,006 --> 00:20:22,706
I wonder what it is.

523
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:27,611
Oh. A Joni Mitchell CD.

524
00:20:27,646 --> 00:20:30,714
"To continue your
emotional education."

525
00:20:30,749 --> 00:20:31,982
That's great.
(chuckles)

526
00:20:32,017 --> 00:20:33,650
That's really great.

527
00:20:33,686 --> 00:20:36,920
Could you excuse me
for just one moment?

528
00:20:36,956 --> 00:20:39,623
♪ I've looked at clouds
from both sides now... ♪

529
00:20:39,658 --> 00:20:42,593
Who did he buy
the necklace for?

530
00:20:43,828 --> 00:20:47,301
I'm gonna let that teddy bear
go all the way.

531
