00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,600
"It seems today that all you see

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,000
"Is violence in movies and sex on TV

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,600
"But where are those
good old-fashioned values

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,720
"On which we used to rely?

00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,520
"Lucky there's a family guy

"Lucky there's a man who positively
can do all the things that make us

00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,920
"Laugh and cry

"He's a family guy

00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,600
Oh, my, this place is enormous.

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,600
They got these plastic disc guns.
I haven't seen one since Cleveland's wedding.

12
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,520
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,320
to celebrate the joining
of these two people...

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,520
...in the bonds of holy matrimony,

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
consecrated before God Almighty.

16
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,920
Hey, Stratego. I used to love this game.

17
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,120
Oh, my God. Abe Vigoda?

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,520
Go bother Steve Guttenberg.
He's behind the Chinese chequers.

19
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,920
Abe, shut up!

20
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,800
Look at me, Chris. I'm Yanni sans the attitude.

21
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,800
My God, that's amazing.

22
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,320
- You are so talented.
- Huh?

23
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,400
Wait a second. Something's not right here.

24
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,600
You were just making it look like
you were playing. You're a phony!

25
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,520
- Hey! This guy's a great big phony!
- Come on, Chris.

26
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,720
- Agh!
- There you are.

27
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,520
Hey, you're a great big phony,
you know that?

28
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,800
Your mom and I have something for you.

29
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,600
Let me guess. Another
colourful box with a crank

30
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,200
that I'm expected to turn until -
big shock - a jack pops out.

31
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,520
And you laugh and the kids laugh and
the dog laughs and I die a little inside.

32
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,320
Surprise, honey.

33
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,400
A trikey!

34
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,920
I think he likes it.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,520
When I stick this army guy with the sharp
bayonet up my nose, it tickles my brain.

36
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,000
Ow! Oh. Now I don't know math.

37
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,120
- Give it to me now, dammit!
- Not now, Stewie. When we get home.

38
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,520
That's right. You're a big fat phony!

39
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,000
What I'm about to show you is a fight scene
from Star Trek, season one, episode 18.

40
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm going to identify when it's Shatner and
when it's his stunt double, Fred Lubbins.

41
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,120
Let's watch.

42
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,920
That's Shatner. That's Lubbins.
That's Shatner. That's Lubbins.

43
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,800
That's Shatner. That's Lubbins.

44
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,720
That's Shatner, but when I freeze-frame,
you can clearly see Lubbins' coffee cup.

45
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,720
- He is the biggest dork on the planet.
- Totally.

46
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,920
And so, because of his
rough-and-tumble style of command,

47
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,120
Captain Kirk is clearly superior
to Jean-Luc Picard.

48
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,520
- Any questions? Meg?
- No. Leave me alone.

49
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,400
Thank you, Neil,
for that irrelevant presentation.

50
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,400
We all know Captain Picard
is the superior officer.

51
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,320
- Ugh!
- Mr Lassenbee's getting arrested.

52
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,720
What in God's name...? Mr Lassenbee,
what the hell's going on here?

53
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,920
There's a law against teaching
the evolutionary theory

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,200
that Gil Gerard used a time machine
and ejaculated into the primordial ooze.

55
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,400
This stupid country.

56
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,720
Tom Tucker, live at James Woods High
School with this sensational breaking story.

57
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,520
A teacher caught molesting children...
with crackpot theories. Full story at 11.

58
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,520
And out.

59
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,520
Oh, my God!
That's Tom Tucker from the news.

60
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:48,600
Hey, kids. Remember, Mr T says
"I pity the fool who does drugs. "

61
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,000
- Better hurry up, Mr Tucker.
- I'm coming.

62
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,600
Reports indicate she has consumed
a record amount of seamen.

63
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,800
Sounds like one powerful hurricane.

64
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,120
In other news, school board elections
took place last evening.

65
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,320
Fred Johnson leads candidate Betsy LaFoe
by a substantial...

66
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,520
Hi, Meg. You know how cute I think you are.

67
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,120
...turmoil when President Bush
stuck his finger in a socket.

68
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,320
Whoa!

69
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,800
Yikes. Awkward.

70
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,920
...that's where leprechauns
hide their gold. More at 11.

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,320
Hey, you know who lives in this house?
A great big phony! That's right.

72
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,200
A phony lives here. A big fat phony!

73
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,320
I say, look at me.
I feel like a regular grease monkey.

74
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,200
- Remember that time I had that Mustang?
- Oh, yeah, you took her for a spin that time.

75
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,520
That was awesome.

76
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,520
Those chowderheads on the corner
busted your stones.

77
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,120
Hey, your sister say anything about me?

78
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,920
- Oh, my God. I'm missing the news!
- We all miss The News, Meg.

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,400
But Huey Lewis needs time to create.
We have to be patient.

80
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,320
And in entertainment,
Mary Tyler Moore is 64 years old today.

81
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,800
- Really? 64?
- Yes.

82
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,000
- I thought she was dead.
- She's alive.

83
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,000
Fantastic. And now this.

84
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,320
Are you a student interested in
the glamorous world of unpaid internships?

85
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,120
If so, you can try out for
Channel Five's young anchor programme.

86
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,600
Oh, wow!

87
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,120
You'll gain valuable experience,
work closely with Tom and me,

88
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,400
and produce your own on-air report.

89
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,520
So call us now.

90
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,600
Yeah!

91
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,320
Question number one:
Would you consider growing a moustache?

92
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,720
I guess so.

93
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,920
Question two: Look at my moustache.

94
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,600
Do you think it tickles women
when I kiss them?

95
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,720
I don't know.

96
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,520
Wrong. The answer is: Only slightly,
only slightly. Next.

97
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,120
Oh, God, I can't hire any of these girls.

98
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,320
They're all too pretty.
Their breasts are too perky.

99
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,320
Perfect.

100
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,400
Congratulations. You got the job.

101
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,320
Oh, my God! Oh, thank you, thank you!
This is beyond anything I've ever dreamed of!

102
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,200
You and your partner
will start tomorrow after school.

103
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,320
- Great! Who's my partner?
- Hey, there, hot stuff!

104
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,200
Well, well. It appears the Fates
have conspired in our favour. Eh, Meg?

105
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,520
Stay away from me, Neil.
Just because we're working together

106
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,720
does not mean I like you. Give it to me!

107
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,720
- What's that?
- Give it to me, Neil.

108
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,120
- Give it to me! Give it to me, Neil.
- Yeah. That'll work just fine.

109
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,920
Ugh!

110
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,120
Look who's here.
It's our bright-eyed young interns.

111
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,720
- Did you two wear your eager caps?
- I sure did, Mr Tucker.

112
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,520
Great. Cos you two
are gonna have so much fun!

113
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,600
Don't act any cheerier.
You'll give us all diabetes.

114
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,400
- Bite me, Tom.
- Come on, kids.

115
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,520
Here's where we produce
our celebrity interviews.

116
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,200
I did one with Dustin Hoffman.
He's almost impossible to book.

117
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,320
Dustin, it's been a while.
I gotta say, you look great.

118
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,120
Are you trying to seduce me?

119
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,400
I am not trying to seduce you,
Dustin Hoffman. You really look great.

120
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,200
- Uh-oh. Twelve minutes to Wapner.
- I understand your hectic schedule.

121
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,720
We appreciate you taking the time
to be with us here in the studio.

122
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,400
- If there's anything I can ever do for you...
- Bring me Peter Pan!

123
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,320
I'll keep my eye out for him.
Thanks, Dustin.

124
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,120
He's this tall.

125
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,120
Can you believe it? Our little Stewie
learning to ride his first tricycle.

126
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,120
This'll be more exciting than when Brian
taught me about Columbus.

127
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,120
- Where are we going?
- We're going to visit the year 1492.

128
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,520
That's when Columbus set sail
for the New World.

129
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,800
- We're on a ship.
- This is the Santa Maria.

130
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,120
Columbus took it to find a route to India.

131
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,600
- Any sign of India yet?
- Nothing yet.

132
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,600
Columbus was going to America.

133
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,320
Columbus discovered America
entirely by mistake.

134
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,400
Wow!

135
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,400
- What are you doing? Back off, fat man.
- Hang on, Stewie.

136
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,600
What the...? Hey, hey, let go.
Get your filthy paws off.

137
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,800
Let go. Let go, I say. Let go. Don't let go!

138
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,400
Oh, this is exhilarating.

139
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,920
- Go, Stewie!
- Yay, Stewie!

140
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,920
I gotta go check on dinner. You keep
taping Stewie. Don't miss a moment.

141
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,000
I got it.

142
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,720
Look, it's dancing with me.

143
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,320
It's this incredibly benevolent force
that wants me to know

144
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,720
there's no reason to be afraid.

145
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,320
Sometimes there's so much beauty
in the world, it makes my heart burst.

146
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,720
It's just some trash blowing in the wind!

147
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,520
Do you have any idea how complicated
your circulatory system is?

148
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,800
Hi, Mr Tucker. I brought you Rice Crispy
Treats. I remember you said you liked them.

149
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,320
Look. This one is in the shape of a heart.

150
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,320
I'm sorry, but there's a handsome man
in my spoon. Come back later.

151
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,920
Oh, my God.
Meg's in love with Tom Tucker!

152
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,320
Try to move in on my woman,
will you, Tom Tucker?

153
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,920
No one crosses Neil Goldman
and gets away with it.

154
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,520
I added something to your coffee
I don't think you're gonna like.

155
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,520
- Here's your coffee, Mr Tucker.
- What the hell is in this?

156
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,400
Sweet'N Low.
That's for trying to steal my woman!

157
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,520
- Bring it to me with urine in it like I asked.
- Yes, sir.

158
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,720
- Nice bike.
- That's the understatement of the century.

159
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,400
- It's cool. Too cool for you.
- No, no. I think it's right where I'm at.

160
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,600
Out of my way!

161
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,520
Oh, I see. Oh, yes, I suppose you do have
to ride it to truly appreciate its virtues.

162
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,000
Well, then, I'll just wait
right here till you get back.

163
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,800
- Where the devil is he?
- You've obviously never met a bully.

164
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,200
What do you mean?

165
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,520
He wasn't taking it for a test ride,
he was just taking it.

166
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,800
- You... you mean...?
- Mm-hm.

167
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,600
He... stole... my trikey?

168
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,320
Mr Tucker, has anyone
ever told you your eyes are...

169
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,720
Hang on, sweetie. I've gotta call Peter
Jennings and reschedule our golf game.

170
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,520
This is Peter. You know what to do.

171
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:09,200
Mr Tucker, Miss Simmons, there's a nut on
top of Town Hall with a high-powered rifle.

172
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,400
The gunman's been identified as the
Mass Media Murderer who targets the press.

173
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,200
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Mass Media Murderer?

174
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,920
I think this would be a fine opportunity
to give our interns real-world experience.

175
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,800
That means you'll get to ride
in the news chopper. I'm so jealous.

176
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,000
Better put in for some new interns.
Good luck!

177
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,800
I've got Hugh Downs up here.

178
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,520
I'm gonna splatter his distinguished career
all over the pavement.

179
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,400
- Hey, why me? Why the media?
- I've got my reasons.

180
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,600
Dan Rather thinks he can condense
a whole day's events into a half-hour.

181
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,400
Don't get me started on that arrogant jerk.

182
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,800
- Really? You know him?
- I'm Hugh Downs. I know everybody.

183
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,400
- In fact, he's down there.
- Where?

184
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,120
Ha-ha! See ya later, sucker! And by the way,
Rather is an OK guy in small doses.

185
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,120
Look how close we're getting, Meg.

186
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,400
Hey! That was my lucky assassin hat!

187
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,800
Mayday! Mayday! I'm going down!

188
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,720
Oh, my God, we're gonna die! There's
so much of life I haven't experienced!

189
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,400
I never got the chance to be some
drunk college guy's last resort!

190
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,720
My years of expensive orthodontic work
will be a total waste!

191
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,400
- I never even had my first kiss!
- It's not too late, Meg.

192
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,200
I'm here for you.

193
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,320
Time to sign off.

194
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,600
Remember me, dirt bag?

195
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,520
Wow! You saved
those kids' lives, Mr Downs.

196
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,800
All in a day's work. If you ever need me,

197
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,000
just blow this whistle,
or call John Stossel's cellphone.

198
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,720
Hugh Downs away!

199
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,200
Honey, thank God you're safe.
We were so worried.

200
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,400
We now go to junior anchor Neil Goldman

201
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,600
with exclusive footage
from today's exciting scene.

202
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,520
Thank you, Diane. There may have been
some commotion on the rooftop,

203
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,520
but the real story was inside the mouths
of Meg Griffin and Neil Goldman,

204
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,920
where a meeting of the tongues,
a summit of saliva,

205
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,600
established a new world order of love.

206
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,600
Agh!

207
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,000
Let's watch it one more time
in super slow-mo.

208
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,120
This is where we cease to be Meg and Neil

209
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,320
and begin life anew as Meil.

210
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,520
Oh, my God. He put it on TV?

211
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,720
Isn't that cute, Peter?
Our daughter's first love.

212
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:03,400
I just want to kill myself! I'm going upstairs
right now and eat a whole bowl of peanuts.

213
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,400
I'm allergic to peanuts!

214
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,920
You don't know anything about me!

215
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,120
Who was that guy?

216
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,720
Constable, I'd like to report
the theft of my tricycle.

217
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,920
Oh, look at the little baby.
Aren't you cute! Where's your mommy?

218
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
How dare you condescend to me?
I demand justice!

219
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,720
I'm here to turn myself in. I have
a dismembered hooker bleeding in my trunk.

220
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,800
Oh, look at the little baby.
Aren't you cute! Where's your mommy?

221
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,000
- Where did you get that shirt?
- From Neil.

222
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,400
Hello, lover.

223
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,400
Neil, what are you doing?
I'm not your lover. I don't even like you.

224
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,520
Meg, I strongly suggest you hold
my hand, lest you look like a slut.

225
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,120
Tell these people that there's
nothing going on between us.

226
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,120
Oh, don't be afraid of the fire, Meg.
I won't let you burn.

227
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,520
Al, why haven't I leaped?

228
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,400
Ziggy says you can't leap
until she loves you back.

229
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,800
Don't worry, I'll get her.

230
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,200
What do you want to work on?
Cardio? Upper body?

231
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,520
Upper body. I need to get buff,
so I can get my tricycle back.

232
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,200
Luckily, we're running a special
for the next 17 minutes.

233
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,520
OK. That's a little unusual but... OK, tell me.

234
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,200
The normal plan is 78 months
at 40 a month and 200 down. Watch this.

235
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,800
- Forget the down.
- Yeah.

236
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,720
Goodbye 40 a month, let's do 35.

237
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,920
- 35. That's the cheapest?
- Yeah, hang on, hang on.

238
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,320
Trace, can you bring me
some free gym bags?

239
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,920
I could probably just do
some push-ups at home.

240
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,320
Let's start you off with a body-fat test,
maybe a heart rate.

241
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,920
You're not hearing me. I don't think
this is for me. Thanks, anyway.

242
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And for the future,
you came on a little strong.

243
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,520
- What's going on here?
- We invited Neil's family over for dinner.

244
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,720
- Hi.
- Hello.

245
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,000
- You what?!
- To get to know 'em better.

246
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,320
Seeing as you two
will one day bless our home

247
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,400
with the pitter-patter
of grandchildren as ugly as sin.

248
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,600
Meg, you never told me your mother
was such a stone-cold fox.

249
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,320
- Now I see where you get it.
- Meg, he's so charming.

250
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,200
My name is Chris.

251
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,920
I'm supposed to be on my best behaviour
tonight and not mention poo.

252
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,400
Oh, God, what have I done?!

253
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,600
Well, let's eat.

254
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,720
I think it's very, very nice that our children
had this wonderful kiss.

255
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,000
I remember when Muriel and I had
our first kiss, and it was just awful.

256
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,720
Oh, just awful. We were both very sick.
Weren't we, dear?

257
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,720
Ugh, we were terribly sick.

258
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,400
We were both 14 and it was winter
and we had terrible head colds.

259
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:52,720
Mine especially was very bad. I had terrible
mucus coming out from inside my nose.

260
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,720
And the other children,
they were very nasty to me.

261
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,920
They said bad, hurtful things to me.

262
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,600
They called me Tasty Cakes,

263
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,320
and they would beat me
and stick pine cones in my ass.

264
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,320
- Those were very bad times.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

265
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,120
Thank you very much.

266
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,400
Excuse me. I'm gonna go throw up.

267
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,000
Please flush the toilet twice.

268
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,520
Once for the bulk, and again for the
remainder. Thank you. Oh, she's a dear.

269
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,920
You're blocking my light, you stupid baby!

270
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,800
My hooligan friend,
I've been racking my brain

271
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,920
in a fruitless attempt
to resolve our unpleasantness.

272
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,920
But then it dawned on me. Your cruelty
merely stems from a deep-seated inner pain.

273
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
The obvious remedy
is a healthy dose of outer pain!

274
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,120
Children washing cars to raise money
for charity. Is anything more arousing?

275
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:51,920
We go to Meg Griffin for a special Channel
Five junior anchor segment on the moon.

276
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,920
The moon. There's a reason
no one goes there. It's cold, and it's ugly.

277
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,120
Its surface is plagued
with craters and jagged peaks.

278
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,000
Oh, wait! That's not the moon.
It's Neil Goldman's face.

279
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,520
Recently, many of you saw me
kissing this freak of nature.

280
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,720
If I wasn't seconds away from death,
I wouldn't have done it.

281
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,000
I mean, who in their right mind would?
I went to the streets to find out.

282
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,600
Would you kiss this guy?

283
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,520
- Ugh! No!
- No way!

284
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,520
- No!
- No!

285
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,400
Oh, God, no!
What's the matter with you? Oh!

286
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,120
It's official. Neil Goldman isn't kissable.

287
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,720
Hear that, Neil? I don't like you.
I never will! Back to you, Tom.

288
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,400
Thank you, Meg. I guess beggars
can be choosers. And now this.

289
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,120
- Well, well. Isn't this a darling picture!
- Let me go, man!

290
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,400
- How old are you, Charlie?
- Seven.

291
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,800
Seven? Well, my, my.
You're practically a lady.

292
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,720
Ironic that your fate
is in the hands of an infant.

293
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,720
- Now tell me where my tricycle is!
- I don't know. I lost it.

294
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,320
- Agh!
- I have other ways of obtaining the truth.

295
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,800
No! Don't!

296
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,320
- Stewie? Look what I found.
- My trikey!

297
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,400
- What's going on down here?
- We're playing house.

298
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,520
That boy is all tied up.

299
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,400
Roman Polanski's house.

300
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,120
Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker.
Our top story: The president has been shot.

301
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,520
Tragedy strikes the nation.
The president has been shot.

302
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,800
Why's the president in this casket?
We'll tell you.

303
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,320
- Nice job on that report last night.
- Wow! Thanks, Mr Tucker.

304
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,320
That means so much coming
from someone so handsome.

305
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,600
- How'd you like to pick up my dry-cleaning?
- Sure. But isn't that Neil's job?

306
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,520
- Little jerk hasn't been in all day.
- He hasn't?

307
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,200
A breaking story! A geek is on top of
Town Hall! He's about to jump!

308
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,400
- Oh, my God! Neil!
- Is it Neil?

309
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,720
I've been calling him Ned all week.

310
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,920
Oh, my God! Neil, please don't jump.

311
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,120
I was just a piece of eye candy
that she turned into an all-day sucker.

312
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,320
Mr Tucker! Thank God you're here!
Someone's got to do something! He'll fall!

313
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,720
I'm on it. Have that cartoon sound-effect
guy cue up the...

314
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,800
Top it off with a...

315
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,800
And if there's time, be ready with a...
"Wah, wah, wah, wah.

316
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,400
You don't care about him at all, do you?

317
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,320
All you care about are your stupid ratings!
You're a horrible man!

318
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,920
- Neil, I'm sorry!
- Meg?

319
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,720
- There he goes!
- Good stuff, good stuff, good stuff!

320
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,320
Neil!

321
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,520
- Meg! You do care!
- Don't read too much into this, Neil.

322
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,120
It's hard not to when I'm lying
right on top of you.

323
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,600
Just because you're repulsive and
the most annoying person on the planet,

324
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,800
and I'm not the only one who thinks so,
doesn't mean I want you to kill yourself.

325
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,400
Thanks, Meg. But I was never
really planning to jump.

326
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,120
Wasn't gonna jump? You're a phony!

327
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,720
Hey, everybody!
This guy's a great big phony!

328
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,800
