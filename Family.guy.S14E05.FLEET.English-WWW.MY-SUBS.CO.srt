00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:36,877
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Hey, guys, do you like beer,</i>

13
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:38,579
<i>but can't</i>
<i>get drunk from beer?</i>

14
00:00:38,613 --> 00:00:40,748
<i>Then try new Vodka Beer.</i>

15
00:00:40,782 --> 00:00:42,016
<i>The can says "beer,"</i>

16
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,386
<i>but inside is 12 ounces</i>
<i>of carbonated vodka.</i>

17
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,322
<i>And the best part is,</i>
<i>your wife will never know.</i>

18
00:00:48,356 --> 00:00:49,990
Honey, I'm so proud of you,

19
00:00:50,025 --> 00:00:51,859
cutting down to one
beer a night.

20
00:00:51,893 --> 00:00:54,061
(slurring):
Take off your underwear.

21
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:57,565
She don't know.

22
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,899
I got the mail.

23
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:01,101
Hey, does an octopus
live here?

24
00:01:01,136 --> 00:01:02,636
Peter, that says
"occupant."

25
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:03,838
Oh, that's too bad.

26
00:01:03,872 --> 00:01:05,172
That would've
been awesome.

27
00:01:05,207 --> 00:01:06,674
Oh look, Peter.

28
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:08,409
Here's something from
your mother's estate.

29
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,778
Oh, looks like they finally
sold her house.

30
00:01:10,812 --> 00:01:13,714
And the last white domino
in that neighborhood falls.

31
00:01:13,748 --> 00:01:14,882
Wow, they sold it?

32
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:16,183
So that means the house

33
00:01:16,218 --> 00:01:17,885
and everything inside
of it is gone?

34
00:01:17,919 --> 00:01:19,220
Oh, sweetheart.

35
00:01:19,254 --> 00:01:21,555
You thinking about all the good
times you had there?

36
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,791
No, I'm thinking about
my teenage porn stash.

37
00:01:23,825 --> 00:01:25,392
It's still hidden
in the house.

38
00:01:25,427 --> 00:01:28,696
Oh, okay, but I know this
is really about the memories.

39
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,198
Lactating sluts
on box springs.

40
00:01:31,233 --> 00:01:33,467
The-The-The special times
growing up...

41
00:01:33,502 --> 00:01:35,436
Bikini black chicks
sneezing.

42
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,738
Lois, stop making him
reminisce about stuff.

43
00:01:37,772 --> 00:01:38,939
You don't understand, Lois.

44
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,441
A boy's first collection
of nudie books

45
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,409
and girlie movies
is a sacred thing.

46
00:01:42,444 --> 00:01:44,111
It can't fall into
a stranger's hands.

47
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,546
This is very serious.

48
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,314
I'm taking us to DEFCON 4.

49
00:01:47,349 --> 00:01:48,516
(sign buzzes)

50
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,651
What happens when
it hits DEFCON 1?

51
00:01:50,685 --> 00:01:52,887
We see a dog wearing a wig.

52
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:54,889
Aw, heck, let's see that anyway.

53
00:01:54,923 --> 00:01:56,056
(Peter chuckles)

54
00:01:56,091 --> 00:01:59,159
<i>That's not even a lady dog.</i>

55
00:02:02,864 --> 00:02:05,065
Hey, Peter, what's wrong?
You've been real quiet.

56
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,233
I don't know,
Quagmire.

57
00:02:06,268 --> 00:02:07,568
I keep thinking
of my old pornos.

58
00:02:07,602 --> 00:02:09,870
It's like I'm reminded
of them everywhere I look.

59
00:02:09,905 --> 00:02:12,006
You've been looking
at Cleveland a lot.

60
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,341
Plus, you know, when
people find that box,

61
00:02:14,376 --> 00:02:16,443
they won't know that, like,
for some of them magazines,

62
00:02:16,478 --> 00:02:18,379
I just had them as,
like, a joke.

63
00:02:18,413 --> 00:02:20,180
You know, not 'cause, like,
I was really into it.

64
00:02:20,215 --> 00:02:21,315
Just the opposite.

65
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,650
For some of them
magazines.

66
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:23,851
Okay.

67
00:02:23,885 --> 00:02:25,553
I'm going to be
arrested for sure.

68
00:02:25,587 --> 00:02:27,354
Peter, I know exactly
where you're coming from.

69
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:28,522
You, Quagmire?

70
00:02:28,557 --> 00:02:30,224
You enjoy
pornography, too?

71
00:02:30,258 --> 00:02:32,359
Yup, and I know that
a man's porn collection

72
00:02:32,394 --> 00:02:34,795
must be secured and
protected at all costs,

73
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:36,230
until he gets
ashamed of it

74
00:02:36,264 --> 00:02:37,932
and ditches it in an alley
behind a Kroger's.

75
00:02:37,966 --> 00:02:39,166
Hey, I know!

76
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,901
What if we break into
my old house

77
00:02:40,936 --> 00:02:42,970
and steal back
my big box of pornos?

78
00:02:43,004 --> 00:02:44,605
What do you say?
You guys with me?

79
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:45,873
You bet.
Sure thing, Peter.

80
00:02:45,907 --> 00:02:47,241
I mean, come on,
we're a team.

81
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:49,443
Like fish and chips
and fat guys.

82
00:02:49,477 --> 00:02:51,412
I want the double cheeseburger,

83
00:02:51,446 --> 00:02:54,081
but I'm gonna go healthy
and get the fish and chips.

84
00:02:54,115 --> 00:02:55,482
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Fish and chips!</i>

85
00:02:55,517 --> 00:02:58,953
(singing jauntily):

86
00:03:01,823 --> 00:03:03,424
Okay, you all
remember the plan--

87
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,693
we walk up wearing
our Bill Cosby masks...

88
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,895
Peter, that's
President Obama.

89
00:03:07,929 --> 00:03:10,497
Aw, did I just
do a racism?

90
00:03:10,532 --> 00:03:11,632
(knocking on window)

91
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,667
Hello? Can I help
you gentlemen?

92
00:03:13,702 --> 00:03:14,969
Hi.

93
00:03:15,003 --> 00:03:16,737
You guys have been sitting
in front of my house

94
00:03:16,771 --> 00:03:19,173
for the last five hours
trying on Obama masks.

95
00:03:19,207 --> 00:03:20,841
Is there something
I can do for you?

96
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,977
We, uh... we-we were
just getting ready

97
00:03:23,011 --> 00:03:24,445
to break into your house.

98
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,446
Excuse me?

99
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,547
Oh, hey, cool shirt.

100
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,349
What?
Oh, thank you.

101
00:03:28,383 --> 00:03:29,817
Look, what's this all about?

102
00:03:29,851 --> 00:03:31,385
This guy used to live
in your house

103
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,220
and a box of his old porn
is still hidden in there.

104
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,755
We were gonna break in
and take it.

105
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:36,323
And I was gonna stay
with the rental van

106
00:03:36,358 --> 00:03:39,026
because it's my name
what's on the contract.

107
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,328
Oh. Well, you could've just
knocked on the door and asked.

108
00:03:41,363 --> 00:03:43,030
I don't want that stuff,
I've got kids.

109
00:03:43,064 --> 00:03:44,131
Get it out of there!

110
00:03:44,165 --> 00:03:45,699
Really? Awesome!

111
00:03:45,734 --> 00:03:48,702
Oh, well that was easier
than a game of Pai Gow poker.

112
00:03:48,737 --> 00:03:50,204
Pai gow.
You lose again!

113
00:03:50,238 --> 00:03:51,639
That was awesome!

114
00:03:51,673 --> 00:03:53,507
I can't believe these tables
are always empty.

115
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,342
You play again?
Nope, out of money.

116
00:03:55,377 --> 00:03:56,610
I'm just gonna wait
for my drink.

117
00:03:56,645 --> 00:03:58,345
Who had the full glass
of Goldschlager?

118
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,913
Ah. Sorry, can't tip.

119
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,282
I'm gonna take this
up to my room.

120
00:04:03,985 --> 00:04:06,120
Oh, I'm on the wrong floor.

121
00:04:06,154 --> 00:04:08,422
(vacuum whirring)

122
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:11,191
Almost time for lunch.

123
00:04:11,226 --> 00:04:12,626
Ah...

124
00:04:12,661 --> 00:04:13,627
How was everything?

125
00:04:13,662 --> 00:04:14,728
Delicious.

126
00:04:14,763 --> 00:04:16,130
The prime rib
was mostly fat.

127
00:04:16,164 --> 00:04:17,798
Should I charge it
to your room?

128
00:04:17,832 --> 00:04:18,966
No, I had to check out,

129
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,701
even though my
flight's not until midnight.

130
00:04:20,735 --> 00:04:24,705
Now, how does one with no money
get to the airport?

131
00:04:24,739 --> 00:04:27,975
(horn honking)

132
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:35,149
(honking)

133
00:04:35,183 --> 00:04:37,851
Hey, buddy, you're
blocking the outlet.

134
00:04:37,886 --> 00:04:40,054
Oh, sorry.
There was no chairs.

135
00:04:44,693 --> 00:04:46,293
Hi, Peter.
How was Vegas?

136
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,662
Oh, it's the best.

137
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,600
Sweet.

138
00:04:53,635 --> 00:04:56,403
Now, which movie
should I start with?

139
00:04:56,438 --> 00:04:58,605
<i>"Back-Door Sluts 4."</i>

140
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,407
Eh, I haven't
seen the first three,

141
00:05:00,442 --> 00:05:01,909
I wouldn't know what's going on.

142
00:05:01,943 --> 00:05:03,911
Here we go.

143
00:05:05,213 --> 00:05:08,749
I want to watch
all of these movies, nonstop.

144
00:05:10,552 --> 00:05:12,920
I don't want to watch
any more of these movies, ever.

145
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:16,490
Hey, Brian, you want to go for
a ride to behind the Kroger's?

146
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,791
What?

147
00:05:17,826 --> 00:05:19,760
That's weird. What's that?

148
00:05:26,401 --> 00:05:28,569
Hello, Future Peter.
Hi.

149
00:05:28,603 --> 00:05:30,971
By the time you watch this,
you'll be grown-up,

150
00:05:31,005 --> 00:05:32,706
so I'm sure you're allowed
to eat ice cream

151
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:35,576
and pizza for every meal.
You know it.

152
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,511
Also, I bet you're
a big important doctor

153
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:40,681
like that Doogie Howser kid
who's getting so much ass.

154
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:41,849
Well, I was partly right.

155
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:42,916
I just hope to God

156
00:05:42,951 --> 00:05:44,651
you're not stuck
in some loser job,

157
00:05:44,686 --> 00:05:46,420
like in a brewery,

Are you crazy?
Look at him.

229

rough around the edges, but--

232
00:08:42,947 --> 00:08:45,415
Oh, boy, a little
got in my mouth there.

00:08:48,052 --> 00:08:49,552

important success.

236
00:08:49,587 --> 00:08:52,989
The same way Mumford turned
his son into a success.

237
00:08:53,024 --> 00:08:54,958
Okay, Dad, heading out
to the concert.

238
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,559
Now, hold on a minute, son.

239
00:08:56,594 --> 00:08:57,961
Where are your arm garters?

240
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,763
Your string tie?
Your woolen vest?

241
00:08:59,797 --> 00:09:01,865
You look nothing like
a dry goods clerk

242
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:03,433
from the Garfield
administration.

243
00:09:03,467 --> 00:09:04,501
But, Dad...

244
00:09:04,535 --> 00:09:06,036
No buts! You're a Mumford.

245
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,170
Now get upstairs,

246
00:09:07,204 --> 00:09:08,638
put on a jaunty
travelling hat,

247
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,608
and write the same song
25 times.

248
00:09:15,046 --> 00:09:16,746
Okay, now, Chris, if you
want to be a success,

249
00:09:16,781 --> 00:09:18,782
you gotta look worldly
and sophisticated.

250
00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:21,084
And to do that, you got
to dress like Lenny Kravitz,

251
00:09:21,118 --> 00:09:24,120
with little something from every
part of he world pinned on you.

252
00:09:24,155 --> 00:09:26,623
Leather bracelets!
Nipple ring!

253
00:09:26,657 --> 00:09:28,425
Zippers where zippers
shouldn't be!

254
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:30,260
Wilma Flintstone
pearl necklaces!

255
00:09:30,294 --> 00:09:32,362
A fur shrug
with crocheted sleeves!

256
00:09:32,396 --> 00:09:33,530

257
00:09:33,564 --> 00:09:35,031
A watch on your pinky toe!

258
00:09:35,066 --> 00:09:37,267
And nothing says,
"Look at me, I've been places"

259
00:09:37,301 --> 00:09:40,537
like two lit road flares
hanging from your sunglasses.

260
00:09:40,571 --> 00:09:42,439
Hey, you look like
you've been places.

261
00:09:42,473 --> 00:09:43,440
Stop looking at me!

262
00:09:43,474 --> 00:09:46,476
I do not want
this attention!

263
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,411
Come on, Chris,
let's get out of here.

264
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:03,426
Uh, what are you doing?

265
00:10:03,461 --> 00:10:04,794
Well, I been trying
to make Chris

266
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:06,896
less of a fat dummy,
and nothing seems to be working,

267
00:10:06,931 --> 00:10:09,365
so now we're high-stepping
around in giant hats.

268
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,767
Tip of the giant hat, sir.

269
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:12,368
And to you, sir!

270
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,504
Yes, sir, smart day
to you, sir.

271
00:10:14,538 --> 00:10:15,805
And I thank you, sir.

272
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,873
(yelps)

273
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,541
(cries)

274
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,544
I scraped my knee bad!

275
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,313
Get up, Chris, you're
embarrassing yourself.

276
00:10:23,347 --> 00:10:24,814
You look stupid and fat.

277
00:10:24,849 --> 00:10:26,015
Peter, I have to ask--

278
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,550
are you pushing
Chris so hard

279
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,119
because it's what's
best for him?

280
00:10:29,153 --> 00:10:31,287
Or are you trying to make up
or your own disappointment

281
00:10:31,322 --> 00:10:32,756
about how your life
turned out?

282
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,591
Brian, these are the biggest
hats I could find,

283
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,826
so if your point is that there's
even larger ones available,

284
00:10:36,861 --> 00:10:38,695
I would greet that
with skepticism.

285
00:10:38,729 --> 00:10:40,363
No, no, no, my point is
that you need to let Chris

286
00:10:40,397 --> 00:10:41,898
find his own path.

287
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:42,899
(gasps)

288
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,267
Oh, my God,
you're right, Brian.

289
00:10:44,301 --> 00:10:47,070
He needs to be pointed
to a very specific path.

290
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,605
And then forced to go down it.

291
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:50,840
No, no, that's-that's the
opposite of what I just said.

292
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,509
Chris, your best
chance for success

293
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,911
is to be cultured and
worldly, like our dog.

294
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,379
So starting right now,

295
00:10:56,413 --> 00:10:58,882
you gotta follow Brian around
and do everything he does.

296
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,183
What?!
Come on, Brian.

297
00:11:00,217 --> 00:11:02,152
You gotta show Chris how
to turn out better than me.

298
00:11:02,186 --> 00:11:03,453
I mean, you went to Brown,

299
00:11:03,487 --> 00:11:04,988
you're a published author,

300
00:11:05,022 --> 00:11:07,257
you can hear it first when
Joe falls out of the tub.

301
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,958
That's starting
to happen more often.

302
00:11:08,993 --> 00:11:10,393
But I guess you're right.

303
00:11:10,427 --> 00:11:11,995
Maybe I am the guy
to make a diamond

304
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:13,363
out of this lump of coal.

305
00:11:13,397 --> 00:11:14,898
But only if
it's what Chris wants.

306
00:11:14,932 --> 00:11:15,999
I don't care.

307
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:17,133
All right, I'll do it.

308
00:11:17,168 --> 00:11:18,434
Just follow
my lead, Chris.

309
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,303
'Cause I think you
could be something great.

310
00:11:20,337 --> 00:11:21,771
Who knows?
Maybe you'll even become

311
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,206
one of those mission
control leaders

312
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,875
who gets all thoughtful
while everybody's celebrating.

313
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:30,013
Apollo 13, this is Mission
Control, do you copy?

314
00:11:30,047 --> 00:11:34,217
Apollo 13, this is
mission control, do you copy?

315
00:11:34,251 --> 00:11:36,886
Do you copy, Apollo 13?

316
00:11:36,921 --> 00:11:38,321
(static hissing)

317
00:11:38,355 --> 00:11:40,690
Mission Control,
this is Apollo 13.

318
00:11:40,724 --> 00:11:43,593
We're all okay.
Good to be home.

319
00:11:43,627 --> 00:11:45,495
(cheering)

320
00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:47,030
(sighs)

321
00:11:50,134 --> 00:11:51,467
Sir, you did it!

322
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,403
Sir, is everything okay?

323
00:11:53,437 --> 00:11:56,239
Eh, I bought a Nook e-reader
a couple of years ago

324
00:11:56,273 --> 00:11:58,908
and I'm still pissed about it.

Chew that way.

331
00:13:06,176 --> 00:13:08,478
Eh, dinner's no fun
without Chris here.

332
00:13:08,512 --> 00:13:10,580
There's nobody here for me
to wing my biscuit at.

333
00:13:10,614 --> 00:13:13,917
Well, Peter, he's been spending
an awful lot of time with Bri--

334
00:13:13,951 --> 00:13:16,252
Eh, it's not
the same.

335
00:13:16,287 --> 00:13:19,355
Anyway, he and Brian have been
spending a lot of time together.

336
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,357
Really? You're going
to let that slide?

337
00:13:21,392 --> 00:13:23,059
Guy throws
a biscuit at you?

338
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,260
Good evening, all.

339
00:13:24,295 --> 00:13:25,995
Apologies for being so tardy.

340
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,330
Aw, Chris,
you're not tardy.

341
00:13:27,364 --> 00:13:28,865
We tested you twice.

342
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:31,868
There you guys are.
We were wondering about you.

343
00:13:31,902 --> 00:13:33,736
Brian and I have been
having a blast.

344
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,338
First we went
to a symphony.

345
00:13:35,372 --> 00:13:37,106
Then we saw a small
independent play

346
00:13:37,141 --> 00:13:38,908
with real smoking in it.

347
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,810
And then we hit
the Quahog Book Festival

348
00:13:40,844 --> 00:13:42,078
and went to a Q and A

349
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,480
to ask questions that
weren't really questions.

350
00:13:44,515 --> 00:13:47,517
Wow, look at my sophisticated
young man.

351
00:13:47,551 --> 00:13:50,086
You're certainly taking
to Brian's example.

352
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,955
If anything,
he's teaching me.

353
00:13:51,989 --> 00:13:53,923
I mean, not really,
but you-you know.

354
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,391
Aw, see, I knew Brian

355
00:13:55,426 --> 00:13:57,226
could put Chris on
the path to success.

356
00:13:57,261 --> 00:13:58,628
Hey, Chris,
let's celebrate.

357
00:13:58,662 --> 00:14:00,430
There's a new baby
panda at the zoo.

358
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,765
How about you and me
go chuck tater tots at it?

359
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,766
Chuck them at Lois.

360
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,901
She'll just sit there
and take it.

361
00:14:04,935 --> 00:14:05,969
(chuckling):
Oh, Dad.

362
00:14:06,003 --> 00:14:07,870
That would've been fine
for the old me,

363
00:14:07,905 --> 00:14:09,939
but Brian and I
have to be going.

364
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,575
Oh. Okay.

365
00:14:12,609 --> 00:14:14,043
Yeah, we're off to see
an old movie

366
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:16,612
on temporary screen
in a muddy, freezing park.

367
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,081
That sounds awful.

368
00:14:18,115 --> 00:14:19,349
(chuckling):
It is awful.

369
00:14:19,383 --> 00:14:21,617
But at least parking
will be impossible.

370
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,987
Bye!

371
00:14:24,021 --> 00:14:28,891
Geez, I... feel like
I just... lost my son.

372
00:14:28,926 --> 00:14:30,960
Aw, I got a skin tag in my crack

373
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,996
and it stings
when I don't wipe right.

374
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,664
This has been
a bad dinner.

375
00:14:40,805 --> 00:14:42,038
There you two are.

376
00:14:42,072 --> 00:14:43,206
Sit down and join us.

377
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,374
I can't stay, Mom.

378
00:14:44,408 --> 00:14:45,408
Brian's showing me

379
00:14:45,443 --> 00:14:46,976
all of his favorite
stuff to do.

380
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,645
Getting spooked when
the furnace goes on?

381
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,880
We're participating
in an autism walk.

382
00:14:50,915 --> 00:14:52,649
Looks like you're
doing it right now.

383
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,117
And we may be gone a while,

384
00:14:54,151 --> 00:14:55,919
'cause after that we're going
down to the Civic Center.

385
00:14:55,953 --> 00:14:58,755
Michael Ian Black is cocking
his eyebrows for four hours.

386
00:14:58,789 --> 00:15:02,058
Ha! He says the things
we don't care to say.

387
00:15:02,092 --> 00:15:03,493
Bye!

388
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,630
Man, I'm sick of how much time
Chris is spending with Brian.

389
00:15:07,665 --> 00:15:09,065
Probably smooching
pickles,

390
00:15:09,099 --> 00:15:10,667
'cause they're a couple
of pickle smoochers.

391
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,268
It's like he ain't
even my son no more,

392
00:15:12,303 --> 00:15:14,103
doing all that
fancy-pants stuff.

393
00:15:14,138 --> 00:15:15,872
Oh, Peter,
I know you miss him,

394
00:15:15,906 --> 00:15:17,674
but this is what
you wanted, isn't it?

395
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,243
Well, yeah, but I didn't
realize bettering himself

396
00:15:20,277 --> 00:15:22,078
meant blowing off
his old man.

397
00:15:22,112 --> 00:15:23,713
You know what?
The hell with this.

398
00:15:23,747 --> 00:15:26,049
I want my son back.
Peter, relax.

399
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,951
Chris is just going
through a phase.

400
00:15:27,985 --> 00:15:29,586
He'll grow out of it.

401
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,356
Just like you grew out of your
"Walk Like An Egyptian" phase.

402
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,725
Paul was a good man.

403
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,627
A good friend.

404
00:15:37,661 --> 00:15:42,932
I'll... I'll always remember
how supportive he was when...

405
00:15:42,967 --> 00:15:44,934
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

406
00:15:44,969 --> 00:15:46,669
I can't-I can't-
I can't do this.

407
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,646
Check it out, Lois--
when Chris notices

408
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,615
that "World's Greatest
Son" mug I made,

409
00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:01,251
he'll be back on board with
his old man in no time.

410
00:16:01,285 --> 00:16:03,052
Hey, Chris,
what's on the mug?

411
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,421
"World's Greatest Sun."

412
00:16:05,456 --> 00:16:07,724
This world only has one sun.

413
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,727
What kind of idiot
made this mug?

414
00:16:13,197 --> 00:16:16,165
♪ When everything's
made to be broken ♪

415

419

I'm very easily
influenced by music.

420
00:16:35,486 --> 00:16:38,021
All right, Chris, now I know
you're all sophisticated now,

421
00:16:38,055 --> 00:16:40,957
but no man can resist
the siren call

422
00:16:40,991 --> 00:16:43,760
of mentally impaired
supermodel Kate Upton.

423
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,295
Mm, sorry, Dad.

424
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:47,764
I'm more of a Catherine
Keener man now.

425
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,365
But, Chris, you got
to take advantage.

426
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,000
The clock's ticking
on Kate Upton.

427
00:16:51,035 --> 00:16:52,402
She's almost at the end
of her window.

428
00:16:52,436 --> 00:16:53,503
(timer dings)

429
00:16:53,537 --> 00:16:55,038
Yup, we missed it.

430
00:16:55,072 --> 00:16:56,606
Come on, get out of here.

431
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,075
(grunting)

432
00:17:04,582 --> 00:17:06,382
Sorry, Lois, I need the TV.

433
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:07,951
I gotta win my son back.

434
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,485
What are you
talking about, Peter?

435
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,787
Well, you know how
Brian's got Chris

436
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,956
watching all them fancy
foreign films now?

437
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,657
Well, I figure I can
lure Chris in

438
00:17:14,692 --> 00:17:17,393
with this French movie--
<i>Le Rocqué Trois.</i>

439
00:17:17,428 --> 00:17:21,764
(accordion plays <i>Rocky</i> theme
with French lilt)

440
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:23,399
ADRIENNE (French accent):
<i>Rocqué!</i>

441

<i>J'pité Le fool.</i>

444
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,907
ROCKY:
<i>Oh, Clubbert Lange!</i>

445
00:17:30,941 --> 00:17:32,609
Peter, this
is pointless.

446
00:17:32,643 --> 00:17:34,677
You wanted Chris
to be a better person

447
00:17:34,712 --> 00:17:35,945
with a bright future,

448
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,982
and thanks to Brian,
that's what he has now.

449
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,517
Yeah, but, I don't even
recognize Chris these days.

450
00:17:41,552 --> 00:17:43,519
And I never get
to spend time with him.

451
00:17:43,554 --> 00:17:45,822
It's like Chris
ain't my friend no more.

452
00:17:53,097 --> 00:17:55,365
Thanks for coming to the book
club meeting, everyone.

453
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:57,934
Well, I gotta say,
I loved this week's book--

454
00:17:57,968 --> 00:18:00,036
Annie Proulx's
<i>The Shipping News.</i>

455
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,638
Yes, yes! Yes.

456
00:18:01,672 --> 00:18:03,873
Very <i>Portnoy's Complaint.</i>

457
00:18:03,907 --> 00:18:06,809
Uh, I don't... What, uh,
what do you mean by that?

458
00:18:06,844 --> 00:18:08,945
Oh, you know, just
with... the-the port,

459
00:18:08,979 --> 00:18:10,613
and the shipping.

460
00:18:10,648 --> 00:18:12,749
And of course,
in <i>Portnoy's Complaint</i>

461
00:18:12,783 --> 00:18:14,917
you've got the guy who's
living near the water...

462
00:18:14,952 --> 00:18:16,853
That doesn't sound right.

463
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,622
...and he hated the noise
from the local port,

464
00:18:19,657 --> 00:18:21,324
so he filed one of
the very first

465
00:18:21,358 --> 00:18:24,193
port noise complaints
in maritime law.

466
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,962
And for those of us who
read the complaints,

467
00:18:25,996 --> 00:18:28,097
trust me, they were
very warranted.

468
00:18:28,132 --> 00:18:30,166
Brian, could I talk
to you over here?

469
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,968
Oh, let's dog-ear this
for a sec.

470
00:18:32,002 --> 00:18:33,269
(chuckles)

471
00:18:33,303 --> 00:18:35,538
This one gets it.

472
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,607
Brian, what the hell
are you talking about?

473
00:18:37,641 --> 00:18:39,575
You clearly haven't read
either of those books.

474
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:42,078
Whoa, Chris, now you're starting
to sound like Mark Twain,

475
00:18:42,112 --> 00:18:44,080
whose real name
was Samuel Clemens.

476
00:18:44,114 --> 00:18:45,848
Oh, that is so your go-to!

477
00:18:45,883 --> 00:18:47,517
I can't believe you.

478
00:18:47,551 --> 00:18:50,219
I thought you were this
worldly, sophisticated guy,

479
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:53,322
but you're just a fraud--
like Moses.

480
00:18:53,357 --> 00:18:55,358
And the Lord's Eleventh
Commandment--

481
00:18:55,392 --> 00:18:58,327
"Moses gets to be
first in line at the buffet."

482
00:18:58,362 --> 00:19:00,296
What?!
Oh, seriously?

483
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,131
I know, you guys,
it's so lame,

484
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,067
but that's what it says.

485
00:19:14,912 --> 00:19:16,279
Why are you doing that?

486
00:19:16,313 --> 00:19:18,614
Why are you hucking
tater tots at a baby panda?

487
00:19:18,649 --> 00:19:20,349
'Cause I'm oddly
attracted to him

488
00:19:20,384 --> 00:19:21,517
and it frightens me.

489
00:19:21,552 --> 00:19:23,619
See, this is why
you're so great, Dad.

490
00:19:23,654 --> 00:19:25,888
You don't pretend
to be someone you're not.

491
00:19:25,923 --> 00:19:29,325
You do what you want, and you
don't care what anyone thinks.

492
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:31,194
Well, I-I care what you think.

493
00:19:31,228 --> 00:19:34,831
Look, Chris, you're my kid,
and I want what's best for you,

494
00:19:34,865 --> 00:19:37,100
but I guess
I just don't want you

495
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,102
to become too good
for your old man.

496
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,236
Don't worry, Dad.

497
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,738
I could never be
too good for you

498
00:19:41,772 --> 00:19:43,139
because you're the best.

499
00:19:43,173 --> 00:19:45,775
And I want to be just like you
when I grow up.

500
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:49,178
Really?
Aw, thanks, Chris.

501
00:19:49,213 --> 00:19:50,446
Tater tot?

502
00:19:53,283 --> 00:19:54,851
It's fun, right?
Yeah!

503
00:19:54,885 --> 00:19:57,386
And the mama panda doesn't
do anything about it,

504
00:19:57,421 --> 00:20:00,356
because she was blinded to make
her more submissive.

505
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,557
Ha-ha! You're right.

506
00:20:01,592 --> 00:20:03,459
You know, Chris,
all this started

507
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:06,129
'cause I was feeling bad
about being a failure.

508
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,364
But you know what?
I got you for a son.

509
00:20:08,398 --> 00:20:11,134
So maybe I did something right.

510
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,102
I love you, Dad.

511
00:20:16,874 --> 00:20:18,174
Come on, Chris.

512
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:21,244
Let's go get an $18 Coke at
the terrible zoo restaurant.

513
00:20:21,278 --> 00:20:25,047
Yay! Sticky tables
covered in bees!

514
00:20:29,653 --> 00:20:31,187
Coming up, we'll tell you
where to look

515
00:20:31,221 --> 00:20:33,422
when talking to a coworker
in the bathroom.

516
00:20:33,457 --> 00:20:35,291
The answer
might surprise you.

517
00:20:35,325 --> 00:20:37,915
Well, I think we all
learned something today.

518
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:40,017
In other news,
TVs still make noise,

519
00:20:40,051 --> 00:20:41,885
even when people
resume their conversations.

520
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,320
Yes, studies have determined...
That's right, Peter.

521
00:20:43,655 --> 00:20:45,255
And it's the most important lesson.
(Tom continues)

522
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,530
Everyone should be
who they are.

523
00:20:47,341 --> 00:20:48,661
Success is being
true to yourself.

524
00:20:49,538 --> 00:20:50,938
Amen, Mom.
(Tom continues)

525
00:20:50,973 --> 00:20:53,886
But to have the love of your
family, that's true success.

526
00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:55,216
Let's go ahead and
turn off the TV.

527
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,218
TOM:
There we go.
