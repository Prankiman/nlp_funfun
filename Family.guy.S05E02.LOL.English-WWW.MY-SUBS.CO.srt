1
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:40,541
Oh, this is so exciting.

2
00:00:40,542 --> 00:00:43,065
Maybe we'll get lucky
and see another crash this year.

3
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:45,131
Yeah, we can get some souvenirs.

4
00:00:45,132 --> 00:00:47,965
Last year, I got an altimeter
and a shinbone.

5
00:01:10,897 --> 00:01:12,323
Eh, this is boring.

6
00:01:12,324 --> 00:01:14,824
I'd rather be home watching
that video from The Ring.

7
00:01:14,827 --> 00:01:15,915
Peter, don't...

8
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,465
they say if you
watch that video you die.

9
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,099
Ah, that's a lot of baloney.

10
00:01:21,418 --> 00:01:24,278
<i>We can build
this thing together</i>

11
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:26,833
<i>Standing strong forever</i>

12
00:01:27,126 --> 00:01:30,602
<i>Nothing's gonna stop us now.</i>

13
00:01:30,668 --> 00:01:33,132
Look, there's Mr. Quagmire's plane!

14
00:01:33,137 --> 00:01:34,381
Ladies and gentlemen,

15
00:01:34,387 --> 00:01:37,093
keep your eye on the sky
for the aerial acrobatics

16
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:39,342
of Captain Glen Quagmire.

17
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:50,560
Whoa, gonna need some help here.

18
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:52,822
All right.

19
00:01:54,896 --> 00:01:55,883
Wait a minute, where...

20
00:01:55,926 --> 00:01:56,820
Oh, my God,

21
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:57,852
where's Stewie?

22
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,382
Don't panic, Lois, we'll find him.

23
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:01,243
I'm good at picking
people out of a crowd.

24
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,813
Oh, gosh, this is hard.

25
00:02:02,816 --> 00:02:05,412
Um, yeah, could I get
a better look at number two?

26
00:02:06,448 --> 00:02:09,122
And, number four
could you step forward, too?

27
00:02:09,656 --> 00:02:12,551
Okay, uh, number five,
uh, look at number one.

28
00:02:12,597 --> 00:02:15,463
Look at him like you haven't seen him
in a while and you're happy.

29
00:02:15,495 --> 00:02:17,371
Okay, not too happy,
not too happy.

30
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:18,513
Pull it back, pull it back.

31
00:02:18,515 --> 00:02:21,043
Okay, and, um,
number three could you say,

32
00:02:21,067 --> 00:02:24,662
"Julie, I promise to get back on
my feet before the baby arrives. "

33
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:28,390
Julie, I promise to get back on
my feet before the baby arrives.

34
00:02:28,478 --> 00:02:29,280
He's good.

35
00:02:29,286 --> 00:02:30,790
Yeah, he's always good, very good.

36
00:02:30,805 --> 00:02:32,652
Yeah, yeah, okay, thank you.

37
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:35,031
Stewie? Stewie!

38
00:02:35,037 --> 00:02:37,241
Hey, everybody,
it's Weenie and the Butt here

39
00:02:37,246 --> 00:02:38,840
live at the Quahog Air Show.

40
00:02:38,846 --> 00:02:41,621
We're all ready for
the Weenie sound-alike contest.

41
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:42,593
I don't know, Butt,

42
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:44,721
I don't think they can say my
catchphrase, because...

43
00:02:44,725 --> 00:02:46,882
"They no funny!"

44
00:02:48,308 --> 00:02:49,651
Oh, there it is!

45
00:02:49,655 --> 00:02:52,281
And if you think you can say
that just like Weenie here,

46
00:02:52,295 --> 00:02:56,211
you could win 97.1 dollars
for the cool weekend ahead.

47
00:02:56,216 --> 00:02:57,093

And welcome back.

59
00:03:17,118 --> 00:03:19,301
Uh, excuse I-I got to find a lost kid.

60
00:03:19,305 --> 00:03:20,113
Can I use your mic?

61
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,243
That's what she said.

62
00:03:21,247 --> 00:03:24,031
Whoa, you got Butt-slammed!

63
00:03:26,348 --> 00:03:28,063
Listen, I could really
use a hand here.

64
00:03:28,065 --> 00:03:29,453
That's what he said!

65
00:03:29,508 --> 00:03:31,462
Butt slam!

66
00:03:32,925 --> 00:03:35,163
That's Manic Monkey on 97.1.

Gimme that.

75
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,930
Stewie Griffin, will you please
report to the radio booth.

76
00:03:49,935 --> 00:03:51,062
Stewie Griffin.

77
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:52,982
Hey, that's quite
a voice you've got there.

78
00:03:52,985 --> 00:03:54,872
You ever think about doing radio?

79
00:03:54,877 --> 00:03:57,360
Well, uh, I listen to a lot of radio.

80
00:03:57,365 --> 00:03:59,781
Peter and Lois leave the radio on
when they go out

81
00:03:59,785 --> 00:04:01,151
so I feel like somebody's home.

82
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,282
Well, here's my card.

83
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:03,610
Call me if you're interested.

84
00:04:03,615 --> 00:04:05,952
Hey, okay, we've got
our first contestant.

85
00:04:05,957 --> 00:04:07,780
Let's hear Weenie's catchphrase.

86
00:04:08,506 --> 00:04:10,801
They no funny.

87
00:04:11,108 --> 00:04:13,493
I think we have a wee-ner.

88
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:18,853
And that's Dicky the Punchline Donkey,
on 97.1.

89
00:04:18,855 --> 00:04:22,493
<i>Dicky the Punchline Donkey, on Cool 97.1!</i>

<i>Ninety-seven point one.</i>

101
00:04:38,536 --> 00:04:40,352
And now back to Round Table,

102
00:04:40,356 --> 00:04:42,821
with Al Michaels,
Harold Ramis, Ray Romano,

103
00:04:42,828 --> 00:04:44,013
and Kermit the Frog.

104
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:46,523
There zoning laws are infringing
on the rights of citizens...

105
00:04:46,528 --> 00:04:48,560
Uh, if I might interrupt for a minute,
I'd like to point out that-

106
00:04:48,565 --> 00:04:50,293
You've had your time.
Let someone else speak.

107
00:04:50,295 --> 00:04:52,123
I haven't said a word. It was that guy.

108
00:04:52,128 --> 00:04:54,002
Don't look at me, I can't get
a word in edgewise.

109
00:04:54,005 --> 00:04:56,132
Well, then who the hell's
been talking this whole time?

110
00:05:01,447 --> 00:05:02,381
Thelma!

111
00:05:02,387 --> 00:05:04,301
Hello, darling.

112
00:05:04,306 --> 00:05:06,790
Oh, my God, what
a pleasant surprise.

113
00:05:06,827 --> 00:05:08,281
Mom, what are you doing here?

114
00:05:08,288 --> 00:05:10,481
Peter, I left your father.

115
00:05:10,485 --> 00:05:11,153
What?

116
00:05:11,156 --> 00:05:12,262
Wait, wait, wait, hang on a second.

117
00:05:12,267 --> 00:05:14,593
I never see you, and then
you finally come visit me

118
00:05:14,597 --> 00:05:16,352
and you drop a bombshell like this?

119
00:05:16,355 --> 00:05:18,990
This is just like what happened
at the Peanuts reunion.

120
00:05:26,336 --> 00:05:27,821
Stupid song!

121
00:05:28,046 --> 00:05:29,521
What are you looking at?

122
00:05:30,398 --> 00:05:31,662
Yeah, it's me.

123
00:05:31,668 --> 00:05:34,192
Your old punching bag,
Charlie Brown.

124
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:37,783
Everybody wish Snoopy was here
and Woodstock?

125
00:05:37,867 --> 00:05:40,583
Everybody wish Snoopy
and Woodstock was here?

126
00:05:40,586 --> 00:05:41,923
Well, they're dead!

127
00:05:41,945 --> 00:05:43,213
And guess what?

128
00:05:43,216 --> 00:05:45,171
I sold Snoopy the junk.

129
00:05:45,175 --> 00:05:47,353
That's right, he got it from me!

130
00:05:47,697 --> 00:05:50,852
I swear I didn't know
how strong it was.

131
00:05:50,858 --> 00:05:54,530
And now he's dead!
They're both dead!

132
00:05:54,537 --> 00:05:57,193
I don't give a crap
about Woodstock,

133
00:05:57,196 --> 00:05:59,222
but Snoopy...

134
00:06:00,378 --> 00:06:02,022
Get off me, you skank!

135
00:06:03,457 --> 00:06:05,523
I can't believe you left Dad.

136
00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:08,110
I have needs that he didn't satisfy.

137
00:06:08,116 --> 00:06:10,370
And I'm still a young woman, Peter.

138
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:12,941
82 is the new 74.

139
00:06:12,945 --> 00:06:16,152
I'm putting my fine ass
back on the market.

140
00:06:16,156 --> 00:06:19,210
Boy, this is really going
to upset my evil brother, Thaddeus.

141
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:23,135
Nyah... this will surely affect
my inheritance... nyah.

142
00:06:25,775 --> 00:06:27,163
Hi, I'm Brian Griffin,

143
00:06:27,198 --> 00:06:29,138
and you're listening to The Lunch Hour,

144
00:06:29,145 --> 00:06:31,521
serving up food for the mind.

145
00:06:31,527 --> 00:06:33,222
Today's entree is politics.

146
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,742
What's on your mind today?

147
00:06:34,745 --> 00:06:36,771
The governor's budget,
stem cell research?

148
00:06:36,777 --> 00:06:39,301
Give us a hot spoonful
of your opinion.

149
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:41,471
Ok, we have a question from Quahog.

150
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:43,741
Caller, you're on The Lunch Hour.
Can I take your order?

151
00:06:43,746 --> 00:06:46,603
Yes, uh, I'll have a big helping
of the pretentious crap.

152
00:06:46,608 --> 00:06:49,660
Whoa, sometimes the, uh,
crazy ones get through.

153
00:06:49,857 --> 00:06:52,723
Okay, we have Rose,
from Cranston, on the phone.

154
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:54,550
Welcome, Rose, can I take your order?

155
00:06:54,556 --> 00:06:57,902
Um, yes, that turkey, that-
that raw turkey that you ate

156
00:06:57,908 --> 00:07:00,413
off the counter last week
that got Lois mad,

157
00:07:00,437 --> 00:07:03,342
when you pooped that out
was the timer still in there?

158
00:07:03,345 --> 00:07:04,880
And we're out of time.

159
00:07:04,886 --> 00:07:06,502
This has been The Lunch Hour.

160
00:07:06,517 --> 00:07:09,512
Join us next week, when our
guest will be Gore Vidal.

161
00:07:09,515 --> 00:07:11,803
And remember, life is full of entrees,

162
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,341
so don't fill up on bread.

163
00:07:13,356 --> 00:07:15,471
I'm going to throw you now
to Weenie and The Butt

164
00:07:15,475 --> 00:07:16,470
in the afternoon.

165
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,681
<i>Weenie and the Butt!</i>

166
00:07:17,685 --> 00:07:19,021
<i>Ninety-seven point one!</i>

167
00:07:19,025 --> 00:07:21,372
<i>In the afternoon.</i>

168
00:07:21,376 --> 00:07:22,600
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

169
00:07:22,617 --> 00:07:23,631
<i>WQHG!</i>

170
00:07:23,645 --> 00:07:26,280
<i>Turn it on and rip the knob off!</i>

171
00:07:26,326 --> 00:07:28,551
<i>You're listening to the radio!</i>

172
00:07:29,905 --> 00:07:31,363
Sir, I'm very sorry.

173
00:07:31,366 --> 00:07:34,031
That-that was this guy I know.
He thinks he's hilarious.

174
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:35,321
He is hilarious!

175
00:07:35,336 --> 00:07:37,582
I was on my way in here
to cancel your show,

176
00:07:37,588 --> 00:07:39,421
but the banter you did
with that guy,

177
00:07:39,427 --> 00:07:41,620
well, as we say
in the radio business,

178
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,842
"If you put that on the radio,
people will listen to it!"

179
00:07:44,845 --> 00:07:46,460
Make him part of the show.

180
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:47,592
Oh, you-you don't want him.

181
00:07:47,595 --> 00:07:49,470
He's not really a professional like me.

182
00:07:49,475 --> 00:07:51,222
Listen, you get that kid in here.

183
00:07:51,227 --> 00:07:52,921
We need more laughs on the show.

184
00:07:53,886 --> 00:07:57,471
Well, I guess he couldn't be any worse
than Tim McCarver is at sportscasting.

185
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:02,772
In my view, as good as the Yankees
were in the first half of this game,

186
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:05,861
that's how as bad they've been now.

187
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,202
Poor Peter, I know he's having

188
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,570
a hard time with this
whole divorce thing.

189
00:08:15,636 --> 00:08:18,962
I feel kind of guilty that
I'm here looking for a date.

190
00:08:18,968 --> 00:08:20,331
Thelma, stop that.

191
00:08:20,337 --> 00:08:22,291
You have a right to be happy.

192
00:08:22,296 --> 00:08:24,291
And-and there's a lot of great people here

193
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:25,331
Why don't you mingle?

194
00:08:25,336 --> 00:08:27,001
Oh, my God, Lois, you single now?!

195
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,571
No, Glen, I'm here with Thelma.

196
00:08:29,587 --> 00:08:31,672
- Who's Thelma?
- This is Thelma.

197
00:08:33,717 --> 00:08:35,923
I don't know if this
is gonna work, Lois.

198
00:08:35,927 --> 00:08:38,191
I'm a little shy at these types of things.

199
00:08:38,196 --> 00:08:40,431
Oh, you can overcome shyness.

200
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:44,132
Think of the spider in Charlotte's Web
who had to overcome Tourette's.

201
00:08:46,877 --> 00:08:48,023
I don't know, Lois.

202
00:08:48,026 --> 00:08:50,661
I haven't met a single
interesting person.

203
00:08:50,676 --> 00:08:52,033
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker

204
00:08:52,036 --> 00:08:53,362
trying to get back on my feet

205
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:56,162
after having my ass handed to me
by my bitch of an ex-wife.

206
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:57,283
I'm Thelma.

207
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,741
I'll just be going.

208
00:08:58,745 --> 00:09:00,081
Can I get you some punch?

209
00:09:00,085 --> 00:09:04,373
Oh, no, you see, if you're one
of ten million Americans like me...

210
00:09:04,376 --> 00:09:06,250
Like me.

211
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:07,963
...with a bladder control problem,

212
00:09:07,968 --> 00:09:10,171
punch just goes right through you.

213
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,393
I didn't hear you come in last night.

214
00:09:17,397 --> 00:09:19,671
Did you have a good time
at your prostitutes convention?

215
00:09:19,687 --> 00:09:22,720
Peter, I was just trying to help your
mother meet some new friends.

216
00:09:22,727 --> 00:09:24,193
Lois, you're too nosey.

217
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,743
Like that waiter at that restaurant.

218
00:09:25,747 --> 00:09:27,562
And who had the prime rib?

219
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,822
I hardly think that's any
of your business.

220
00:09:30,097 --> 00:09:32,570
Come on, Mom,
you can't stay in bed all day.

221
00:09:32,578 --> 00:09:34,853
You got to call dad and get
back together with...

222
00:09:35,838 --> 00:09:37,450
Holy crap!

223
00:09:37,538 --> 00:09:39,910
We'll have more on these
new developments after this.

224
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,162
I can't believe what I saw in there.

225
00:09:45,175 --> 00:09:47,511
You were messing around
in what was basically

226
00:09:47,516 --> 00:09:48,752
my first apartment.

227
00:09:48,758 --> 00:09:50,842
Peter, you should be happy for her.

228
00:09:50,846 --> 00:09:52,233
She's just having fun.

229
00:09:52,238 --> 00:09:53,881
I don't see what the problem is.

230
00:09:53,888 --> 00:09:55,330
Tom is a wonderful man.

231
00:09:55,336 --> 00:09:57,631
I don't see the problem, either,
but let's go to Ollie Williams

232
00:09:57,648 --> 00:09:59,331
for the inepth analysis. Ollie?

233
00:09:59,338 --> 00:10:00,161
Lady's old!

234
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:01,620
Thanks, Ollie, over to you, Peter.

235
00:10:01,636 --> 00:10:04,130
Tom Tucker, I forbid you
to see my mother.

236
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:06,233
Peter, you can't talk to Tom that way.

237
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:09,362
He won a local Emmy for his work
with the retardeds.

238
00:10:09,366 --> 00:10:10,893
They certainly wanted to hug me.

239
00:10:10,897 --> 00:10:12,322
Maybe in time, you will, too.

240
00:10:12,327 --> 00:10:14,673
Thanks for watching, I'm Tom Tucker.
Good night.

241
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:23,622
All right, look, let's get
one thing straight, Stewie.

242
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,062
The only reason you're here
is that my boss ordered me

243
00:10:26,076 --> 00:10:26,952
to bring you on.

244
00:10:26,965 --> 00:10:29,330
All right, this is my show,
and it's a serious,

245
00:10:29,348 --> 00:10:32,130
intellectual hour of discussion and
I want to keep it that way.

246
00:10:32,138 --> 00:10:33,102
Hey, no problem.

247
00:10:33,107 --> 00:10:35,701
All right, in three, two, one...

248
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,661
This is The Lunch Hour with your host...

249
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,471
Hey, what's up Quahog?!

250
00:10:39,477 --> 00:10:40,950
From the station that reaches the beaches,

251
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,052
you're listening to Dingo and The Baby!

252
00:10:43,065 --> 00:10:44,643
<i>Dingo and the Baby.</i>

253
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:47,342
<i>97.1 Quahog!</i>

254
00:10:47,348 --> 00:10:49,153
<i>Oh, baby!</i>

255
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,773
What the hell are you doing?

256
00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:53,653
Wha-What the hell does that have
to do with anything?

257
00:10:53,656 --> 00:10:56,210
They're just wacky sounds,
you know to liven things up.

258
00:10:56,217 --> 00:10:57,983
<i>D- i-n-g-o!</i>

259
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,410
<i>D- D-Dingo! Dingo and the...</i>

260
00:11:00,565 --> 00:11:02,121
<i>Baby!</i>

261
00:11:04,687 --> 00:11:08,373
<i>Oh, sexy girlfriend!</i>

262
00:11:13,546 --> 00:11:16,032
Peter, would you stop spying
on your mother's date?

263
00:11:16,048 --> 00:11:17,840
I can't stand it anymore, Lois.

264
00:11:17,847 --> 00:11:19,301
I'm going to put a stop to this.

265
00:11:21,968 --> 00:11:22,803
Hello?

266
00:11:22,806 --> 00:11:26,892
Uh, hello, yes, uh, this is, uh,
this is Tom Tucker's personal physician,

267
00:11:26,898 --> 00:11:28,561
Dr. T and the Women.

268
00:11:28,566 --> 00:11:33,140
Um, could you tell Tom his contagious
penis cancer medicine is ready.

269
00:11:33,147 --> 00:11:34,562
Is this Peter?

270
00:11:34,576 --> 00:11:36,781
Uh, no, it's, uh, uh, Lois.

271
00:11:36,788 --> 00:11:39,082
Uh, Lois, don't crank call my mother.

272
00:11:39,086 --> 00:11:40,380
I'm gonna have to pinch you for that.

273
00:11:40,386 --> 00:11:42,111
Ow, Peter, don't pinch me!

274
00:11:42,127 --> 00:11:42,870
Ow!

275
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,072
Ow... stop it!

276
00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:45,532
Knock it off, damn it!

277
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,872
Cut it out. Maybe I'll tickle you,
huh, how about that?!

278
00:11:47,878 --> 00:11:48,732
No, don't.

279
00:11:48,746 --> 00:11:50,621
Here you go, tickle, tickle.

280
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:51,461
Cut it out!

281
00:11:51,466 --> 00:11:52,772
Stop it!

282
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,202
I mean it! I mean it!

283
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:00,860
Well, I told you to stop!

284
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,602
I tickle you, you hit me
in the head with a frying pan?!

285
00:12:03,606 --> 00:12:04,952
I told you to stop!

286
00:12:04,956 --> 00:12:06,101
I taste blood!

287
00:12:06,107 --> 00:12:07,460
Well, there's a lot of it.

288
00:12:10,988 --> 00:12:12,142
Hey there, champ.

289
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:15,431
Peter, I know this is all
a big adjustment for you,

290
00:12:15,437 --> 00:12:17,442
but all I want is for
your mom to be happy.

291
00:12:17,447 --> 00:12:19,733
Well, why can't she go back with my dad?

292
00:12:19,746 --> 00:12:21,780
Well, I can't answer that, but I'm gonna do

293
00:12:21,786 --> 00:12:24,052
my best to make her
even happier than those kids

294
00:12:24,057 --> 00:12:25,662
on Three Wishes with Amy Grant.

295
00:12:25,876 --> 00:12:27,533
What's your wish, Billy?

296
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:29,291
Can you cure my cancer?

297
00:12:29,355 --> 00:12:32,271
No, but how about if Spider-Man gives you

298
00:12:32,277 --> 00:12:34,820
a $50 gift card to Sears?!

299
00:12:35,378 --> 00:12:37,123
He-Here, get well.

300
00:12:37,488 --> 00:12:39,633
You know, I heard a
rumor about you today?

301
00:12:39,637 --> 00:12:41,131
- You did?
- Yep.

302
00:12:41,138 --> 00:12:42,750
I heard you like milk shakes.

303
00:12:42,755 --> 00:12:44,220
Oh boy, do I!

304
00:12:44,228 --> 00:12:45,861
Let's go get ourselves a shake, huh?

305
00:12:46,655 --> 00:12:48,590
I want to get a milk shake, too.

306
00:12:48,608 --> 00:12:50,342
Too bad- go get your own father.

307
00:12:54,846 --> 00:12:57,061
Hey, Carl, can I get a carton
of smokes, please?

308
00:12:57,065 --> 00:12:57,940
Sure, Brian.

309
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:00,363
And uh, what's that little rubber mailman

310
00:13:00,368 --> 00:13:01,341
you got behind there?

311
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:02,323
Oh, you like that, huh?

312
00:13:02,325 --> 00:13:03,613
Yeah, does that thing squeak?

313
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,633
Yeah, it does.

314
00:13:05,115 --> 00:13:07,182
All right, I'll take that,
and I'm gonna hurry home

315
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,203
and show it to Lois.

316
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,790
Hey, I'd recognize that voice anywhere!

317
00:13:10,797 --> 00:13:14,572
You're Dingo, that dog that plays
all those fart sounds on the radio!

318
00:13:14,578 --> 00:13:15,703
Awesome!

319
00:13:15,706 --> 00:13:17,921
Oh, yeah, yeah, sorry about that,

320
00:13:17,926 --> 00:13:19,503
the show's gotten a little lowbrow.

321
00:13:19,505 --> 00:13:21,050
What are you talking about?!

322
00:13:21,055 --> 00:13:22,922
It's, like, the most hilarious show ever!

323
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,973
Hey, could I get your autograph?

324
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:26,511
My... really?

325
00:13:26,517 --> 00:13:28,660
Wow, you're... gosh,
you're making me feel

326
00:13:28,665 --> 00:13:30,803
more important than
a dwarf among midgets.

327
00:13:31,468 --> 00:13:33,190
Hey, can you reach the Crispix?

328
00:13:33,197 --> 00:13:34,651
Yes, I can.

329
00:13:36,906 --> 00:13:40,173
How awesome is this: going out
to dinner with my new family?

330
00:13:40,178 --> 00:13:41,480
Hi, can I help you?

331
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,992
I want, I want that one!

332
00:13:42,995 --> 00:13:45,101
All right, hold on,
we'll get you that one.

333
00:13:45,108 --> 00:13:46,110
I want straws!

334
00:13:46,128 --> 00:13:47,911
We'll get you a straw.

335
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:48,932
You want a Kid's Meal?

336
00:13:48,935 --> 00:13:49,700
No!

337
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:50,722
Do you mean, "yes"?

338
00:13:50,726 --> 00:13:51,531
Yes!

339
00:13:51,536 --> 00:13:52,873
Okay, one Kid's Meal.

340
00:13:52,878 --> 00:13:53,923
And what'll you have, honey?

341
00:13:53,925 --> 00:13:56,480
I'll have a fish sandwich and a Sanka.

342
00:13:56,486 --> 00:13:58,693
Oh, he's adorable.

343
00:13:58,695 --> 00:14:00,380
Say hi to the nice lady, Peter.

344
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:02,271
Oh, he's shy.

345
00:14:10,018 --> 00:14:13,223
<i>I don't believe in fretting and grieving</i>

346
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:16,083
<i>Why mess around with stride?</i>

347
00:14:16,885 --> 00:14:20,543
<i>I never was cut out to step and strut out</i>

348
00:14:20,547 --> 00:14:23,292
<i>Give me the simple life</i>

349
00:14:23,366 --> 00:14:27,270
<i>Some find it pleasant dining on pheasants</i>

350
00:14:27,277 --> 00:14:30,381
<i>Those things roll off my knife</i>

351
00:14:30,388 --> 00:14:34,540
<i>Just serve me tomatoes
and mashed potatoes</i>

352
00:14:34,546 --> 00:14:37,463
<i>Give me the simple life.</i>

353
00:14:39,886 --> 00:14:42,252
We now return to the
Sunday afternoon movie:

354
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,282
Masturbator and Commander.

355
00:14:45,925 --> 00:14:48,591
Captain, the enemy ship
has opened fire on us.

356
00:14:48,598 --> 00:14:49,541
I'll be right out!

357
00:14:49,546 --> 00:14:51,430
Sir, we've already lost ten men.

358
00:14:51,436 --> 00:14:52,223
Hang on!

359
00:14:52,227 --> 00:14:54,222
Sir, don't you think
we should return fire?

360
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,353
Yeah, yeah, go ahead and do that,

361
00:14:55,355 --> 00:14:57,283
and I'll-I'll meet you up there
in like five minutes.

362
00:14:57,556 --> 00:14:59,980
Peter, I've never seen you so happy.

363
00:14:59,988 --> 00:15:01,732
Well, Lois, I never realized
what it was like

364
00:15:01,737 --> 00:15:02,940
to have a real dad.

365
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:05,062
I mean, my own dad
was such a ballbuster,

366
00:15:05,065 --> 00:15:07,240
I- I guess I just always
thought that was normal.

367
00:15:07,555 --> 00:15:09,572
But Papa Tom is so different.

368
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,141
For the first time in my life,

369
00:15:11,148 --> 00:15:13,121
I feel like I have a real family, you know?

370
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,951
I mean I'm-I'm not just going
through the motions

371
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:16,162
like I do around here.

372
00:15:16,168 --> 00:15:18,290
Hey, champ, you want to
watch Chicken Little?

373
00:15:19,215 --> 00:15:20,121
Yeah!

374
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,650
And what does a chicken say?

375
00:15:21,657 --> 00:15:22,822
"Moo!"

376
00:15:23,795 --> 00:15:24,753
Why not.

377
00:15:24,978 --> 00:15:26,090
Come on, Ma!

378
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,260
Hey, what gives with the suitcase?

379
00:15:28,267 --> 00:15:32,272
Tom, there's no easy way to say this,
I'll just come right out with it.

380
00:15:32,275 --> 00:15:33,432
I'm leaving.

381
00:15:33,436 --> 00:15:34,181
Wha...

382
00:15:34,186 --> 00:15:35,650
leaving, why?

383
00:15:35,658 --> 00:15:37,392
Tommy, this has been great,

384
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:40,060
but I wasn't looking
for anything long-term.

385
00:15:40,068 --> 00:15:43,972
I just needed someone to clear
all the bats out of my plumbing.

386
00:15:43,988 --> 00:15:45,270
What do we do now Bill?

387
00:15:45,275 --> 00:15:46,483
We write, Tim.

388
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,112
We write our story.

389
00:15:49,446 --> 00:15:51,001
Good bye, dear.

390
00:15:53,116 --> 00:15:55,580
It's all my fault!

391
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,003
Nyah!

392
00:16:03,175 --> 00:16:05,883
I know it hurts right now, Peter,
but we'll get through this.

393
00:16:05,947 --> 00:16:07,651
You're still my little buddy, right?

394
00:16:07,655 --> 00:16:08,411
Yeah.

395
00:16:08,418 --> 00:16:10,303
Then we'll be okay. Good night, buddy.

396
00:16:10,305 --> 00:16:11,960
Good night, Papa Tom.

397
00:16:11,965 --> 00:16:12,793
Good night, son.

398
00:16:12,798 --> 00:16:14,522
- Good night, Lois.
- Good night.

399
00:16:14,955 --> 00:16:16,710
Peter, this is a little strange.

400
00:16:16,715 --> 00:16:19,381
No stranger than when
Darth Vader was a meter maid.

401
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:22,020
Oh, come on, man, cut me a break!

402
00:16:22,025 --> 00:16:24,110
I was only in there for like five minutes!

403
00:16:24,115 --> 00:16:25,821
I already started writing the ticket.

404
00:16:25,827 --> 00:16:28,103
You know, I make
your annual salary in a week.

405
00:16:28,105 --> 00:16:29,610
Are you happy doing what you're doing?

406
00:16:29,616 --> 00:16:31,041
'Cause you're pathetic.

407
00:16:41,445 --> 00:16:42,830
I got to do it, Karen.

408
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,081
I just... I-I got to take a shot.

409
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,592
That guy, that guy just got to me today.

410
00:16:47,595 --> 00:16:50,653
You do whatever you think is right,
and I'll support it.

411
00:16:52,228 --> 00:16:54,051
I don't really understand it.

412
00:16:54,057 --> 00:16:55,641
What do you want this loan for?

413
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:58,723
I want to build a giant space station
that can destroy a planet.

414
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,733
I don't know that that would be
a good investment on our end.

415
00:17:01,915 --> 00:17:03,852
I mean, I want to open
a sports bar.

416
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,401
Good morning, Quahog!

417
00:17:06,408 --> 00:17:08,231
You're here with Dingo...

418
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,572
And the Baby...

419
00:17:12,555 --> 00:17:14,613
And if you're thinking
about changing the station...

420
00:17:14,615 --> 00:17:16,930
<i>Don't... you do it!</i>

421
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:19,823
Today, we got Homeless Hank from
the Dumpster out back with us.

422
00:17:19,828 --> 00:17:20,663
Hey, I got an idea:

423
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,590
How about the first three women
willing to come down

424
00:17:22,597 --> 00:17:24,790
and have sex with Hank
get free boob jobs

425

courtesy of Dr. John Viener?

426
00:17:26,508 --> 00:17:27,730
Are you reading my mind, man?

427
00:17:27,737 --> 00:17:28,671
Let's go to the phones.

428
00:17:28,677 --> 00:17:31,631
Go ahead caller, you're on
with Dingo and The Baby.

429
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:34,342
Is this Dingo?

430
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:35,572
Yes, honey, what's your name?

431
00:17:35,576 --> 00:17:38,091
Sindy, with an "S."

432
00:17:38,095 --> 00:17:39,280
Ooh, hot.

433
00:17:39,286 --> 00:17:42,110
Oh, yeah, that's hot, that is hot.

434
00:17:42,117 --> 00:17:43,561
Tell me something, Sindy, how'd you like

435
00:17:43,565 --> 00:17:45,412
to come down here and get naked for us?

436
00:17:45,586 --> 00:17:46,693
Sure.

437
00:17:48,248 --> 00:17:49,292
I think we got a show.

438
00:17:49,295 --> 00:17:50,630
Oh yeah, we got a show!

439
00:17:50,638 --> 00:17:52,921
- We definitely got a show!
- Oh, yeah, there's a show!

440
00:17:53,815 --> 00:17:57,033
<i>After all, AIDS is a deadly,
incurable disease.</i>

441
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:00,411
<i>But no matter how you come
to judge, Charles Wheeler</i>

442
00:18:00,418 --> 00:18:04,001
<i>and his partners' unethical,
moral, and inhuman terms,</i>

443
00:18:04,008 --> 00:18:07,963
<i>the fact of the matter is,
when they fired Andrew Beckett</i>

444
00:18:07,968 --> 00:18:09,802
<i>because he had AIDS,</i>

445
00:18:09,807 --> 00:18:12,553
<i>they broke the law.</i>

446
00:18:12,556 --> 00:18:14,881
My God, what is wrong with you?

447
00:18:14,888 --> 00:18:17,312
I swear to God, that was
supposed to be "Food Fight!"

448
00:18:19,936 --> 00:18:21,301
I want some ice cream.

449
00:18:21,305 --> 00:18:22,872
No, Peter, you finish your food.

450
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:27,232
You, hey, you-you get back here,
right now, mister!

451
00:18:27,395 --> 00:18:29,621
Don't, don't you...
get down from that chair,

452
00:18:29,628 --> 00:18:30,573
or you're in big trouble.

453
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:33,440
You put that ice cream back right now.

454
00:18:33,496 --> 00:18:34,431
I mean it.

455
00:18:34,995 --> 00:18:36,352
I am not kidding around.

456
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,110
I am not going to say it again.

457
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,830
Uh... if you put that ice cream
in your mouth you're gonna be

458
00:18:41,845 --> 00:18:43,200
in big trouble, young man!

459
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,371
Uh you... uh, uh.

460
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,170
I hate you, I hate you!

461
00:18:52,175 --> 00:18:53,341
I want my mommy!

462
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:54,732
Well I'm the best you've got!

463
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:56,173
All right, so you know the drill.

464
00:18:56,175 --> 00:18:57,841
We're going to turn on the hot dog cannon,

465
00:18:57,846 --> 00:19:00,010
and for every hot dog that you
catch in your mouth,

466
00:19:00,018 --> 00:19:03,583
you get a $100 toward a boob job
that you desperately need.

467
00:19:03,585 --> 00:19:04,933
I know.

468
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:06,293
Okay, here we go.

469
00:19:06,915 --> 00:19:07,982
Oh, a miss!

470
00:19:07,985 --> 00:19:10,272
Aw, you got her in the eye with that one.

471
00:19:10,626 --> 00:19:13,132
Whoa, that one was
a teat-seeking missile!

472
00:19:13,137 --> 00:19:15,681
I'm looking for Brian Griffin.

473
00:19:16,157 --> 00:19:17,511
Gore Vidal!

474
00:19:17,836 --> 00:19:20,490
I was supposed to do The Lunch Hour?

475
00:19:20,498 --> 00:19:22,620
Uh... this is The Lunch Hour.

476
00:19:22,917 --> 00:19:25,130
That one felt like my dad.

477
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:26,761
<i>Incest in the morning.</i>

478
00:19:26,768 --> 00:19:28,421
<i>Suppressed memories.</i>

479
00:19:28,425 --> 00:19:29,911
<i>Ninety-seven point one!</i>

480
00:19:29,928 --> 00:19:32,710
I think I may have made a mistake.

481
00:19:32,716 --> 00:19:34,100
No, no, no, no, this is it.

482
00:19:34,108 --> 00:19:35,180
You're-you're in the right place.

483
00:19:35,185 --> 00:19:38,091
Uh, listen, uh, why-why don't you
stick around and talk for a while.

484
00:19:38,096 --> 00:19:40,122
My listeners would love
to hear about your new book.

485
00:19:40,368 --> 00:19:41,970
Hundred dollars, boob job!

486
00:19:42,017 --> 00:19:44,111
I'm, uh, going to go.

487
00:19:44,836 --> 00:19:46,930
Oh, my God, what have I done?

488
00:19:46,938 --> 00:19:49,362
Hey, it's all about ratings,
baby, and we got 'em.

489
00:19:49,368 --> 00:19:51,063
No, it wasn't worth it.

490
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:53,312
I'm sorry, Stewie, I can't do this anymore.

491
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:55,213
I'm more of a sell-out
than you were when you did

492
00:19:55,218 --> 00:19:56,761
those Butterfinger commercials.

493
00:19:57,188 --> 00:20:00,501
Nobody better lay a finger
on my Butterfinger.

494
00:20:00,788 --> 00:20:01,803
D'oh!

495
00:20:04,068 --> 00:20:05,492
What's your problem?

496
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:07,660
Ah, Papa Tom's being a jerk.

497
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:09,121
At least he talks to you.

498
00:20:09,128 --> 00:20:12,042
He's my dad and he hasn't
paid attention to me in weeks.

499
00:20:12,076 --> 00:20:13,921
Well, all-in-all, you should be thankful.

500
00:20:13,945 --> 00:20:15,670
I think the Kennedys had a kid like you,

501
00:20:15,677 --> 00:20:17,001
and they had it put to sleep.

502
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,762
Hey, Peter, I'm sorry about
that business with the ice cream.

503
00:20:19,775 --> 00:20:22,943
I guess I'm just still a little
torn up about your mom.

504
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,182
But, hey, I'll make it up to you.
Let's play catch.

505
00:20:25,185 --> 00:20:26,123
Okay!

506
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,180
Wait a minute, you know what?

507
00:20:31,198 --> 00:20:33,290
I think you should play catch with Jake.

508
00:20:33,297 --> 00:20:33,983
Really?

509
00:20:33,987 --> 00:20:37,040
Yeah, I had a taste of what it was like
to have a real father.

510
00:20:37,047 --> 00:20:39,130
I can't make him share his.

511
00:20:39,136 --> 00:20:41,391
Well, all right, Peter, come on, Jake.

512
00:20:41,755 --> 00:20:43,970
Huh, I guess I've learned
a little something

513
00:20:43,977 --> 00:20:45,912
about what it means to be a good dad.

514
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,880
Hey, Dad, do you want to play baseball?

515
00:20:47,885 --> 00:20:50,083
Oh, my God, could you leave me alone!

516
00:20:50,088 --> 00:20:51,933
You are the neediest kid!

517
00:20:52,637 --> 00:20:54,830
I can't believe you gave up our show.

518
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:55,860
Yeah, sorry.

519
00:20:56,087 --> 00:20:57,960
I wonder who they got to replace us.

520
00:20:58,605 --> 00:21:01,580
It's Magic Hour with Dark Chocolate...

521
00:21:01,587 --> 00:21:02,751
And The Rod.

522
00:21:02,755 --> 00:21:04,363
<i>In Rod we trust.</i>

523
00:21:04,368 --> 00:21:05,712
<i>Ninety-seven point one!</i>

524
00:21:06,436 --> 00:21:07,893
<i>Giggity giggity goo!</i>
