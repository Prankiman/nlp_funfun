12
00:00:34,873 --> 00:00:37,274
Hey, guys. You look like
you're getting a little red.

13
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:39,209
Maybe you ought to put
some sunblock on.

14
00:00:39,244 --> 00:00:40,344
Joe, we just got here.

15
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:41,645
Oh, sorry about that.

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,246
These got
a little mixed up.

17
00:00:43,282 --> 00:00:45,415
"Hey, glad you guys
could make it!"

18
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:47,484
Ugh, look at Cleveland
over there.

19
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:49,519
He's obviously cleaning his feet
in the pool

20
00:00:49,555 --> 00:00:52,289
without making it look like he's
cleaning his feet in the pool.

21
00:00:52,324 --> 00:00:53,790
Oh, that's nice.

22
00:00:53,826 --> 00:00:55,492
That's a good temp.

23
00:00:55,527 --> 00:00:58,662
I wonder if this temp is
the same on my other foot.

24
00:00:58,697 --> 00:00:59,997
Oh, yeah.

25
00:01:00,032 --> 00:01:02,032
Sure is a good day for it.

26
00:01:02,067 --> 00:01:04,234
Good day for
these wet paint brushes, too.

27
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:07,104
Is the pool too warm
for paint brushes?

28
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:12,275
(toilet flushes)

29
00:01:12,311 --> 00:01:13,610
Hey, sorry again, Kevin.

30
00:01:13,646 --> 00:01:16,113
I didn't see you in the tub.

31
00:01:29,995 --> 00:01:31,261
Huh, what's all this?

32
00:01:31,296 --> 00:01:32,696
JOE: Honey,
it doesn't seem like

33
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:35,098
the Griffins are leaving
anytime too soon!

34
00:01:35,134 --> 00:01:36,199
Oh. Hey, Peter.

35
00:01:36,235 --> 00:01:37,968
Hey, Joe. What are
all these pictures?

36
00:01:38,003 --> 00:01:39,369
Oh, nothing.

37
00:01:39,405 --> 00:01:41,405
They're just some stupid
scribbles I've been working on

38
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,739
for a children's book.

39
00:01:42,775 --> 00:01:43,874
I don't think
that's stupid.

40
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:45,075
I think that's
awesome!

41
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,543
I mean, my one
note on these

42
00:01:46,578 --> 00:01:48,812
would be to hide a bunch
of dongs in the backgrounds,

43
00:01:48,847 --> 00:01:50,247
but, otherwise, I
think they're great!

44
00:01:50,282 --> 00:01:52,883
Wow. Well, that really means
a lot to me, Peter.

45
00:01:52,918 --> 00:01:54,851
I've been working on this book
for nine years,

46
00:01:54,887 --> 00:01:56,920
but I've been too afraid
to show it to anybody.

47
00:01:56,955 --> 00:01:58,822
Come on, Joe.
You can't be afraid.

48
00:01:58,857 --> 00:02:01,525
What if Bono had been afraid
to wear sunglasses?

49
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,960
Then nobody would know
about Africa.

50
00:02:02,961 --> 00:02:04,261
What's it about?

51
00:02:04,296 --> 00:02:06,396
Well, it's called
<i>The Hopeful Squirrel.</i>

52
00:02:06,432 --> 00:02:07,931
It's about
a handicapped squirrel

53
00:02:07,966 --> 00:02:10,000
who has to learn
to overcome his disabilities

54
00:02:10,035 --> 00:02:11,702
so he can survive in the wild.

55
00:02:11,737 --> 00:02:14,771
As you can imagine,
it's very personal to me.

56
00:02:14,807 --> 00:02:18,241
Wait... were you
once a squirrel?

57
00:02:18,277 --> 00:02:20,210
No, Peter.
I'm handicapped.

58
00:02:20,245 --> 00:02:22,285
Well, you know, you ought
to do something with this.

59
00:02:22,314 --> 00:02:23,413
Really? You think so?

60
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:24,548
Hey, trust me, Joe.

61
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:25,982
I know talent
when I see it.

62
00:02:26,018 --> 00:02:27,884
I mean, I discovered
Mr. Peanut.

63
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,686
Ordinary legume.

64
00:02:29,722 --> 00:02:31,555
Ordinary legume.

65
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,124
Extraordinary peanut!

66
00:02:38,263 --> 00:02:40,030
Oh, man.
There she is.

67
00:02:40,065 --> 00:02:40,931
Wha... Who?

68
00:02:40,966 --> 00:02:42,132
That girl,
right there.

69
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:44,301
She comes in here every morning
after her run.

70
00:02:44,336 --> 00:02:46,036
Ah, I'm obsessed
with her.

71
00:02:46,071 --> 00:02:47,671
Well, why don't
you go talk to her?

72
00:02:47,706 --> 00:02:49,172
Way ahead of ya.

73
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,707
Wh... Where
are you going?

74
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,310
(panting)

75
00:02:53,345 --> 00:02:55,212
And... 1,000.

76
00:02:55,247 --> 00:02:56,247
Whew.
(laughs)

77
00:02:56,248 --> 00:02:57,614
1,000 what?

78
00:02:57,649 --> 00:02:59,683
Percent, that's what.
(scoffs)

79
00:02:59,718 --> 00:03:01,384
You, uh, you in
the game, too?

80
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,019
You mean running?

81
00:03:03,055 --> 00:03:04,855
Uh, let me think--
what's on my trophies?

82
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,289
Uh... yes!

83
00:03:06,325 --> 00:03:07,357
STEWIE:
You're losing her!

84
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,392
Hey, I'm Brian.

85
00:03:08,393 --> 00:03:09,393
Hi, I'm Chloe.

86
00:03:09,394 --> 00:03:10,394
Nice to meet you.

87
00:03:10,395 --> 00:03:12,028
Hey, uh, you
wouldn't maybe want

88
00:03:12,064 --> 00:03:13,997
to grab a bite to eat
sometime, would you?

89
00:03:14,032 --> 00:03:15,032
That sounds great.

90
00:03:15,033 --> 00:03:16,099
Awesome.

91
00:03:16,135 --> 00:03:17,968
You know, see, this is
how you meet people.

92
00:03:18,003 --> 00:03:19,503
I tried the online
dating thing,

93
00:03:19,538 --> 00:03:21,638
but there's just too much
competition out there.

94
00:03:24,376 --> 00:03:26,696
Short, but handsome, slightly
hairy, newly single salesman.

95
00:03:26,712 --> 00:03:29,246
Short, but handsome, slightly
hairy, newly single salesman.

96
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:31,915
Short, but handsome, slightly
hairy, newly single salesman.

97
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,284
Hi, I'm Al Harrington
of Al Harrington's Wacky Waving

98
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,020
Inflatable Arm-Flailing Tube-Man
Warehouse and Emporium.

99
00:03:37,055 --> 00:03:39,156
<i>Due to a gut-busting divorce,</i>
<i>limited people skills,</i>

100
00:03:39,191 --> 00:03:41,191
<i>and significant prodding</i>
<i>from my therapist,</i>

101
00:03:41,226 --> 00:03:43,693
I am currently seeking online
companionship as

102
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:46,429
a short, but handsome, slightly
hairy, newly single salesman.

103
00:03:46,465 --> 00:03:47,764
And I would love to attempt

104
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,167
to convert my heavily
embellished Internet profile

105
00:03:50,202 --> 00:03:52,002
and carefully airbrushed,
out-of-date photo,

106
00:03:52,037 --> 00:03:55,972
into a night of
physical intimacy with you...!

107
00:03:59,578 --> 00:04:00,811
(knocking)

108
00:04:03,348 --> 00:04:05,582
Peter, I just heard
the best news.

109
00:04:05,617 --> 00:04:08,118
Wow, word gets
around fast.

110
00:04:08,153 --> 00:04:09,085
Nice, right?

111
00:04:09,121 --> 00:04:10,587
No. Peter,
I took your advice

112
00:04:10,622 --> 00:04:12,355
and sent my book
to a publisher.

113
00:04:12,391 --> 00:04:14,591
They're gonna publish
<i>The Hopeful Squirrel.</i>

114
00:04:14,626 --> 00:04:15,926
And it's all
thanks to you!

115
00:04:15,961 --> 00:04:17,260
Joe, that's amazing!

116
00:04:17,296 --> 00:04:19,329
So there's gonna be a
real live book out there

117
00:04:19,364 --> 00:04:20,530
with your name on it?

118
00:04:20,566 --> 00:04:22,899
Well, actually, I'm writing it
under a pen name--

119
00:04:22,935 --> 00:04:24,301
David Chicago.

120
00:04:24,336 --> 00:04:27,137
Well, how come you didn't
just write it under Joe...

121
00:04:27,172 --> 00:04:28,638
S... Steenburj...

122
00:04:28,674 --> 00:04:29,973
You know,
your real name?

123
00:04:30,008 --> 00:04:32,642
I wanted to avoid catching crap
down at the police station.

124
00:04:32,678 --> 00:04:34,611
They don't like
anything artistic.

125
00:04:34,646 --> 00:04:36,847
They were pretty rough
on my mime act.

126
00:04:36,882 --> 00:04:38,114
I'm in a box.

127
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,684
Oop, that's the
back of the box.

128
00:04:40,719 --> 00:04:42,018
You're not supposed
to talk!

129
00:04:42,054 --> 00:04:44,754
Well, how else are you
gonna know I'm in a box?!

130
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,159
(doorbell rings)

131
00:04:49,194 --> 00:04:50,460
Oh. Hi, Brian.

132
00:04:50,495 --> 00:04:52,028
Hey. You, uh...

133
00:04:52,064 --> 00:04:53,663
you didn't forget
about our date, did you?

134
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:54,865
Of course not.

135
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,666
I was just thinking,
since it's so nice out,

136
00:04:56,702 --> 00:04:58,735
we could go out for
a run and then eat.

137
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,404
Oh. Yeah. N-no, no. You know,
I would totally do that.

138
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,175
I-I just... I've already run,
like, so many "K" today.

139
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,676
Oh, come on,
don't be a wimp!

140
00:05:06,712 --> 00:05:08,745
This way, you'll earn
your dessert.

141
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,947
(sighs)

142
00:05:12,484 --> 00:05:14,751
Wow, this is great,
isn't it, Brian?

143
00:05:14,786 --> 00:05:16,486
(panting):
Yeah, it's awesome.

144
00:05:16,521 --> 00:05:18,455
Hey, uh, is your vision

145
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,891
also reduced
to just a tiny pinhole?

146
00:05:20,926 --> 00:05:22,359
Just push
through it, Brian.

147
00:05:22,394 --> 00:05:24,027
Once you hit
your runner's high,

148
00:05:24,062 --> 00:05:25,562
you'll catch
your second wind.

149
00:05:25,597 --> 00:05:26,630
Runner's high?

150
00:05:26,665 --> 00:05:28,665
Yeah, my endorphins
always kick in

151
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,367
at the top of this hill.

152
00:05:31,937 --> 00:05:33,403
Oh, crap.

153
00:05:33,438 --> 00:05:35,438
(panting)

154
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,943
<i>Brian, this is your heart.</i>

155
00:05:39,978 --> 00:05:41,344
<i>What the hell do you think</i>
<i>you're doing?</i>

156
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,512
<i>Stop.</i>

157
00:05:42,547 --> 00:05:44,214

I still see you!

183
00:06:47,145 --> 00:06:48,445
Hello, everyone.
I'm Blake Walker

184
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,046
from Piermont Publishing.

185
00:06:50,082 --> 00:06:52,682
Please join me in welcoming
David Chicago.

186
00:06:52,718 --> 00:06:54,517
(applause)

187
00:06:54,553 --> 00:06:57,954
Okay, so, uh, hi, folks,
and thank you all for coming.

188
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,323
I know this would've been
a great day to surf.

189
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:01,858
PETER:
That's not a joke!

190
00:07:01,893 --> 00:07:05,428
Uh, anyway,
this is<i> The Hopeful Squirrel.</i>

191
00:07:05,464 --> 00:07:07,897
"There once was
a handicapped squirrel

192
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:10,266
who could not climb trees
to get food."

193
00:07:10,302 --> 00:07:12,302
Okay, next page.

194
00:07:16,508 --> 00:07:17,741
"The squirrel"--

195
00:07:17,776 --> 00:07:19,442
the same squirrel
from the first page--

196
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:22,912
"hoped that the other animals
would share their food with him.

197
00:07:22,948 --> 00:07:24,914
"'Please,'
said the Hopeful Squirrel.

198
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,217
"'If you could all spare
just one nut,

199
00:07:27,252 --> 00:07:29,352
I, too, could survive
the winter.'"

200
00:07:29,388 --> 00:07:30,987
Sorry about that.

201
00:07:31,023 --> 00:07:33,223
Mommy, I don't like
the wheel man.

202
00:07:33,258 --> 00:07:35,058
"But none of the other animals

203
00:07:35,093 --> 00:07:38,361
would share
with the Hopeful Squirrel."

204
00:07:38,397 --> 00:07:40,163
Hey, eyes front! I'm talking!

205
00:07:40,198 --> 00:07:41,765
Don't tell my kid what to do.

206
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,767
Well, maybe if you did,
I wouldn't have to!

207
00:07:43,802 --> 00:07:45,535
(parents heckling)

208
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,037
Shut up! This is free!

209
00:07:47,072 --> 00:07:48,352
QUAGMIRE:
You know why it's free?

210
00:07:48,373 --> 00:07:50,240
'Cause it sucks!
Quagmire?

211
00:07:50,275 --> 00:07:53,209
I think it might
be time to leave.

212
00:07:53,245 --> 00:07:55,278
Ah, crap, this is Joe's dream.

213
00:07:55,313 --> 00:07:57,113
I got to do something.

214
00:07:57,149 --> 00:07:58,448
Joe, what are
you doing?

215
00:07:58,483 --> 00:08:00,283
The-the squirrel doesn't
even sound hopeful.

216
00:08:00,318 --> 00:08:01,684
It's got to be like,

217
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,820
(cheerfully): "If you
could spare just one nut,

218
00:08:03,855 --> 00:08:06,122
I, too, could
survive the winter!"

219
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:07,557
Oh, I like that voice.

220
00:08:07,592 --> 00:08:08,925
He's funny.

221
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,127
That's the man who passed out
at the liquor store.

222
00:08:11,163 --> 00:08:13,296
Joe, quick,
give me the book.

223
00:08:13,331 --> 00:08:17,400
"And so, the squirrel decided
to climb for his own nuts.

224
00:08:17,436 --> 00:08:20,270
"'I don't need legs when
I've got a positive attitude

225
00:08:20,305 --> 00:08:22,439
and arm strength.'"

226
00:08:22,474 --> 00:08:25,108
"'I'm sorry that
we mistreated you,'

227
00:08:25,143 --> 00:08:27,077
"said Buddy the Badger.

228
00:08:27,112 --> 00:08:28,578
"'Could you find it
in your heart

229
00:08:28,613 --> 00:08:30,213
"to share your nuts with us?'

230
00:08:30,248 --> 00:08:32,549
"'Of course I'll share
with you all,'

231
00:08:32,584 --> 00:08:33,783
"said the squirrel.

232
00:08:33,819 --> 00:08:35,485
"'For if I could not forgive,

233
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,588
then I would be
truly handicapped.'"

234
00:08:38,623 --> 00:08:39,789
(cheering)

235
00:08:45,831 --> 00:08:47,931
Wow, that was great.
Who are you?

236
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:50,400
Just a grown man
with a pet hermit crab.

237
00:08:50,435 --> 00:08:52,735
Listen, Joe, how would you feel
about your friend

238
00:08:52,771 --> 00:08:54,771
getting more involved?
What do you mean?

239
00:08:54,806 --> 00:08:57,207
Well, you would write the books,
and your friend, Peter,

240
00:08:57,242 --> 00:08:59,309
would be the public face
of<i> The Hopeful Squirrel.</i>

241
00:08:59,344 --> 00:09:01,044
He would be David Chicago.

242
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:03,746
Well, I...
I don't know.

243
00:09:03,782 --> 00:09:05,381
Joe, this happens
all the time.

244
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:06,716
You wouldn't believe
who really writes

245
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:08,585
all those Stephen King books.

246
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,954
Scary stuff, scary stuff,
scary stuff. Ding!

247
00:09:10,989 --> 00:09:13,323
Scary stuff,
scary stuff, scary stuff. Ding!

248
00:09:13,358 --> 00:09:16,359
Scary stuff, scary stuff,
scary stuff. Lunch!

249
00:09:16,394 --> 00:09:18,528
Look, Peter can get this book
into the hands

250
00:09:18,563 --> 00:09:20,096
of every kid in America.

251
00:09:20,132 --> 00:09:21,431
That's what you wanted,
isn't it?

252
00:09:21,466 --> 00:09:22,999
All right.

253
00:09:23,034 --> 00:09:25,468
Well, whatever you think
is best for the book.

254
00:09:25,504 --> 00:09:27,437
Great! So it's all agreed.

255
00:09:27,472 --> 00:09:29,272
Can't wait to work
with you, Peter.

256
00:09:29,307 --> 00:09:31,741
What-what just happened?

257
00:09:31,776 --> 00:09:34,010
Oh, the bookstore closed
and is now a Target.

258
00:09:34,045 --> 00:09:36,746
But don't worry,
our industry's fine.

259
00:09:41,764 --> 00:09:43,764
Excuse me, Mr. Chicago?

260
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,666
Could you please sign
my copy of your book?

261
00:09:45,701 --> 00:09:47,301
- Sure, I...
- Easy there, Joe.

262
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,336
Hot Rod asked for Mr. Chicago.

263
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,308
"Give me all your money.
I have a gun"?

264
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,743
Oh, wait, I think
I messed something up.

265
00:09:56,779 --> 00:09:58,979
"Never give up on your dreams"?

266
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,051
Listen, Peter, if you're
gonna act as David Chicago,

267
00:10:04,086 --> 00:10:06,386
I need to know that you're
gonna take this seriously

268
00:10:06,422 --> 00:10:08,322
and honor the message
of the book.

269
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,090
Joe, I got it. Trust me.

270
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,358
This ain't the first time

271
00:10:11,393 --> 00:10:13,260
I've pretended
to be someone I'm not.

272
00:10:13,295 --> 00:10:15,162
(making ghost noises)

273
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:18,498
Gene Shalit, I am the
ghost of Roger Ebert.

274
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,300
(screams)
And even in death,

275
00:10:20,336 --> 00:10:22,135
I'm a better
critic than you.

276
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:24,104
Leave me alone!
Go back to hell!

277
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:25,272
(hisses)

278
00:10:25,307 --> 00:10:27,474
Gene, is everything
all right?

279
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:28,609
It's fine, Joanne.

280
00:10:28,644 --> 00:10:30,010
Go back to sleep.

281
00:10:31,747 --> 00:10:33,747
(kissing noisily)

282
00:10:36,752 --> 00:10:38,218
(grunts, snorts)

283
00:10:43,192 --> 00:10:44,825
Good afternoon,
I'm Tom Tucker.

284
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,794
Welcome to another edition
of<i> Cross-Legged Chat.</i>

285
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,529
Our guest on
today's show is

286
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:52,833
local bestselling children's
book author David Chicago.

287
00:10:52,868 --> 00:10:54,267
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

288
00:10:54,303 --> 00:10:56,403
Wow, all your words are
right there for you?

289
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:57,504
(laughs)

290
00:10:57,539 --> 00:10:59,906
Quite... quite the imagination
on this one.

291
00:10:59,942 --> 00:11:01,708
So, tell me,
how did you decide

292
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,710
to write about
a handicapped squirrel?

293
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:06,546
You know, I'd see
these crippled kids

294
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,482
limping down the sidewalk
on my way to work,

295
00:11:08,517 --> 00:11:10,617
and I would just
laugh and laugh,

296
00:11:10,653 --> 00:11:12,519
and I thought,
"Hey! Put that in a book!"

297
00:11:12,554 --> 00:11:14,388
(laughter)

298
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:17,658
He's making people laugh
at handicapped people.

299
00:11:17,693 --> 00:11:18,892
What's he doing out there?!

300
00:11:18,927 --> 00:11:20,260
I'll tell you
what he's doing,

301
00:11:20,295 --> 00:11:21,615
he's selling books!
They love him!

302
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,463
Now, I understand
we have some questions

303
00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:24,531
from the audience.

304
00:11:24,566 --> 00:11:26,033
Yes, I have a question.

305
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:28,535
Is the Hopeful Squirrel
a boy or a girl?

306
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:29,836
(high-pitched voice):
I'm a boy!

307
00:11:29,872 --> 00:11:32,205
But in the book,
I'm drawn smooth down there,

308
00:11:32,241 --> 00:11:34,241
so it's not a bad question.

309
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,509
Okay, that's all our time.

310
00:11:35,544 --> 00:11:37,577
We invite you to stay tuned
through the credits

311
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,746
so you can see
where I buy my clothes.

312
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,616
(cheering, music playing)

313
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,060
So what's
going on here?

314
00:11:53,095 --> 00:11:54,528
Just having dinner.

315
00:11:54,563 --> 00:11:57,064
That's Dad's chair.
He's gonna be mad.

316
00:11:57,099 --> 00:12:00,400
Wow, Brian, you sure have been
doing a lot of jogging lately.

317
00:12:00,436 --> 00:12:02,669
(chuckles)
It's called "running," Lois.

318
00:12:02,705 --> 00:12:04,004
Why don't you
have some food?

319
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,539
Oh, you mean fuel?

320
00:12:05,574 --> 00:12:07,741
Ah, no-no offense,
Lois, but that stuff

321
00:12:07,776 --> 00:12:09,543
is nothing but chemicals
and empty calories.

322
00:12:09,578 --> 00:12:12,412
Okay. I'll mush some up
and put it on the floor

323
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:14,314
next to the trash,
if you get hungry.

324
00:12:14,349 --> 00:12:16,249
I think you bought
girl running shoes.

325
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:17,851
You know, in case
any of you want to,

326
00:12:17,886 --> 00:12:19,186
uh, come cheer us on,

327
00:12:19,221 --> 00:12:21,088
Chloe and I are doing
the Quahog Marathon

328
00:12:21,123 --> 00:12:22,189
in a couple weeks.

329
00:12:22,224 --> 00:12:23,423
A marathon?

330
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:25,759
But-but what if that sexy boy
has another bomb?

331
00:12:25,794 --> 00:12:28,261
Yeah, are you sure
you can finish a marathon?

332
00:12:28,297 --> 00:12:29,463
I'm not worried, Meg.

333
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,331
I'm just gonna give it
all I've got,

334
00:12:31,366 --> 00:12:33,667
like Scotty
engineering the<i> Enterprise.</i>

335
00:12:33,702 --> 00:12:35,102
(alarm blaring)

336
00:12:35,137 --> 00:12:36,603
Scotty, we need more speed!

337
00:12:36,638 --> 00:12:38,538
SCOTTY: <i>I'm giving her
all she's got, Captain!

338
00:12:38,574 --> 00:12:39,873
<i>She can't take any more!

339
00:12:39,908 --> 00:12:42,642
Damn. Chekov, reroute
auxiliary power to the helm.

340
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,144
<i>Scotty to bridge.

341
00:12:44,146 --> 00:12:47,547
<i>Uh... Captain, this uh...
this is a little embarrassing,

342
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,449
<i>but, uh, you know,
I've never noticed, uh,

343
00:12:49,485 --> 00:12:51,518
<i>the little lever
I've been pushing, it's...

344
00:12:51,553 --> 00:12:53,453
<i>it's only about two-thirds
of the way up.

345
00:12:53,489 --> 00:12:55,388
<i>I-I actually can give her more.

346
00:12:55,424 --> 00:12:56,424
That's great, Scotty!

347
00:12:56,425 --> 00:12:57,824
Mr. Spock, give us
readings on...

348
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,693
SCOTTY:
<i>Uh, C-Captain, Scotty again.

349
00:12:59,728 --> 00:13:01,361
<i>Y... You're not gonna
believe this.

350
00:13:01,396 --> 00:13:03,396
<i>Uh, there's another lever here, too.

351
00:13:03,432 --> 00:13:06,299
<i>The ship can literally go
three times as fast.

352
00:13:06,335 --> 00:13:07,701
<i>I...</i> (laughs)
<i>I'm sorry.

353
00:13:07,736 --> 00:13:09,936
<i>I feel like such a capital-J
jerk right now.

354
00:13:09,972 --> 00:13:11,037
It's okay, Scotty.

355
00:13:11,073 --> 00:13:13,106
Lieutenant Uhura,
open all channels for...

356
00:13:13,142 --> 00:13:15,809
<i>Captain, I've-I've got to, uh,
interrupt again.

357
00:13:15,844 --> 00:13:17,077
<i>I've just been thinking about

358
00:13:17,112 --> 00:13:18,879
<i>this-this "giving her
all she's got" thing.

359
00:13:18,914 --> 00:13:21,748
<i>I mean, I've been completely
wrong for years now.

360
00:13:21,784 --> 00:13:23,316
<i>I-I feel terrible.

361
00:13:23,352 --> 00:13:25,385
<i>I mean, think of how many
crises we've been in

362
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,454
<i>where the issue was
how fast we could go.

363
00:13:27,489 --> 00:13:29,756
<i>I-I mean... I'm sorry, Captain.

364
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:30,924
Scotty, it's okay.

365
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:31,992
<i>No, it's not!

366
00:13:32,027 --> 00:13:33,393
<i>Eric's dead!

367
00:13:33,428 --> 00:13:36,296
<i>At the funeral, I literally
said the words to his wife,

368
00:13:36,331 --> 00:13:37,898
<i>"I was giving her
all she's got."

369
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:39,266
Scotty, it's fine.

370
00:13:39,301 --> 00:13:40,301
Sulu, lock phasers...

371
00:13:40,302 --> 00:13:42,035
<i>Captain, I just
got to jump in here.

372
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,603
<i>W-We don't have enough
dilithium crystals

373
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:45,005
<i>to run the phasers.

374
00:13:46,475 --> 00:13:49,509
<i>I've-I've lost all credibility,
haven't I?

375
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:55,849
Peter, I think
we need to talk.

376
00:13:55,884 --> 00:13:57,584
You totally screwed up my book.

377
00:13:57,619 --> 00:13:59,753
You're getting kids to laugh
at handicapped people,

378
00:13:59,788 --> 00:14:01,588
when I'm trying to inspire them.

379
00:14:01,623 --> 00:14:03,423
I'm afraid you're
off the project.

380
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:04,458
What?

381
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:05,859
You can't kick me
off the project.

382
00:14:05,894 --> 00:14:06,960
I'm David Chicago!

383
00:14:06,995 --> 00:14:08,595
I'm the one who
wrote the book.

384
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,263
Joe, come on.
Let's not kid ourselves.

385
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:11,865
All right?
Everybody knows my face now.

386
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,767
And besides, I'm the only
one of the two of us

387
00:14:13,802 --> 00:14:15,535
who can do
a squirrel voice.

388
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:17,437
(high-pitched voice): Well, I don't know
if that's quite true.

389
00:14:17,472 --> 00:14:19,372
Joe, Joe, stop.
You're embarrassing yourself.

390
00:14:19,408 --> 00:14:21,842
Sorry, Joe, but
the publisher loves me.

391
00:14:21,877 --> 00:14:23,243
The public loves me.

392
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:24,377
I'm not going anywhere.

393
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:25,879
Screw you, Peter!
You know what?

394
00:14:25,914 --> 00:14:27,147
You've ruined this for me.

395
00:14:27,182 --> 00:14:28,915
I want nothing
to do with the book,

396
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,684
and I want nothing
to do with you!

397
00:14:32,721 --> 00:14:35,989
Aw, one of his shoes fell off
during the anger.

398
00:14:39,571 --> 00:14:41,704
(toilet flushes, door opens)

399
00:14:41,739 --> 00:14:44,607
Peter, Bonnie told me
that Joe's very upset.

400
00:14:44,642 --> 00:14:46,542
Did you really take
his book away from him?

401
00:14:46,578 --> 00:14:48,411
Did you just poop
and then get into bed

402
00:14:48,446 --> 00:14:49,446
without underwear on?

403
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,614
That book really
meant a lot to Joe.

404
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:53,149
I think you should
talk to him.

405
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,318
Hey, that book would've
been nothing without me.

406
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,153
And besides,
he's the one who quit.

407
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,888
Now the publisher
wants another book

408
00:14:58,923 --> 00:15:00,022
and it's all on me!

409
00:15:00,058 --> 00:15:02,325
I just hate to see
you two in a fight.

410
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,228
And on the same week
when my sister and I

411
00:15:05,263 --> 00:15:07,363
are having such
a big fight, too.

412
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:10,566
Good night, Lois.

413
00:15:14,906 --> 00:15:16,806
All right, guys.
Ideas, ideas.

414
00:15:16,841 --> 00:15:18,574
We got a Hopeful Squirrel
book to write.

415
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:19,909
All right, now,
who's got something?

416
00:15:19,944 --> 00:15:21,544
I-I got... I got something.

417
00:15:21,579 --> 00:15:25,848
What if the squirrel
has lasers...

418
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,483
that he shoots
out of his eyes!

419
00:15:27,518 --> 00:15:28,818
Quagmire's
on the board.

420
00:15:28,853 --> 00:15:31,053
And how 'bout
he got a frog friend

421
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:32,888
that's got some sort
of catchphrase?

422
00:15:32,924 --> 00:15:35,691
Like, if he's seeing something
kooky, he could be like,

423
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:39,262
"Damn, that's cray-cray
in a good way, right there!"

424
00:15:39,297 --> 00:15:40,630
Wow.

425
00:15:40,665 --> 00:15:42,331
God just speaks
right through you,

426
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:43,367
doesn't he, Cleveland?

427
00:15:43,368 --> 00:15:44,533
I believe he does.

428
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:45,835
Okay, what else,
what else?

429
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,304
If there's
a bison...

430
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:50,006
Is that a statement
or a question?

431
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:51,307
It is what it is.

432
00:15:51,342 --> 00:15:53,409
Ain't nothing gotta
be nothing, huh?

433
00:15:57,015 --> 00:15:59,455
BRIAN: Hey, Stewie! Can you come
in the bathroom for a second?

434
00:15:59,484 --> 00:16:00,783
(sighs)

435
00:16:00,818 --> 00:16:03,052
What is it, Bri...
Oh, my God!

436
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,687
Hey, could you
close the gate?

437
00:16:04,722 --> 00:16:07,456
Couple of calves
got loose. Ha, pow!

438
00:16:07,492 --> 00:16:09,225
Brian, you're all sinewy.

439
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,927
Your whole body looks like
Paul McCartney's neck.

440
00:16:11,963 --> 00:16:13,663
- Thanks.
- That's not a compliment.

441
00:16:13,698 --> 00:16:14,698
You look terrible.

442
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:16,098
What does your
girlfriend think of this?

443
00:16:16,134 --> 00:16:17,967
I dumped her; she
couldn't keep up with me.

444
00:16:18,002 --> 00:16:19,602
Hey, grab me some more
Band-Aids, will you?

445
00:16:19,637 --> 00:16:20,870
I got, like, eight
more nipples

446
00:16:20,905 --> 00:16:22,338
to cover up
before my run.

447
00:16:22,373 --> 00:16:25,975
You know, whatever you're doing,
it isn't healthy, Brian.

448
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,343
Oh, I'm not healthy?

449
00:16:27,378 --> 00:16:30,012
Stewie, my heart rate is
down to four beats a minute.

450
00:16:30,048 --> 00:16:31,614
Besides, I got
to keep training.

451
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:33,182
The marathon's
in two days.

452
00:16:33,217 --> 00:16:36,052
Brian, I-I'm worried you're
losing yourself in all this.

453
00:16:36,087 --> 00:16:37,553
Do you remember that phase

454
00:16:37,588 --> 00:16:39,522
when you thought
you were a pointer dog?

455
00:16:39,557 --> 00:16:41,891
Was someone wearing
my new high heels?

456
00:16:43,328 --> 00:16:44,827
You dick.

457
00:16:51,936 --> 00:16:54,303
(dramatic music playing)

458
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:55,838
QUAGMIRE (over P.A. system):
Ladies and gentlemen,

459
00:16:55,873 --> 00:16:57,373
boys and girls,

460
00:16:57,408 --> 00:16:59,408
hot moms who are married
but looking...

461
00:17:00,445 --> 00:17:03,145
David Chicago!

462
00:17:03,181 --> 00:17:05,915
(crowd cheering)

463
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:09,051
Hey, how many of
y'all bitches like to read?

464
00:17:09,087 --> 00:17:11,320
(cheering)

465
00:17:13,191 --> 00:17:14,523
"Chapter One.

466
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,292
"It was winter in the forest,

467
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:19,462
"so the squirrel was happy
he'd built that hot tub.

468
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:23,032
"But little did he know,
a strain of super gonorrhea

469
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:24,667

470
00:17:24,702 --> 00:17:28,070

00:17:28,106 --> 00:17:30,573
"On top of that,
some son of a bitch

472
00:17:30,608 --> 00:17:32,241
killed his brother."

473
00:17:34,078 --> 00:17:35,811
"The monkey's
kick-ass buzz saw hand tore his head open.

474
00:17:37,315 --> 00:17:40,449
"'His brains, his brains--
they're everywhere!'

475
00:17:40,485 --> 00:17:42,284
the little girl yelled."

476
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,754
CLEVELAND: "'Damn, that's cray-cray
in a good way, right there!'"

477
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:47,089
"...exclaimed
Billy the Bullfrog."

478
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:50,292
"The woodchuck mom and her baby
finished their cocoa

479
00:17:50,328 --> 00:17:52,895
"and then tucked in
for another cozy night.

480
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,197
But then..."

481
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:58,067
"'Nothing but cops on the take
and hookers on the make,'

482
00:17:58,102 --> 00:17:59,568

00:18:06,144 --> 00:18:08,310
The end."

487
00:18:09,647 --> 00:18:11,480
- You're awful.
- That was the worst.

488
00:18:11,516 --> 00:18:13,182
We had trouble hearing
you in the back.

489
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,255
I'm sorry, Peter,
you're fired.

490
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:22,558
I'm sorry Joe's dream
didn't work out for you, Peter.

491
00:18:22,593 --> 00:18:24,660
(sighs)
What was I thinking?

492
00:18:24,695 --> 00:18:26,796
Joe's the one with
all the talent.

493
00:18:26,831 --> 00:18:28,364
Me trying to
write a book

494
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:31,100
is like CeeLo trying to
find a pair of pants.

495
00:18:31,135 --> 00:18:34,970
Yeah, I need to find something
a cartoon apple would wear.

496
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,910
Hey, you made it!

497
00:18:40,945 --> 00:18:42,812
So you ready to watch
me kick some ass?

498
00:18:42,847 --> 00:18:44,980
Brian, I think you've taken
all of this too far.

499
00:18:45,016 --> 00:18:47,550
You know, there is such a thing
as too much exercise.

500
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,285
Stewie, I know you're
worried, all right?

501
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,153
And no offense, but
I'm not taking advice

502
00:18:51,189 --> 00:18:52,655
from a guy
who eats bread.

503
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,356
ANNOUNCER:
Runners, take your marks!

504
00:18:54,392 --> 00:18:56,859
(crowd cheering)

505
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:05,201
(screams)
Oh, son of a bitch!

506
00:19:05,236 --> 00:19:06,702
Ow, my leg!

507
00:19:06,737 --> 00:19:08,304
Help me, somebody!

508
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:10,339
(grunting, groaning)

509
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:18,848
Brian, why does everything
you touch turn to garbage?

510
00:19:25,857 --> 00:19:26,857
Peter.

511
00:19:26,891 --> 00:19:28,924
Look, Joe,
I messed up.

512
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,593
All right? I just...

513
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:33,629
I just got so wrapped up
in all the attention.

514
00:19:33,664 --> 00:19:36,198
The attention
you deserved.

515
00:19:36,234 --> 00:19:37,967
I know how much
this meant to you,

516
00:19:38,002 --> 00:19:40,369
and I... I should've
just stayed out of it.

517
00:19:40,404 --> 00:19:42,371
Listen, I'm...

518
00:19:42,406 --> 00:19:45,241
I'm sorry
I mistreated you.

519
00:19:45,276 --> 00:19:47,877
Okay?
You deserve better.

520
00:19:47,912 --> 00:19:49,411
Peter, wait.

521
00:19:49,447 --> 00:19:51,780
If I could
not forgive,

522
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,949
then I would be
truly handicapped.

523
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:54,985
What?

524
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:56,218
It's from the
book, Peter.

525
00:19:56,254 --> 00:19:57,254
What book?

526
00:19:57,255 --> 00:19:58,387
I forgive you, Peter.

527
00:19:58,422 --> 00:19:59,422
You do?

528
00:19:59,423 --> 00:20:01,257
Yeah.  The truth is,

529
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:03,025
I never would have
had the confidence

530
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,894
to get my book published
in the first place.

531
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:06,695
And that's all I ever wanted.

532
00:20:06,731 --> 00:20:08,297
Friends?

533
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,232
Frasier.

534
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,405
So, Bri, how's
that ankle itch?

535
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,506
Well, what
do you mean?

536
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:18,807
I'm just saying,
you probably have

537
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,342
an itchy ankle
under that cast.

538
00:20:20,378 --> 00:20:21,610
It starts as a tickle

539
00:20:21,646 --> 00:20:22,966
and then you can't
quite reach it?

540
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,580
- Not gonna work, Stewie.
- Yes, you're right.

541
00:20:24,615 --> 00:20:25,814
Best not
to think about it.

542
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,416
Even though it might
be a little bug

543
00:20:27,451 --> 00:20:29,151
digging away
down there,

544
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,686
just nagging
and itching and...

545
00:20:30,721 --> 00:20:32,621
Ah, ah, crap,
I did it to myself!

546
00:20:32,657 --> 00:20:34,423
Ah, what is that?

547
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,892
Well, Peter, I'm glad
you made up with Joe.

548
00:20:36,928 --> 00:20:38,260
Yeah, me, too.

549
00:20:38,296 --> 00:20:40,062
It just goes
to show you, Lois,

550
00:20:40,097 --> 00:20:41,864
books is bad news.

551
00:20:41,899 --> 00:20:44,199
Well, except for the books
they sell at Urban Outfitters.

552
00:20:44,235 --> 00:20:46,951
<i>The Single Girls'</i>
<i>Guide to Happy Hour.</i>

553
00:20:47,117 --> 00:20:49,165
<i>Dogs Who Look</i>
<i>Like Presidents.</i>

554
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:52,267
This one's just pictures
of people reacting to farts.

555
00:20:52,499 --> 00:20:54,651
I like where
the USA is headed.
