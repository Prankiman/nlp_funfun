00:00:01,254 --> 00:00:06,098
<i>Family Guy
No Chris Left Behind</i>

2
00:00:33,818 --> 00:00:36,157
We now return
to How I Met Your Father.

3
00:00:36,158 --> 00:00:39,496
Oh, Barney, I'm never going to meet
the right girl and get married.

4
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:42,720
You know, Ted, don't you think
it's kinda strange for a guy in his 20s

5
00:00:42,721 --> 00:00:45,737
to always be talking about getting
married rather than getting laid?

6
00:00:46,424 --> 00:00:47,287
Barney,

7
00:00:47,607 --> 00:00:48,806
I'm in love with you.

8
00:00:49,926 --> 00:00:51,100
Suit up.

9
00:00:53,483 --> 00:00:56,966
All right, come on, everyone.
Go get dressed. It's ballet night.

10
00:00:58,594 --> 00:01:00,993
Lois, don't freakin'
put me through this again.

11
00:01:00,998 --> 00:01:03,523
Peter, a little culture
is good for this family.

12
00:01:03,529 --> 00:01:05,800
Besides, you liked
The Nutcracker, didn't you?

13
00:01:05,807 --> 00:01:07,380
No, Lois, I did not.

14
00:01:07,395 --> 00:01:09,970
The Nutcracker
had zero physical comedy.

15
00:01:09,975 --> 00:01:12,063
And with a name like
The Nutcracker I thought,

16
00:01:12,075 --> 00:01:14,562
"Oh, this will be worth
a few yuks," but no, Lois,

17
00:01:14,605 --> 00:01:18,310
that title wrote a check that those
queers on stage refused to cash.

18
00:01:18,316 --> 00:01:19,670
Peter, we're going.

19
00:01:19,676 --> 00:01:22,912
Well, we're not the first people
to be dragged off against our will.

20
00:01:23,055 --> 00:01:24,561
- Are we there yet?
- No!

21
00:01:24,568 --> 00:01:26,033
- Are we there yet?
- No!

22
00:01:26,035 --> 00:01:26,931
Are we there yet?

23
00:01:26,938 --> 00:01:29,520
Damn it! I swear to God
I will turn this ship around!

24
00:01:30,195 --> 00:01:32,690
- That works. - It'll teach us a lesson.
- Yeah, that's even better.

25
00:01:32,697 --> 00:01:35,613
All right, if that's what you...
Wait a minute!

26
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:45,930
You know, Meg, female ballet dancers
are famous for anorexia and bulimia.

27
00:01:46,615 --> 00:01:49,680
And, uh, it seems
to work out for them, so...

28
00:01:50,405 --> 00:01:51,960
hintity, hint-hint.

29
00:01:51,996 --> 00:01:53,512
Boy, this is gonna be long.

30
00:01:53,618 --> 00:01:57,820
So, uh, you kids develop any good
pot connections at your school yet?

31
00:01:57,825 --> 00:01:59,251
- What? - Yeah.
- Ah.

32
00:01:59,265 --> 00:02:02,561
Lois, we'll be right back.
Meg's gonna take me outside to poop.

33
00:02:20,067 --> 00:02:20,670
<i>Hello.</i>

34
00:02:20,677 --> 00:02:21,792
Hey, Quagmire.

35
00:02:21,795 --> 00:02:22,871
<i>Hey, Peter, what's up?</i>

36
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:24,760
I'm stuck at the stupid ballet.

37
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:26,113
<i>Get out of here. You serious?</i>

38
00:02:26,115 --> 00:02:27,240
- Yeah.
- So am I.

39
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:27,961
What?

40
00:02:27,965 --> 00:02:30,280
<i>Yeah, I got dragged here
by this broad I'm trying to screw.</i>

41
00:02:30,286 --> 00:02:31,160
Where you sitting?

42
00:02:31,168 --> 00:02:33,212
<i>Look across at the other
balcony. I can see you.</i>

43
00:02:35,297 --> 00:02:37,722
Oh, my God! What do we do?!
What do we do?! We're both here.

44
00:02:37,728 --> 00:02:40,061
Oh, my God! We should text each other!
Hang up! Hang up!

45
00:02:59,406 --> 00:03:02,851
Chris, how many times have I told you
no reading during meals?

46
00:03:02,858 --> 00:03:04,692
I have a history test today, Mom,

47
00:03:04,706 --> 00:03:08,071
and I couldn't study last night
because you made us go to the ballet.

48
00:03:09,017 --> 00:03:13,442
Well, Chris, you're not gonna learn any history from this.
This textbook is from 1948.

49
00:03:13,448 --> 00:03:15,171
- What?
- Chapter 3:

50
00:03:15,177 --> 00:03:18,370
"Youth culture rebels with
Big Band music."

51
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,661
Let me see that.

52
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:23,860
"Israel, the brand-new country
everyone's gonna love."

53
00:03:23,876 --> 00:03:25,562
What the hell? Are the schools
so underfunded

54
00:03:25,566 --> 00:03:27,832
that they can't afford text books
from this century?

55
00:03:27,835 --> 00:03:31,110
Well, I am going to raise hell about this
at the next PTA meeting.

56
00:03:31,118 --> 00:03:33,862
Well, let me know if you need help.
I can be very persuasive.

57
00:03:33,868 --> 00:03:36,703
I gave the next speech after
the Braveheart guy.

58
00:03:36,785 --> 00:03:40,562
They can take our lives,
but they can never take

59
00:03:40,566 --> 00:03:42,441
our freedom!

60
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:45,412
And... and...

61
00:03:45,415 --> 00:03:47,863
Let's not forget the tax
they levied on properties

62
00:03:47,866 --> 00:03:49,900
that are in abutment of church lands.

63
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,822
So, yeah, let's do it.

64
00:03:58,748 --> 00:04:00,840
All right, let's get
this meeting underway.

65
00:04:00,845 --> 00:04:03,833
For our first order of business,
we'll go to Bruce.

66
00:04:03,836 --> 00:04:06,441
Well, hey, y'all said my name.

67
00:04:06,448 --> 00:04:08,953
Welcome to our meeting
here at the school.

68
00:04:08,976 --> 00:04:11,623
We got lots of exciting
topics here tonight.

69
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,870
We gonna have a puppet show.
We gonna have some jazz.

70
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:16,290
No, I'm just kidding.

71
00:04:16,295 --> 00:04:18,823
We have some business
to take care of, though.

72
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:20,901
I'm sorry I pulled y'all's legs.

73
00:04:20,905 --> 00:04:24,662
I'm just a little excited
'cause I met somebody today.

74
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:26,683
Someone in the bookstore.

75
00:04:26,727 --> 00:04:30,050
Someone who likes the same
kind of literature as I do.

76
00:04:30,057 --> 00:04:32,700
Oh, and the adventure begins again.

77
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,411
Excuse me, Principal Shepherd

78
00:04:34,418 --> 00:04:36,011
There's something I'd like to discuss.

79
00:04:36,016 --> 00:04:38,663
The school has gone too far
with these budget cuts.

80
00:04:38,668 --> 00:04:41,700
I'm sorry, Mrs. Griffin,
but the "No Child Left Behind" law

81
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:45,451
cost us our federal funding because
our students' test scores were too low.

82
00:04:45,456 --> 00:04:48,731
They cut a school's funding
if it's got low test scores?

83
00:04:48,775 --> 00:04:51,622
This is not what the founding
fathers had in mind.

84
00:04:51,747 --> 00:04:55,313
Okay, we're here to sign
this declaration of our independence.

85
00:04:55,318 --> 00:04:56,873
Let's take roll call first.

86
00:04:56,877 --> 00:04:58,363
<i>- Thomas Jefferson?
- Here.</i>

87
00:04:58,367 --> 00:04:59,993
<i>- Benjamin Franklin.
- Here.</i>

88
00:04:59,996 --> 00:05:02,553
<i>- John Footpenis?
- It's Hancock now.</i>

89
00:05:02,555 --> 00:05:04,650
<i>- Why?
- Mind your business. That's why.</i>

90
00:05:04,848 --> 00:05:08,553
Well, somehow this school needs
to raise its test scores right away.

91
00:05:08,556 --> 00:05:12,542
I suppose there is one thing I can do
to raise the school's test average.

92
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:13,563
Then do it.

93
00:05:13,566 --> 00:05:16,652
All right, we'll drop
the dumbest student we have:

94
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:19,513
Chris Griffin is hereby expelled.

95
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:23,091
But if I leave now,
I won't hear who's the dumbest kid in the school.

96
00:05:27,128 --> 00:05:29,472
Cool, I don't have to go to school.

97
00:05:29,477 --> 00:05:31,923
I can just pee in my bed all day.

98
00:05:31,925 --> 00:05:34,293
Chris, being expelled is a serious thing.

99
00:05:34,326 --> 00:05:36,513
Peter, we've got to find
another school for him.

100
00:05:36,517 --> 00:05:38,181
I say, I could home-school him.

101
00:05:38,188 --> 00:05:40,650
After all, I taught Cleveland how to make Jiffy Pop.

102
00:05:50,566 --> 00:05:52,960
So do you think your school
would be right for Chris?

103
00:05:52,975 --> 00:05:54,321
Oh, absolutely.

104
00:05:54,326 --> 00:05:56,932
Quahog School
for the Deaf has great programs,

105
00:05:56,938 --> 00:05:58,583
both academic and athletic.

106
00:05:58,626 --> 00:06:01,631
In fact, you're just in time
for our homecoming pep rally.

107
00:06:01,677 --> 00:06:04,000
What are we gonna do to Lincoln?!

108
00:06:04,007 --> 00:06:05,273
<i>Kill them!</i>

109
00:06:05,306 --> 00:06:07,350
I can't hear you!

110
00:06:07,357 --> 00:06:08,543
<i>Kill them!</i>

111
00:06:08,545 --> 00:06:10,740
I can't hear you!

112
00:06:10,748 --> 00:06:11,883
<i>Kill them!</i>

113
00:06:11,926 --> 00:06:14,101
I can't hear you!

114
00:06:14,146 --> 00:06:15,353
<i>Kill them!</i>

115
00:06:15,388 --> 00:06:17,282
I can't hear you!

116
00:06:17,328 --> 00:06:18,551
<i>Kill them!</i>

117
00:06:18,718 --> 00:06:19,900
Let's just go.

118
00:06:22,977 --> 00:06:25,542
Welcome to the Quahog
Maritime School, Chris.

119
00:06:25,576 --> 00:06:27,780
Our curriculum consists of being on boats

120
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:32,342
for long periods of time with men,
just men for many days at a time.

121
00:06:32,345 --> 00:06:36,340
Up on the deck with lots of men
or down in the galley with lots of men.

122
00:06:36,348 --> 00:06:38,410
Is this some kind of pirate school?

123
00:06:38,415 --> 00:06:42,122
Well, a certain kind of pirate.
Yes, we've been called that.

124
00:06:42,128 --> 00:06:43,220
I don't know.

125
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:45,370
Is there some kind of preschool program?

126
00:06:48,357 --> 00:06:51,703
You know, I have to admit I've always
been a little worried about Chris, but

127
00:06:51,706 --> 00:06:55,133
I guess I just convinced myself
things would work out for him,

128
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:58,440
but with no education, what kind
of future can he possibly have?

129
00:06:58,445 --> 00:06:59,893
What are we supposed to do, Lois?

130
00:06:59,896 --> 00:07:01,930
I mean, it's not like the high school
will take him back.

131
00:07:01,976 --> 00:07:04,141
And every other school
we've tried just doesn't...

132
00:07:04,726 --> 00:07:05,973
Oh, crap!

133
00:09:02,096 --> 00:09:03,601
My son got into DeVry.

134
00:09:03,646 --> 00:09:06,410
Ah, good.
What'd he have to do,open the door?

135
00:09:07,288 --> 00:09:09,162
Can't you let me have anything?

136
00:09:59,758 --> 00:10:02,002
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hang on. Hang on.

137
00:10:02,506 --> 00:10:03,513
What are we fighting about?

138
00:10:04,368 --> 00:10:06,653
You know, I have completely forgotten.

139
00:10:06,656 --> 00:10:08,733
- Me, too.
- Something about a coupon. It's all...

140
00:10:08,735 --> 00:10:12,183
- I cannot for the life of me remember.
- Oh, my God, that's ridiculous.

141
00:10:12,185 --> 00:10:14,360
You know what?
I-I just... I hope I didn't hurt you.

142
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,156
No, no, no.
I... I'm all right. I'm all right..

143
00:10:16,814 --> 00:10:18,803
But listen, you know what?
Let me make it up to you.

144
00:10:18,848 --> 00:10:21,173
Why don't you let my wife and
I take you out to dinner?

145
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:23,203
Well, that sounds lovely.

146
00:10:25,296 --> 00:10:27,141
Uh, that was delicious.

147
00:10:27,146 --> 00:10:29,020
You know, I drive
by this place all the time

148
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:31,000
and I've never been inside;
isn't that funny?

149
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,830
Y-Yeah, you know, Nicole and I
came here by accident.

150
00:10:33,838 --> 00:10:37,153
W-We had reservations at another place
and they... right, right, honey?

151
00:10:37,157 --> 00:10:39,712
Yeah, they couldn't seat us for like
an hour, so we ended up coming here

152
00:10:39,716 --> 00:10:40,951
- and we just loved it.
- Loved it.

153
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,682
I can see why. I mean,
th-that halibut was...

154
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,003
that, may have been the best
halibut I've ever had.

155
00:10:46,007 --> 00:10:47,850
Well, glad we talked you out
of the pork chops, huh?

156
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,432
Yes! Thank you!

157
00:10:50,788 --> 00:10:52,780
Oh, oh, oh, lemme, lemme,let me...
I-I'll get that.

158
00:10:52,805 --> 00:10:54,132
Oh, no, no, no,no, no, I got it.

159
00:10:54,135 --> 00:10:55,881
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm taking care of this.

160
00:10:55,885 --> 00:10:58,001
No, no, no, your money's
no good here.

161
00:10:58,005 --> 00:11:00,152
My food was more expensive.
I feel bad. If I...

162
00:11:00,157 --> 00:11:01,950
We invited you. I've got this.

163
00:11:01,957 --> 00:11:04,441
- Look, just let goof the check, huh.
- You let go of the check.

164
00:11:04,448 --> 00:11:07,381
- I'm not taking my hand off this thing.
- Well, neither am I.

165
00:11:07,766 --> 00:11:09,362
Let go of the check.

166
00:11:09,365 --> 00:11:11,141
- Ernie, if he wants to...
- Stay out of this!

167
00:11:11,147 --> 00:11:12,460
Don't you talk to my wife like that!

168
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:14,220
Oh, yeah?
What are you gonna do about it?

169
00:12:17,315 --> 00:12:18,342
Sorry.

170
00:12:18,587 --> 00:12:22,080
And every other school we've tried just
doesn't seem to be a good fit for Chris.

171
00:12:22,128 --> 00:12:24,321
Well, there is one other option.

172
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,202
Daddy, there's something
I need you to do for me.

173
00:12:30,218 --> 00:12:32,902
Chris got expelled from
James Woods High, and,

174
00:12:32,936 --> 00:12:37,190
well, I was wondering if you could get him
into that fancy boarding school you went to.

175
00:12:37,197 --> 00:12:39,940
You want me to get Chris
into Morningwood Academy?

176
00:12:39,946 --> 00:12:42,082
It would mean so much to our family.

177
00:12:42,088 --> 00:12:44,710
All right, I'll pull some strings
on one condition:

178
00:12:44,756 --> 00:12:47,603
I want Peter to do something
really humiliating.

179
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:49,792
Well, what did you have in mind?

180
00:12:49,795 --> 00:12:54,851
He has to shoot and starin' a shot-for-shot
remake of Liar, Liar for my amusement.

181
00:12:55,016 --> 00:12:56,411
Do you know why I stopped you?

182
00:12:56,425 --> 00:12:58,632
I didn't fasten my seat belt.
I didn't look in my rear view mirror.

183
00:12:58,638 --> 00:13:00,912
I didn't signal when I pulled away
from the curb. I almost hit a Chevy.

184
00:13:00,917 --> 00:13:02,522
I changed lanes in the intersection
without signaling.

185
00:13:02,527 --> 00:13:05,523
I changed lanes while running
a red light and speeding!

186
00:13:15,017 --> 00:13:16,473
Well, Chris, here we are.

187
00:13:16,475 --> 00:13:18,851
Wow, this school is really nice.

188
00:13:18,855 --> 00:13:21,742
Boy, a degree from here
would set you up with any job you wanted.

189
00:13:21,747 --> 00:13:23,861
Yes, I should attend this institution.

190
00:13:23,866 --> 00:13:26,960
Perhaps one day I could be more powerful
than King Friday.

191
00:13:26,977 --> 00:13:30,051
I am the supreme ruler of the
Neighborhood of Make Believe.

192
00:13:30,057 --> 00:13:31,700
All will kneel before my...

193
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:36,513
What kind of freakin' king lives
next to the train tracks?

194
00:13:36,536 --> 00:13:37,962
What is this, Mexico?

195
00:13:41,648 --> 00:13:44,051
Hi. Is this room 214?

196
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:47,622
Oh, you must be our new dorm mate.
I'm Rogers Chapstick,

197
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:49,603
heir to the Chapstick fortune.

198
00:13:49,607 --> 00:13:53,311
And this is Virgil MasterCard,
heir to the MasterCard fortune.

199
00:13:53,315 --> 00:13:58,293
Oh, yes, yes,how do you do, sirrrr?

200
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:02,313
And this is James Bottomtooth, IV.

201
00:14:04,418 --> 00:14:08,920
- Uh... I'm Chris.
- Let me get those bags for you. Johann?

202
00:14:13,268 --> 00:14:17,461
Um, oh, dear. Johann tells me your
luggage is the luggage of the poor.

203
00:14:17,467 --> 00:14:19,683
Well... I am poor.

204
00:14:19,866 --> 00:14:21,110
Oh.

205
00:14:21,186 --> 00:14:22,403
Oh, I see.

206
00:14:34,138 --> 00:14:34,981
What the...?

207
00:14:38,376 --> 00:14:40,212
This school is not for your kind!

208
00:14:40,248 --> 00:14:41,412
Why?!

209
00:14:44,605 --> 00:14:47,260
I still don't fully understand!

210
00:14:55,425 --> 00:14:58,383
...and that was the third time
I slept with Katherine Harris.

211
00:14:58,395 --> 00:15:01,812
Well, I love her politics,
but how is she in bed?

212
00:15:01,815 --> 00:15:05,720
Well, as anyone in Florida will tell you,
she knows how to rig an erection.

213
00:15:09,498 --> 00:15:14,121
One time I picked my nose and I swear
I could feel the bottom of my eye.

214
00:15:14,126 --> 00:15:17,022
- Shut up, poor kid.
- No, I'm serious. Look!

215
00:15:23,236 --> 00:15:25,250
So, Chris, how's the new school?

216
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,370
It's awful. I hate it!

217
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:30,001
Everybody's mean to me because I'm not rich.

218
00:15:30,008 --> 00:15:32,172
Oh, no, Chris, that's horrible.

219
00:15:32,175 --> 00:15:33,721
All right, look,I'll tell you what.

220
00:15:33,727 --> 00:15:36,632
I'll call Daddy and I'll see
if there's anything he can do.

221
00:15:40,508 --> 00:15:42,303
Well, that's enough fun for one day.

222
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:45,572
I'm sweating more than a non-legacy
applying to Yale.

223
00:16:10,047 --> 00:16:11,242
Where am I?

224
00:16:12,696 --> 00:16:13,620
Grandpa?

225
00:16:13,628 --> 00:16:15,062
What are you doing here?

226
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:18,361
Chris, welcome to the
Skull and Bones Society.

227
00:16:18,396 --> 00:16:22,080
This is where the most powerful men in
the world are groomed for their futures.

228
00:16:22,087 --> 00:16:26,250
Every president, every CEO,
every douchebag named Ryan Seacrest.

229
00:16:26,257 --> 00:16:30,063
The Skull and Bones Society
has been a part of my family for decades,

230
00:16:30,088 --> 00:16:32,073
and we want you to become a member.

231
00:16:32,077 --> 00:16:34,460
Really? Wow, cool!

232
00:16:34,468 --> 00:16:37,092
Excellent. You get your
own stock portfolio,

233
00:16:37,095 --> 00:16:39,082
a percentage of the 9/11 Victims' Fund,

234
00:16:39,187 --> 00:16:41,481
And the best medical care on the planet.

235
00:16:41,487 --> 00:16:43,433
You'll be kept as healthy as a horse.

236
00:16:44,226 --> 00:16:47,763
- So, how's that leg doing?
- Great. Great. Never better.

237
00:16:47,776 --> 00:16:49,872
Good. Why don't you try putting
some weight on it?

238
00:16:49,887 --> 00:16:50,923
Eh, sure.

239
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:54,062
Yes! Yes!
Oh, that's good.

240
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:56,040
That feels good.
Very strong.

241
00:16:56,075 --> 00:16:58,612
Sorry, Thunder, I gotta put you down.

242
00:16:59,777 --> 00:17:00,960
How's your leg, huh?!

243
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:02,583
How's your leg?! You ready to race?!

244
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:10,771
<i>We now return to Japanese Girls</i>

245
00:17:10,808 --> 00:17:13,112
<i>Think Small Versions of Things
Are Really Cute.</i>

246
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:16,992
Oh, look at my tiny dog.
I'm gonna put it in my tiny purse.

247
00:17:18,135 --> 00:17:19,142
Tiny phone!

248
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:20,561
Tiny everything!

249
00:17:22,856 --> 00:17:25,042
Peter, have you seen this tuition bill?

250
00:17:25,046 --> 00:17:28,183
Morningwood Academy
is charging us $30,000.

251
00:17:28,216 --> 00:17:30,942
Well, looks like we're all gonna
have to take second jobs.

252
00:17:30,985 --> 00:17:34,861
I guess I'll see if I can get my old gig back
selling buttscratchers at the ballpark.

253
00:17:34,907 --> 00:17:38,441
Buttscratcher! Buttscratcher!
Get your buttscratcher here!

254
00:17:38,446 --> 00:17:40,330
- Buttscratcher!
- Buttscratcher.

255
00:17:40,368 --> 00:17:42,191
- Buttscratcher!
- Buttscratcher!

256
00:17:42,238 --> 00:17:43,472
Buttscratcher!

257
00:17:43,478 --> 00:17:45,441
<i>- Buttscratcher!
- Buttscratcher!</i>

258
00:17:50,026 --> 00:17:51,590
Chris, come here. You'll love this.

259
00:17:51,598 --> 00:17:53,443
The first Thursday of every month

260
00:17:53,446 --> 00:17:56,811
we go to a local orphanage, pick out
a kid, fill out all the paperwork

261
00:17:56,817 --> 00:17:59,083
and then don't take him home.
It's hilarious.

262
00:17:59,087 --> 00:18:00,801
That sounds kind of cruel.

263
00:18:00,806 --> 00:18:02,331
No, no, you'll love it.It's great.

264
00:18:04,806 --> 00:18:08,392
Come on. Come on in.
Your family's waiting in here.

265
00:18:08,438 --> 00:18:10,622
There are toys. And a puppy.

266
00:18:10,628 --> 00:18:14,102
And food that's not served
from warming trays.

267
00:18:16,665 --> 00:18:18,261
Come on.You gotta want it.

268
00:18:19,338 --> 00:18:21,193
Ah, you gotta do better than that.

269
00:18:21,296 --> 00:18:25,013
Okay, I guess you don't want a new
family, toys, and a puppy.

270
00:18:30,135 --> 00:18:32,161
Hi, everybody, I'm home.

271
00:18:32,165 --> 00:18:33,383
- Hi, Chris.
- Hello.Hey, how are you?

272
00:18:33,385 --> 00:18:35,511
Well, tell us everything,sweetie.

273
00:18:35,525 --> 00:18:37,000
How's school going so far?

274
00:18:37,006 --> 00:18:38,231
It's great, Mom.

275
00:18:38,238 --> 00:18:41,173
I got powerful connections now,
thanks to Grandpa.

276
00:18:41,196 --> 00:18:45,413
Chris, I'd give you a hug, but I'm exhausted from
working two jobs to pay your tuition.

277
00:18:45,515 --> 00:18:46,903
I've been selling buttscratchers.

278
00:18:46,908 --> 00:18:48,641
- Buttscratcher!
- No, Peter.

279
00:18:48,645 --> 00:18:50,433
- Buttscratcher!
- Peter, no.

280
00:18:50,438 --> 00:18:52,001
- Buttscratcher!
- No!

281
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,862
Buttscratcher...

282
00:18:53,888 --> 00:18:54,920
Dad, you...

283
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:58,091
You got an extra job just
to put me through school?

284
00:18:58,098 --> 00:18:59,372
We all did, Chris.

285
00:18:59,387 --> 00:19:01,093
Meg and I have been working nights.

286
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:04,390
I'll take the one on the right.

287
00:19:04,428 --> 00:19:07,022
Well, once again, Meg, I'll be back in an hour.

288
00:19:07,427 --> 00:19:10,641
And I got a job following fat people
around with a tuba.

289
00:19:14,177 --> 00:19:15,171
Stop it.

290
00:19:16,278 --> 00:19:17,180
Cut it out

291
00:19:17,805 --> 00:19:20,312
I have a glandular problem.

292
00:19:21,836 --> 00:19:23,181
That'll be $60.

293
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,500
You wanted to see me, Grandpa?

294
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,910
Yes, Chris.
Your pledge period is over.

295
00:19:35,918 --> 00:19:39,612
The Skull and Bones elders
are now ready to admit you to our ranks.

296
00:19:39,655 --> 00:19:42,040
As is customary with all our new members,

297
00:19:42,046 --> 00:19:45,833
you now have to spend seven minutes in
the closet with our most senior member.

298
00:19:45,838 --> 00:19:49,161
We don't start the clock until the door closes.

299
00:19:49,165 --> 00:19:51,880
You know, Grandpa, I don't think
I want to go through with it.

300
00:19:51,897 --> 00:19:54,051
We all had to do it, Chris.
Now get in there.

301
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:56,930
No, I mean,
I think I want to go back to my old school.

302
00:19:56,945 --> 00:20:01,272
My family's working so hard to pay
my tuition here, and I feel bad.

303
00:20:01,435 --> 00:20:04,891
Is there any way you can get me back
into James Woods High?

304
00:20:04,906 --> 00:20:07,320
Well, I suppose I could
pull some strings

305
00:20:07,357 --> 00:20:09,181
if that's really what you want, Chris.

306
00:20:09,188 --> 00:20:09,993
It is.

307
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:11,670
All right,consider it done.

308
00:20:11,686 --> 00:20:13,161
Thanks, Grandpa.

309
00:20:14,587 --> 00:20:15,852
Sorry, Master Herbert.

310
00:20:15,857 --> 00:20:20,031
Sorry? You better get your
ass in that closet, Pewterschmidt.

311
00:20:20,057 --> 00:20:21,111
Yes, sir.

312
00:20:21,977 --> 00:20:24,050
I am so tired of you.

313
00:20:27,865 --> 00:20:29,942
Ah, it's good to have you back, buddy.

314
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:30,901
Thanks, Dad.

315
00:20:30,907 --> 00:20:35,290
I didn't really fit in there anyway.
The rooms were only 15x20.

316
00:20:38,408 --> 00:20:41,453
If I didn't learn to laugh at myself,
I'd be dead right now.

317
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,802
Why don't you take your stuff up
to your room, Chris?

318
00:20:43,807 --> 00:20:44,993
Okay, Mom.

319
00:20:47,968 --> 00:20:49,042
Cut it out.

320
00:20:50,096 --> 00:20:52,070
I'm just trying to live my life.

321
00:20:52,598 --> 00:20:54,712
No one taught me about carbs.
