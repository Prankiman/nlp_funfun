1
00:00:03,289 --> 00:00:05,423
- What's wrong with the TV?
- Nothing, Chris.

2
00:00:05,468 --> 00:00:06,735
All the shows are
in widescreen now.

3
00:00:06,803 --> 00:00:08,654
So you can see all
the stuff on the sides

4
00:00:08,722 --> 00:00:09,848
that you
couldn't before.

5
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:12,102
We now return to <i>The Brady Bunch.</i>

6
00:00:12,126 --> 00:00:14,208
See, look.
Here's what you used to see.

7
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:15,300
Good night, Mike.

8
00:00:15,323 --> 00:00:16,333
Good night, Carol.

9
00:00:16,348 --> 00:00:18,163

21
00:01:02,024 --> 00:01:03,358
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.

22
00:01:03,426 --> 00:01:04,726
Diane can't be with us today.

23
00:01:04,794 --> 00:01:05,860
Where is Diane, Ollie?

24
00:01:05,928 --> 00:01:07,395
- She dead!
- Thanks, Ollie.

25
00:01:07,463 --> 00:01:08,897
Yes, Diane is no longer with us.

26
00:01:08,964 --> 00:01:10,598
She was shot by
an unknown assailant,

27
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:13,218
after she herself committed
a series of gruesome murders.

28
00:01:13,285 --> 00:01:15,653
I'd like to welcome
our new co-anchor, Joyce Kinney.

29
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:17,255
- Welcome, Joyce.
- Thanks, Tom.

30
00:01:17,323 --> 00:01:19,791
Wow, you sound crazy nervous.

31
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:21,659
In local news,
there was a hit-and-run

32
00:01:21,727 --> 00:01:23,728
by a drunk driver today
at Quahog Park.

33
00:01:23,796 --> 00:01:24,996
Two children are missing.

34
00:01:26,098 --> 00:01:27,999
I was just there.

35
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:29,284
Oh, boy.

36
00:01:29,351 --> 00:01:30,885
Don't let Brian see this.

37
00:01:30,953 --> 00:01:32,871
It says here that Rush Limbaugh

38
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:34,689
will be signing books
at the Quahog Mall.

39
00:01:34,757 --> 00:01:36,291
I have very good hearing!

40
00:01:37,526 --> 00:01:38,593
He's awful.

41
00:01:38,661 --> 00:01:40,078
But I thought
Rush Limbaugh is

42
00:01:40,146 --> 00:01:42,430
a fictional character
played by Fred Savage.

43
00:01:42,498 --> 00:01:43,431
Where'd you
hear that?

44
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:44,449
Fox News.

45
00:01:44,517 --> 00:01:45,550
Then it's a lie.

46
00:01:45,634 --> 00:01:47,135
Everything Fox News
says is a lie.

47
00:01:47,203 --> 00:01:48,470
But this one's true, Mom.

48
00:01:48,537 --> 00:01:50,171
You saw it with your own eyes

49
00:01:50,222 --> 00:01:52,173
and then you reported it
on Fox News.

50
00:01:52,241 --> 00:01:55,677
Even true things, once said
on Fox News, become lies.

51
00:01:55,745 --> 00:01:57,078
Why's Limbaugh
coming here?

52
00:01:57,146 --> 00:02:00,248
Don't they have bookstores
at the Nazi fascist...

53
00:02:00,316 --> 00:02:02,817
fascist fat camp
where he, where he go...

54
00:02:02,885 --> 00:02:04,385
Where he...
Where he is a counselor?

55
00:02:04,453 --> 00:02:05,854
I tell you what, Brian,

56
00:02:05,921 --> 00:02:07,789
if you want, we'll give you
another crack at that.

57
00:02:07,857 --> 00:02:10,358
This guy single-handedly
set political discourse back

58
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:11,659
a hundred years.

59
00:02:11,727 --> 00:02:13,161
You know what?
I'm gonna go down there

60
00:02:13,228 --> 00:02:15,363
and give that bastard
Limbaugh a piece of my mind.

61
00:02:15,431 --> 00:02:18,333
But first I'm gonna sit here and
stare at this brown paper bag

62
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,268
I'm pretty sure has food in it.

63
00:02:24,673 --> 00:02:25,573
No!

64
00:02:25,641 --> 00:02:26,474
Ah, oh, well.

65
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:34,566
Look at him.

66
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,051
His side screwed up our country
for a generation.

67
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:38,286
I hate everything
about that man.

68
00:02:38,354 --> 00:02:39,888
I'm gonna go
tear him a new one.

69
00:02:39,955 --> 00:02:41,990
I'm gonna go find some
hardcover photography books

70
00:02:42,057 --> 00:02:45,059
of tasteful nudes.

71
00:02:45,127 --> 00:02:47,996
Oh, my God,
yes, that is tasteful!

72
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,034
Hey, my friend,
who should I make this out to?

73
00:02:53,102 --> 00:02:54,786
Listen, Limbaugh,
my name is Brian Griffin,

74
00:02:54,854 --> 00:02:56,721
and I have got
something to say to you.

75
00:02:56,789 --> 00:02:58,456
Our republic has
been bastardized

76
00:02:58,524 --> 00:03:00,558
and royally screwed up
thanks to you jackasses.

77
00:03:00,626 --> 00:03:01,593
You suck!

78
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,827
And you're terrible.

79
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:04,429
And... And
And you've div...

80
00:03:04,497 --> 00:03:06,331
You've been divorced
several times.

81
00:03:06,398 --> 00:03:08,433
Yes, uh, valid points
you're raising, my friend,

82
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:09,868
and I respect you
for raising them.

83
00:03:09,935 --> 00:03:11,386
But may I ask you a question?

84
00:03:11,453 --> 00:03:12,387
Okay.

85
00:03:12,454 --> 00:03:14,789
Have you ever read
anything I've written?

86
00:03:14,857 --> 00:03:16,291
Well, no, I haven't.

87
00:03:16,358 --> 00:03:18,092
But I've read things
other people have written

88
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,295
about the things you've written,
and I do not approve

89
00:03:20,362 --> 00:03:21,763
of the things
I've read from others

90
00:03:21,831 --> 00:03:23,164
about the things
they've read from you.

91
00:03:23,232 --> 00:03:24,365
Not one bit, sir.

92
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,935
For crying out loud, Brian,
read my book.

93
00:03:27,002 --> 00:03:28,269
Judge for yourself.

94
00:03:28,337 --> 00:03:31,539
I'd sooner spend a night
watching European porn.

95
00:03:31,607 --> 00:03:33,675
- <i>Provo! Provo!</i>
- <i>Ah-shnork! Ah-shnork!</i>

96
00:03:33,742 --> 00:03:35,677
<i>Provo!</i>
<i>Ah-shnork!</i>

97
00:03:35,744 --> 00:03:38,112
- <i>Provo! Provo!</i>
- <i>Ah-shnork! Ah-shnork!</i>

98
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,148
- <i>Kaloooooof!</i>
- <i>A'gerta!</i>

99
00:03:43,853 --> 00:03:46,087
Stupid right-wing dick.

100
00:03:46,154 --> 00:03:47,956
Yeah, you... Hey, y...
You want to sign my book?

101
00:03:48,007 --> 00:03:50,441
Yeah, you can sign my ass book.

102
00:03:50,509 --> 00:03:52,177
Is what would've been
awesome to say.

103
00:03:55,664 --> 00:03:59,467
Oh, no. It's a multiracial
TV gang, including white guys.

104
00:03:59,535 --> 00:04:01,986
Well, well,
what do we got here?

105
00:04:02,054 --> 00:04:04,322
Let's beat him up,
but not because of his color,

106
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,424
'cause that doesn't
matter to us.

107
00:05:00,713 --> 00:05:01,713
Wow.

108
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,981
Thanks, Rush.

109
00:05:03,048 --> 00:05:04,465
Ah, it was nothing.
I mean, you'd have

110
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:05,433
done the same
thing for me.

111
00:05:05,501 --> 00:05:07,418
Uh, yeah, of course.

112
00:05:07,486 --> 00:05:09,454
Hey, you...
You dropped something.

113
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:11,422
You think you might
give it a read now?

114
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,524
Uh, well...

115
00:05:13,592 --> 00:05:15,710
What... What if I stick a piece
of bologna in the book,

116
00:05:15,778 --> 00:05:17,145
and I don't tell you which page?

117
00:05:17,212 --> 00:05:18,613
Would you read it, then, Brian?

118
00:05:18,681 --> 00:05:20,698
Would you read it to find
the page with the bologna?

119
00:05:20,766 --> 00:05:23,234
Okay, look, I'll read
four pages of your book tonight.

120
00:05:23,302 --> 00:05:24,302
All right?
Four pages.

121
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,370
That's it.

122
00:05:25,437 --> 00:05:27,105
And maybe more
if tonight's episode

123
00:05:27,172 --> 00:05:28,573
of <i>The Office</i>
ends up sucking.

124
00:05:32,778 --> 00:05:33,711
Four pages.
Done.

125
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:35,396
Moving on.

126
00:05:35,464 --> 00:05:38,516
I know my staplers
by sound and by weight.

127
00:05:38,584 --> 00:05:41,502
And that stapler, good sir,
is a "Schrute."

128
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,706
Ha! Look at John Krasinski
look at the camera.

129
00:05:44,773 --> 00:05:46,257
He can't believe
this guy!

130
00:05:47,793 --> 00:05:50,244
Aw, but there were gonna be
more hijinks in Scranton.

131
00:05:50,312 --> 00:05:52,230
Scranton.

132
00:05:52,298 --> 00:05:53,448
Dunder Mifflin.

133
00:05:54,616 --> 00:05:56,934
Funny words
are funny.

134
00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:15,336
Oh, my God.

135
00:06:15,404 --> 00:06:17,405
Rush Limbaugh
was right all along.

136
00:06:17,473 --> 00:06:20,408
Conservative Republicanism
is the answer.

137
00:06:20,476 --> 00:06:22,343
Good. Good for Brian.

138
00:06:22,411 --> 00:06:23,494
Brian, look at this.

139
00:06:23,562 --> 00:06:25,380
Now, this is a
tasteful nude.

140
00:06:25,447 --> 00:06:28,883
It's called "A Saucy Outing
In Tottenham Court Square."

141
00:06:34,957 --> 00:06:37,559
Brian, are you reading the
new Rush Limbaugh book?

142
00:06:37,627 --> 00:06:39,561
Yeah, I picked it up
at the mall yesterday.

143
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:41,029
I... I can't believe
I'm saying this,

144
00:06:41,097 --> 00:06:43,982
but this might be
the best book I've ever read.

145
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,150
Brian, you got
to be joking.

146
00:06:45,218 --> 00:06:46,685
No, I mean it, Lois.

147
00:06:46,752 --> 00:06:49,087
You know, I've never actually
read any of Limbaugh's stuff,

148
00:06:49,155 --> 00:06:51,022
but this book
makes an excellent case for

149
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,308
personal accountability,
fiscal responsibility

150
00:06:53,376 --> 00:06:54,543
and steak eatership.

151
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,812
But you're a
hard-core liberal.

152
00:06:56,863 --> 00:06:59,131
Rush Limbaugh is a
right-wing extremist.

153
00:06:59,198 --> 00:07:01,366
He stands for
everything you despise.

154
00:07:01,434 --> 00:07:03,201
My loyalty is to reason, Lois.

155
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:05,570
And as a reasonable person,
I reserve the right

156
00:07:05,638 --> 00:07:07,189
to change my mind
when presented with

157
00:07:07,256 --> 00:07:09,191
new information
that alters my perspective.

158
00:07:09,258 --> 00:07:11,610
And I got to tell you,
I had this guy all wrong.

159
00:07:11,694 --> 00:07:14,696
I mean, some of the stuff
in here is... Hey, bologna!

160
00:07:18,868 --> 00:07:20,218
Thank you, friends.

161
00:07:20,286 --> 00:07:22,737
It's always a pleasure
to meet regular, real Americans.

162
00:07:22,805 --> 00:07:23,588
Love the
Hummer, Rush.

163
00:07:23,656 --> 00:07:24,656
How do you like it?

164
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,191
It is the best.

165
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:28,677
I'm not saying you'd have to be
gay to drive something else.

166
00:07:28,744 --> 00:07:30,195
But if you drive
something else,

167
00:07:30,263 --> 00:07:32,814
you're probably a guy who likes
to pleasure other men sexually.

168
00:07:33,966 --> 00:07:35,717
Hey, it's my new
friend, Brian!

169
00:07:35,784 --> 00:07:36,718
Hi, Rush.

170
00:07:36,786 --> 00:07:38,587
Listen, I...
I have to tell you,

171
00:07:38,638 --> 00:07:41,006
I read your book
and it was very persuasive.

172
00:07:41,073 --> 00:07:42,340
I knew you'd like it,

173
00:07:42,408 --> 00:07:44,142
and I'm glad you enjoyed it,
Brian, I really am.

174
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,844
Oh, I...
I more than enjoyed it.

175
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:48,113
Ev... Every page
just spoke to me.

176
00:07:48,181 --> 00:07:50,115
And... And, you know,
talking to you now, I just,

177
00:07:50,183 --> 00:07:51,600
I... I want to find
the right words

178
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:53,368
to describe how much
I agree with you.

179
00:07:53,436 --> 00:07:54,769
I got the
words, Brian.

180
00:07:54,837 --> 00:07:56,771
"Thank you, Rush,
for doing my thinking for me,

181
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,506
"'cause I lack
the ability to think

182
00:07:58,574 --> 00:08:00,375
- critically and independently."
- Yes, that!

183
00:08:00,443 --> 00:08:01,977
You should be proud
of yourself, Brian.

184
00:08:02,044 --> 00:08:03,712
I mean, you sound like
a thoughtful American.

185
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:06,164
Well, listen, I'd really love
to pick your brain some more

186
00:08:06,232 --> 00:08:07,632
and hear some of
your other thoughts

187
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,100
about what's going on
in this country.

188
00:08:09,168 --> 00:08:11,670
I can do even better
than that, Brian.

189
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:24,583
Wow.

190
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:25,850
Never thought
I'd set foot

191
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:27,586
inside Republican
National Headquarters.

192
00:08:27,653 --> 00:08:28,687
This is amazing.

193
00:08:28,754 --> 00:08:30,121
And it gets better, Brian.

194
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:32,624
Come on, I'm gonna introduce you
to some of my pals here.

195
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,826
Brian, meet George W. Bush.

196
00:08:34,894 --> 00:08:35,927
Hey, Georgie!

197
00:08:35,995 --> 00:08:38,179
Uncle Rush!

198
00:08:38,247 --> 00:08:40,065
Hey! Whoo!

199
00:08:40,132 --> 00:08:41,499
You are getting heavy.

200
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:43,835
I know.
I'm 64 and three-quarters.

201
00:08:43,903 --> 00:08:45,370
You sure are, slugger.

202
00:08:45,438 --> 00:08:47,138
Hey, you got one for me?

203
00:08:47,206 --> 00:08:48,423
What? What are you
talking about?

204
00:08:48,491 --> 00:08:50,258
Oh, come on, Uncle Rush.

205
00:08:50,326 --> 00:08:51,559
I... I don't know what
you're talking about, really.

206
00:08:51,627 --> 00:08:52,928
Come on!

207
00:08:52,995 --> 00:08:56,597
Oh. Wait a second.

208
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:57,849
Yay! Yippee!

209
00:08:57,917 --> 00:08:58,950
Thanks, Uncle Rush!

210
00:08:59,018 --> 00:09:00,368
Don't tell my dad.

211
00:09:00,436 --> 00:09:02,370
Hey, there, Rush.
How you doing?

212
00:09:02,438 --> 00:09:03,571
Hey, John.

213
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:05,273
Hey, I'd like you to meet
my friend, Brian.

214
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:06,942
Brian, John McCain.

215
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:08,677
Gosh, it sure is
a pleasure, Mr. McCain.

216
00:09:08,744 --> 00:09:10,362
How do you two know each other?

217
00:09:10,429 --> 00:09:13,465
Oh, Rush and I used to solve
mysteries together back in the day.

218
00:09:17,003 --> 00:09:18,787
I don't understand, John.

219
00:09:18,854 --> 00:09:21,856
The groundskeeper said he saw
the mummy burning the flag.

220
00:09:21,924 --> 00:09:23,692
But mummies don't
hate America.

221
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:26,461
They sure don't, Rush.
But Democrats do.

222
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:29,130
Ruh-roh.
Remocrats.

223
00:09:30,566 --> 00:09:32,117
Oh, it's okay, Hot Dog.

224
00:09:32,184 --> 00:09:35,787
But I think it's time we unravel
the mummy and the mystery.

225
00:09:39,425 --> 00:09:40,825
I don't get it, John.

226
00:09:40,893 --> 00:09:43,061
How's a pig gonna help
us lure the mummy?

227
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:46,398
Rush, I've never known
a Democrat to pass up pork.

228
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,173
Gotcha!

229
00:09:56,325 --> 00:10:00,795
Now let's find out
who you really are.

230
00:10:00,846 --> 00:10:02,630
It's old man Barney Frank!

231
00:10:02,698 --> 00:10:04,566
And I would have
gotten away with it, too,

232
00:10:04,633 --> 00:10:06,935
if it weren't for you
meddling Republicans.

233
00:10:07,003 --> 00:10:08,670
Thanks for all your help,
Globetrotters.

234
00:10:08,738 --> 00:10:10,739
That was a cold swish.

235
00:10:10,806 --> 00:10:11,973
Put her there.

236
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,708
Aw, no, no, no, no.

237
00:10:19,198 --> 00:10:22,467
Look, Brian, all I'm saying is,
it's not normal for people

238
00:10:22,535 --> 00:10:25,420
to change their political views
so radically overnight.

239
00:10:25,488 --> 00:10:27,722
Lois, no offense,
but you don't exactly know

240
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,140
what you're talking about.

241
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,475
I mean, you're...
You're not exactly a fountain

242
00:10:30,543 --> 00:10:32,143
of political knowledge yourself.

243
00:10:32,211 --> 00:10:34,679
You want to know
what I think is happening here?

244
00:10:34,747 --> 00:10:36,548
Oh, this should be
rich and overtaxed.

245
00:10:36,615 --> 00:10:38,983
I think you just got to be
in the "out" group.

246
00:10:39,051 --> 00:10:41,870
Whoever's on top, whoever's
in power, whoever's successful,

247
00:10:41,937 --> 00:10:43,872
you got to be
on the other side

248
00:10:43,939 --> 00:10:46,174
or you don't feel like
the smartest guy in the room.

249
00:10:46,242 --> 00:10:48,343
All you are, my dear,
is a contrarian.

250
00:10:48,411 --> 00:10:50,578
Oh, please, you could
not be more off base.

251
00:10:50,646 --> 00:10:53,148
Oh, yeah? Let me ask, what did
you think of the movie <i>Titanic?</i>

252
00:10:53,215 --> 00:10:54,983
Horrible. One of the
worst movies ever made.

253
00:10:55,051 --> 00:10:56,751
Mm-hmm. How about
<i>Slumdog Millionaire?</i>

254
00:10:56,819 --> 00:10:58,186
Overrated.
Just a terrible movie.

255
00:10:58,254 --> 00:10:59,254
<i>Cocktail.</i>

256
00:10:59,321 --> 00:11:00,989
Actually,
not a bad film.

257
00:11:01,057 --> 00:11:02,974
You know, as classically
structured cinema,

258
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:04,943
<i>Cocktail</i> was one of the
best films of its era.

259
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,761
You make me sick, Brian.

260
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:09,197
Look, Lois, if I were you,
I'd stow that attitude,

261
00:11:09,265 --> 00:11:11,533
because Rush Limbaugh is
coming over for dinner tonight.

262
00:11:15,738 --> 00:11:18,239
Lois, this dinner
looks delicious.

263
00:11:18,307 --> 00:11:19,474
Oh, well, thank you.

264
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:20,575
Dig in, everyone.

265
00:11:20,643 --> 00:11:21,910
Whoa, hang on, hang on.

266
00:11:21,977 --> 00:11:23,378
I think you're forgetting
the grace, Lois.

267
00:11:24,713 --> 00:11:28,383
Dear God who definitely exists,
we, your people,

268
00:11:28,451 --> 00:11:30,919
who have been on this
planet for 6,000 years

269
00:11:30,986 --> 00:11:33,855
and not a second more,
wish to thank you for this bounty,

270
00:11:33,923 --> 00:11:35,840
and for keeping Congress
predominantly white

271
00:11:35,908 --> 00:11:37,242
through Christ
our Lord, amen.

272
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:40,712
So, Rush, I see you
made it here okay,

273
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,982
driving on roads built with
public funds, by the government.

274
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:45,583
Yeah, what about
that, Rush?

275
00:11:45,651 --> 00:11:47,702
I guess the government's
pretty good, like Lois says.

276
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:50,388
Actually, I took the toll roads.
Privately built.

277
00:11:50,456 --> 00:11:52,974
Way smoother than the
crumbling public road system.

278
00:11:53,042 --> 00:11:55,126
Yeah, Lois. Government sucks
at doing stuff.

279
00:11:55,194 --> 00:11:56,961
Oh, no, toll roads
sound great.

280
00:11:57,029 --> 00:11:59,597
Too bad only the very rich
can afford to use them.

281
00:11:59,665 --> 00:12:00,765
I agree with Lois.

282
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,333
Well, maybe more
people could

283
00:12:02,401 --> 00:12:04,602
if the government wasn't taxing
the bajeezus out of them.

284
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,237
Now I agree with Rush.

285
00:12:06,305 --> 00:12:08,473
I'm too a'stupid
to make up my own mind.

286
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,775
Yeah, okay.
Whatever you say, Rush.

287
00:12:10,843 --> 00:12:12,844
So...
Nice weather today.

288
00:12:12,912 --> 00:12:14,345
Yeah,
unseasonably cool.

289
00:12:14,413 --> 00:12:16,815
I guess we can forget that whole
global warming myth.

290
00:12:16,882 --> 00:12:19,551
Global warming is not a myth,
you son of a bitch!

291
00:12:19,618 --> 00:12:21,269
Look, what the hell
are you so hostile for?

292
00:12:21,337 --> 00:12:23,304
Because you brainwashed
our dog.

293
00:12:23,372 --> 00:12:24,772
Hey, listen,
sister, I just...

294
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,277
I'm sorry.

295
00:12:29,345 --> 00:12:32,780
Look, all I did was expose Brian
to a different way of thinking.

296
00:12:32,848 --> 00:12:34,983
He embraced... Oh, God,
I'm gonna move over here.

297
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,818
He embraced it
on his own, Lois.

298
00:12:36,886 --> 00:12:38,386
Well, after Rush
opened my eyes,

299
00:12:38,454 --> 00:12:41,222
I am seeing the world
in a whole new way now.

300
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,992

Whoa, hang on, Lois.

350

What are you saying?
I don't have a mind of my own?

351
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:04,265
That's insulting.
And... And you know what?

352
00:15:04,316 --> 00:15:05,566
I don't...
I don't like the way

353
00:15:05,634 --> 00:15:07,251
you've been talking
to Rush this evening.

354
00:15:07,319 --> 00:15:09,120
You know, I... I thought
you were my friends.

355
00:15:09,204 --> 00:15:11,489
But if you can't accept me
now that we disagree

356
00:15:11,557 --> 00:15:13,291
about certain things, then
maybe you aren't the friends

357
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:15,076
I thought you were.
I'm moving out.

358
00:15:15,144 --> 00:15:16,878
- What?!
- No!
- Again?

359
00:15:16,945 --> 00:15:18,379
I'm gonna go stay
with Rush Limbaugh.

360
00:15:18,447 --> 00:15:19,881
- Right, Rush?
- Huh?

361
00:15:19,948 --> 00:15:21,215
I'm gonna
stay with you.

362
00:15:21,283 --> 00:15:22,917
Uh... yeah, yeah, sure.

363
00:15:22,985 --> 00:15:24,118
That... That's fine.

364
00:15:24,186 --> 00:15:26,654
Oh, this is a bad idea.

365
00:15:26,722 --> 00:15:28,890
But I guess sometimes
Fox has bad ideas, huh?

366
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:32,377
Let's all just sit here
for a moment

367
00:15:32,444 --> 00:15:34,696
and remember that
this was a thing.

368
00:15:42,197 --> 00:15:43,064
Morning, Rush.

369
00:15:43,121 --> 00:15:44,822
Hey, thanks again
for letting me stay here.

370
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,724
Oh, it's not really
any trouble, Brian.

371
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,559
What do you figure,
just a few days?

372
00:15:48,627 --> 00:15:49,827
Aw, man, who knows?

373
00:15:49,895 --> 00:15:51,662
It's just so good
to be out of there.

374
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,497
Hey, you know, I've been
reading all your books

375
00:15:53,565 --> 00:15:55,583
and I so 100% agree with you.

376
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,401
I mean, what is going
on with this country?

377
00:15:57,469 --> 00:15:59,069
I mean, wake up, America.

378
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,106
I mean, these taxes, right?
I mean, am I right?

379
00:16:02,173 --> 00:16:03,374
About the taxes?
You know?

380
00:16:03,441 --> 00:16:04,541
Yeah, taxes are pretty high.

381
00:16:04,609 --> 00:16:06,343
Is... Is... Is that
a new coffee machine?

382
00:16:06,411 --> 00:16:08,646
Oh, yeah, I took the liberty
of replacing your old one

383
00:16:08,713 --> 00:16:10,064
with a new,
American-made coffee machine.

384
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,917
In fact, I got
you a bunch

385
00:16:13,969 --> 00:16:15,469
of new, topnotch,
American-made stuff.

386
00:16:17,172 --> 00:16:18,772
What else did you buy?

387
00:16:18,857 --> 00:16:21,292
Oh, a couple things:
That light fixture...

388
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:23,560
new heat regulator
on your stove...

389
00:16:23,612 --> 00:16:25,529
your man-bra...

390
00:16:25,597 --> 00:16:27,064
your garbage disposal...

391
00:16:27,132 --> 00:16:28,449
your dishwasher...

392
00:16:28,516 --> 00:16:29,583
and your new cat.

393
00:16:29,651 --> 00:16:32,236
Moo.

394
00:16:36,641 --> 00:16:38,909
And you're listening to
the <i>Rush Limbaugh Show.</i>

395
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:41,095
I want to take a moment
to give a shout-out

396
00:16:41,162 --> 00:16:44,198
to my good friend Ken Lay,
faked his own death,

397
00:16:44,266 --> 00:16:46,100
listening in on
a ham radio somewhere

398
00:16:46,167 --> 00:16:47,384
in international waters.

399
00:16:47,452 --> 00:16:48,686
Smooth sailin', Kenny Boy.

400
00:16:48,753 --> 00:16:50,371
Hey, Rush?

401
00:16:50,438 --> 00:16:52,039
Is it okay to
hang out in here?

402
00:16:52,107 --> 00:16:53,958
Wh... All right, fine,
just don't say anything, okay?

403
00:16:55,844 --> 00:16:58,512
So, friends, we were
talking about Nancy Pelosi.

404
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,713
How do we stop her?

405
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:01,181
How do we stop
the Pelosi agenda?

406
00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:02,633
Hey, I'll tell you how.

407
00:17:02,701 --> 00:17:05,035
You strap her to a board,
put a cloth in her mouth

408
00:17:05,103 --> 00:17:06,570
and pour water over it
to simulate drowning.

409
00:17:06,638 --> 00:17:07,855
Yeah! Small government!

410
00:17:07,922 --> 00:17:10,457
And why don't we take
a short break here, folks.

411
00:17:10,525 --> 00:17:11,558
We'll be right back.

412
00:17:11,626 --> 00:17:12,943
Brian, are you nuts?

413
00:17:12,994 --> 00:17:15,129
What the hell kind of show
do you think I'm doing here?

414
00:17:15,196 --> 00:17:17,147
Wha... What? What are you...
Come on. Pelosi's a monster.

415
00:17:17,215 --> 00:17:19,650
And she's addicted to crack.
Come on, you're with me on this.

416
00:17:19,718 --> 00:17:21,051
Of course she's
addicted to crack,

417
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,486
but you can't just say that.

418
00:17:22,554 --> 00:17:24,888
You got to lead people there
with an intelligent argument

419
00:17:24,956 --> 00:17:26,890
so they arrive at it
on their own.

420
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,742
Hey, come on, man.
We got to tell people how it is.

421
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,127
We got to get them
on board with us.

422
00:17:30,195 --> 00:17:32,696
Brian, look, there is no
victory unless people know why

423
00:17:32,764 --> 00:17:35,232
they were wrong to disagree
with you in the first place.

424
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,034
Boy, do you sound soft.

425
00:17:37,102 --> 00:17:38,469
What the hell's
your problem, Brian?

426
00:17:38,536 --> 00:17:39,987
My... My problem?

427
00:17:40,055 --> 00:17:41,705
My... Right now my
problem seems to be

428
00:17:41,773 --> 00:17:43,340
that I am talking
to a Pelosi-lover.

429
00:17:43,408 --> 00:17:44,575
- What?!
- Yeah, that's right.

430
00:17:44,642 --> 00:17:45,876
You love Pelosi.

431
00:17:45,944 --> 00:17:47,811
You know what?
It's time for you to go.

432
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:49,346
- Right now.
- Hey, fine.

433
00:17:49,397 --> 00:17:51,982
I don't have to sit here and
waste my time with a softie.

434
00:17:52,033 --> 00:17:53,233
You... You call
yourself a Republican?

435
00:17:53,301 --> 00:17:55,052
Republicans don't shy
away from a fight.

436
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,520
And I'm gonna
prove it to you.

437
00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:09,433
Aha!

438
00:18:09,501 --> 00:18:10,901
Who are you?

439
00:18:10,969 --> 00:18:12,269
How did you get in here?

440
00:18:12,337 --> 00:18:13,554
Shut up, Pelosi.

441
00:18:13,621 --> 00:18:15,389
Are you here to take my baby?

442
00:18:15,457 --> 00:18:17,324
No, I'm here to strap
you to a board,

443
00:18:17,392 --> 00:18:19,710
put a cloth in your mouth
and pour water over it

444
00:18:19,778 --> 00:18:21,011
to simulate the
sensation of drowning.

445
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,363
Yeah! Traditional values!

446
00:18:31,956 --> 00:18:34,041
Griffin, you've been bailed out.

447
00:18:36,461 --> 00:18:38,562
Oh, Rush, thank God.

448
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,930
Boy, you got down
here quick.

449
00:18:39,998 --> 00:18:42,566
Yeah, I keep Strom Thurmond's
corpse in the front seat

450
00:18:42,634 --> 00:18:44,735
- so I can use the carpool lane.
- Oh.

451
00:18:44,803 --> 00:18:46,236
Okay, well, come on,
let's go home.

452
00:18:46,304 --> 00:18:47,404
Great idea.

453
00:18:47,472 --> 00:18:48,889
Time for you to go home.

454
00:18:48,957 --> 00:18:50,190
Home to the Griffins.

455
00:18:50,258 --> 00:18:52,092
Wh... What do you mean?

456
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,894
That's where you
belong, Brian.

457
00:18:53,962 --> 00:18:55,329
You're not really
a conservative.

458
00:18:55,397 --> 00:18:56,530
What are you...
That's not true.

459
00:18:56,598 --> 00:18:57,631
I am conservative.

460
00:18:57,699 --> 00:18:58,866
I support the death penalty

461
00:18:58,933 --> 00:19:00,234
to show people
that killing is wrong.

462
00:19:00,301 --> 00:19:01,802
And that's great, Brian.

463
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:05,205
Look, I... I make a living
persuading others to join my side.

464
00:19:05,273 --> 00:19:06,940
But I'd never,
ever want somebody

465
00:19:07,008 --> 00:19:08,409
to be something they're not.

466
00:19:08,476 --> 00:19:09,710
You're a liberal, Brian.

467
00:19:09,778 --> 00:19:11,478
I mean, what about
that four-year-old

468
00:19:11,546 --> 00:19:13,063
that was executed in Texas?

469
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:15,499
There was a four-year-old
executed in Texas?

470
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:19,103
Not really, but you see, Brian,
your concern betrays you.

471
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,571
I know your type.

472
00:19:20,638 --> 00:19:22,272
It's not a coincidence
you turned your back

473
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,308
on your democratic principles
just when the Democrats

474
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:25,576
became the political
establishment.

475
00:19:25,643 --> 00:19:27,377
All you want is something
to fight against.

476
00:19:27,445 --> 00:19:29,413
I mean...

477
00:19:29,481 --> 00:19:31,498
I suppose we shouldn't
be executing children.

478
00:19:31,566 --> 00:19:32,499
You see?

479
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:34,101
You're not really one of us.

480
00:19:34,169 --> 00:19:35,803
Oh, my God...

481
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,805
Lois was right.

482
00:19:37,872 --> 00:19:41,642
Right there. See, the fact that you
would give a woman credit for anything...

483
00:19:41,709 --> 00:19:43,410
It means you're
a liberal, Brian.

484
00:19:43,478 --> 00:19:47,381
It's time for you to spread
your two left wings and fly.

485
00:19:47,449 --> 00:19:50,617
Does this... Does this mean
I'll never see you again?

486
00:19:50,685 --> 00:19:53,070
Oh, I'll be around.

487
00:19:53,138 --> 00:19:54,705
Wherever there's
a rich white guy

488
00:19:54,772 --> 00:19:57,508
in need of another tax break,
I'll be there.

489
00:19:57,575 --> 00:19:59,476
Wherever there's
a brain-dead woman

490
00:19:59,544 --> 00:20:01,278
in need
of expensive life support

491
00:20:01,346 --> 00:20:04,181
her husband doesn't want,
I'll be there.

492
00:20:04,249 --> 00:20:06,583
Wherever there's a country
that needs to be invaded

493
00:20:06,651 --> 00:20:10,220
for reasons that don't exactly
pan out, I'll be there, too.

494
00:20:10,288 --> 00:20:12,523
Oh, yes, I will be around.

495
00:20:23,551 --> 00:20:24,618
Hey, Limbaugh.

496
00:20:26,254 --> 00:20:28,155
I think you're a boneheaded,
fascist,

497
00:20:28,223 --> 00:20:30,023
corporate-shilling blowhard.

498
00:20:30,091 --> 00:20:32,025
Look, you little smartass,

499
00:20:32,093 --> 00:20:34,828
I think you are a Godless,
socialist, pot-smoking,

500
00:20:34,896 --> 00:20:36,296
maggot-infested member

501
00:20:36,364 --> 00:20:37,664
of the blame-America-first
crowd,

502
00:20:37,732 --> 00:20:39,700
and I think you want
the terrorists to win.

503
