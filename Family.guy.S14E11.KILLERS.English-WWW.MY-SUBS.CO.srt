Wow, that was amazing, I think!

17
00:00:47,926 --> 00:00:49,626
All right, everyone,

18
00:00:49,661 --> 00:00:51,294
it's time to open up
our bank statements.

19
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,663
Let's gather
'round for prayer.

20
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:55,966
Hey, God, it's the Griffins.

21
00:00:56,001 --> 00:00:57,667
Again, we're very sorry

22
00:00:57,703 --> 00:00:59,136
we cyber-bullied
that girl to death.

23
00:00:59,171 --> 00:01:01,004
But we still want a snowmobile.

24
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,572
Today, though,
please let there be money

25
00:01:02,608 --> 00:01:03,907
in our bank account.

26
00:01:03,942 --> 00:01:05,509
Amen. Amen.
Amen. Amen.

27
00:01:06,745 --> 00:01:08,044
Damn it.
It didn't work.

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,579
We're still poor.

29
00:01:09,615 --> 00:01:12,249
Peter, every month our savings
get smaller and smaller.

30
00:01:12,284 --> 00:01:14,084
We really gotta
figure out a better way

31
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:15,519
to budget for this
family's future.

32
00:01:15,554 --> 00:01:16,753
Bitcoin.

33
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:18,021
What?
I don't know.

34
00:01:18,056 --> 00:01:19,422
This is serious.

35
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:21,358
We need to think
about our kids' education.

36
00:01:21,393 --> 00:01:24,161
Of course, it's already too late
for Meg to go to college.

37
00:01:24,196 --> 00:01:26,530
And Chris is too dumb
to get in anywhere.

38
00:01:26,565 --> 00:01:27,731
Yay!

39
00:01:27,766 --> 00:01:29,032
No, Chris.
Not yay.

40
00:01:29,067 --> 00:01:31,067
But there's still
time for Stewie.

41
00:01:31,103 --> 00:01:33,236
Let's sit down later
and see if we can figure out

42
00:01:33,272 --> 00:01:35,038
a plan to get our
finances in order.

43
00:01:35,073 --> 00:01:36,439
Eh, don't worry
about it, Lois.

44
00:01:36,475 --> 00:01:38,208
I will always provide
for the family.

45
00:01:38,243 --> 00:01:40,110
Even if I have to
shoot our dinner.

46
00:01:40,145 --> 00:01:41,711
(screaming)

47
00:01:41,747 --> 00:01:43,613
(gunshot)

48
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:45,882
This will look great
in my study.

49
00:01:45,918 --> 00:01:47,684
I'm a hunter,

50
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,953
but I'm a silly hunter.

51
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,526
(clears throat)

52
00:01:56,562 --> 00:01:58,628
(swallows thickly)

53
00:01:58,664 --> 00:02:00,063
Hey, don't fill up on that.

54
00:02:00,098 --> 00:02:01,531
We got breakfast coming.

55
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:03,867
Hey, Peter, I think
I figured out one way

56
00:02:03,902 --> 00:02:05,635
we can save money
for Stewie's college.

57
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:08,371
If we bundle our cable
and Internet together,

58
00:02:08,407 --> 00:02:10,707
we can save
$14 a month.

59
00:02:10,742 --> 00:02:13,076
No! Bundling is
a sign of defeat!

60
00:02:13,111 --> 00:02:14,911
Plus, I figured out
something better.

61
00:02:14,947 --> 00:02:17,214
A metal detector.
What?

62
00:02:17,249 --> 00:02:19,316
Yeah, it combines two of
America's greatest resources:

63
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:20,584
garbage and luck.

64
00:02:20,619 --> 00:02:21,818
That's stupid,
Peter.

65
00:02:21,854 --> 00:02:23,386
Ah, you're just
saying that

66
00:02:23,422 --> 00:02:25,155
because the battery it uses
causes bladder cancer.

67
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,556
Well, then, I'm off.

68
00:02:26,592 --> 00:02:28,558
I shall be at the beach
looking for valuables

69
00:02:28,594 --> 00:02:30,460
and occasionally using
a doorless bathroom.

70
00:02:30,495 --> 00:02:31,962
Good day, madam.

TV ANNOUNCER: We now return to
<i>The Awkward Stepdad Show.</i>

72
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:41,671
Man, your mom's
a real groaner.

73
00:02:41,707 --> 00:02:43,440
Do you hear that
in your room?

74
00:02:43,475 --> 00:02:46,243
Hey, Dad,
where are you going?

75
00:02:46,278 --> 00:02:48,378
Well, Meg, now that
I'm a metal detector guy,

76
00:02:48,413 --> 00:02:50,947
I gotta start eating breakfast
at on-the-sand cafes,

77
00:02:50,983 --> 00:02:52,582
where I will
judge tourists

78
00:02:52,618 --> 00:02:54,618
as my skin browns
and hardens.

79
00:02:54,653 --> 00:02:56,419
Stop throwin' your kid's diapers

80
00:02:56,455 --> 00:02:58,889
in the trash
with all the soda cans!

81
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:05,061
Hey, Lois, check out what
I found with my metal detector.

82
00:03:06,732 --> 00:03:09,032
Are those... are
those Purple Hearts?

83
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:10,907
Yeah, some idiot buried,
like, a hundred of 'em

84
00:03:10,936 --> 00:03:12,602
in this big lawn
under these bone cages.

85
00:03:12,638 --> 00:03:14,104
Peter!

86
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:16,706
I think you desecrated
a military graveyard!

87
00:03:16,742 --> 00:03:18,375
Hey, guys, like four jeeps

88
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,943
just drove up
onto our front yard.

89
00:03:19,978 --> 00:03:21,444
They must be here
for the medals!

90
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,380
Maybe. Or it could be
because of my

91
00:03:23,415 --> 00:03:25,749
"I'm Gonna Barf
on the White House" blog.

92
00:03:29,488 --> 00:03:30,921
(metal detector beeping)

93
00:03:30,956 --> 00:03:32,289
(beeping increases)

94
00:03:32,324 --> 00:03:35,091
Ah, sweet!

95
00:03:35,127 --> 00:03:36,927
Huh.

96
00:03:36,962 --> 00:03:39,482
Wonder what happens if I turn it
on and point 'em at each other.

97
00:03:42,467 --> 00:03:43,900
Oh, my God!

98
00:03:43,936 --> 00:03:46,503
Did you also call
into a talk show

99
00:03:46,538 --> 00:03:49,239
without turning down
your radio first?

100
00:03:49,274 --> 00:03:51,241
(beeping)

101
00:03:51,276 --> 00:03:52,276
(beeping increases)

102
00:03:52,311 --> 00:03:54,144
Jackpot.

103
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:55,679
Wow, an iPad!

104
00:03:55,714 --> 00:03:56,947
This thing finds
everything!

105
00:03:56,982 --> 00:03:58,949
(beeps)
Engagement ring!

106
00:03:58,984 --> 00:04:00,784
(beeps)
Family locket!

107
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:02,786
(beeps)
Sunglasses that are an upgrade

108
00:04:02,821 --> 00:04:05,121
over my current pair!
MAN: There he is!

109
00:04:05,157 --> 00:04:07,958
There's the guy who's been
stealing everyone's stuff!

110
00:04:07,993 --> 00:04:10,527
Don't yell at me,
I'm very sunburned!

111
00:04:10,562 --> 00:04:13,964
(clattering)
Go, crappy car, go!

112
00:04:17,202 --> 00:04:20,437
Peter, did you rob
a bunch of people

113
00:04:20,472 --> 00:04:22,172
on the beach
with your metal detector?

114
00:04:22,207 --> 00:04:23,773
Well, that's only
half the story.

115
00:04:23,809 --> 00:04:25,842
I also hooted at a lady
who was breastfeeding.

116
00:04:25,877 --> 00:04:28,211
I want you to get rid of
that metal detector.

117
00:04:28,246 --> 00:04:30,013
All you're doing is
getting into trouble

118
00:04:30,048 --> 00:04:32,015
and digging up junk
when we really need

119
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,683
to be saving
for Stewie's college.

120
00:04:33,719 --> 00:04:35,352
Tomorrow we are
going to the mall

121
00:04:35,387 --> 00:04:37,153
and returning that
thing to the store.

122
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:38,822
(sighs)
Okay, fine.

123
00:04:38,857 --> 00:04:41,291
But you should know, the day
I bought this metal detector

124
00:04:41,326 --> 00:04:43,693
was the happiest
day of my life.

125
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:46,663
Well, obviously,
the second happiest.

I have IBS.

Well, I'm glad
the store was willing

138

to take that
metal detector back.

All right, let's go
to the food court.

140
00:05:29,274 --> 00:05:31,074
I love eating
Panda Express

141
00:05:31,109 --> 00:05:33,176
while squeezin' our purchases
between our knees

142
00:05:33,211 --> 00:05:34,577
'cause someone
might grab 'em.

143
00:05:34,613 --> 00:05:36,679
God, the mall sucks,
doesn't it, kids?

144
00:05:36,715 --> 00:05:38,515
If I had a credit card,
I'd shop online.

145
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,050
Oh, hey, Bonnie.

146
00:05:40,085 --> 00:05:41,451
What are you guys
doing here?

147
00:05:41,486 --> 00:05:42,786
Oh, hey, Lois.

148
00:05:42,821 --> 00:05:44,788
We saw an ad
looking for a toddler

149
00:05:44,823 --> 00:05:46,589
to appear in a peanut
butter commercial

150
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,925
and we thought
we'd bring Susie.

151
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,594
Joe, are you wearing a corsage?
Yeah.

152
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,630
You can get a really good deal
on them after prom season.

153
00:05:53,665 --> 00:05:54,898
They're for girls, Joe.

154
00:05:54,933 --> 00:05:56,433
Hey, Peter,

155
00:05:56,468 --> 00:05:59,369
why don't you let me do me,
and you do you, okay?

156
00:05:59,404 --> 00:06:01,071
Peanut butter commercial, huh?

157
00:06:01,106 --> 00:06:02,739
Hey, Bri, maybe
you should audition.

158
00:06:02,774 --> 00:06:04,941
You know, because of that
one time you got in the trash

159
00:06:04,976 --> 00:06:06,943
and ate a whole jar of
recalled peanut butter?

160
00:06:06,978 --> 00:06:08,578
It wasn't peanut butter.

161
00:06:08,613 --> 00:06:10,380
It was that pre-mixed peanut
butter and jelly thing.

162
00:06:10,415 --> 00:06:11,915
Oh, Mom bought that?

163
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,617
That's what the scab kid
at school always has!

164
00:06:14,653 --> 00:06:16,386
That was really great, Jake.

165
00:06:16,421 --> 00:06:17,620
Really, really great.

166
00:06:17,656 --> 00:06:19,322
Your face is upside-down,

167
00:06:19,357 --> 00:06:21,558
so we're not gonna pick you,
but thanks for coming.

168
00:06:21,593 --> 00:06:23,226
Hey. Hey.
This is you.

I'm sorry, we're looking for

more of a
"Num-num-num-num-num-num-num."

Bob, look over there!

Num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-
num-num-num-num-num!

178
00:06:41,255 --> 00:06:42,488
Whose kid is that?

179
00:06:42,523 --> 00:06:44,323
Oh, that's our son, Stewie.

180
00:06:44,359 --> 00:06:45,758
He's adorable!

181
00:06:45,793 --> 00:06:47,693
And exactly what
we're looking for!

182
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:51,430
Congratulations, your son
is the new peanut butter kid!

183
00:06:51,466 --> 00:06:53,432
My God, I don't believe it!

00:06:53,468 --> 00:06:55,067
That's so cool!

185

Hey, what's Dad doing
over there with Chris?

186
00:06:57,138 --> 00:07:00,039
Oh, he's telling him that he's
no longer his favorite son.

193
00:07:20,228 --> 00:07:22,194
I didn't even tell him.

194
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,063
He just does not
like to be touched.

195
00:07:29,144 --> 00:07:30,911
Thanks for coming
to the viewing party

for Stewie's commercial,
everybody.

We're sorry that it's
airing during<i> 2 Broke Girls,</i>

198
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:37,818
but we have no
control over that.

199
00:07:37,853 --> 00:07:39,853
Thanks for coming to
my big night, Brian.

H-Hey, wait,
where's the baby?

00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:56,103
Well, he likes
his hero dad,

but he loves
Scooter's Peanut Butter.

Let's all calm down
a little.

00:08:13,222 --> 00:08:15,489
Wow, I can't believe
Stewie's a commercial star.

We haven't had a

Let me see that.

It's a royalty check
from Stewie's commercial.

235

Apparently, he gets paid

This is great.

We can put it right into

Yeah, yeah,

maybe we should keep
a little bit out to celebrate.

I mean, I ain't
done nothin' fancy

I mean... I mean,
the world of child acting

269
00:10:07,469 --> 00:10:09,336
can be a pretty bad
environment for a kid.

270
00:10:09,371 --> 00:10:11,338
Maybe we should just
let Stewie's childhood

271
00:10:11,373 --> 00:10:12,806
be about being a child.

Wasn't your kid an actor,

Okay, Stewie, you booked
the last commercial

290
00:10:49,411 --> 00:10:52,212
without even trying, so this
one should be a piece of cake.

Oh, is your child up for the
cough syrup commercial, too?

You'd have no way
of knowing this,

Oh, thank you.

00:11:49,538 --> 00:11:51,338
Oh, okay, I'm out, I'm out.

316
00:11:51,373 --> 00:11:52,739
Tappin' out.

317
00:11:52,775 --> 00:11:55,175
Well, that was
a disaster.

318
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,177
It was humiliating
is what it was.

319
00:11:57,212 --> 00:11:58,578
That woman just smiled

320
00:11:58,614 --> 00:12:00,580
when Stewie banged
his balls on the floor.

321
00:12:00,616 --> 00:12:02,582
A damn disaster.

322
00:12:02,618 --> 00:12:04,584
Num-num-num-num-num-
num-num-num-num?

323
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,353
Shut up,
that's over!

324
00:12:06,388 --> 00:12:07,554
Did you see those other kids?

325
00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:08,755
They were amazing.

326
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,190
One of them was texting

327
00:12:10,225 --> 00:12:12,025
with the funny-dumb kid
from<i> Modern Family.</i>

328
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,593
I want to text with that kid.

329
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:15,428
Holy Christmas, there were
a lot of hot moms

330
00:12:15,464 --> 00:12:17,097
in yoga pants in there though.

331
00:12:17,132 --> 00:12:19,933
Dear me, they're really
disappointed in me, Rupert.

332
00:12:19,968 --> 00:12:21,768
I haven't seen
the fat man this upset

333
00:12:21,804 --> 00:12:23,637
since he went
to the 9/11 museum.

334
00:12:23,672 --> 00:12:25,639
Lois made us do this,

335
00:12:25,674 --> 00:12:28,742
but I wanted to go to the
Central Park merry-go-round.

336
00:12:28,777 --> 00:12:31,111
We had time to do both!

337
00:12:33,582 --> 00:12:35,549
(piano plays
Bent Fabric's "Alley Cat")

338
00:12:35,584 --> 00:12:38,118

Okay, that's great, that's
great, that's great.

342
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:54,267
Just one question,
Stewie--

343
00:12:54,303 --> 00:12:56,670
do you get pleasure out of
humiliating your family?

344
00:12:56,705 --> 00:12:59,105
Yeah, is there some kind
of sick joy in it?

345
00:12:59,141 --> 00:13:00,941
Why can't he just
be Pierce Brosnan?

346
00:13:00,976 --> 00:13:02,242
Pierce Brosnan
would've got this.

347
00:13:02,277 --> 00:13:03,243
In a heartbeat!

348
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:04,511
It's 3:00

349
00:13:04,546 --> 00:13:05,946
What the hell
are you guys doing?

350
00:13:05,981 --> 00:13:08,148
What does it look like?
We're practicing.

351
00:13:08,183 --> 00:13:09,783
Stewie has another
audition tomorrow,

352
00:13:09,818 --> 00:13:11,685
and we're not gonna be
embarrassed like we were today.

353
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,120
See, this is the kind
of thing I was talking about.

354
00:13:14,156 --> 00:13:15,856
And look at him,
he can barely stand up.

355
00:13:15,891 --> 00:13:18,792
That's why I made this--
I call it "8 Hour Energy."

356
00:13:18,827 --> 00:13:21,428
It's one part 5-Hour Energy,
and the other three hours are

357
00:13:21,463 --> 00:13:23,029
espresso, Scotts
Turf Builder,

358
00:13:23,065 --> 00:13:26,032
and a tiny, tiny super-small
amount of cocaine.

359
00:13:26,068 --> 00:13:27,500
Just a little bit.

360
00:13:27,536 --> 00:13:29,936
I can't stress the
littleness of it enough.

361
00:13:29,972 --> 00:13:31,771

his acting career?

Oh, he's fine
with it.

369
00:13:45,721 --> 00:13:46,686
Stewie, if you're
fine with it,

370
00:13:46,722 --> 00:13:49,122
bleed from the nose.

371
00:13:49,157 --> 00:13:51,024
I think that's
pretty close.

372
00:13:59,304 --> 00:14:01,671
All right, Stewie, now remember
what we practiced last night.

373
00:14:01,706 --> 00:14:03,673
And here's a trick
to keep that confidence up.

374
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,108
You go in that room

375
00:14:05,143 --> 00:14:07,510
and imagine everyone in it
wants you sexually.

376
00:14:07,545 --> 00:14:10,513
I'm doing it right now,
and I feel powerful.

377
00:14:10,548 --> 00:14:11,948
Okay.

378
00:14:11,983 --> 00:14:13,950
And don't forget--
if you screw this up,

379
00:14:13,985 --> 00:14:15,910
Mommy's gonna kill
all of your toys.

380
00:14:15,934 --> 00:14:16,821
Okay.

381
00:14:16,821 --> 00:14:19,288
All right, now I'm gonna go
psych out these other kids.

382
00:14:19,324 --> 00:14:20,690
Hey, little guy.

383
00:14:20,725 --> 00:14:21,691
Nervous?

384
00:14:21,726 --> 00:14:23,126
Sure you are.

385
00:14:23,161 --> 00:14:24,527
Here's something
that might help you.

386
00:14:24,562 --> 00:14:26,529
(air horn blares)

387
00:14:26,564 --> 00:14:28,197
Hey, little guy.

388
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:29,399
Stewie Griffin?

389
00:14:29,434 --> 00:14:30,633
Oh, right here.

390
00:14:30,668 --> 00:14:32,035
Peter, he
needs a boost.

391
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,770
Give him some of
the acting soup.

392
00:14:35,206 --> 00:14:36,172
(gulps)

393
00:14:36,207 --> 00:14:38,608
I want to say curse words!

394
00:14:40,745 --> 00:14:43,146
Okay, Stewie, you're just
gonna drink this juice,

395
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:45,982
then say, "Mmm,"
and rub your belly.

396
00:14:46,017 --> 00:14:47,017
Yeah, yeah,
you got it.

397
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,851
(gulps)

398
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:50,219
Yeah! Bye, juice!

399
00:14:50,255 --> 00:14:51,654
That was amazing.

400
00:14:51,689 --> 00:14:53,056
I've got goosebumps.

401
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:54,657
I want him
sexually.

402
00:14:54,692 --> 00:14:57,193
Well, Mom, Dad,

403
00:14:57,228 --> 00:14:59,495
I think we've got our
new orange juice boy.

404
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,497
Does this guy really
think we're his parents?

405
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:02,899
Stewie got the part?!

406
00:15:02,934 --> 00:15:04,333
Yes!

407
00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:07,370
That is how
you do it.

408
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,277
Oh, hey, Brian.
What's going on?

409
00:15:14,312 --> 00:15:15,278
Where's the fridge?

410
00:15:15,313 --> 00:15:16,679
Oh, we got a new one.

411
00:15:16,714 --> 00:15:18,514
Stewie booked that
orange juice commercial,

412
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,917
so we thought we'd make a few
upgrades around the house.

413
00:15:20,952 --> 00:15:23,920
Yeah, I even bought an awesome
voice-activated 3-D printer.

414
00:15:23,955 --> 00:15:25,855
Why the hell do you
need a 3-D printer?

415
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,256
Print coyote.

416
00:15:27,292 --> 00:15:29,292

417
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:32,695

418
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,097
CHRIS: Hey, what,
hey, no, no, no!

419
00:15:34,132 --> 00:15:36,065
Heel, heel, heel!

420
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,300
I can't make him
attack you, Brian,

421
00:15:37,335 --> 00:15:38,534
but if I keep
printing them,

422
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,069
eventually one will
go after you.

423
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,904
That money is supposed to
be for Stewie's college.

424
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,740
He's an actor, you idiot--
he doesn't need college.

425
00:15:44,776 --> 00:15:47,577
Look, I-I just don't think any
of this is good for Stewie.

426
00:15:47,612 --> 00:15:48,978
It's great for Stewie.

427
00:15:49,013 --> 00:15:50,213
He's becoming a star.

428
00:15:50,248 --> 00:15:52,215
That's right.

429
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,084
Man, this must be what it's like
to be Anne Hathaway's parents.

430
00:15:56,654 --> 00:15:58,454
Oh, that's Anne's car.

431
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,922
Ugh.

432
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:04,427
Hey, Stewie, can
I talk to you?

433
00:16:04,462 --> 00:16:05,928
What are you doing?

434
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:07,597
I don't know.

435
00:16:07,632 --> 00:16:10,933
Mom and Dad just, uh, stuck
a book on my head and-and left.

436
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:12,935
Stewie, look at you,
you're a wreck.

437
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:15,338
And for what? So Peter and Lois
can spend the money you earned

438
00:16:15,373 --> 00:16:16,772
on crap they
don't even need?

439
00:16:16,808 --> 00:16:19,175
Uh, I'm not supposed
to use my voice

440
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,010
for non-paying
stuff, Brian.

441
00:16:21,045 --> 00:16:22,845
This is insane--
you've got to stop.

442
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:25,681
Ugh, stop worrying,
I'm fine.

443
00:16:25,717 --> 00:16:28,117
And besides, the fat man
knows what he's doing.

444
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,519
No, he doesn't,
he's an idiot.

445
00:16:29,554 --> 00:16:30,994
Remember? He couldn't
even figure out

446
00:16:31,022 --> 00:16:32,989
how to use a hotel
business center.

447
00:16:33,024 --> 00:16:35,825
So what business
are you in?

448
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,827
Oh, I'm just here to look
at other people's e-mails

449
00:16:37,862 --> 00:16:40,263
who haven't logged out.
And how's business?

450
00:16:40,298 --> 00:16:43,266
Well, I've left some pretty wild
replies on a bunch of Evites.

451
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:46,269
Look at this-- I'm
bringing 53 guests.

452
00:16:46,304 --> 00:16:49,872
You're the coolest guy I've ever
met in one of these things.

453
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:56,379
Oh, hey.

454
00:16:56,414 --> 00:16:58,214
You caught me
pigging out.

455
00:16:58,249 --> 00:17:00,216
I'm dipping this celery
stalk into some lemon water.

456
00:17:00,251 --> 00:17:02,051
But don't freak out.

457
00:17:02,086 --> 00:17:04,053
I'm just gonna smell it and
then throw it in the trash.

458
00:17:04,088 --> 00:17:05,888
Stewie, this has
gotten out of control.

459
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:07,723
If you're gonna
continue on this path,

460
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:09,559
you need to know
what your future holds.

461
00:17:09,594 --> 00:17:11,994
Being a child actor
almost never ends well.

462
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,829
You remember that kid
from<i> A Christmas Story</i>

463
00:17:13,865 --> 00:17:15,231
who got his tongue
stuck to that pole?

464
00:17:15,266 --> 00:17:16,666
Yeah, whatever
happened to him?

465
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:18,067
I'll tell you
what happened to him.

466
00:17:18,102 --> 00:17:19,502
He did porn.

467
00:17:19,537 --> 00:17:21,337
Boner from<i> Growing Pains?</i> Dead.

468
00:17:21,372 --> 00:17:23,339
Screech from
<i>Saved by the Bell?</i> Porn.

469
00:17:23,374 --> 00:17:24,740
Corey Haim? Dead.

470
00:17:24,776 --> 00:17:27,076
Dana Plato? Porn, then dead.

471
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:28,878
Oh, no, this is horrible.

472
00:17:28,913 --> 00:17:31,314
You see, Stewie, there are
tons of actors like this.

473
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:33,316
They all started out
just like you,

474
00:17:33,351 --> 00:17:34,717
but eventually
they were destroyed

475
00:17:34,752 --> 00:17:36,552
by their parents'
greed, drugs

476
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:37,987
or perverted
Hollywood directors.

477
00:17:38,022 --> 00:17:39,388
Oh, like Bryan Singer.

478
00:17:39,424 --> 00:17:42,225
Exactly. The point is
it's a dark path.

479
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,660
My God, I had no idea
it could be so bad.

480
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:46,495
Brian, I don't want
to act anymore.

481
00:17:46,531 --> 00:17:49,498
Good. Now we just got to make
Peter and Lois understand.

482
00:17:49,534 --> 00:17:51,500
Yes, well, if they want
to make me into a monster

483
00:17:51,536 --> 00:17:54,337
like those people, we'll
give 'em a monster.

484
00:17:54,372 --> 00:17:56,539
Like when Godzilla
attacked Haiti.

485
00:17:56,574 --> 00:17:58,241
(flames crackling)

486
00:17:58,276 --> 00:18:00,676
(roars)

487
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,712
Oh, my God.

488
00:18:13,424 --> 00:18:15,391
Peter, did you
get my text?

489
00:18:15,426 --> 00:18:17,793
No, hold on.

490
00:18:17,829 --> 00:18:19,795
No, I don't know
what he's doing here.

491
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:22,231
Okay, Stewie, when Barbara
hands you that orange juice,

492
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,066
you're gonna drink it
and smile.

493
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:26,469
And really show us that
energy from your audition.

494
00:18:26,504 --> 00:18:28,471
H-Hold on a second,
he's got a smudge on his face.

495
00:18:28,506 --> 00:18:30,039
Let me just take care
of that for you guys.

496
00:18:30,074 --> 00:18:31,440
Here, drink this.

497
00:18:31,476 --> 00:18:32,875
I threw a little Molly
in there, too,

498
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,310
so we'll go out
clubbing afterwards.

499
00:18:38,983 --> 00:18:40,383
Hey, you want this?

500
00:18:40,418 --> 00:18:41,784
Sure, I'll
drink anything.

501
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:43,419
All right, action!

502
00:18:43,454 --> 00:18:46,822
As a mom, I want my kids
to start their day right.

503
00:18:46,858 --> 00:18:48,824
And there's no better way
than with a glass

504
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,260
of fresh-squeezed
Sunnydale Orange Juice.

505
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,662
Isn't that right,
sweetie?

506
00:18:52,697 --> 00:18:54,497
Shut your hole, bitch!

507
00:18:54,532 --> 00:18:56,499
I'll tell you what I want
fresh-squeezed-- these.

508
00:18:56,534 --> 00:18:57,933
(shrieks)

509
00:18:57,969 --> 00:18:59,335
What the hell's
he doing?

510
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,803
He's blowing this.

511
00:19:00,838 --> 00:19:04,240
Oh, here's what I think
of this orange juice.

512
00:19:04,275 --> 00:19:07,243
(grunting)

513
00:19:07,278 --> 00:19:10,246
I-I can't... I can't go right
now with everybody watching.

514
00:19:10,281 --> 00:19:13,949
But-but I presume you understand
the disrespect I intended.

515
00:19:13,985 --> 00:19:15,951
Oh, my God, he's
having a meltdown.

516
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:17,353
You don't suppose this
has anything to do

517
00:19:17,388 --> 00:19:19,355
with the sleep deprivation
and narcotics?

518
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:22,191
Oh, Peter, what have
we been thinking?

519
00:19:22,226 --> 00:19:25,194
It's us-- we're the ones
who turned him into this.

520
00:19:25,229 --> 00:19:27,496
Get this kid out of here!
He's fired.

521
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:29,932
Well done.

522
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:31,334
Not a bad performance.

523
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:32,768
Thank you, Brian, I...

524
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:33,769
Uh, there's the poop.

525
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:34,770
Right now.

526
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,172
Oh, Stewie.

527
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:38,174
Mommy and Daddy
are so sorry.

528
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:41,010
I-I guess we just got
too caught up in your success

529
00:19:41,045 --> 00:19:43,012
and forgot that you're
just a baby.

530
00:19:43,047 --> 00:19:44,447
You were
right, Brian.

531
00:19:44,482 --> 00:19:46,849
I guess we pushed Stewie
a little too hard.

532
00:19:46,884 --> 00:19:48,851
Well, the good news is
that now he can go back

533
00:19:48,886 --> 00:19:50,853
to being a regular kid.

534
00:19:50,888 --> 00:19:52,855
♪ ♪

535
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,857
Why are you winking at
our baby, you creep?

536
00:19:54,892 --> 00:19:56,659
God, that's weird.

537
00:19:56,694 --> 00:19:58,527
I don't want to ever
see that happen again.

538
00:20:02,633 --> 00:20:05,601
Well, we went a little crazy
there, didn't we, Peter?

539
00:20:05,636 --> 00:20:07,002
But I'm glad we have

540
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:09,772
our normal, very average,
non-famous baby back.

541
00:20:09,807 --> 00:20:11,607
You know, I was once
a very famous baby.

542
00:20:11,642 --> 00:20:13,209
Were you, Peter?

543
00:20:13,244 --> 00:20:15,444
No, but you see how easy
it is for me to lie to you?

544
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,146
I do it every day.

545
00:20:17,181 --> 00:20:19,548
Anyway, looks like everything
worked out for the best.

546
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:21,584
You know, Brian, that acting
stuff was a bit much for me,

547
00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:24,220
but I did quite enjoy
the dancing and the cocaine.

548
00:20:24,255 --> 00:20:26,055
Yeah?
Yep.

549
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,890
So you're just gonna be a
dancer and a drug addict?

550
00:20:27,925 --> 00:20:30,326
For a while. I might
crash when I'm 18,

551
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:32,728
but then I'll just turn
to the Lord and working out.

552
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:37,266
I'll-I'll just be a 180 degree
different type of insufferable.

553
00:20:37,301 --> 00:20:39,268
I used to need drugs
to feel powerful,

554
00:20:39,303 --> 00:20:41,704
but now my power comes
from my core strength.

555
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:43,539
And let's look at that
word, "strength."

556
00:20:43,574 --> 00:20:45,541
The "S" stands
for sacrifice.

557
00:20:45,576 --> 00:20:47,343
No gain without
sacrifice.

558
00:20:47,378 --> 00:20:50,513
The "T," of course, stands for
the sufferings of the cross.

559
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:52,314
The "R"...
You want some cocaine?

560
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,950
Oh, my God, please, yes!
That's all I want all the time!
