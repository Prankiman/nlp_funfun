1
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:05,701
It seems today that all you see

2
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:09,035
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

3
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:12,743
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

4
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,610
On which we used to rely?

5
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:18,880
Lucky there's a family guy

6
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:22,550
Lucky there's a man who
Positively can do

7
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:24,145
all the things that make us

8
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:25,884
Laugh and cry

9
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:30,725
He's a family guy

10
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:46,109
I must say
I do feeI a strange satisfaction...

11
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:50,774
watching the black ball topple
all those self-righteous white pins.

12
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,715
Can't blame them for being self-righteous.

13
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:55,014
The black ball's
in their neighborhood uninvited.

14
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:57,988
The black ball's done nothing wrong.

15
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:01,321
If the black ball's innocent,
it has nothing to fear.

16
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,387
Wonder what the hell's down there.

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,833
Judd Hirsch?

18
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:10,503
Hey.

19
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:13,595
What's going on?

20
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:15,968
Nothing.

21
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:17,637
all right.

22
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:21,104
Hi, boys. Your ride is here.

23
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:24,206
Hey, you're just in time.
Mort's one ball away from a perfect game.

24
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:26,478
Oh, God. The pressure's too much.

25
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,679
I just lost controI of my bladder.

26
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:33,522
Why didn't I clothespin the end
of my penis like MurieI told me to?

27
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:42,701
Oh, my God. You bowled a perfect game.

28
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:49,671
I just never stopped believing.
Say no to acid.

29
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:52,443
Jeez, relax, Mort.
You'd think you were God himself.

30
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:54,035
No, he's over there.

31
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,545
Hey, you want to see what I can do?
all right, ready? Check it out.

32
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,811
Beer, glass. all right, now watch this.

33
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:02,285
Oh, hey.
Guess I'll go over here for a minute.

34
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:04,114
Oh, holy crap!

35
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,351
That's still pouring itself. Oh, wow.
That's amazing.

36
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,893
I've never seen anyone do that.
You want to go out later?

37
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:10,929
I'll be right back. I'm gonna go tinkle.

38
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,521
Okay, everybody ready?
Hey, where's Quagmire?

39
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:40,954
Would you just sit down
and go to the bathroom already?

40
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,160
A scandaI at
the Quahog Bowling alley tonight...

41
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,130
where a locaI man, Glenn Quagmire...

42
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:49,167
was charged with peeping
in the ladies'room.

43
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:50,998
Coming up, Diane's weight.

44
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:55,935
He's all yours, Joe.

45
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:58,272
You're lucky I've got some extra pull
around here...

46
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,778
thanks to my 18 medals for heroism.

47
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,609
There he goes again with the medals.

48
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:06,014
Hey, Joe, if you love your medals so much,
why don't you marry them?

49
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,780
I did something like that once.

50
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:09,445
And in the event of your death...

51
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:12,184
you'd like the insurance policy
to be paid to your wife?

52
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,418
Yup.

53
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,926
And your wife is this piece of pie?

54
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,657
You got it. Love you.

55
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:20,595
Okay, sign here.

56
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,533
You know what? You can probably
go ahead and canceI that.

57
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,867
Well, well, look who's here.

58
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:31,535
all right, all right,
look, I know an apology is due here...

59
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:35,205
so, Lois, tell Quagmire
you're sorry you had him arrested.

60
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:38,648
Excuse me?
He's the one who owes me an apology.

61
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:40,514
He was watching me go to the bathroom.

62
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,885
Well, clearly he thinks you're attractive,
Lois. It's a positive thing.

63
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,788
Thank you, Glenn,
for complimenting our family.

64
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:49,224
We have had it
with his disrespect for women.

65
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,389
We're petitioning the city to have him
removed from the neighborhood.

66
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,934
Yeah, I don't want to bring a new baby
into the world with him running around.

67
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:59,129
First of all, Bonnie, you've been pregnant
for six years, all right?

68
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,467
Either have the baby or don't.

69
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,770
Second of all, Quagmire's a good guy.
He's just a little mixed up.

70
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:12,308
- This isn't medium rare.
- Then have them take it back.

71
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:33,418
Sorry about that.

72
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:36,962
Second of all, Quagmire's a good guy,
you know? He's just a little mixed up.

73
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,930
That's all. Come on.
Give him another chance, eh?

74
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:43,126
all right. But one more incident
like the one at the bowling alley...

75
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,067
and Quagmire is out of this neighborhood.

76
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,271
Now, don't worry about a thing, Quagmire.

77
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,435
Your pals are gonna
help you change your ways.

78
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:55,013
I don't know, Peter.
I'm not sure I can do this.

79
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,076
Meg, get out of the way.

80
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:08,988
all right, Glenn. This exercise
should help teach you self-controI.

81
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,628
Here's this month's
Victoria's Secret catalog.

82
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,794
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Dead kittens. Dead kittens.

83
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,065
Old nuns. Really old nuns.

84
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:22,164
Renee Zellweger. Oh, there we go.

85
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,240
- all right.
- You did good. Good.

86
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,474
Peter, are you sure
Quagmire is ready to be out in public?

87
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,880
Nothing to worry about, Lois.

88
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:34,418
We figured out
a foolproof rehabilitation method.

89
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,887
I got the idea from when Brian
had to wear that cone after his operation.

90
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,481
Okay, if I make this,
we're all gonna get laid.

91
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,891
Yes! Score! Score!

92
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:46,556
Boy, I'd really like to
chew on my crotch right now.

93
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:49,530
Okay, Quagmire.
Time to take off your training wheels.

94
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,969
Okay, I think I'm ready.

95
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,936
Oh, boy.

96
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,172
- What's the matter, Glenn?
- Nothing.

97
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,175
Oh, Stacie, you dropped
your pompom in the water.

98
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:07,980
- I'll get it for you.
- I'll come with you.

99
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,349
- Me, too.
- But wait a minute.

100
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:12,720
We don't want to get our sweaters all wet.
Better take them off.

101
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,088
Splash fight!

102
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:25,365
Oh, God. Oh, God. I need some air.

103
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:31,900
Naked plastic chicks.

104
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:45,287
- Where am I? Am I dead?
- No.

105
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:48,224
This is where we monitor
all the dressing rooms in the mall...

106
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,022
so we can keep an eye out for shoplifters.

107
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,357
You don't say.

108
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,058
Oh, my God!
That one's having a heart attack!

109
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,340
- That was amazing.
- You saved her life.

110
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:11,177
Thank God you know CPR.

111
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,876
What the hell's CPR?

112
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:17,654
Congratulations, Quagmire.

113
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,317
You're the newest member
of my wall of fame.

114
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:21,620
What's wrong, Peter?

115
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,560
It's nothing, Joe. I don't know.

116
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:27,132
It's just that all you guys
have something to be proud of.

117
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,691
Quagmire got a key to the city.
Mort bowled a perfect game.

118
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:32,862
You're always getting medals
for catching crooks.

119
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,440
Hell, even Cleveland
used to be an accomplished auctioneer.

120
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:39,375
I have 125. Do I hear 130? $130,000
for this authentic Comanche headdress?

121
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:42,777
I got 130. Do I hear 135? 140? Do I hear-

122
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,314
135, going once.

123
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,316
I'm the only one here
who's got nothing, you know?

124
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,483
If I die tomorrow, there's nothing
people would remember me for.

125
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:58,053
Not if you jumped off a skyscraper
and landed on Joan Cusack.

126
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:03,060
People would say, "Hey, remember
that guy who landed on Joan Cusack?"

127
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,034
Well, things are gonna change.

128
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:08,538
From this day forth, people are gonna
know the name Peter Griffin...

129
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,632
even if I have to shout it
from the rooftops.

130
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:13,105
You hear that, world?

131
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:16,340
I am gonna do something
that people will remember me for.

132
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:22,217
Oh, God! Sorry, sorry. Hey, Joan Cusack.

133
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:24,482
Hello?

134
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:26,692
Oh-oh.

135
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:44,334
Peter, if you'd just let me talk, I'll explain
to you why you shouldn't do this.

136
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:47,412
Later, Brian. I gotta do something
people will remember me for...

137
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:51,040
which is why I've invented
a new type of flying machine.

138
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:53,947
You know, I vaguely recall
seeing footage somewhere...

139
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:58,786
of something exactly like this that leads
me to believe this probably won't work.

140
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,687
all right, Stewie. Let her rip.

141
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:05,831
all right...

142
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:09,799
we attack the Rice Krispie guys at dawn,
assuming Judd Hirsch delivers the goods.

143
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:15,337
Brian, this time, I think I got just the thing
people will remember me for.

144
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,899
I am gonna stop pollution
with my new lovable character...

145
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,206
Gary the No-Trash Cougar.

146
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:28,012
Pick up your trash!
I want to know whose cup this is.

147
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,279
I said I want to know whose cup this is!

148
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,891
Pick it up!

149
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:36,721
Thank you, sweetie.

150
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:39,855
See what a nicer place this is
when we all pitch in?

151
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,999
Like Gary the No-Trash Cougar says:

152
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,366
"Give a larbage, throw out your garbage. "

153
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:46,597
Spread the word.

154
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:57,004
Those freaking elves, man.
They just came out of the trees, man.

155
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:00,279
- They just came out of the trees.
- You saved my ass back there.

156
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,648
You saved mine.

157
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:05,148
- Here's to Snap.
- To Snap.

158
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:07,320
This sucks.

159
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:10,054
I've been working on this all week
and I keep coming up dry.

160
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:13,131
Who am I kidding? I'm never gonna
be remembered for anything.

161
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,700
Not like my great-great-uncles,
the Siamese twins...

162
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:17,564
who fought each other in the CiviI War.

163
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,434
- I'm seceding.
- Like hell you are.

164
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:24,403
Not too smart, huh?

165
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,705
Yeah, did not think that one through.

166
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,515
Peter, you have to stop
comparing yourself to other people...

167
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:33,608
and find out what's speciaI about you.

168
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:36,415
In sadder news, the man
who held the Guinness World Record...

169
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:40,288
for most drugs ever done
by a single human being died today.

170
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:44,190
He was attacked by a pack of wild dogs
he thought he saw.

171
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,589
There you go, Peter.
You could break a world record.

172
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,895
What, are you nuts?
I got no speciaI talents.

173
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:51,867
What can I do that nobody else does?

174
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,438
Well, you just ate my tip.

175
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,238
I got it!

176
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,781
Peter, you're really putting away
those Mentos.

177
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:07,546
These aren't Mentos, Lois.

178
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:11,612
Everybody, you're looking at a guy
who's gonna set a new world record.

179
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:16,423
I am gonna eat more nickels
than anyone has ever eaten before.

180
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,724
Setting this world record
is gonna make me famous...

181
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:21,299
just like the world's fattest twins
over there.

182
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:25,400
- Did I tell you that I'm doing Atkins?
- Oh, that's not good for you.

183
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,609
- Dad, I just don't hear it.
- Come on!

184
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,009
Really, Peter. It just doesn't-

185
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,412
You're telling me that doesn't sound
like Camptown Races?

186
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:38,744
Not one bit.

187
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,547
Do Short People!

188
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,680
This is the worst use of money
since I tricked out my big wheeI.

189
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:56,657
Hey, ladies, check out this ride. Yeah.

190
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,533
I'm off to make trouble
for the establishment.

191
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,705
I love you, Lois.

192
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:08,906
I love you, too, Peter.
Even if you are full of nickels.

193
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,223
Goodnight, honey.

194
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,397
Oh, my God, Lois. I can't see.

195
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,241
How about now?
No, nothing.

196
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,042
Well, that makes me feeI
much better.

197
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:44,740
You can't see the spaceship, either.

198
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,375
My cousin Marshall insists
if you look past the picture...

199
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:48,680
you can see a spaceship.

200
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:50,880
Can you please just tell us
what's wrong with my husband?

201
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,721
Oh, yes. You see, after ingesting
such a large number of metaI coins...

202
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,489
Mr. Griffin appears to have succumbed
to nickeI poisoning...

203
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:58,893
causing him to lose his sight.

204
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,990
Oh, my God, Lois. I'm blind as a bat.
I can't see a damn thing.

205
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,399
You know what else you can't see?
The writing on the wall.

206
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:06,937
Vaudeville's dead. And TV's the box
they're gonna bury it in.

207
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,405
Back then, everybody had a specialty.
I, for one, am a tumbler.

208
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:11,408
Watch me leap through this big hoop.

209
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,269
Vamp! Vamp!

210
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:25,018
So we're all gonna have to pitch in
and help your father out...

211
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,557
now that he's lost his sight.

212
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:29,058
Nobody took care of me
when I lost my arms and legs...

213
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,594
and was struck blind, deaf, and dumb.

214
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,425
Hey, Meg,
they got a Happy Days spoof in here...

215
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,262
but they call it Crappy Days.

216
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:40,296
all right, you know what?

217
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,897
If you're not gonna laugh,
then I'm not gonna keep you company.

218
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:46,808
This sucks. Now the only thing anybody's
gonna remember me for after I die...

219
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:48,743
is being that blind guy.

220
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,041
Don't give up yet, Peter.

221
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,709
I mean,
many blind people live rich, fulfilling lives.

222
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:56,219
I don't know, Brian.
I mean, I guess I can give it a shot.

223
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,456
Oh, my God, I almost didn't do it.
I almost didn't do it.

224
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,152
I thought, "Is this in bad taste?"

225
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:04,752
But you know what? I went for it.

226
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,854
I went for it and I am so glad I did.

227
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,762
Oh, worth it. Totally worth it.

228
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:25,415
- Hey, you still awake, Lois, honey?
- Dad?

229
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:27,781
That's right. I'm your daddy.

230
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,651
Don't talk, Lois. Don't talk.

231
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:34,089
Just let me do all the work. Yeah.

232
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:37,319
Now feeI my warm breath
on the nape of your neck.

233
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:42,466
My hands on your big soft boobs
running down your big manlike...

234
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,058
Holy crap, it's Chris.

235
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,839
So, how're you doing?

236
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,641
You do all your homework?
Finish all your subjects?

237
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,076
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

238
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,444
Just checking. Have a good night, Son.

239
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,552
You still awake, honey?
What the deuce?

240
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,190
- Peter, what the hell is that?
- This is my Seeing Eye dog, Brutus.

241
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,785
What do you need a Seeing Eye dog for?

242
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:15,196
Well, because I can't do anything
for myself, Brian. I can't drive.

243
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,790
I don't know when to cross the street.

244
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:18,699
And I took a dump
in the church confessionaI...

245
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,999
which I guess they frown upon
if you're not homeless.

246
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:23,472
I thought I could deaI with being blind
at first.

247
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:24,667
But I don't know.

248
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:27,712
I haven't felt this out of place
since that week I lived with Superman.

249
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:34,275
We must stop Lex Luthor before
he irradiates the world's supply of gold.

250
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,878
Hi, sorry.
I know you got a meeting going on. But...

251
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:42,926
So we are officially running low
on Mr. Pibb and Cheez-Its.

252
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:45,519
So just putting it out there.

253
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:48,065
If you're heading to the store later...

254
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:52,365
you know, 800-mile drive for me,
like, five seconds for you.

255
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,802
Whatever. I'm not here.

256
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,999
Peter, this is something
you're still adjusting to.

257
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,871
You can't expect
to get used to it overnight.

258
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:00,206
Whatever you say, Brian.
I'm going to The Clam.

259
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,279
Did Peter leave?

260
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,646
Yeah. Boy, he's really down about this.

261
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:08,548
I know. I'm so worried about him.

262
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:11,589
I've been looking into support groups
we could join to help him.

263
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,151
- Are you not wearing makeup?
- No, I just...

264
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,818
You know, since Peter went blind...

265
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,421
it's actually been kind of nice not to
have to worry about my appearance.

266
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:21,794
I see.

267
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,828
Is it really noticeable?

268
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,298
Well, a little mascara wouldn't kill you.

269
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:30,339
I was kind of thinking I'd try
an au natureI thing.

270
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:34,335
You think you have the skin for that?

271
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,209
Oh, let me light that for you, babe.

272
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:44,188
- Wow!
- Yeah, magic fingers.

273
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,158
- Jesus Christ!
- What?

274
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,955
Get the Escalade. We're out of here.

275
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,608
Come on, girI. I'm thirsty.

276
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:09,113
all right, you don't want to come in? Fine.
I'll just tie you to this parking meter.

277
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:18,317
Hey, Horace.

278
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:19,981
I'll have a Pawtucket Patriot.

279
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:22,891
So how's your hammer hanging?

280
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:25,920
Is somebody smoking in here?

281
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,458
Hey, you ever watch that show Scrubs?

282
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,697
Lois had it on the other night
and I was kind of fading in and out.

283
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:38,401
But, you know, I was watching and I'm
wondering, which one is the funny guy?

284
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:41,109
Peter, grab my hand!

285
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,681
- Jeez, Horace, you been drinking?
- Grab it and pull!

286
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:47,351
Come on, let's go.

287
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,524
And here comes the heroic blind man.

288
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:55,593
Tell us, sir, how did you summon
the courage to save your friend...

289
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,458
- from that burning building?
- That freaking place was on fire?

290
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:01,692
And there you have it.
Coming up next, watch me shave.

291
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,261
Peter, you're all right!

292
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,134
I am so proud of you
for saving Horace's life.

293
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,798
Yeah, Peter, you were amazing.

294
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:14,205
You know, Brian, I guess I was.
And you know what else?

295
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,609
People are gonna remember me for this.
