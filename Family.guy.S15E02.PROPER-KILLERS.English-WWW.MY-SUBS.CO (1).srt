11
00:00:43,068 --> 00:00:45,231
Ah, the Feast of San Gennaro.

12
00:00:45,232 --> 00:00:47,266
Every child here has seen a relative

13
00:00:47,267 --> 00:00:48,934
murdered in a barber chair.

14
00:00:48,935 --> 00:00:50,591
Step right up!

15
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:53,567
Teach an old Italian
lady how to use an iPad!

16
00:00:53,568 --> 00:00:55,708
Now, that sounds like
fun. I'll give it a try.

17
00:00:55,709 --> 00:00:58,544
Hey, how are you? Look
what I got for you.

18
00:00:58,545 --> 00:01:00,735
What is it? It's a tablet computer.

19
00:01:00,736 --> 00:01:01,770
I don't want it.

20
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:03,122
But you don't even know what it is.

21
00:01:03,123 --> 00:01:04,123
I don't want it.

22
00:01:04,124 --> 00:01:05,557
But you can watch movies on it.

23
00:01:05,558 --> 00:01:06,625
My eyes hurt.

24
00:01:06,626 --> 00:01:08,327
I'm trying to do something nice here!

25
00:01:08,328 --> 00:01:09,928
For the last time, I don't want it.

26
00:01:09,929 --> 00:01:12,598
I bet you if Joey was giving
it to you, you'd take it.

27
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:13,832
Don't you bring him into this.

28
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:15,234
Joey was a good boy.

29
00:01:15,235 --> 00:01:16,869
Oh, yeah, yeah, Joey was a good boy?

30
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,271
You thought he was making 100
grand a year hauling lumber?

31
00:01:19,272 --> 00:01:20,439
Don't you start with this.

32
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,774
He was dirty, Ma!

33
00:01:21,775 --> 00:01:23,842
I can't hear this! I won't hear it!

34
00:01:23,843 --> 00:01:25,611
- He was an angel!
- Oh, that's right.

35
00:01:25,612 --> 00:01:28,013
"Angel Joey," great
Joey, perfect Joey.

36
00:01:28,014 --> 00:01:29,548
I got to go to the church.

37
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:30,849
Oh, yeah, sure, light another candle.

38
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:31,850
That'll bring him back.

39
00:01:31,851 --> 00:01:33,118
You watch your tongue.

40
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,854
Admit it, you wish it was me
in that car instead of him!

41
00:01:35,855 --> 00:01:37,890
Just take your little TV and go!

42
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:39,558
It's an iPad, you dumb cow!

43
00:01:40,827 --> 00:01:43,829
I guess I don't have any sons now.

44
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,398
Ma! I'm sorry, Ma!

45
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,765
Ma! Ma!

46
00:01:49,135 --> 00:01:50,903
Hey, Bri, look over there.

47
00:01:50,904 --> 00:01:53,005
That guy looks like Frank Sinatra, Jr.

48
00:01:53,006 --> 00:01:54,340
Stewie, this is Federal Hill.

49
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:56,484
Everybody looks like
Frank Sinatra, Jr.

50
00:01:56,485 --> 00:01:57,076
Well, then who's that guy

51
00:01:57,077 --> 00:01:58,877
who looks like a young Frank Sinatra?

52
00:01:58,878 --> 00:02:00,713
Oh, that's Woody Allen's
son, but you're right,

53
00:02:00,714 --> 00:02:03,048
that other guy behind him
is Frank Sinatra, Jr.

54
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:04,683
Stewie! Elliot!

55
00:02:04,684 --> 00:02:06,318
It-it's actually Brian.

56
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:08,187
We've-we've met many times before.

57
00:02:08,188 --> 00:02:09,747
Then who's Elliot?

58
00:02:09,748 --> 00:02:11,299
I-I really wouldn't know.

59
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,258
This is a bad start to
whatever we're doing.

60
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:15,661
Well, now, what brings you
fellas to the festival?

61
00:02:15,662 --> 00:02:17,830
My dad will drive long
distances for ice

62
00:02:17,831 --> 00:02:19,164
with colored liquid in it.

63
00:02:19,165 --> 00:02:20,299
They got blue!

64
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,067
And we all love the Italian food.

65
00:02:22,068 --> 00:02:23,969
Oh, you like Italian food?

66
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,337
Want a meatball?

67
00:02:25,338 --> 00:02:27,473
Yeah, I'm gonna pass on
that, but it's a shame

68
00:02:27,474 --> 00:02:30,142
we can't get good Italian
food like this in Quahog.

69
00:02:30,143 --> 00:02:32,411
Well, maybe the three
of us ought to open

70
00:02:32,412 --> 00:02:34,079
an Italian restaurant there.

71
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,220
Open our own Italian restaurant?

72
00:02:36,221 --> 00:02:37,916
I say, that sounds fun.

73
00:02:37,917 --> 00:02:40,919
You, uh, you keep
meatballs in your jacket?

74
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,760
Oh, yeah, all my pockets are
lined with Reynolds Wrap.

75
00:02:43,761 --> 00:02:45,395
I learned that from my old buddies:

76
00:02:45,396 --> 00:02:47,731
Dean Martin, Jr., Joey Bishop, Jr.,

77
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:49,565
and Sammy Davis the Third.

78
00:02:50,635 --> 00:02:52,235
Hey, where's Chris?

79
00:02:52,236 --> 00:02:54,137
He's over there playing
that carnival game.

80
00:02:54,138 --> 00:02:55,438
Step right up!

81
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,408
Everybody take a chance
on Whack-a-Big-a-Pussy!

82
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:01,645
Hey, Ton'!

83
00:03:01,646 --> 00:03:03,947
This is not what I thought it was!

84
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,010
Oh, my God, Chris is out of control!

85
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:09,719
I know!

86
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,355
It must be all the violence
in movies and sex on TV.

87
00:03:12,356 --> 00:03:13,557
Oh.

88
00:03:13,558 --> 00:03:15,024
See, I listen.

89
00:03:20,364 --> 00:03:22,232
Peter, we need to talk
about what happened

90
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:23,300
at the street fair.

91
00:03:23,301 --> 00:03:25,035
Lois, it's an Italian festival.

92
00:03:25,036 --> 00:03:26,503
You're supposed to yell "Bella, Bella"

93
00:03:26,504 --> 00:03:28,538
and grab as much fat ass as you can.

94
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:30,440
No, I'm talking about Chris.

95
00:03:30,441 --> 00:03:33,343
I had no idea he had so
much pent-up aggression.

96
00:03:33,344 --> 00:03:36,179
We have to deal with his anger
issues before he hurts himself.

97
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,581
Ah, that's good thinking, Lois.

98
00:03:37,582 --> 00:03:38,782
I've seen what happens

99
00:03:38,783 --> 00:03:40,784
when people hold in their
aggression for too long.

100
00:03:40,785 --> 00:03:43,085
Don't forget, I was in
that elevator with Jay-Z.

101
00:03:44,255 --> 00:03:46,056
Hey, could you have
your guy hit "two"?

102
00:03:46,057 --> 00:03:47,924
I got to get down to
the business center

103
00:03:47,925 --> 00:03:49,326
to print out my boarding pass.

104
00:03:49,327 --> 00:03:51,461
Oh! Hey! That's gonna leave a mark!

105
00:03:51,462 --> 00:03:53,229
That's from a movie.

106
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,799
So, you girls traveling
with your dad here?

107
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,267
Hey, don't kick him, Muddy Shoes.

108
00:03:57,268 --> 00:03:58,902
He's got a white suit on.

109
00:03:58,903 --> 00:04:01,438
Hey, look, I don't know if you
guys are really staying here,

110
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,073
but you can't get into the
pool without a room key.

111
00:04:07,712 --> 00:04:10,080
Okay, Chris, your mom
and I want to help you

112
00:04:10,081 --> 00:04:12,549
get out some of that aggression,
so I thought you and me

113
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,450
could huck rotten
apples at passing cars.

114
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,589
Oh, I didn't know we had
brown apple in the forecast.

115
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,390
Welp, we needed it.

116
00:04:23,995 --> 00:04:26,295
Wow, can I have a turn?

117
00:04:33,104 --> 00:04:35,972
Hey, which one of you threw
that apple at my car?

118
00:04:35,973 --> 00:04:37,741
He did it. He dragged me out here.

119
00:04:37,742 --> 00:04:39,275
I wanted to be in school, sir.

120
00:04:39,276 --> 00:04:41,311
Where'd you get a
cannon like that, kid?

121
00:04:41,312 --> 00:04:43,613
I work out my right arm
three times a day.

122
00:04:43,614 --> 00:04:44,748
Mm, Free weights?

123
00:04:44,749 --> 00:04:47,550
No, mostly JPEGs of Helen
Hunt on my hard drive.

124
00:04:47,551 --> 00:04:49,719
Well, I'm Coach Doyle, and I
head up the baseball team

125
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,787
at James Woods High.

126
00:04:50,788 --> 00:04:53,156
What fake class do they
also make you teach?

127
00:04:53,157 --> 00:04:55,191
- Driver's ed, right?
- No, wood shop.

128
00:04:55,192 --> 00:04:56,760
Ah, that was my second guess.

129
00:04:56,761 --> 00:04:58,595
Tell me, son, how would
you like to pitch

130
00:04:58,596 --> 00:04:59,896
for the high school team?

131
00:04:59,897 --> 00:05:02,265
Baseball's the sport people
play while eating, right?

132
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:04,768
Oh, yeah, sometimes I even
watch a whole Blacklist.

133
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:06,970
I don't know, I've never
played baseball before.

134
00:05:06,971 --> 00:05:09,039
Oh, come on, Chris, you got to do it.

135
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,440
If you don't, you'll regret it.

136
00:05:10,441 --> 00:05:13,710
Just like Jesus' friend, Evan,
who bailed on the Last Supper.

137
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:15,979
Aw, they did a painting?

138
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,631
I would've gone if I knew they
were gonna do a painting.

139
00:05:22,887 --> 00:05:24,320
Here we are, fellas.

140
00:05:24,321 --> 00:05:27,724
The future site of Quahog's
newest Italian restaurant.

141
00:05:27,725 --> 00:05:29,626
Wow, this is a great location.

142
00:05:29,627 --> 00:05:30,927
Can we afford this?

143
00:05:30,928 --> 00:05:32,095
Sure we can.

144
00:05:32,096 --> 00:05:33,797
I set up one of those Kickstarters.

145
00:05:33,798 --> 00:05:35,498
Then I realized how stupid that is

146
00:05:35,499 --> 00:05:38,068
and I went to the bank for
a loan like an adult.

147
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:40,770
Now, fellas, the tables should
all be bolted to the floor

148
00:05:40,771 --> 00:05:42,172
to prevent theft.

149
00:05:42,173 --> 00:05:43,907
You know, most restaurants
go out of business

150
00:05:43,908 --> 00:05:46,109
because people are
stealing the tables.

151
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,678
The toilets should also
be bolted to the floor.

152
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:50,780
I think that's pretty
standard, Frank, but okay.

153
00:05:50,781 --> 00:05:52,849
Great. Now let's go find
some chump's restaurant

154
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,050
and steal his tables and toilets.

155
00:06:03,728 --> 00:06:06,496
James Woods is winning for
now, but y'all never know

156
00:06:06,497 --> 00:06:08,732
what might happen in
the moments to come.

157
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:10,900
I mean, look, there's
two baseball guys

158
00:06:10,901 --> 00:06:12,602
out on the bases right now.

159
00:06:12,603 --> 00:06:15,070
What if they's run to
the scoring place?

160
00:06:18,609 --> 00:06:20,944
Oh, here comes a new boy.

161
00:06:20,945 --> 00:06:22,545
All right, Chris!

162
00:06:22,546 --> 00:06:24,814
Wow, I've never seen him
run onto a baseball field

163
00:06:24,815 --> 00:06:27,751
when he wasn't chasing a duck
or being chased by a duck.

164
00:06:27,752 --> 00:06:29,119
That a duck over there?

165
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,120
Ah, come on!

166
00:06:30,121 --> 00:06:31,654
What the hell's Coach Doyle thinking

167
00:06:31,655 --> 00:06:33,457
bringing in that fat slob?!

168
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,416
You know what?

169
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:38,428
I bet you a hundred bucks that
"fat slob" strikes this kid out.

170
00:06:38,429 --> 00:06:40,229
Ha, you're on.

171
00:06:43,267 --> 00:06:44,501
Strike one!

172
00:06:48,272 --> 00:06:49,640
Strike two!

173
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:50,791
Ooh!

174
00:06:58,682 --> 00:07:00,016
Strike three!

175
00:07:02,052 --> 00:07:04,354
Three strikes and he's out,

176
00:07:04,355 --> 00:07:06,955
just like my cousin
Freddie with the drugs.

177
00:07:08,025 --> 00:07:10,560
Holy crap, a hundred bucks!

178
00:07:10,561 --> 00:07:11,860
Hey, nice going, Chris!

179
00:07:13,664 --> 00:07:16,099
Wow, look how proud my dad is.

180
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,733
Oh, my God, a duck!

181
00:07:19,136 --> 00:07:20,503
It was a trap!

182
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:30,317
Guys, tonight the drinks are on me.

183
00:07:30,318 --> 00:07:33,086
I just won a hundred bucks
off Chris's baseball game.

184
00:07:33,087 --> 00:07:34,788
Really? How'd you do that?

185
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:37,457
This dad took one look at
Chris and thought he'd suck,

186
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,593
but it turns out Chris
is a great pitcher.

187
00:07:39,594 --> 00:07:42,362
I'm so proud of the money
I won betting on him.

188
00:07:42,363 --> 00:07:44,865
You know, I bet there are
plenty of other baseball dads

189
00:07:44,866 --> 00:07:46,467
who'd also assume Chris stinks.

190
00:07:46,468 --> 00:07:47,801
Peter, we could make a lot of money.

191
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:50,604
Yeah, we could make
Toni Braxton money.

192
00:07:50,605 --> 00:07:52,406
Is that... is that a lot?

193
00:07:52,407 --> 00:07:54,742
It's a lot, and then nothing.

194
00:07:54,743 --> 00:07:58,130
And then a record whose proceeds
go directly to creditors.

Every successful restaurant

That's what we're lacking.

No, we're not.

219
00:09:09,184 --> 00:09:11,554
Frank, you're the hook! That's right.

220
00:09:11,555 --> 00:09:13,875
We just need to make you the
face of the restaurant.

221
00:09:13,876 --> 00:09:16,204
It may be the five
loaves of garlic bread

Look at this, guys.

264
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:39,080
I can't believe we made
all this in one game.

265
00:11:39,081 --> 00:11:40,448
Yeah, I'm having a great time

266
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:42,517
handling this money and
then touching my eyeball.

Jerome, another round
for my blurry friends.

00:11:45,655 --> 00:11:47,189
Yeah, we got a good thing going.

269
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,224
We just have to keep
Chris's talent a secret.

270
00:11:49,225 --> 00:11:51,159
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.

271
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,695
Our top story tonight, the
James Woods High baseball team

272
00:11:53,696 --> 00:11:55,797
is headed to the
district championship,

273
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:59,267
thanks to their secret weapon,
star pitcher Chris Griffin.

274
00:11:59,268 --> 00:12:01,870
Ah, crap, now everyone
knows Chris is a ringer!

275
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:04,005
Tom Tucker just ruined everything.

276
00:12:04,006 --> 00:12:06,807
This sucks even worse than
when I stubbed my toe.

277
00:12:08,277 --> 00:12:09,611
Aah!

278
00:12:09,612 --> 00:12:12,714
Why does everything bad
always happen to me?!

279
00:12:12,715 --> 00:12:16,384
Answer me, guy in box
and guy on cross!

280
00:12:22,925 --> 00:12:24,526
Stewie, can I talk to you?

281
00:12:24,527 --> 00:12:27,062
Look, Brian, I affectionately
pat all the waiters on the ass.

282
00:12:27,063 --> 00:12:28,930
And if anyone has a problem with it,

283
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:30,298
they should come to me directly!

284
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:31,566
No, no, it's not that.

285
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:32,867
I-I've been going
through our receipts,

286
00:12:32,868 --> 00:12:34,502
and we're actually losing money.

287
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,071
Well, yeah, duh.

288
00:12:36,072 --> 00:12:37,505
Frank comps every meal.

289
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,974
Look, he's doing it again.

290
00:12:38,975 --> 00:12:40,976
Little-known secret
about Charlton Heston.

291
00:12:40,977 --> 00:12:42,744
Never used toilet paper.

292
00:12:42,745 --> 00:12:44,379
Just drop and go.

293
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,780
Uh, here, let me get
that check for you.

294
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,388
Well, it's official.

295
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:55,657
Nobody wants to bet against Chris now.

296
00:12:55,658 --> 00:12:56,992
Damn it! I can't believe my kid

297
00:12:56,993 --> 00:12:58,426
isn't making money for us anymore.

298
00:12:58,427 --> 00:13:00,862
I feel like Jessica Simpson's dad.

299
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,897
Well, there are plenty
of guys willing to bet

300
00:13:02,898 --> 00:13:05,333
on James Woods High to
win, I'll tell you that.

301
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:08,570
The only way we could ever make
money now is if Chris lost.

302
00:13:08,571 --> 00:13:10,730
Wait a minute, Joe, that's it!

303
00:13:10,731 --> 00:13:12,340
All we got to do is take those bets

304
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:13,934
and get Chris to take a dive!

305
00:13:13,935 --> 00:13:15,074
Wait, hold on, Peter.

306
00:13:15,075 --> 00:13:18,013
You're gonna ask your own
son to lose on purpose?

307
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:19,214
Damn, Quagmire!

308
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,849
Your fridge gives you
water from the door?

309
00:13:25,254 --> 00:13:26,988
Hey, champ, what you doing?

310
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:28,590
My Spanish homework.

311
00:13:28,591 --> 00:13:31,470
Oh, well, then maybe I'll just
say this to you in Spanish.

00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,548
Calm down. This is how
they package Snapple now.

321
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:04,383
They're trying to trick
kids into drinking it.

322
00:14:04,384 --> 00:14:05,818
You may not believe this,

323
00:14:05,819 --> 00:14:08,087
but there was a time when
Snapple ruled the nation.

324
00:14:08,088 --> 00:14:09,488
Preposterous!

325
00:14:09,489 --> 00:14:11,790
It's true. Even Jerry
Seinfeld drank it.

326
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,893
And he was the president of the '90s.

327
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,195
But why are you so down?

328
00:14:16,196 --> 00:14:19,632
Dad told me I have to lose the
championship game on purpose.

329
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:20,733
He what?!

330
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,102
Peter, get in here right now!

331
00:14:23,103 --> 00:14:25,604
Wow, someone's day-horny!

332
00:14:25,605 --> 00:14:26,772
Oh, hey, Chris.

333
00:14:26,773 --> 00:14:28,407
Did you tell Chris he had to lose

334
00:14:28,408 --> 00:14:29,742
the district championship?!

335
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,943
Let me just get a
garbage bag. Hold on.

336
00:14:35,315 --> 00:14:37,283
Okay, now that I'm decent.

337
00:14:37,284 --> 00:14:39,685
Yes, I did tell Chris
to throw the game.

338
00:14:39,686 --> 00:14:41,387
But it's okay; it's for gambling.

339
00:14:41,388 --> 00:14:44,256
What?! You're betting on
Chris's baseball team?!

340
00:14:44,257 --> 00:14:46,525
Technically against
Chris's baseball team.

341
00:14:46,526 --> 00:14:47,793
Are you crazy?!

342
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:49,295
Do I look crazy?!

343
00:14:49,296 --> 00:14:51,163
What do you think puts
the food on our table

344
00:14:51,164 --> 00:14:52,631
and the garbage bags on our backs?!

345
00:14:52,632 --> 00:14:54,333
Chris, your father's a jackass.

346
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:55,734
When you get on that field,

347
00:14:55,735 --> 00:14:57,903
you try your very
best and play to win.

348
00:14:57,904 --> 00:14:59,505
You understand me?

349
00:14:59,506 --> 00:15:01,640
Yeah. Thanks, Mom.

350
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:03,242
But, Lois, if Chris wins that game,

351
00:15:03,243 --> 00:15:05,874
I'll be out a ton of money and
I'll have to kiss a fella!

352
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,504
I take all kinds of bets.

353
00:15:11,885 --> 00:15:13,686
Hey, Frank, we have to talk.

354
00:15:13,687 --> 00:15:16,255
You've got to stop giving
away all the food for free.

355
00:15:16,256 --> 00:15:18,324
Yeah, otherwise there's no way
we're gonna make a profit.

356
00:15:18,325 --> 00:15:20,359
Oh, we don't have to
worry about money.

357
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,895
I might be doing a Duets
thing with that Lady Goo-Ga.

358
00:15:22,896 --> 00:15:24,296
Uh-huh, that's wrong.

359
00:15:24,297 --> 00:15:25,698
Anyway, the restaurant's
gonna go under

360
00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:27,066
if you keep giving away food.

361
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:28,500
All right, all right.

362
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:29,802
Thank you, Frank.

363
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,836
I appreciate you trying it my way.

364
00:15:32,687 --> 00:15:34,187
Thank you.

365
00:15:34,188 --> 00:15:35,222
What was that?

366
00:15:35,223 --> 00:15:36,490
Oh, I get 40 bucks

367
00:15:36,491 --> 00:15:38,878
every time somebody says "my way."

368
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,660
Nancy gets 60.

369
00:15:45,032 --> 00:15:46,700
What do you mean Chris
won't take a dive?!

370
00:15:46,701 --> 00:15:48,335
We already took a ton of bets!

371
00:15:48,336 --> 00:15:49,636
Look, I'm sorry, you guys,

372
00:15:49,637 --> 00:15:51,905
but my hot piece-of-ass
wife says no way.

373
00:15:51,906 --> 00:15:54,474
It's a weird time to brag
about your wife, Peter.

374
00:15:54,475 --> 00:15:56,343
I don't know, I've just
been so horny today.

375
00:15:56,344 --> 00:15:57,978
Oh, man, I don't need to know that!

376
00:15:57,979 --> 00:15:59,246
Well, pull it together, Peter,

377
00:15:59,247 --> 00:16:00,981
'cause we're about to
lose a lot of money!

378
00:16:00,982 --> 00:16:02,616
I know.

379
00:16:02,617 --> 00:16:04,351
We're screwed once
Chris takes the mound

380
00:16:04,352 --> 00:16:06,186
with that awesome arm of his.

381
00:16:06,187 --> 00:16:08,989
Wait, so what you're saying
is Chris isn't the problem,

382
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,290
his arm is.

383
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:11,591
I guess.

384
00:16:12,878 --> 00:16:15,195
Okay. We hear you, Peter.

385
00:16:15,196 --> 00:16:17,297
Loud and clear.

386
00:16:17,298 --> 00:16:19,766
Yeah, we'll fix this problem.

387
00:16:19,767 --> 00:16:21,401
You guys are creeping me out.

388
00:16:21,402 --> 00:16:23,303
All right, I'm gonna
exit while discreetly

389
00:16:23,304 --> 00:16:25,271
checking out the hot
chick by the door.

390
00:16:32,246 --> 00:16:33,880
You guys heard what I heard, right?

391
00:16:33,881 --> 00:16:36,216
Peter just asked us
to break Chris's arm.

392
00:16:36,217 --> 00:16:37,617
Well, he intimated.

393
00:16:37,618 --> 00:16:38,885
I don't know what that means,

394
00:16:38,886 --> 00:16:41,321
but let's go rough up a
teenager for beer money!

395
00:16:41,322 --> 00:16:43,389
Oh, I call biting!

396
00:16:49,397 --> 00:16:52,098
Okay, there's the baseball
team's locker room right there.

397
00:16:52,099 --> 00:16:54,367
Perfect! And we look like
regular high school students,

398
00:16:54,368 --> 00:16:56,335
so we'll fit right in.

399
00:16:58,205 --> 00:17:00,574
Joe, are you sure about these clothes?

400
00:17:00,575 --> 00:17:03,777
Trust me. I bought the absolute
latest issue of Archie comics,

401
00:17:03,778 --> 00:17:06,478
and this is what the kids are wearing.

402
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:09,549
Oh, hey, fellow teens.

403
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,385
Wait a minute, teenagers
don't have wheelchairs!

404
00:17:12,386 --> 00:17:15,354
No! Oh, no!

405
00:17:20,628 --> 00:17:23,229
Okay, guys, we've served
our last free meal.

406
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,531
Here I go with the check.

407
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:27,834
Oh, I'm sorry.

408
00:17:27,835 --> 00:17:29,169
Last time we ate here,

409
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,538
Mr. Sinatra's son said it was free.

410
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:33,239
Okay, uh, everyone, new policy!

411
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,241
As is the case with many restaurants,

412
00:17:35,242 --> 00:17:37,644
you're going to have
to pay for your food.

413
00:17:37,645 --> 00:17:40,280
What? This food ain't
worth paying for.

414
00:17:40,281 --> 00:17:43,182
Yeah, the only reason we eat
here is 'cause it's free.

415
00:17:44,418 --> 00:17:46,886
Look whose restaurant
thinks it's so good!

416
00:17:46,887 --> 00:17:49,756
Oh, yeah? If it was Joey's
restaurant, you would've paid.

417
00:17:51,192 --> 00:17:52,993
Ma!

418
00:17:52,994 --> 00:17:54,327
I'm sorry, Ma!

419
00:17:54,328 --> 00:17:56,392
Ma!

420
00:17:57,102 --> 00:17:58,637
I can't believe it.

421
00:17:58,638 --> 00:17:59,839
They hated us.

422
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,810
Well, fellas, we gave
it our best shot.

423
00:18:01,811 --> 00:18:03,770
If you need me, I'll be
back in Palm Springs,

424
00:18:03,771 --> 00:18:06,653
which has been completely
taken over by the gays.

425
00:18:07,608 --> 00:18:09,709
So, want to grab whatever wine is left

426
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,111
and then burn the place down?

427
00:18:11,112 --> 00:18:13,113
Maybe, but first, let's
have an unearned

428
00:18:13,114 --> 00:18:15,248
end-of-the-series moment
where we turn out the lights

429
00:18:15,249 --> 00:18:16,715
on our own place.

430
00:18:18,986 --> 00:18:21,520
Sorry, pal, we're closed.

431
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,492
Peter, we've got great news!

432
00:18:48,493 --> 00:18:49,826
Chris isn't playing!

433
00:18:49,827 --> 00:18:51,161
He's not? Why?

434
00:18:51,162 --> 00:18:53,274
Well, 'cause we broke his
arm like you told us to.

435
00:18:53,275 --> 00:18:54,943
Shattered. We shattered his arm.

436
00:18:54,944 --> 00:18:57,078
You what?! I never
told you to do that!

437
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:59,114
You didn't? That's what
I thought I heard.

438
00:18:59,115 --> 00:19:02,117
Quagmire, this is humbling,
but it may be time

439
00:19:02,118 --> 00:19:04,619
for all of us to talk
about hearing aids.

440
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,054
I feel terrible! I got
to go find my son!

441
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,326
Chris!

442
00:19:11,327 --> 00:19:14,395
Dad, my arm's broke!
And look, a Camaro!

443
00:19:14,396 --> 00:19:16,564
Oh, that guy must be so boss.

444
00:19:16,565 --> 00:19:19,400
But listen, Chris, I had no
idea this was gonna happen.

445
00:19:19,401 --> 00:19:21,369
Look, I was wrong to
bet on your games,

446
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,738
and it's even worse that
I told you to lose.

447
00:19:23,739 --> 00:19:25,006
I'm so sorry.

448
00:19:25,007 --> 00:19:26,374
Oh, that's okay, Dad.

449
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,409
I just feel bad that my arm is broken

450
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:31,312
in so many places and hurts so much.

451
00:19:31,313 --> 00:19:33,581
No, Chris, I've been a
terrible dad lately.

452
00:19:34,146 --> 00:19:35,784
You found something you were great at,

453
00:19:35,785 --> 00:19:37,585
and instead of being happy for you,

454
00:19:37,586 --> 00:19:39,687
I tried to use it to make money.

455
00:19:39,688 --> 00:19:43,158
And now your arm is broken and
your baseball career is over.

456
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:44,759
Not necessarily.

457
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,127
What? What are you talking about?

458
00:19:46,128 --> 00:19:48,329
Well, for the last few
weeks, since my right arm's

459
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:52,300
been exhausted from pitching,
my left arm's had to, uh,

460
00:19:52,301 --> 00:19:55,164
pick up the slack in the bathroom.

461
00:20:08,304 --> 00:20:09,551
You see the pitcher?

462
00:20:09,552 --> 00:20:10,840
That's my kid.

463
00:20:15,057 --> 00:20:16,624
Aah! Son of a bitch!

464
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,059
Oh, my God!

465
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,727
Sorry, Mr. Quagmire!

466
00:20:19,728 --> 00:20:21,529
I heard that bone break.

467
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,664
My ears are fine.

468
00:20:27,469 --> 00:20:29,737
Well, Chris, we're very proud of you

469
00:20:29,738 --> 00:20:31,673
for making it to the
district championship.

470
00:20:31,674 --> 00:20:33,141
Thanks, Mom.

471
00:20:33,142 --> 00:20:34,642
It was really something, Lois.

472
00:20:34,643 --> 00:20:37,145
The next pitch Chris threw
hit his coach in the head,

473
00:20:37,146 --> 00:20:39,647
so there was no one to
take him out of the game.

474
00:20:39,648 --> 00:20:41,583
Chris walked the next 46 batters.

475
00:20:41,584 --> 00:20:42,851
State record.

476
00:20:42,852 --> 00:20:45,119
Wow, Chris! State record!

477
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,667
Yeah, they got crushed.

478
00:20:46,668 --> 00:20:48,256
