don't know what's going on in here.

All right, now remember, Lando, don't get
a single scratch on the <i>Falcon</i>, okay?

312
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:56,077
Look, will you relax?
I already said I'll be careful.

313

Well, just make sure you are. That ship's
gotten me laid a bunch of times.

- Oh, nothing.

I'm never gonna see her again.

- I was just ironing my robe,

00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,144
taking a look around.
What's up?

328
00:24:10,341 --> 00:24:13,515
Well I just wanted to let you know
there's a rebel fleet massing at Sullust,

329
00:24:13,611 --> 00:24:15,716
and I think
they're going to invade or something.

330
00:24:15,847 --> 00:24:17,884
You made sure there wasn't a hole
in the Death Star this time?

to be concerned about.

It's of no concern!
The rebellion will soon be crushed,

- (LAUGHS) Yeah, most of it.

is worth the price we paid.

769
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:32,077
And save Yub Nub for me.

770
00:53:33,202 --> 00:53:35,705
Come to think of it, you can shave
your yub nub for me, too!

771
00:53:35,805 --> 00:53:37,045
(LAUGHS EXCITEDLY)

772
00:53:37,139 --> 00:53:38,140
I'll see you at 7:00.

773
00:53:46,382 --> 00:53:47,759
(STORMTROOPERS SCREAMING)

774
00:53:53,122 --> 00:53:54,829
(EWOKS CHATTERING)

775
00:53:55,591 --> 00:53:57,502
(YUB NUB PLAYING)

776
00:54:14,076 --> 00:54:16,056
What the hell, man?
I was gonna make it!

777
00:54:16,412 --> 00:54:18,653
Thanks for watching over me
and keeping me safe.

778
00:54:19,015 --> 00:54:20,892
Fuck you!
You murdered me, you ass.

779
00:54:29,559 --> 00:54:30,902
The end.

780
00:54:30,993 --> 00:54:34,099
And that's the final chapter
in the <i>Star Wars</i> saga.

781
00:54:34,196 --> 00:54:35,436
What about the prequels?

782
00:54:35,531 --> 00:54:37,101
I think <i>The Cleveland Show</i>
is gonna do those.

783
00:54:37,466 --> 00:54:40,538
Dad, one question.
What do you got against Seth Green?

784
00:54:40,836 --> 00:54:43,248
I just think he's a douche.
You got a problem with that?

785
00:54:43,539 --> 00:54:45,985
Well, we're all entitled to our own opinion.

786
00:54:46,075 --> 00:54:48,851
For example, me,
l think Seth MacFarlane is a douche.

787
00:54:49,145 --> 00:54:50,954
- What's that, now?
- Yeah, I don't like him, either.

788
00:54:51,113 --> 00:54:52,114
Yeah, me neither.

789
00:54:52,248 --> 00:54:54,353
Wait a second.
I hear he's a pretty nice guy.

790
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:56,452
Yeah, good-looking guy.
Talented, young...

791
00:54:56,652 --> 00:54:58,962
Talented?
He ripped off <i>The Simpsons</i>.

792
00:54:59,155 --> 00:55:01,396
Yeah, he watched TV in the '80s.
We get it.

793
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:03,663
And he only puts out, like,
ten new episodes a year.

794
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:06,467
And then he splits those up
into five DVD sets.

795
00:55:06,729 --> 00:55:08,367
He doesn't make those decisions, Chris.

796
00:55:08,464 --> 00:55:10,171
Those decisions are made
at the corporate level.

797
00:55:10,466 --> 00:55:13,106
But he still takes the money every week.
How noble.

798
00:55:13,269 --> 00:55:16,443
And doesn't he have a whole staff
that writes those episodes anyway?

799
00:55:16,539 --> 00:55:19,782
Well, I wouldn't know about that,
but I think, and I hope, Chris,

800
00:55:19,875 --> 00:55:22,719
that ultimately,
people will just remember the laughter.
