11
00:00:33,872 --> 00:00:36,407
And now, the Game Show Network presents,

12
00:00:36,408 --> 00:00:39,811
<i>Are We Talking About Jake
Gyllenhaal or Jared Leto?</i>

13
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:43,100
"I am oily-haired with
dinner-plate eyes."

14
00:00:44,182 --> 00:00:46,849
"I was in that one movie
about the weirdo."

15
00:00:48,053 --> 00:00:51,354
"I somehow look both
deathly ill and ripped."

16
00:00:52,358 --> 00:00:56,105
"I am a less successful
version of Tobey Maguire."

17
00:00:56,106 --> 00:00:57,829
Anyone? No?

18
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:02,700
"You would totally believe any
story about me being a dick."

19
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:04,802
I'm changing the channel.
I like both of them.

20
00:01:04,803 --> 00:01:06,237
Peter, did you see this?

21
00:01:06,238 --> 00:01:07,805
It says here that Carter Pewterschmidt

22
00:01:07,806 --> 00:01:10,319
has bought the
Pawtucket Patriot Brewery.

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,133
Now what's that?

24
00:01:11,134 --> 00:01:12,543
It's where you work, Peter.

25
00:01:12,544 --> 00:01:14,612
Why the hell would Daddy
buy the brewery?

26
00:01:14,613 --> 00:01:16,714
Well, there's children in the
room... watch your swearing...

27
00:01:16,715 --> 00:01:19,450
But apparently, he's looking
to diversify his holdings.

28
00:01:19,451 --> 00:01:23,123
Wow, Dad. I guess that means
Grandpa's your new boss.

29
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,895
Ah, crap. I don't want to work for him.

30
00:01:24,896 --> 00:01:27,191
I'd rather work for Doctor Frankenstein.

31
00:01:32,331 --> 00:01:34,924
- Igor, I did it!
- Hold on.

32
00:01:34,925 --> 00:01:37,068
You discovered the power
to create new life,

33
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:39,037
and you created a guy?

34
00:01:39,038 --> 00:01:43,184
So I should've made a woman so
I could have sex with a corpse?

35
00:01:43,185 --> 00:01:44,008
I don't know, man.

36
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:46,410
You just shouldn't have made a guy.

37
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,584
All right, now that
I'm in charge of this brewery,

38
00:01:53,585 --> 00:01:55,153
there's gonna be some changes
around here.

39
00:01:55,154 --> 00:01:59,123
For one thing, no more T-shirts
or dungarees in the work place.

40
00:01:59,757 --> 00:02:01,196
Dungarees are jeans!

41
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:03,795
Griffin? What are you doing here?

42
00:02:03,796 --> 00:02:05,296
I... I work here.

43
00:02:05,297 --> 00:02:06,898
You do? No way!

44
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,666
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

45
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:10,902
Effective immediately,
you're the guy at the office

46
00:02:10,903 --> 00:02:13,871
with a weird ski tan, but
you can't talk about it.

47
00:02:13,872 --> 00:02:15,707
Hey, what, did you go
skiing this weekend?

48
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,708
I'm not allowed to talk about it.

49
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,152
Aw, damn it.

50
00:02:31,656 --> 00:02:33,090
Morning, Brian.

51
00:02:33,092 --> 00:02:34,158
I'm afraid you ran a red light.

52
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:35,693
Your license please.

53
00:02:35,694 --> 00:02:36,928
Ugh. I swear, Joe,

54
00:02:36,929 --> 00:02:39,230
the light was still gray
when I went through it.

55
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:41,631
Mm-hmm. Are you aware this is expired?

56
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:42,133
What?

57
00:02:42,134 --> 00:02:43,735
Brian, step out of the vehicle.

58
00:02:43,736 --> 00:02:45,036
Wha-Wha... What? What's going on?

59
00:02:45,037 --> 00:02:46,437
Well, the law's clear.

60
00:02:46,438 --> 00:02:47,872
I have to confiscate your license,

61
00:02:47,873 --> 00:02:49,507
and you're gonna have to walk home.

62
00:02:49,508 --> 00:02:51,175
Well, can't you at least give me a ride?

63
00:02:51,176 --> 00:02:52,710
No can do, amigo.

64
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:54,911
Ugh. All right, I guess
I'll just call an Uber.

65
00:02:58,684 --> 00:03:01,752
Are you Brian?

66
00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:08,025
Ah, Griffin, there you are.

67
00:03:08,026 --> 00:03:09,894
I've decided that as your new boss,

68
00:03:09,895 --> 00:03:12,497
I'm gonna require you to
have a standing desk.

69
00:03:12,498 --> 00:03:14,665
Aw, but I'll look like such an ass!

70
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:15,967
And that's not all.

71
00:03:15,968 --> 00:03:17,635
You got to constantly tell everybody

72
00:03:17,636 --> 00:03:20,271
what a good idea it is,
and how important it is,

73
00:03:20,272 --> 00:03:22,540
and how wrong they are
for having traditional desks.

74
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,876
Can't I just work at it
and mind my own business?

75
00:03:24,877 --> 00:03:26,677
No, you have to be a freak about it.

76
00:03:26,678 --> 00:03:28,813
Maybe it can just be
my own personal choice,

77
00:03:28,814 --> 00:03:30,982
and-and I'm not judging
others for their choices.

78
00:03:30,983 --> 00:03:33,317
No. You being right means
everyone else is wrong.

79
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:36,320
That's what your standing desk
is saying to the chair people.

80
00:03:36,321 --> 00:03:38,489
From now on,
you call them "chair people."

81
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,576
Oh, and three times
a day you have to say,

82
00:03:40,577 --> 00:03:42,994
"Sitting is the biggest killer
in America."

83
00:03:54,592 --> 00:03:55,773
Good night, Peter.

84
00:03:55,774 --> 00:03:57,575
Good night,
gender-transitioned co-worker

85
00:03:57,576 --> 00:03:59,254
we had a whole meeting about.

86
00:04:00,078 --> 00:04:03,714
Mr. Pewterschmidt, what
you're ordering is illegal.

87
00:04:03,715 --> 00:04:05,025
I don't care about that.

88
00:04:05,026 --> 00:04:07,752
I want our beer cans made from
the cheapest material possible.

89
00:04:07,753 --> 00:04:08,413
But sir...

90
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,084
What about those metal toilets
where prisoners make wine?

91
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:12,030
Use those.

92
00:04:12,765 --> 00:04:15,126
But sir, if word got out
about this, it'd be one

93
00:04:15,127 --> 00:04:17,762
of the most notorious
developments in beer history,

94
00:04:17,763 --> 00:04:21,968
second only to Michelob Ultra
Dragon Fruit Peach.

95
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,242
Peter, are you sure you heard
Mr. Pewterschmidt correctly?

96
00:04:31,243 --> 00:04:34,512
He actually said
he wanted cheap, toxic materials

97
00:04:34,513 --> 00:04:37,248
inserted into the brewery's
supply stream?

98
00:04:37,249 --> 00:04:38,483
Well, his eyes looked different

99
00:04:38,484 --> 00:04:40,518
how he said it, but that was the gist.

100
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,987
Also, some of the brewery
workers say very hurtful things

101
00:04:42,988 --> 00:04:45,065
if a co-worker wears shorts.

102
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:46,123
Follow the money.

103
00:04:46,124 --> 00:04:47,592
Mr. Griffin, it sounds like

104
00:04:47,593 --> 00:04:49,760
you've brought me an interesting story.

105
00:04:49,761 --> 00:04:51,762
What should I do with it, Ollie?

106
00:04:51,763 --> 00:04:52,964
Make it news!

107
00:04:52,965 --> 00:04:54,732
Ah, you got a standing desk, too?

108
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:55,967
Sitting's bad!

109
00:04:55,968 --> 00:04:57,697
I know. They don't want
to hear it, though.

110
00:05:03,141 --> 00:05:05,643
Sir, there's
a reporter here to see you.

111
00:05:05,644 --> 00:05:08,179
Is it Kermit the Frog
when he's wearing a trench coat?

112
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,981
That tells you he's a reporter.

113
00:05:23,228 --> 00:05:26,264
Sir, an anonymous whistleblower
in the brewery says

114
00:05:26,265 --> 00:05:28,733
you've personally ordered
the sourcing of cut-rate,

115
00:05:28,734 --> 00:05:31,749
potentially toxic canning materials.

116
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,121
God, you're gorgeous.

117
00:05:33,122 --> 00:05:36,374
Mr. Pewterschmidt, I remind you,
this is on the record.

118
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,910
You ever been with a man
who's got a prostate

119
00:05:38,911 --> 00:05:41,397
the size of a beefsteak tomato?

120
00:05:51,404 --> 00:05:53,127
Oh, crap, it's Carter!

121
00:05:53,128 --> 00:05:54,821
I bet he's mad
I told the news about him.

122
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:56,693
I'll just do what Superman does.

123
00:05:58,297 --> 00:05:59,776
Oh, hey, Carter.

124
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:01,722
Hello, citizen. Have you seen Peter?

125
00:06:01,723 --> 00:06:04,468
Aw, he was just here!

126
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:05,670
Daddy, what's this about?

127
00:06:05,671 --> 00:06:07,405
Did Peter screw something up at work?

128
00:06:07,406 --> 00:06:09,473
No, I'm here because
I've got important news.

129
00:06:09,474 --> 00:06:12,662
Lois, everyone, I've left your mother,

130
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:14,896
and Tricia Takanawa
is moving in with me.

131
00:06:14,897 --> 00:06:16,742
Holy crap! What?!

132
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:17,748
I wanted you to know.

133
00:06:18,095 --> 00:06:19,796
I'm in love!

134
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:21,731
Well, good for you
for being honest, Carter.

135
00:06:21,732 --> 00:06:22,999
It's never good

136
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,068
to keep something
that matters to you a secret.

137
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:27,170
<i>Tell her about the surf camp
in Belize, Peter.</i>

138
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:28,395
<i>Tell her you're going.</i>

139
00:06:28,396 --> 00:06:30,296
<i>Tell her it's your dream,
and you deserve it.</i>

140
00:06:30,297 --> 00:06:32,098
<i>Tell her it'll make you a better father.</i>

141
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:33,433
What's that, Peter?

142
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,621
Ah, nothing. Just something stupid.

143
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:55,534
You're leaving Babs
for Tricia Takanawa?!

144
00:06:55,535 --> 00:06:57,503
And I've never been happier!

145
00:06:57,504 --> 00:06:59,338
What about Mom? Where is Mom?

146
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:02,116
The sanitarium. The sanitarium?!

147
00:07:02,117 --> 00:07:03,757
Yeah. I told her I was leaving her,

148
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:05,392
and she freaked out for no reason.

149
00:07:05,393 --> 00:07:07,987
And I'll tell you, I don't know
why they call it a "sanitarium."

150
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:09,568
That place is a filthy hell hole.

151
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:11,570
Oh, my God! That's awful!

152
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:14,239
Sorry. What'd you say?
I was texting Tricia.

153
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,475
She just sent me
a picture of her smoothie.

154
00:07:16,476 --> 00:07:19,116
"Looks good, babe."

155
00:07:23,116 --> 00:07:24,883
All right, class, let's get started.

156
00:07:24,884 --> 00:07:26,318
Stewie, what are you doing?

157
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,786
And why are you dressed like that?

158
00:07:27,787 --> 00:07:30,055
Because I'm your driver's
ed instructor, Brian.

159
00:07:30,056 --> 00:07:31,323
- You're what?
- That's right.

160
00:07:31,324 --> 00:07:32,658
I heard you lost your license,

161
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:34,293
and I'm gonna help you get it back.

162
00:07:34,294 --> 00:07:35,861
Uh... okay.

163
00:07:35,862 --> 00:07:37,563
Now, we've got a lot to cover.

164
00:07:37,564 --> 00:07:39,531
But first, let's watch a safety video

165
00:07:39,532 --> 00:07:42,667
designed to terrorize you into
being a responsible motorist.

166
00:07:48,074 --> 00:07:50,275
Come on, kid with a bright future.

167
00:07:50,276 --> 00:07:52,811
I'll give you a no-seatbelt car ride

168
00:07:52,812 --> 00:07:55,314
after this teen kegger party.

169
00:07:55,315 --> 00:07:56,515
I don't know.

170
00:07:56,516 --> 00:07:58,350
I'm going to Harvard-Yale tomorrow.

171
00:07:58,351 --> 00:08:00,852
I'd hate to lose it all
because of making poor choices.

172
00:08:00,853 --> 00:08:04,323
Ah, come on, man. I just had
a couple of alcohol beers.

173
00:08:04,324 --> 00:08:07,059
And I'm his girlfriend
'cause he has great genitals.

174
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,394
And I'm impressed
with reckless behavior,

175
00:08:09,395 --> 00:08:12,798
so I'm going to reward him with
my mouth while he's driving.

176
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,167
Now let's smoke a marijuana cigarette

177
00:08:15,168 --> 00:08:17,202
while I'm speeding because of a dare.

178
00:08:17,203 --> 00:08:20,038
Hey, careful. I'd hate
for you to be unresponsive

179
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:23,775
to my pleasuring while you're
driving because of intoxication.

180
00:08:23,776 --> 00:08:25,143
Stewie, is this about anything

181
00:08:25,144 --> 00:08:26,545
but oral stuff while you're driving?

182
00:08:26,546 --> 00:08:28,680
It's about all facets
of driving safety, yes.

183
00:08:28,681 --> 00:08:29,948
I'm gonna fast-forward.

184
00:08:34,454 --> 00:08:36,188
What a waste.

185
00:08:36,189 --> 00:08:38,624
I'm a grizzled, seen-it-all veteran cop,

186
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,460
and I'm shaking my head
at the senseless waste.

187
00:08:41,461 --> 00:08:43,462
Sir, we've done our police tests.

188
00:08:43,463 --> 00:08:45,030
The driver was being mouth-pleased

189
00:08:45,031 --> 00:08:46,931
at the moment of impact.

190
00:08:54,507 --> 00:08:56,074
Lois! Fat Ass!

191
00:08:56,075 --> 00:08:59,077
Family, I want you to
meet Tricia Takanawa.

192
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:02,381
Hello, everyone. So happy you came.

193
00:09:02,382 --> 00:09:03,715
Yup, food's on the table,

194
00:09:03,716 --> 00:09:05,417
and if anyone needs
some dirty underpants,

195
00:09:05,418 --> 00:09:06,885
the vending machine's right over there.

196
00:09:06,886 --> 00:09:08,186
How nice.

197
00:09:08,187 --> 00:09:09,855
Right where my mother's
China cabinet used to be.

198
00:09:09,856 --> 00:09:12,557
Lois, can I please have a dollar
for the vending machine?

199
00:09:12,558 --> 00:09:14,526
No, Peter. I'm getting our coats.

200
00:09:14,527 --> 00:09:16,260
We're leaving.

201
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:22,534
No! Bill too crinkly!

202
00:09:22,535 --> 00:09:24,502
Try again!

203
00:09:25,805 --> 00:09:27,339
Bill too crinkly!

204
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,341
You dollar funny!

205
00:09:29,342 --> 00:09:31,376
This must be so difficult for you.

206
00:09:31,377 --> 00:09:34,056
It is. There's a lot of choices here.

207
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:35,213
But I ain't talking to you.

208
00:09:35,214 --> 00:09:37,816
I thought you were supposed to
be doing a news story on Carter,

209
00:09:37,817 --> 00:09:39,284
not shacking up with him.

210
00:09:39,285 --> 00:09:41,720
The truth is all I ever wanted

211
00:09:41,721 --> 00:09:43,822
was to some day have a family of my own.

212
00:09:43,823 --> 00:09:47,192
And I realized Carter
could give me all of that.

213
00:09:47,193 --> 00:09:48,794
A family all your own?

214
00:09:48,795 --> 00:09:50,962
Yes. A family just like this,

215
00:09:50,963 --> 00:09:54,066
in fact, with a fine son
just like you, Peter.

216
00:09:54,067 --> 00:09:57,836
A son to whom I could one day
give a piece of sour plum candy.

217
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,441
Thank you, Mama Tricia!

218
00:10:00,442 --> 00:10:03,642
But a lazy son
who does not make me proud?

219
00:10:03,643 --> 00:10:06,945
Peter, that son deserves no candy.

220
00:10:08,881 --> 00:10:10,215
I swear, Mama Tricia,

221
00:10:10,216 --> 00:10:13,027
I'm gonna make you the
proudest Tiger Mom of all!

222
00:10:13,028 --> 00:10:15,554
Not like how Jesus feels about his kid.

223
00:10:15,555 --> 00:10:17,723
Dad, I got bullied at school!

224
00:10:17,724 --> 00:10:19,391
They flipped up my lunch tray!

225
00:10:19,392 --> 00:10:20,859
Oh, that sucks.

226
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,561
I wonder if that's the worst thing

227
00:10:22,562 --> 00:10:24,629
that ever happened to a guy?

228
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,832
Whoa. Whoa!

229
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,500
Billy, this guy in this book here...

230
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:31,610
He's really getting
the business... yikes!

231
00:10:31,611 --> 00:10:34,061
Okay, I'm sorry. What
happened at school today?

232
00:10:34,062 --> 00:10:35,607
You're kind of a dick, Dad.

233
00:10:35,608 --> 00:10:37,876
Huh. I wonder if there's anyone in here

234
00:10:37,877 --> 00:10:39,678
whose dad was a bigger dick.

235
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:42,279
Wow! Crazy!

236
00:10:45,852 --> 00:10:48,820
Uh, Mom, why is Dad
over there playing chess

237
00:10:48,821 --> 00:10:50,422
with Tricia Takanawa?

238
00:10:50,423 --> 00:10:52,524
Because, Chris, your idiot father

239
00:10:52,525 --> 00:10:54,259
thinks she's his new "Tiger Mom,"

240
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,094
and he's trying to impress her.

241
00:10:56,095 --> 00:10:59,331
All right, Peter, it's time
to master the game of chess.

242
00:10:59,332 --> 00:11:00,732
Okay, that shouldn't be too hard.

243
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:03,535
No. You will do it in the
traditional Japanese way...

244
00:11:03,536 --> 00:11:05,937
On a wacky game show
while a beautiful woman

245
00:11:05,938 --> 00:11:08,340
beats your scrotum with a reed.

246
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:10,675
Ow. I don't know which way
the horse goes.

247
00:11:12,412 --> 00:11:14,778
Why is that guy laughing at me
and where is he?

248
00:11:15,548 --> 00:11:18,049
There was a time limit?
Nobody told me that.

249
00:11:19,485 --> 00:11:21,787
Time for "Good Door, Bad Door"!

250
00:11:21,788 --> 00:11:24,456
Wait. How bad is the bad door?

251
00:11:26,626 --> 00:11:29,027
Grandpa-san, how bad was the bad door?

252
00:11:29,028 --> 00:11:30,429
Not too bad.

253
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,830
But shortly afterwards,

254
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:33,665
I was almost eaten alive
by an escalator.

255
00:11:34,934 --> 00:11:36,735
The game is still going on?

256
00:11:36,736 --> 00:11:40,338
You lose chess!

257
00:11:45,011 --> 00:11:47,913
Peter, another way
to impress your Asian Tiger Mom

258
00:11:47,914 --> 00:11:50,348
is to put on this
old-fashioned baseball hat

259
00:11:50,349 --> 00:11:53,185
and assist Indiana Jones
on his next adventure.

260
00:11:53,186 --> 00:11:54,886
You got it, Mama Tricia.

261
00:11:54,887 --> 00:11:56,988
Okay, nice and slow, Doctor Jones.

262
00:11:56,989 --> 00:11:58,957
More alcohol and pot.

263
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,159
Yeah, let's get you out
of the tub first, Doctor Jones.

264
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,994
I want to fly an old plane.

265
00:12:02,995 --> 00:12:04,463
I'm not sure that's a great idea.

266
00:12:04,464 --> 00:12:05,897
Not a new, safe one.

267
00:12:05,898 --> 00:12:07,299
Uh, yeah, yeah, I got that.

268
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,334
There's a
skeleton in my bedroom.

269
00:12:09,335 --> 00:12:10,836
That's your wife, Doctor Jones.

270
00:12:10,837 --> 00:12:13,104
Now maybe today we don't do the earring?

271
00:12:13,105 --> 00:12:15,639
No. Earring every day.

272
00:12:18,845 --> 00:12:20,212
All right, Brian, let's begin.

273
00:12:20,213 --> 00:12:21,546
Great, let's do it.

274
00:12:21,547 --> 00:12:22,681
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

275
00:12:22,682 --> 00:12:24,456
Stop! Demerit!

276
00:12:24,457 --> 00:12:25,317
What the hell?

277
00:12:25,318 --> 00:12:26,585
Where are your hands, Brian?

278
00:12:26,586 --> 00:12:28,153
Uh... on the steering wheel?

279
00:12:28,154 --> 00:12:29,954
Ten and two.

280
00:12:32,091 --> 00:12:33,926
All right, commence.

281
00:12:35,294 --> 00:12:37,362
IPDE, Brian, IPDE. What?

282
00:12:37,363 --> 00:12:40,899
IPDE... Identify,
Predict, Decide, Execute.

283
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,068
You've got to constantly
be IPDE-ing everything

284
00:12:43,069 --> 00:12:44,536
in your target zone.

285
00:12:44,537 --> 00:12:45,971
I-I-I-I don't, I don't know
what you're saying.

286
00:12:45,972 --> 00:12:47,405
"Identify. Predict..."

287
00:12:47,406 --> 00:12:48,707
Yeah, you said that.

288
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,108
- But it doesn't mean anyth...
- IPDE that.

289
00:12:50,109 --> 00:12:52,744
- Uh... it's a child with a ball.
- Very good.

290
00:12:52,745 --> 00:12:55,013
Identified. Now predict.

291
00:12:55,014 --> 00:12:56,648
- Predict what?
- IPDE.

292
00:12:56,649 --> 00:12:58,350
Yeah, you keep saying
that like it's a word.

293
00:12:58,351 --> 00:12:59,885
Those four letters don't make a word.

294
00:12:59,886 --> 00:13:01,753
It-it's not helping
me remember anything.

295
00:13:01,754 --> 00:13:03,388
Well, now you've got
an oncoming vehicle.

296
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:05,357
Pay attention to your
four-to-six second zone.

297
00:13:05,358 --> 00:13:07,392
What? What is that?
Fo-four-to-six second...?

298
00:13:07,393 --> 00:13:08,860
IPDE the car, Brian. IPDE the car!

299
00:13:08,861 --> 00:13:10,061
What does that mean?

300
00:13:10,062 --> 00:13:11,596
Now, check your gauges with one eye

301
00:13:11,597 --> 00:13:13,265
while keeping
your other eye on the road.

302
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:14,666
My eyes go in the same direction.

303
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:16,034
What's your tire pressure?

304
00:13:16,035 --> 00:13:17,702
I-I can't... I don't...
I-I'm in the car.

305
00:13:17,703 --> 00:13:19,037
Stop! Demerit!

306
00:13:19,038 --> 00:13:20,472
Stewie, I know how to drive.

307
00:13:20,473 --> 00:13:21,773
I've been driving for years.

308
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:26,411
Ever hear of IPDE, jackass?

309
00:13:30,917 --> 00:13:33,385
I had a great day with the fat son.

310
00:13:33,386 --> 00:13:35,320
He's started to respond positively

311
00:13:35,321 --> 00:13:37,556
to the caning
of his buttocks and knuckles.

312
00:13:37,557 --> 00:13:39,324
Speaking of buttocks and knuckles,

313
00:13:39,325 --> 00:13:40,992
let's fool around.

314
00:13:40,993 --> 00:13:43,395
Mmm, sounds good.

315
00:13:43,396 --> 00:13:44,996
I wonder if I can tell you

316
00:13:44,997 --> 00:13:47,999
one of my deepest sexual fantasies?

317
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,001
All right. Let me just burp
through my nose for a second,

318
00:13:50,002 --> 00:13:51,369
I've been drinking seltzer.

319
00:13:52,772 --> 00:13:54,005
Okay, what do you got?

320
00:13:54,006 --> 00:13:56,141
Well, you're going
to think this is silly,

321
00:13:56,142 --> 00:13:58,710
but I love it when a man confesses

322
00:13:58,711 --> 00:14:01,379
to manufacturing improprieties.

323
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,316
Oh, yeah? Well, then,
you're gonna love this.

324
00:14:04,317 --> 00:14:06,918
I ordered the brewery
to start making beer cans

325
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:10,288
out of toxic, unsafe metal,
just to save a few bucks.

326
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:12,190
Exactly what I wanted to hear.

327
00:14:12,191 --> 00:14:13,624
Thank you, Carter.

328
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,894
And there you have it,

329
00:14:15,895 --> 00:14:17,896
Channel Five News audience.

330
00:14:17,897 --> 00:14:21,132
This has been Tricia Takanawa,
with my undercover exposé

331
00:14:21,133 --> 00:14:23,501
of Pawtucket Patriot Brewery.

332
00:14:23,502 --> 00:14:26,871
Up next... is Papa John dyeing
his eyebrows?

333
00:14:26,872 --> 00:14:28,873
I sleep with him to find out,

334
00:14:28,874 --> 00:14:31,810
though I'm fairly confident
the answer is yes.

335
00:14:31,811 --> 00:14:33,712
And... we're clear.

336
00:14:33,713 --> 00:14:35,480
What-What's going on?

337
00:14:35,481 --> 00:14:37,649
I finished my investigation.

338
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:38,984
But... I don't understand.

339
00:14:38,985 --> 00:14:40,919
I... I thought we were in love.

340
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,593
I only let you think that.

341
00:14:42,594 --> 00:14:43,521
I'm sorry.

342
00:14:43,522 --> 00:14:45,623
It's time for me to go.

343
00:14:48,227 --> 00:14:49,060
Chris?

344
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:50,295
Hi, Grandpa.

345
00:14:50,296 --> 00:14:51,896
I got an internship.

346
00:14:51,897 --> 00:14:54,432
You mean, you've been
working for Tricia?

347
00:14:54,433 --> 00:14:57,034
Hang on, I got to get
20 seconds of room tone.

348
00:14:58,137 --> 00:14:59,938
What's room tone?

349
00:14:59,939 --> 00:15:01,438
Oh, we got to start again.

350
00:15:06,508 --> 00:15:08,799
I miss her so much, Griffin.

351
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,782
Of all the women I've
institutionalized Babs over,

352
00:15:11,783 --> 00:15:13,970
she's the one who meant the most to me.

353
00:15:13,971 --> 00:15:14,885
I know.

354
00:15:14,886 --> 00:15:16,787
It's like, one day she's my Tiger Mom,

355
00:15:16,788 --> 00:15:18,455
and the next day she isn't,

356
00:15:18,456 --> 00:15:19,923
and the day before that first day,

357
00:15:19,924 --> 00:15:21,290
she also wasn't.

358
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:23,293
But the point is she hurt us, Carter.

359
00:15:23,294 --> 00:15:25,028
We got to get her back.

360
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:26,964
We need revenge.

361
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,033
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.

362
00:15:30,034 --> 00:15:31,201
Coming up next,

363
00:15:31,202 --> 00:15:34,404
Nicki Minaj... is a bear?

364
00:15:34,405 --> 00:15:37,975
But first, congratulations to
our very own Tricia Takanawa.

365
00:15:37,976 --> 00:15:39,977
That's right, Tom.
Tricia's recent exposé

366
00:15:39,978 --> 00:15:41,712
on the Pawtucket Patriot Brewery

367
00:15:41,713 --> 00:15:43,380
has been nominated for a local Emmy.

368
00:15:43,381 --> 00:15:45,582
Mm, the "local" really hurts that.

369
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:46,917
That's it, Griffin.

370
00:15:46,918 --> 00:15:48,619
That's how we'll get our revenge.

371
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,354
You and I will go to the local Emmys,

372
00:15:50,355 --> 00:15:52,022
and we'll embarrass Tricia
on her big night

373
00:15:52,023 --> 00:15:53,457
in front of all her peers.

374
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,092
That's a great idea!

375
00:15:55,093 --> 00:15:56,426
'Cause people need to know

376
00:15:56,427 --> 00:15:57,828
that she's an even bigger fraud

377
00:15:57,829 --> 00:15:59,463
than Robert Baden Powell,

378
00:15:59,464 --> 00:16:01,231
the founder of the Boy Scouts.

379
00:16:01,232 --> 00:16:03,500
Ma'am, I'd like to take
your son into the woods.

380
00:16:03,501 --> 00:16:05,969
What? That sounds suspicious.

381
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:08,438
Well, what if I said we'd
both be wearing shorts

382
00:16:08,439 --> 00:16:10,474
and neckerchiefs, and
I'd give him little patches

383
00:16:10,475 --> 00:16:12,308
for doing what I say?

384
00:16:18,383 --> 00:16:19,983
So? How'd we do?

385
00:16:19,984 --> 00:16:21,518
Did you pass your driver's test?

386
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,919
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I think so.

387
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,154
You brought up IPDE?

388
00:16:24,155 --> 00:16:25,455
As a matter of fact, I did.

389
00:16:25,456 --> 00:16:26,556
He was impressed?

390
00:16:26,557 --> 00:16:28,291
No, he had no idea
what I was talking about.

391
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:29,626
He tried to Google it on his phone

392
00:16:29,627 --> 00:16:31,862
and ended up spilling hot coffee
on his balls.

393
00:16:31,863 --> 00:16:33,764
I took him to the ER
and he said he'd pass me

394
00:16:33,765 --> 00:16:35,232
if I picked him up in an hour.

395
00:16:35,233 --> 00:16:36,867
So it did work.

396
00:16:36,868 --> 00:16:39,202
Well, congratulations, you're
getting your license back!

397
00:16:39,203 --> 00:16:40,570
I know, it's great.

398
00:16:40,571 --> 00:16:43,306
Now I'll be able to go to
those dog parties again.

399
00:17:10,468 --> 00:17:11,701
There's Tricia.

400
00:17:13,438 --> 00:17:15,238
Sweet. What's our plan??

401
00:17:15,239 --> 00:17:17,007
We put this in her drink.

402
00:17:17,008 --> 00:17:19,876
It'll make her instantly
"triple" herself.

403
00:17:19,877 --> 00:17:22,546
Tripling is when you vomit,
defecate, and orgasm,

404
00:17:22,547 --> 00:17:24,047
all at the same time.

405
00:17:24,048 --> 00:17:25,749
Wha... I-I don't...

406
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,422
Why would that medicine even exist?

407
00:17:27,423 --> 00:17:28,251
Cosby.

408
00:17:28,252 --> 00:17:29,686
Now all we need is a distraction

409
00:17:29,687 --> 00:17:31,221
so we can spike her cocktail.

410
00:17:31,222 --> 00:17:32,989
Aha. You leave that to me.

411
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,591
I know something that might distract

412
00:17:34,592 --> 00:17:36,159
all these news people.

413
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,794
Maybe if one of us just chuckles

414
00:17:37,795 --> 00:17:39,162
for no apparent reason,

415
00:17:39,163 --> 00:17:40,797
everyone else will start chuckling.

416
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:42,032
Worth a shot.

417
00:17:51,409 --> 00:17:52,809
All right, they're all news chuckling!

418
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,044
Go, go, go!

419
00:18:02,053 --> 00:18:03,887
Okay. All Tricia's got to do now

420
00:18:03,888 --> 00:18:05,322
is take one sip and she'll blow it out

421
00:18:05,323 --> 00:18:06,590
of all three holes,

422
00:18:06,591 --> 00:18:07,991
right here in front of everyone.

423
00:18:07,992 --> 00:18:11,093
And that will make us feel
better about our life choices.

424
00:18:11,996 --> 00:18:13,230
Hello, Mother.

425
00:18:13,231 --> 00:18:15,165
I'm so happy you could be here tonight.

426
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,433
Why happy?

427
00:18:16,434 --> 00:18:17,768
You no work for Channel Ten,

428
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:19,035
just Channel Five.

429
00:18:19,036 --> 00:18:20,537
Only half as good.

430
00:18:20,538 --> 00:18:22,906
Mother, please,
I-I'm being honored tonight.

431
00:18:22,907 --> 00:18:25,342
What honor? Connie Chung
marry Maury Povich,

432
00:18:25,343 --> 00:18:27,244
form media super team.

433
00:18:27,245 --> 00:18:29,713
Where your Povich? You have no Povich.

434
00:18:29,714 --> 00:18:32,749
Wow. Tricia's mom is really
coming down hard on her.

435
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,252
Yeah, and with really
outdated references.

436
00:18:35,253 --> 00:18:36,620
You know,

437
00:18:36,621 --> 00:18:39,489
it's no wonder Mama Trish
was so tough on me.

438
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,091
It's the only thing she knows.

439
00:18:41,092 --> 00:18:42,592
And where grandchildren?

440
00:18:42,593 --> 00:18:45,395
Who take care of me
when I 121 years old?

441
00:18:45,396 --> 00:18:47,864
Who take care of Irene? No one.

442
00:18:47,865 --> 00:18:49,766
No one take care of Irene.

443
00:18:49,767 --> 00:18:51,268
I guess her name is Irene.

444
00:18:51,269 --> 00:18:53,837
Carter, I-I'm starting
to feel bad for Tricia.

445
00:18:53,838 --> 00:18:56,293
Maybe what she did to us
was wrong, but sheesh,

446
00:18:56,294 --> 00:18:58,742
look what her own life has been like.

447
00:18:58,743 --> 00:19:00,644
I-I don't, I don't think I can do this.

448
00:19:00,645 --> 00:19:02,879
Well, this stuff's already in her drink.

449
00:19:09,153 --> 00:19:12,588
Mama Tricia!

450
00:19:16,394 --> 00:19:19,762
No!

451
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,309
Where'd you get these?

452
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,477
Oh, I see the guy.

453
00:19:38,616 --> 00:19:39,850
You're a weird guy, Griffin.

454
00:19:39,851 --> 00:19:41,051
Eh, I don't know.

455
00:19:41,052 --> 00:19:42,419
You know, I just been thinking,

456
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,654
the way you and me fell
so fast for this lady,

457
00:19:44,655 --> 00:19:46,189
and for no reason?

458
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,283
Maybe the problem ain't
Tricia, you know?

459
00:19:48,284 --> 00:19:49,494
Maybe it's us.

460
00:19:49,495 --> 00:19:50,260
What do you mean?

461
00:19:50,261 --> 00:19:52,162
Well, with my real mom gone,

462
00:19:52,163 --> 00:19:54,130
I-I guess maybe I just needed

463
00:19:54,131 --> 00:19:56,066
someone in my life to fill that role.

464
00:19:56,067 --> 00:20:00,003
Someone who loves me enough to
call me fat and lazy and stupid.

465
00:20:00,004 --> 00:20:02,272
Hmm, maybe you're right.

466
00:20:02,273 --> 00:20:05,909
And maybe I was just looking
for a way to feel young again.

467
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:09,346
Hey, Carter? We're gonna be okay.

468
00:20:13,217 --> 00:20:15,919
Ah, crap. This thing was a rental.

469
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,453
Here's your tux back, bye!

470
00:20:21,425 --> 00:20:23,426
Well, I'm just glad all this nonsense

471
00:20:23,427 --> 00:20:25,328
with Tricia Takanawa is over.

472
00:20:25,329 --> 00:20:27,097
Hey, what ever happened with Grandma?

473
00:20:27,098 --> 00:20:28,899
Yeah, that's what everybody
was thinking about, Meg.

474
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,934
Trust me, she'll come back
if we need her.

475
00:20:30,935 --> 00:20:32,102
Hey, Stewie, seriously,

476
00:20:32,103 --> 00:20:33,270
thanks for everything you did

477
00:20:33,271 --> 00:20:34,504
to help me get my license back.

478
00:20:34,505 --> 00:20:35,805
My pleasure.

479
00:20:35,806 --> 00:20:37,307
But now you owe me.

480
00:20:37,308 --> 00:20:38,608
That means one day,

481
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:40,543
I'm gonna come to you
and ask for a favor.

482
00:20:40,544 --> 00:20:42,078
But I need to know something.

483
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,947
I need to know that you're gonna say yes

484
00:20:43,948 --> 00:20:45,215
when that day comes.

485
00:20:45,216 --> 00:20:47,217
Uh, o-okay.

486
00:20:47,218 --> 00:20:48,585
Can we go for ice cream?

487
00:20:53,673 --> 00:20:54,657
Come on!

488
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,720
