"It seems today that all you see

00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,250
"Is violence in movies and sex on TV

Let's see. We've got soda, purple stuff...

11
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,290
Sunny D! All right!

12
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,040
We now return to "The Smurfs".

13
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,500
- Hey. You have a good time last night?
- Smurftacular!

14
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,880
- I saw you leave with Smurfette.
- We left the bar and she started smurfin' me.

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,790
Shut the smurf up!
Right in the smurfin'parking lot?

16
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,290
- Smurf, yeah!
- That is freakin' smurf!

17
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,790
- You smurf it.
- That is freakin' smurf.

18
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,290
Hello?

19
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,750
Oh, my God!

20
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,880
Peter, why are you staring into the dryer?

21
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,090
I'm watching the latest episode
of Laundry Theatre.

22
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,380
Those are Chris's socks, right?

23
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,340
They don't know that Stewie's shirt
is having an affair with Meg's trousers.

24
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,050
It's fun to watch rich people be naughty!

25
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,130
Listen to me. My sister just called.

26
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,170
Her baby's due any day now
and Ted just walked out on her.

27
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,670
Whoa, back it up. You have a sister?

28
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,970
I promised her I'd be on the next train.
Poor Carol, all alone in that big house.

29
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,510
Carol... She the one with
the Jacuzzi and the pool table?

30
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,170
- Yeah.
- I'll come with you.

31
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,380
Really? That's a surprise.

32
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,380
Come on, Lois.
When have I not been there for you?

33
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,050
- Get outta the car!
- Scream and you're dead.

34
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,340
Thanks for the ride, lady.

35
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:56,550
- It's the Griffins. What can I do for you?
- Glen, we have a family emergency.

36
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,090
We really need you to take the kids
for just a couple of days.

37
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,760
In accordance with Megan's Law,
I'm obligated to inform you that...

38
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,510
- That's fine. I'll take the kids.
- Thanks, buddy.

39
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,510
Gosh, I never entertained kids before.

40
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,720
So a chick walks into
a gynaecologist's office...

41
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,260
Wha-ha-ha-ha-hey!

42
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,760
Diggly, diggly, diggly, diggly!

43
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,760
Carol, we'll get you through this.

44
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:38,640
In a few days you'll have a beautiful baby
to smother with all your unrequited love.

45
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:42,100
And as soon as the baby can crawl,
it'll probably leave me too,

46
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,100
just like my eight husbands.

47
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:50,220
Hey, Carol. It's me, Ted.
I came back because I love you and...

48
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,810
I'm just kidding. It's me, Peter.

49
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,350
It was so nice of you to come, Peter.
You're so considerate.

50
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,430
It was nothing.

51
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,940
Mr Quagmire, I finished the scavenger hunt.

52
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,850
Hold your horses. Let's go down the list.

53
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,850
- An unsharpened pencil?
- Check.

54
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,980
A speed-limit sign that
doesn't end in five or zero?

55
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,650
Your mom's hairbrush?

56
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,360
- You win!
- Oh, boy! What's my prize?

57
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,440
- A pencil and a speed sign.
- I did it!

58
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,900
I'll be right back.

59
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,110
Teeth and some toenail clippings
and we'll be ready for our date.

60
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,020
Carol, since Ted dumped you,
can I have his shirts?

61
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:53,020
Ted's shirts? He's half your size.

62
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,020
I know, but check this out.

63
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:59,190
Carol, say "David Banner,
I just slashed your tyres. "

64
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,360
- David Banner, I just slashed your tyres.
- Aaagh!

65
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,480
I'm priceless!

66
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,190
Sit with Carol. I'm gonna use the ladies room.

67
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,190
- Does she still take the newspaper in there?
- Yeah.

68
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,820
And after she does, I just can't read it.

69
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:20,030
Oh! Oh, God! The baby's gonna be here
any minute. We'd better get moving.

70
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:24,200
You gotta relax. You let that kid start
calling the shots now and you're screwed.

71
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,860
Is Mr Quagmire baby-sitting
all these people, too?

72
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,200
Hey. If I could rearrange the alphabet,
I'd put U and I together.

73
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,110
You must be a parking ticket,
cos you got "fine" written all over you.

74
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,780
Hey, there. I don't wanna
come between you... or do I?

75
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,660
That's awful.

76
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,030
This is a song I've been singing
for a number of years,

77
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,910
and I find it grows truer and truer
as time goes by.

78
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,120
I'm hungry for you, baby.
Come on, walk with me, talk with me.

79
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,870
Don't worry. We're almost there.
Peter, why are we stopped?

80
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:25,120
- I'll have three cheeseburgers.
- For God's sake, she's having a baby!

81
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,950
Oh, that's right. And a kid's meal.
And... I guess I'll have fries.

82
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,580
If I have fries,
is anybody else gonna have any?

83
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,910
I don't wanna be the only one eating 'em.
I'll feel like a fatty.

84
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,660
- Nurse, this woman is in labour.
- Excuse me. I was here first.

85
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,330
My leg is asleep.

86
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,290
Oh!

87
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:49,910
All right, let's see what we have here.
The baby's crowning.

88
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,000
Oh!

89
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,000
All right, I'm just going to put on
a pair of gloves and we'll deliver this baby.

90
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,750
These don't feel like gloves at all.
They feel like used needles.

91
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,250
But this is where I always keep the gloves.
Maybe if I dig deeper.

92
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:09,710
No, just feels like more needles.
That's the craziest thing.

93
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,330
Oh. Now I'm sure this isn't the glove drawer.

94
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,920
Oh, my God! Who's gonna deliver my baby?

95
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,130
Honey, do something!

96
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,920
No baby, but it looks like
Carol's blowing a bubble.

97
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,880
- Peter, that's the head. Push! Push!
- I am! It won't go back in.

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,710
Not you, Peter. Carol, push. Peter, you pull.

99
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,420
Aagh!

100
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,790
- Oh, my God!
- What? What?

101
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,000
It's a beautiful baby girl.

102
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:37,750
A baby girl. I'm so happy!

103
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,170
But she has a penis.
We'll have to do something about that.

104
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,630
- Peter, no! It's a boy.
- Well, how do you like that!

105
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:47,760
Hey there, little fella.
Welcome to the planet Earth!

106
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,710
Coochie, coochie, coochie-coo!

107
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:56,090
- He takes after his Uncle Peter.
- He's Carol's baby. Give him to her.

108
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,050
Oh, yeah.

109
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:02,340
Honey, you were fantastic. And you were
so cute when you were holding it.

110
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,130
I know. I didn't wanna give it up. Let's steal it.

111
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,340
No, wait. I got a better idea.

112
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,670
- Lois, let's have another baby.
- What?

113
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,470
- Sweetie, you're not serious?
- I sure am.

114
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,090
The best thing I've ever done is being a dad.

115
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,430
Peter, I think it's a wonderful idea.

116
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,720
Why haven't you sent for help?

117
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,890
I can't believe you wanna have another kid.

118
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,050
Did you find Chris and Meg's baby books?

119
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,300
Not yet. Hey, look at this, Lois.
It's our pet rock.

120
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,010
I remember the first day we brought it home.

121
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,970
See that? Huh? Huh?

122
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,970
Bad rock! Bad!

123
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:47,350
We do that outside.
Look at him. He knows what he did.

124
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,640
I found my baby book!

125
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,600
Hey, here's the broken condom
that led to my birth.

126
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,680
And the resulting lawsuit bought us
this house. You're my favourite mistake.

127
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,600
You see, Meg? I'm the favourite.

128
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,640
Ah, baby books. Nostalgic for the days
of chafed nipples and episiotomies?

129
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:11,100
- Somebody hasn't heard the news.
- News? What news?

130
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:15,270
What's the most wonderful thing
that could happen to this family?

131
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,520
The Phillies won.

132
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,310
- You're gonna have a baby brother.
- Or a sister.

133
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:28,390
A new baby. That's wonderful.
Call me when Kojak starts.

134
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,310
What?!

135
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,980
Another baby? But I'm the baby. Why
the deuce would they want to replace me?

136
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:40,270
My cheeks are pinchable, my bottom
is smooth, my laugh is heart-warming.

137
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,060
What's that? I certainly am not overreacting.

138
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,480
What happened to Bobby
when they added Oliver to The Brady Bunch?

139
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,190
- Oliver, did you break this vase?
- No, the floor did.

140
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,650
He's so cute.

141
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:59,860
- Hey, everybody! I...
- Bobby, you get back in the garage!

142
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,520
It can't happen. I was here first. Well,
technically third, but no time for semantics.

143
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,560
This is Stewie country,
and I intend to keep it that way.

144
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:14,320
As God is my witness, from this day forward,
Peter and Lois shall not conceive.

145
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,070
- What are you doing here?
- Peter and Lois are... getting intimate.

146
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,530
My God, I thought I had more time.
I've got to stop them.

147
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,480
Whaaa! Whaaa!

148
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,650
Mommy, Daddy, I had a bad dream!
I saw the bo...

149
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:36,400
Blast! What is that name again?
Bo... Bo... Bogeyman! Yes, that's it!

150
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:40,570
- I saw the bogeyman.
- Did someone have a bad dream?

151
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:44,110
Why don't you sleep
with Mommy and Daddy?

152
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,740
Peter, for God's sake. Stewie's right here.

153
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,740
We can still do it.
He'll just think I'm hurtin' ya.

154
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,070
Relax, honey. It's only for tonight.

155
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,360
Roll over. Roll over, I say!

156
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,030
Smells like cheese.

157
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,950
- OK, insert rod support A into slot B.
- That's what...

158
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:13,280
If you say "That's what she said"
once more, I'll pop you.

159
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,360
What you buildin', neighbour?

160
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:19,240
We were keeping it a secret,
but you're my best friends, so I'll tell ya.

161
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,160
Lois and I are having another baby!

162
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,780
We are so throwing you a shower.

163
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:40,780
Fat man, we'll see if Lois
wants to have sexual relations

164
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,240
when she finds lipstick on your collar.

165
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,080
There we are.

166
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,580
Well, look at you there.

167
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,200
You're a filthy girl, aren't you?

168
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,950
Yes, you're looking for a bad time,
that's what you're after.

169
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,120
You're a dirty flirt. You want it bad
and you don't care who you get it from,

170
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,870
because you have no self-respect,
and that gets you off, doesn't it?

171
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,620
Stewie! Bad boy! That's Mommy's make-up.

172
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:17,460
And you got it all over your father's
favourite shirt. Go to your room.

173
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,750
Wow. The evidence is really piling up.

174
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,670
Make any joke you want.
You know I look good.

175
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,210
Oh, my God! They're at it again. All this time
spent keeping people from having sex!

176
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:36,420
Now I know how
the Catholic Church feels. Ba-zing!

177
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,830
Time to initiate phase two.

178
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,090
All right, testing voice modulator.
Blast, you vile woman!

179
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,710
- Blast, you vile woman.
- That won't do.

180
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,380
Pardon me, you with
severe aesthetic deficiencies.

181
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,710
- Hey, ugly!
- Excellent. Ha-ha-ha-ha!

182
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,790
Sweet. Ha-ha-ha-ha!

183
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,420
Who's got beer?

184
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:14,260
- Where'd you go, my little pumpkin-eater?
- To the can. Kissing you made me barf.

185
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,960
- What?
- Dad, Meg keeps pushing me.

186
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:21,550
- Like I could! He's so fat.
- I'm not fat. I'm Rubenesque.

187
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,630
That's it. Your dad's had enough.

188
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:27,170
I want you kids to go and drink
the antifreeze in the garage.

189
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,090
I'm gonna chug it all
so there's none left for you.

190
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,670
- Watch it!
- Peter!

191
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,050
What?

192
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,420
Hey, Peter.

193
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,880
I see nussing. Nussing.

194
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,510
I've had it with these interruptions.
All we want is time alone.

195
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,430
You kids go to your rooms
for the rest of the night.

196
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:51,430
I don't wanna go to my room.
There's an evil monkey in my closet.

197
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:54,760
Evil monkey! That's funny.

198
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,840
Agh!

199
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:03,430
This romantic dinner
was a wonderful idea, Peter.

200
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,470
You deserve it, my beautiful princess.

201
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,430
You know, I'm not wearing any panties.

202
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:15,720
Don't worry.
We can always throw that chair out.

203
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:33,640
Very well, then. If I can't stop them from
the outside, I'll stop them from the inside.

204
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,390
Oh, dear. I'm afraid you're in a no-fly zone.

205
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:09,350
As was your fate, Mr Fly, so is the fate
of every sperm in Peter's body.

206
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,560
Aagh!

207
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,060
Computer on.

208
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,650
30 minutes before ship re-expansion.

209
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:25,610
Just enough time to obliterate
all those little potential usurpers.

210
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,400
- Engine status.
- Nominal.

211
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,060
- Fuel supply.
- Full.

212
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:33,520
Air supply.

213
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:38,230
Very well. Through the lips, over the gums.
Look out, testicles, here I come!

214
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,980
"Lois

215
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,940
"You can't spell "love" without L-O

216
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:50,400
"You can't spell "is" without I-S

217
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:54,780
"You can't spell "silo" without Lois

218
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,690
And solo from the pet rock.

219
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,320
No! No! No!

220
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,030
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

221
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:11,030
Warning: Host's oxygen levels rising.
Heart rate increasing.

222
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:14,990
My God. Either they're watching Batman
or they're doing the do.

223
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,450
If I'm to reach the testicles and destroy the
sperm before coitus, I must buy some time.

224
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:27,400
- Computer, location.
- 15mm northeast of the duodenum.

225
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,780
Very well. Fire phasers!

226
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,860
Oh, jeez! My duodenum's acting up.

227
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:38,320
Entering testicular perimeter.

228
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,240
Well, well. Do you know what today is?

229
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:49,070
A bad day to be a sperm.

230
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,950
What the deuce...?

231
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:35,750
- Well, it seems you're out of ammunition.
- As are you, Stewart.

232
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,250
- You know my name.
- I know many things.

233
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,910
- Indeed.
- Quite.

234
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,660
We should exchange monosyllabic
expressions of arrogance in person.

235
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,000
- Hm.
- Mm.

236
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:52,620
- Peter, I'm waiting.
- I'm comin'.

237
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,580
- You came unarmed?
- As we agreed.

238
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,790
Admirable. But foolish!

239
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,540
It's going to be a shame
to destroy such a worthy adversary.

240
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,750
My thoughts exactly.

241
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:35,210
- I've got you in the sleeper hold.
- As I you.

242
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,050
Your attempts to escape are...

243
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,340
Futile.

244
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:57,300
Well, well. Nap time appears to be over.

245
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:03,260
Finish me off. My one regret is that I won't be
able to do away with that red-headed woman.

246
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,970
What the...? How the devil
do you know about Lois?

247
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:09,510
You've seen that little gleam
in the fat man's eye? That twinkle?

248
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,680
That's me, plotting my escape.

249
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,550
You hate Lois? I hate Lois, too.
What else do you hate?

250
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:19,300
People who send pictures
of their families as Christmas cards.

251
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,340
- People who use the word "guestimate".
- Guys who wear sandals with socks.

252
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:27,010
Jason Patric. Ew!

253
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:29,930
Perhaps I've been looking
at this the wrong way.

254
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,930
I should embrace the idea
of having a little brother.

255
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:36,470
After all, it's obvious
we'd make quite a formidable team.

256
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:02,850
- Two minutes to re-expansion.
- Dear God! I'll never get out of here in time.

257
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,220
Move aside. I know a short cut.

258
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,180
Mm.

259
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,020
Mm.

260
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,140
Re-expansion in 60 seconds.

261
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,980
There's the tear duct.
We've gotta make him cry.

262
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,270
I think I know just the way.

263
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,100
Follow my lead.

264
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,310
Oh, Peter. I love you.

265
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,650
And I love you, Lou Gossett Junior.

266
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:10,770
It worked. You've got to get
down there so you can be born.

267
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,070
10 seconds to re-expansion.

268
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,820
- I guess this is goodbye.
- For now.

269
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:22,110
When you're born, don't let the doctor
slap you on the ass. It degrades us all.

270
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,190
Give it to her good, old man.

271
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,690
Peter, wait. I've been thinking.

272
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,360
It's been a long time since
we had such a wonderful night.

273
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,030
It'll be impossible to spend time together
like this if we're raising another child.

274
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,490
I thought, you know,
Brian would do a lot of the work.

275
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:58,070
I don't know. I mean,
Stewie alone needs so much attention.

276
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,990
Maybe we should hold off
on having another baby.

277
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:05,570
- Yeah, you may be right.
- No, no! You must receive his seed!

278
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:09,320
- Look who's here!
- But, Lois, we still get to do it, right?

279
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:13,070
- Honey, not in front of Stewie.
- OK. Back in a minute.

280
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:18,990
No, no, no! Come back here this instant,
you fat bastard, and do her!

281
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:23,700
Stop! Stop it! Stop tickling me! Stop it!

282
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,910
I'll kill you, I swear to God!

283
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,280
Wha... Wha... What did you just do?

284
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,830
No!

285
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:40,450
You killed my brother! How could you, you...!

286
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,040
Oh, my God! The twinkle. He's alive.

287
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,950
Well played, sperm brother. Well played.

288
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,870
He's more clever than I thought.

289
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,080
Perhaps too clever.
