1
00:00:33,855 --> 00:00:35,595
Hey, everybody.
Look what came in the mail.

2
00:00:35,896 --> 00:00:37,930
We got invitations
to Jillian's wedding.

3
00:00:38,131 --> 00:00:40,458
Jillian's wedding?
She's getting married?

4
00:00:40,493 --> 00:00:41,533
Wow, that's great.

5
00:00:41,568 --> 00:00:44,282
Looks like she finally found
someone after dating that last loser.

6
00:00:44,728 --> 00:00:45,997
She dated someone after me?

7
00:00:45,998 --> 00:00:49,691
No. See how I set up my own
joke? You walked right into it, Brian.

8
00:00:49,692 --> 00:00:55,275
Walk right in. Sit right down.
Stewie's gonna make you the fool.

9
00:00:55,276 --> 00:01:00,576
Peter, here's your invite.
Chris, Meg, Stewie, and me.

10
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,143
Uhhhh ......
probably one more in there.

11
00:01:03,144 --> 00:01:05,762
No, doesn't look like it.
Oh, yeah, here it is.

12
00:01:05,763 --> 00:01:08,863
Brian. Oh, no, wait.
It's for B. Ryan.

13
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:12,347
Ah, cool, Mrs G. Thanks
for lettin' me stay here
the last couple of weeks.

14
00:01:14,217 --> 00:01:15,454
I've enjoyed his company.

15
00:01:15,455 --> 00:01:17,242
She invited everybody except me?

16
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,049
What the hell?
We dated for 6 months.

17
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,975
Ouch! Well, Brian, looks
like you're the odd man out.

18
00:01:21,976 --> 00:01:23,878
Like a non-praying mantis.

19
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:27,003
Bless us, oh Lord, for these
gifts we are about to receive.

20
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:29,571
Help us to be mindful
of all our blessings ...

21
00:01:29,572 --> 00:01:31,379
and ...

22
00:01:43,024 --> 00:01:45,268
Brian, I'm filling
out my RSVP card ...

23
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:47,690
and I don't know
whether I should get the
salmon or the snausages.

24
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:48,778
They're having snausages?

25
00:01:48,779 --> 00:01:50,348
Yeah, sounds like fun.

26
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:52,951
Big deal! I couldn't care less
about going to that wedding.

27
00:01:52,952 --> 00:01:55,793
Look on the bright
side. It frees you up to
go to Cleveland's barbeque.

28
00:01:55,794 --> 00:01:57,122
Cleveland's having a barbeque?

29
00:01:57,123 --> 00:01:59,797
Oh, boy, this is really awkward ...

30
00:01:59,798 --> 00:02:02,045
None of this is awkward.
I've moved on from Jillian.

31
00:02:02,046 --> 00:02:03,849
I've dated plenty
of other girls since her.

32
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,889
- I never do computer dating.
- Yeah, me neither.

33
00:02:07,776 --> 00:02:09,931
So .... you're 27?

34
00:02:09,932 --> 00:02:13,047
Well, that picture,
y'know, it was posted
a couple of years ago.

35
00:02:13,707 --> 00:02:15,746
So ... so you're ...
you're a Golden Retriever?

36
00:02:15,747 --> 00:02:17,896
Well, it's a Retriever mix ...

37
00:02:18,904 --> 00:02:21,148
... b ... bra ... doodle.

38
00:02:21,149 --> 00:02:22,981
Wh ... where is that waitress?

39
00:02:23,293 --> 00:02:25,631
Fine! If you're so over her,
we should all go out to dinner.

40
00:02:25,632 --> 00:02:28,077
You, me, Jillian and her fiance.

41
00:02:28,078 --> 00:02:29,504
Unless you're uncomfortable.

42
00:02:29,505 --> 00:02:32,204
I would have no problem with
that. I'd love to meet the fiance.

43
00:02:32,205 --> 00:02:34,558
Great! And I'm sure
Dushawn would love to meet you.

44
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:37,099
- Dushawn?
- Ahh ... his name's Derek.

45
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,372
But look at your face.

46
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,444
We now return to ... "The Hills"

47
00:02:43,445 --> 00:02:45,806
Justin Bobby was
supposed to be here, already.

48
00:02:45,807 --> 00:02:47,321
Are you still going out with him?

49
00:02:47,322 --> 00:02:48,405
I guess so.

50
00:02:48,406 --> 00:02:51,386
I hate how he pushes
his bangs out of his face
with every word he says.

51
00:02:52,016 --> 00:02:53,980
Ummm ...  order me a beer.

52
00:02:54,029 --> 00:02:56,997
I have to find a
spot for my motorcycle.

53
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,416
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Jillian.

54
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:05,420
Oh, hey, Jillian. Congratulations
on your upcoming nuptuals.

55
00:03:05,421 --> 00:03:06,953
Oh! Are they showing?

56
00:03:07,007 --> 00:03:08,107
It's a really thin bra.

57
00:03:08,108 --> 00:03:10,208
Peter, I came over
to ask you something.

58
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:12,509
Will you give me
away at my wedding?

59
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,115
Wow, sure. That'd be great!

60
00:03:14,116 --> 00:03:16,946
Jillian, don't you want your
own father to give you away?

61
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,348
Lois, don't ruin this for me.

62
00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:20,524
Don't ruin this like
you ruined Kicks cereal.

63
00:03:21,494 --> 00:03:23,875
Mmmm. This Kicks
cereal is good tasting.

64
00:03:23,876 --> 00:03:26,017
And it's good for you.

65
00:03:26,693 --> 00:03:27,749
Naaaah!!!

66
00:03:28,483 --> 00:03:30,425
My father can't give
me away 'cause he's dead..

67
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,430
Ha ha ...

68
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,696
Well then, Peter would
be happy to do the honours.

69
00:03:33,697 --> 00:03:36,579
Plus, when's the next time you're
gonna get to give a bride away?

70
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,140
I know. This is a once
in a lifetime opportunity.

71
00:03:39,141 --> 00:03:41,228
You can give me away
when I get married, dad.

72
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:42,434
N-a-a-a-a-h!

73
00:03:45,874 --> 00:03:47,937
Merci, mademoiselle.
And for the gentleman ... ?

74
00:03:47,972 --> 00:03:50,956
Yeah, can I have, ah,
this 3rd thing down, please?

75
00:03:50,957 --> 00:03:52,776
Ah, very good,sir.
And for you?

76
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:54,367
<i>ORDERS IN FRENCH </i>

77
00:03:58,074 --> 00:04:01,688
Ah ha ha ha. Bon.
Excellent. Merci, monsieur.

78
00:04:02,497 --> 00:04:06,090
Wow, Derek, that's pretty
good French you speak there.

79
00:04:06,091 --> 00:04:07,858
He also speaks 'Orange'.

80
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:09,411
- Mandarin, honey.
- Mandolin.

81
00:04:10,212 --> 00:04:11,627
O-o-o-h ... o-o-o-h!

82
00:04:12,496 --> 00:04:14,169
Hey, hey. What luck, huh?

83
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:16,999
Wow, sweetie! That was amazing.

84
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,831
Ha, I don't think I could do
that again in a million years.

85
00:04:22,318 --> 00:04:28,661
- Ahhhhhhh ... oh ... oh ... oh ...
- Aah ... ah ... ah ... ah

86
00:04:28,776 --> 00:04:30,391
I caught ... this piece.

87
00:04:30,392 --> 00:04:32,512
Oh, my God! Sir, are you alright?

88
00:04:32,513 --> 00:04:35,575
Ahhh ... I don't know.
I actually just had elbow surgery.

89
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:37,622
I wasn't even supposed
to come in to work today ...

90
00:04:37,623 --> 00:04:39,366
Why would you
trip me deliberately?!

91
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:40,661
I ...I'm ... I'm sorry.

92
00:04:40,662 --> 00:04:41,538
Dinner's goin' great.

93
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:43,624
You know, I can probably
help you with that elbow.

94
00:04:48,832 --> 00:04:51,676
- Does that feel better?
- Yeah, it feels a lot better.

95
00:04:51,677 --> 00:04:53,790
Wow, you're the best man ever.

96
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:54,874
Oh ho ho, hardly.

97
00:04:54,874 --> 00:04:57,065
Excuse me, I'm just gonna
use the restroom really quick.

98
00:04:57,066 --> 00:04:59,282
- I'll go with you.
- Oh, my God. Gay!

99
00:04:59,283 --> 00:05:01,604
Shutup! He's obviously some
sort of Superman. I just ...

100
00:05:01,005 --> 00:05:05,545
... I just need to know
if he has any shortcomings
that'll make me feel better.

101
00:05:05,546 --> 00:05:08,181
You are not even ...
You're goin' in there to look ...
That's even gayer.

102
00:05:12,564 --> 00:05:13,554
Oh, come on!

103
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,246
Can I have anoth ...
another bourbon, please?

104
00:05:20,116 --> 00:05:23,409
Hey, blondie. You wanna get
together with my "Dogwood?"

105
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:23,976
What?

106
00:05:24,176 --> 00:05:27,155
Dogwood, y'know, like
... like Dogwood and Blondie.

107
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,097
Like in the funnies.

108
00:05:28,111 --> 00:05:29,160
You mean Dagwood?

109
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:30,426
Dagwood. That's what it is.

110
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,707
Hey, how about this one ...

111
00:05:31,735 --> 00:05:33,678
You wanna take a Wizard on my Id?

112
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:34,540
Ah, ha ha ha.

113
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:37,273
You remind me of my step dad.

114
00:05:46,382 --> 00:05:48,597
Oh ... oh, man.

115
00:05:49,438 --> 00:05:51,291
What the hell did I do last night?

116
00:05:51,326 --> 00:05:52,399
Good morning.

117
00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:55,158
Oh, my God! You're Lauren Conrad!

118
00:05:55,193 --> 00:05:56,845
- Yeah.
- From "The Hills".

119
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,125
Yeah, you seem surprised.

120
00:05:58,146 --> 00:06:02,316
No, no .. it's just .. I ..
I mean .. I probably had
a lot to drink last night so

121
00:06:02,351 --> 00:06:04,813
if I did anything that might have
offended you, I'm .. I'm sorry.

122
00:06:04,848 --> 00:06:06,068
No, it's OK, I have a dog

123
00:06:06,098 --> 00:06:08,003
so I've had to cut
poop out of his fur before.

124
00:06:08,157 --> 00:06:10,196
Oh ... oh, thanks.

125
00:06:10,231 --> 00:06:11,869
Well, otherwise it was
a fun night though, right?

126
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:13,358
So fun.

127
00:06:17,018 --> 00:06:19,094
Y'know, I had a
really fun night, Brian.

128
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,488
You seem like a really cool guy.

129
00:06:20,523 --> 00:06:22,523
Yeah, um ... Hey,
y'know, if you don't mind ...

130
00:06:22,623 --> 00:06:25,270
I'm sorta a low
profile kinda person, so ...

131
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,234
I'm gonna take off before
anybody gets the wrong idea here.

132
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:32,685
Hey ... Brian, is that you?
Is that Lauren Con ...?

133
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,852
I was shoppin' for hats ...
Hang on! I'm coming over!

134
00:06:34,887 --> 00:06:36,255
Oh, no.

135
00:06:36,302 --> 00:06:38,068
Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.

136
00:06:38,103 --> 00:06:38,831
Who's that?

137
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:41,271
Oh, it's just this jerk
that goes to my school.

138
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:42,492
You go to school?

139
00:06:42,551 --> 00:06:45,334
No, I just lied to you
and I'm not really sure why.

140
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:48,309
Is this the longest
light ever, or what?

141
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:52,071
Ah, there we go!

142
00:06:52,711 --> 00:06:54,607
Oh, my God! How do
you two know each other?

143
00:06:54,672 --> 00:06:56,635
Ah, we actually just met.

144
00:06:56,687 --> 00:06:58,144
Well, I'm Stewie.

145
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,451
I'm Lauren, it's good to meet you.

146
00:06:59,512 --> 00:07:02,626
I love the show. Do you
need a gay friend on the
show .. a friend on the show?

147
00:07:02,726 --> 00:07:05,323
Hey, you know what? I'm
actually on my way to go shoot now

148
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:06,908
if you want, you guys can tag along.

149
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:09,005
Oh, ah, I don't know if we have time.

150
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,251
Yes, we would love to.
Brian, don't wreck this for me.

151
00:07:12,286 --> 00:07:14,312
Oh, my God! I have
the perfect hat for this.

152
00:07:18,474 --> 00:07:21,942
Listen, Lauren, I'm not .. not
super comfortable being on camera.

153
00:07:22,158 --> 00:07:24,884
Oh, relax. After a little while
you'll forget they're even there.

154
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:28,659
What's everybody looking at?
The salesman told me it was unisex.

155
00:07:28,757 --> 00:07:29,979
Hey, those people look familiar.

156
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,743
Ah, that's Heidi and Spencer.
I don't really talk to them.

157
00:07:32,835 --> 00:07:35,323
Wow, Spencer does
look like a monkey.

158
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,985
Spencer, I am so
over your selfishness.

159
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:41,382
Whatta ya want? I came out to
Hollywood, I'm on camera all day

160
00:07:41,463 --> 00:07:43,477
and I turned my
back on my own kind.

161
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:48,659
Uuugh... there's Brody
Jenner. God, what a douchebag.

162
00:07:48,694 --> 00:07:52,336
I can't believe that came
out of Bruce Jenner's vagina.

163
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,482
Bruce Jenner is a man.

164
00:07:53,517 --> 00:07:56,519
No, Brian. That's what
the Press would have
you believe. But he's not.

165
00:07:56,554 --> 00:08:01,458
Bruce Jenner is a woman. An
elegant, beautiful, Dutch woman.

166
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,312
This is where they
edit the show together.

167
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,314
Lauren, we've got a rough
cut of next week's episode.

168
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,503
- Can you queue that up, Terry?
- Sure.

169
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:12,158
I need to be, like, fine,
to be alone, and, like, not
even want to date someone

170
00:08:12,193 --> 00:08:14,098
and then I know I'll be
fine to get into a relationship.

171
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:17,505
That's it? That was like, 5 seconds.

172
00:08:17,586 --> 00:08:21,344
It's OK. They fill the
rest with shots of street
signs, and fronts of restaurants

173
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:22,806
and old footage from the A Team.

174
00:08:43,303 --> 00:08:45,237
Hey, Brian, where
were you last night, buddy?

175
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,670
Oh, I was .. um .. I was out. I
got a little wrecked after dinner

176
00:08:48,678 --> 00:08:49,686
and I didn't wanna drive home.

177
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,473
Oh, yeah? Did you stay in town
or did you head for 'The Hills?'

178
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:56,081
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

179
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,386
Wait a minute! How the hell do
you guys know about that already?

180
00:08:58,421 --> 00:09:00,710
It's all over the internet. Look!

181
00:09:00,964 --> 00:09:03,129
Does Lauren Conrad
have a new beau?

182
00:09:03,198 --> 00:09:05,340
An anonymous
source has the answers ..

183
00:09:05,421 --> 00:09:08,068
Oh, yeah, I know that
guy. His name's Brian Griffin

184
00:09:08,116 --> 00:09:10,771
and he definitely
boned Lauren last night.

185
00:09:11,335 --> 00:09:13,235
Great ... great...
That ... that's fantastic.

186
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,747
Well, I think it's wonderful that
 you're datin' such a classy, well

187
00:09:16,793 --> 00:09:22,516
educated girl like Lauren Conra ...
ha ha. She's such an idiot, Brian.

188
00:09:23,466 --> 00:09:25,145
She's such an idiot!

189
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:28,432
Yeah, you know
something, Brian. I bet you
make the late night monologues.

190
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,894
I mean, it's a little weird isn't it,
 this new Lauren Conrad relationship?

191
00:09:31,981 --> 00:09:34,448
When asked about their sex
life, Brian was quoted as saying

192
00:09:34,483 --> 00:09:37,225
"Oh, yeah, we just do it "me" style."

193
00:09:38,205 --> 00:09:40,911
Have you seen the news about
Lauren Conrad and Brian Griffin?

194
00:09:40,946 --> 00:09:44,500
Y'know, a lot of these
young Hollywood girls carry
their little dogs around in their purse.

195
00:09:44,535 --> 00:09:48,595
But Lauren carries one in her pants.

196
00:09:49,849 --> 00:09:53,426
Yeah, so Lauren Conrad and
Brian Griffin are now a couple.

197
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:57,659
Apparently she gave
that dog a bone and
... he gave it right back!

198
00:09:58,755 --> 00:10:01,338
Look, I was drunk
outta my mind, I didn't
know what I was doing.

199
00:10:01,373 --> 00:10:05,165
It was a one night
thing. I have no interest in
dating one of those shallow

200
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,992
idiot celebrities who's
only famous for being famous.

201
00:10:08,027 --> 00:10:09,662
I'm going over to let her down easy.

202
00:10:09,697 --> 00:10:11,736
Hey, tell her I like her
work in "Jake and the Fatman".

203
00:10:11,871 --> 00:10:14,129
Oh no, wait.
That was William Conrad.

204
00:10:14,219 --> 00:10:15,877
Tell her I like "Jake and the Fatman".

205
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:20,513
Can I help you?

206
00:10:20,548 --> 00:10:25,321
Yeah, I'm Brian. I'm, ah,
the guy all the comedians
have been talking about.

207
00:10:25,356 --> 00:10:28,545
Oh, si! Ha ha ha ha ha.
Lauren is in the back.

208
00:10:28,645 --> 00:10:30,945
Just follow the
music and you will find her.

209
00:10:30,946 --> 00:10:31,946
Thanks.

210
00:10:43,247 --> 00:10:45,547
- Oh, hi Brian.
- Wow! Hi.

211
00:10:45,548 --> 00:10:47,724
- That's beautiful. What was that?

212
00:10:47,824 --> 00:10:50,575
- It's Mozart's violin
concerto number 1 in B flat.

213
00:10:51,749 --> 00:10:53,949
Plato's symposium ... this yours?

214
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,650
- Oh, yeah.
- It's pretty worn out.

215
00:10:55,651 --> 00:10:57,451
Yeah, I've read it,
like, a hundred times.

216
00:10:57,452 --> 00:11:00,342
I find Aristófanes'
quasi satirical origin myth

217
00:11:00,343 --> 00:11:03,374
regarding the three genders
both fantastic and serious.

218
00:11:03,753 --> 00:11:06,753
Yeah, that .. er .. that
always cracked me up.

219
00:11:06,754 --> 00:11:08,854
So, you read a lot, huh?

220
00:11:08,855 --> 00:11:12,055
Yeah, but I try not
to let it interfere with
my biomolecular research.

221
00:11:12,056 --> 00:11:14,656
Biomolecular?
I ... I don't understand.

222
00:11:14,657 --> 00:11:16,757
Come on. I'll show
you what I did yesterday.

223
00:11:16,758 --> 00:11:20,358
It'll make you feel ... young,
as when the world was new.

224
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:36,159
- You did all this in a day?
- The matrix formed in a day.

225
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,860
The life forms grew later at
a substantially accelerated rate.

226
00:11:40,561 --> 00:11:43,561
Can I cook? Or can't I?

227
00:11:47,162 --> 00:11:49,862
This doesn't make any sense. If
you're so smart why do you hide it?

228
00:11:49,863 --> 00:11:52,763
Come on, Brian. You know
America doesn't like smart people.

229
00:11:52,764 --> 00:11:54,364
They elected Bush twice.

230
00:11:54,365 --> 00:11:58,065
Yeah, once, but .. so this whole
 persona is just a publicity stunt?

231
00:11:58,066 --> 00:12:00,366
Publicity is what keeps
this franchise running, Brian.

232
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:03,067
We're even using state of the
art computer animation to create

233
00:12:03,068 --> 00:12:05,068
a fake sex tape
with me and Bill Cosby.

234
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:09,769
Now, you will get ready for the
zim zam and the babbidy bibbedy.

235
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:14,270
and you will take off your
clothes, like vooo and voooom

236
00:12:14,271 --> 00:12:18,771
and get ready for
the most splendiferous
pudding pop you have ever seen.

237
00:12:22,072 --> 00:12:24,772
Alright, Jillian, since I'm giving
you away on your wedding day

238
00:12:24,773 --> 00:12:26,845
I wanna make sure it
all goes off without a hitch.

239
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,646
Now, what are your
thoughts on a wedding singer?

240
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:31,747
Oh, I thought that maybe I
would just DJ the wedding myself.

241
00:12:31,748 --> 00:12:34,148
I already made a playlist on this.

242
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:36,949
- A box of Junior Mints?
- This isn't an iPod?

243
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:40,450
- Do Junior Mints play MP3s?
- My iPod is chocolate?

244
00:12:41,451 --> 00:12:45,351
Well, be that as it may,
 or not be that, I was thinkin'
 I could be your wedding singer.

245
00:12:45,552 --> 00:12:47,552
That's a great idea, Peter!

246
00:12:47,553 --> 00:12:50,753
Sweet! And I promise you'll be
able to understand all the words.

247
00:12:50,754 --> 00:12:53,454
Not like Sting where you
can only understand the last 3.

248
00:12:59,955 --> 00:13:02,355
... brand new day ..

249
00:13:05,356 --> 00:13:06,925
So, did you break up with  Lauren?

250
00:13:06,956 --> 00:13:10,256
No, I didn't. As a matter of fact,
she's coming over for dinner tonight.

251
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:11,757
Say what?!

252
00:13:15,858 --> 00:13:18,858
Well, Lauren, it's a real
pleasure havin' you here for dinner.

253
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,259
Of course, I'm sure this isn't
as exciting as your usual cuisine.

254
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,145
Y'know, all that caviar
with the little silver spoons

255
00:13:25,246 --> 00:13:28,146
Actually, Mrs Griffin, caviar
spoons are carved from bone.

256
00:13:28,147 --> 00:13:31,547
They don't use metal because
it reacts chemically with the
fish eggs and changes their taste.

257
00:13:31,948 --> 00:13:33,848
Oh, well that's fascinating.

258
00:13:33,949 --> 00:13:36,100
You could have just
complimented the free food,

259
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,950
but one upping
me is another way to go.

260
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:39,351
- So, y'know, guys ...
- Bitch.

261
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,805
Lauren just finished
a fascinating doctoral thesis

262
00:13:41,806 --> 00:13:43,952
on sub-orbital
propulsion mechanisms

263
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:46,853
that NASA is using for the
next generation of space shuttles.

264
00:13:46,975 --> 00:13:50,122
Oooohhhhhh ... Aaaaahhhh!

265
00:13:50,254 --> 00:13:53,036
So, Lauren, um, whenever
 I'm watchin' your show ... 

266
00:13:53,054 --> 00:13:54,416
... you give me wood.

267
00:13:55,355 --> 00:13:56,655
Where do we go from here?

268
00:13:56,656 --> 00:13:59,056
Well, I could sign a picture for you.

269
00:13:59,857 --> 00:14:01,757
Uh, yeah, sure,
that'd be fine. Thank you.

270
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,263
So, Lauren, do you and
Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan

271
00:14:04,358 --> 00:14:06,258
 all hang out and
go drunk driving together?

272
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:08,659
I heard that Lindsay
Lohan wasn't driving that night.

273
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,360
She was taking the rap for a friend.

274
00:14:12,361 --> 00:14:13,761
Road hog!

275
00:14:14,662 --> 00:14:17,462
Oh, no! I already have 2 strikes.

276
00:14:17,463 --> 00:14:20,763
- I'll take the wheel, Mr Magoo.
- I'm too old to go to prison.

277
00:14:20,764 --> 00:14:24,664
They'll rape me! And I'll
never see 'em coming, no I won't.

278
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:28,445
Well, uh, Lauren and I had a
great time today at the Art museum.

279
00:14:28,446 --> 00:14:31,246
There was a special exhibition
of rare Monet paintings ...

280
00:14:31,247 --> 00:14:32,647
- Manet, honey.
- What?

281
00:14:32,648 --> 00:14:34,948
It was actually the
Manet exhibit, not Monet ...

282
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:37,249
But no big deal. People
make that mistake all the time.

283
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,450
Oh, right.

284
00:14:38,451 --> 00:14:42,251
Y'know, I don't mean
to be rude, but do you
have a more comfortable chair?

285
00:14:42,252 --> 00:14:43,452
This one's really hurting my back.

286
00:14:43,953 --> 00:14:47,353
Oh, my God! Quagmire, you
come out from under there!

287
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:51,554
I'm sorry everybody. I just
wanted to meet her so bad.

288
00:14:51,555 --> 00:14:54,055
I can't do anything right.

289
00:14:54,956 --> 00:14:56,156
I'll go have a talk with him.

290
00:14:57,657 --> 00:14:59,745
Hey, buddy, where are all your pals?

291
00:14:59,746 --> 00:15:02,546
- Playin' baseball.
- Well, why aren't you
playin' with 'em?

292
00:15:02,596 --> 00:15:05,647
- 'Cause I don't have a glove.
- Oh, yeah?

293
00:15:05,898 --> 00:15:10,048
- Gee! Just for me? No fooling?
- Nah, just kidding. It's mine.

294
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:11,649
- Oh.
- Yeah.

295
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:18,050
Oh, sweetie, dinner with your
family was so much fun tonight.

296
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:19,651
Yeah, I think they really liked you.

297
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:22,452
It was so cute when
you thought Manet was Monet.

298
00:15:22,453 --> 00:15:24,453
Yeah .. yeah .. that .. that was a hoot.

299
00:15:24,654 --> 00:15:26,988
Oh, hey, how are you
liking my unabridged history

300
00:15:26,989 --> 00:15:29,154
of 2nd World War naval
tactics in the Pacific theatre?

301
00:15:29,155 --> 00:15:31,473
Oh, it's really, um .. interesting ..

302
00:15:31,508 --> 00:15:32,985
I'm at the part where
they detail the account

303
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,869
of Admiral Halsey's
victory at Midway.

304
00:15:34,904 --> 00:15:36,458
You mean Admiral
Spruance, sweetie.

305
00:15:36,551 --> 00:15:36,986
Huh?

306
00:15:37,053 --> 00:15:40,506
Well, Halsey was
hospitalized with cirrhosis
at the outset of the battle

307
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:44,406
so Spruance, who
prior to June of 1941,
was primarily a desk Admiral

308
00:15:44,407 --> 00:15:47,240
was charged with leading the
naval fleet at Midway against Japan.

309
00:15:47,275 --> 00:15:49,401
A victory which
surprised even his peers.

310
00:15:49,436 --> 00:15:52,866
And in fact, was a
turning point for the American
naval forces in the Pacific.

311
00:15:53,127 --> 00:15:54,941
No, yeah. That's ..
that's the part I'm at.

312
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,292
Oh, my God, you're so cute

313
00:15:56,327 --> 00:15:57,675
when you don't know
what you're talking about.

314
00:15:57,847 --> 00:15:59,167
Well, wait a minute. What
the hell does that mean?

315
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:00,474
Are you saying I'm not smart?

316
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:03,157
You don't have to be. You're
adorable. Like those calendars

317
00:16:03,192 --> 00:16:04,392
that have monkeys in clothes.

318
00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:05,979
Look, why don't we talk
about this in the morning?

319
00:16:06,025 --> 00:16:07,626
I wanna finish that book.

320
00:16:08,858 --> 00:16:11,876
- Sweetie, since when
do you wear reading glasses?
- What? These?

321
00:16:11,911 --> 00:16:13,925
- I've had these forever.
- Honey, those aren't real.

322
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,788
- Sure they are.
- No .. they're not.

323
00:16:15,823 --> 00:16:17,875
I can see the little
Austin Powers logo on the side.

324
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,962
What are you talkin'
about?  These are my glasses.

325
00:16:22,822 --> 00:16:24,472
Yeah, baby, yeah!

326
00:16:24,473 --> 00:16:26,522
- Alright, I can't do this.
- Can't do what?

327
00:16:26,557 --> 00:16:28,609
I can't date someone
who's smarter than I am.

328
00:16:28,644 --> 00:16:29,987
I feel like Jillian.

329
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,871
O-o-o-o-o-h-h-h-h ..

330
00:16:32,111 --> 00:16:33,703
- What? What, what,
what? What is that?

331
00:16:33,828 --> 00:16:34,903
I think I get it.

332
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:37,067
This isn't about me
being smarter than you.

333
00:16:37,102 --> 00:16:39,116
This is about you still
being in love with Jillian.

334
00:16:39,151 --> 00:16:41,677
- How do you know that?
- Because I'm smarter than you, Brian.

335
00:16:42,108 --> 00:16:42,991
Oh, my God ...

336
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:44,742
You're right!

337
00:16:45,413 --> 00:16:49,104
Y'know, I thought I was
over her, but .. I'm .. I'm not.

338
00:16:49,886 --> 00:16:53,724
Somewhere along the line she
must have gotten under my skin.

339
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:58,270
I'm in love with her. How
could I have been so miopic?

340
00:16:58,305 --> 00:17:01,251
- "Myopic".
- Thank you, Lauren!

341
00:17:04,828 --> 00:17:08,106
My God, Lauren. What am I gonna
do? I'm still in love with Jillian.

342
00:17:08,141 --> 00:17:09,954
Well, there's only one
thing you can do, Brian.

343
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:11,132
Tell her how you feel.

344
00:17:11,134 --> 00:17:13,905
What's the use? It's
over. She's moved on.

345
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,684
Well, who knows? Women
are complex creatures, Brian.

346
00:17:16,766 --> 00:17:19,270
Maybe she just needs to be
reminded how much she misses you.

347
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:21,990
And I know exactly
how to do that, Brian.

348
00:17:22,025 --> 00:17:25,903
She needs to see you on
the arm of a beautiful woman.

349
00:17:31,827 --> 00:17:34,286
- What is this gonna do?
- It's gonna make her jealous.

350
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:36,551
You, out on the
town with a hot date.

351
00:17:36,586 --> 00:17:37,941
How are you a hot date?

352
00:17:38,014 --> 00:17:39,942
Whoa! You're angry at her, not me.

353
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:41,407
No wonder you're alone.

354
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:49,667
This isn't working at all. She
doesn't even know we're here.

355
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:53,393
Oh, she will, Brian. And she's gonna
be upset that your date is so into you.

356
00:17:53,428 --> 00:17:55,516
Ok, ready? I've
been reading up on things that

357
00:17:55,551 --> 00:17:58,385
sound sexy.
"Oh, Brian, I can't wait

358
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,548
til after dinner

359
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:02,731
'cause then we'll go home and you
can watch me have my period".

360
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,708
What the hell's wrong
with you? That's not sexy!

361
00:18:04,743 --> 00:18:07,168
Hey, Brian. I just
noticed you over here.

362
00:18:07,203 --> 00:18:10,149
- Hi, I'm Jillian.
- Desiree. Charmed!

363
00:18:10,184 --> 00:18:13,949
Well, I wish we could
stay. But we have quite
an exciting evening planned.

364
00:18:14,322 --> 00:18:16,855
Oh, oh, yeah, right.
We're really hittin' the town.

365
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,389
Yes, we're gonna
douche the night away.

366
00:18:19,424 --> 00:18:22,556
Uh, well, have fun. You
two are a really cute couple.

367
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,984
Hey, Desiree.

368
00:18:24,015 --> 00:18:26,299
Oh ... hey, Lee...

369
00:18:26,434 --> 00:18:29,156
Brian,this is Lee.
Lee, this is Brian.

370
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,019
I know Lee from ...

371
00:18:31,354 --> 00:18:34,447
- ... Starbucks.
- Hey, is that Desiree?

372
00:18:37,689 --> 00:18:41,601
That's it. I mean, I
don't know what else I can
do. The wedding's tomorrow

373
00:18:41,636 --> 00:18:44,060
and she hasn't shown
any signs of leaving Derek.

374
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:47,078
- I've completely run out of options.
- Not quite, Brian.

375
00:18:47,113 --> 00:18:49,426
- There's still one thing you can do.
- What's that?

376
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,521
Go for broke. Just throw all
your cards on the table at once.

377
00:18:52,556 --> 00:18:55,763
Show her that you love her in
a way she can't possibly ignore.

378
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,514
Hello?

379
00:18:57,549 --> 00:18:59,340
Oh, hey, Lee...

380
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,613
No, it's not a bad time.

381
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,743
Yeah, I still have those boots.

382
00:19:05,823 --> 00:19:08,767
Well, maybe I'll wear
'em and maybe I won't.

383
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:31,892
And now, Jillian ..
Do you take Derek ..

384
00:19:31,927 --> 00:19:33,346
Wait!

385
00:19:34,463 --> 00:19:36,587
Jillian, I'm in love with you.

386
00:19:36,622 --> 00:19:39,046
I want you .. no .. I need you

387
00:19:39,081 --> 00:19:41,973
with all my heart and soul.
And my only regret is that I

388
00:19:42,008 --> 00:19:44,432
didn't realize it
when we were together.

389
00:19:44,467 --> 00:19:46,817
Those were the
happiest days of my life and

390
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:50,319
I want more of
those days. Please, Jillian ...

391
00:19:51,213 --> 00:19:54,827
I love you. Will you
please take me back?

392
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:58,926
Brian, no.
You had your chance.

393
00:19:58,961 --> 00:20:01,423
I mean, I thought
you were my 'Soul Train' ..

394
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,472
- but you didn't want me.
- 'Soul Mate.'

395
00:20:03,507 --> 00:20:05,857
Soul Food? I'm sorry ...

396
00:20:05,892 --> 00:20:08,469
but I'm in love with Derek now.

397
00:20:08,804 --> 00:20:10,146
I see.

398
00:20:10,181 --> 00:20:13,126
- And you really feel that way?
- Yeah.

399
00:20:13,161 --> 00:20:15,005
I mean, he's everything I have

400
00:20:15,122 --> 00:20:17,380
especially since my
mom died of cancer.

401
00:20:17,556 --> 00:20:19,002
Ha ha ...

402
00:20:23,857 --> 00:20:26,168
Alright, party people.
Please clear the dance floor

403
00:20:26,203 --> 00:20:28,627
for the bride and
groom's first dance.

404
00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:30,676
And here to sing
a romantic ballad is

405
00:20:30,711 --> 00:20:32,943
the one and only Sting.

406
00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:42,258
... fields of gold.

407
00:20:50,306 --> 00:20:52,244
Hey, buck up there, sport.

408
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:54,815
- At least you gave it your all.
- I guess you're right.

409
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,692
- I still feel like crap, though.
- Well, look at it this way ...

410
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,108
You may have lost Jillian but

411
00:20:59,143 --> 00:21:01,120
you can at least be
happy that she's happy.

412
00:21:01,155 --> 00:21:03,728
- Plus you can always call Lauren.
- No, I can't.

413
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:04,473
Why not?

414
00:21:04,508 --> 00:21:05,916
She's never
gonna speak to me again.

415
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:07,465
I gave her worms.

416
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,000
