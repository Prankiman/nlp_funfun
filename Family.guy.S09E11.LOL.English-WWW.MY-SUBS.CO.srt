12
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:37,003
Everyone, we need to discuss
our problem with Chris.

13
00:00:37,043 --> 00:00:39,594
His little habit of, uh,
personal amusement

14
00:00:39,662 --> 00:00:41,362
is getting way out of hand.

15
00:00:41,414 --> 00:00:42,564
I mean, look at this.

16
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:44,032
What's that,
some kind of board?

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,533
It's Chris' blanket.

18
00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:49,020
We've got to do
something about this.

19
00:00:49,088 --> 00:00:51,556
I'm pretty sure our washing
machine is pregnant.

20
00:00:51,624 --> 00:00:53,775
I don't even know how that's
scientifically possible.

21
00:00:53,843 --> 00:00:56,878
Uh, life, uh, uh,
uh, uh, uh, uh...

22
00:00:56,946 --> 00:00:58,329
finds a way.

23
00:00:58,397 --> 00:01:00,832
You know, maybe you guys
should help find Chris a hobby.

24
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,534
Wait a minute, Brian,
that's a great idea.

25
00:01:02,601 --> 00:01:03,601
Chris needs a hobby.

26
00:01:03,669 --> 00:01:04,819
Hey, Chris, get in here.

27
00:01:04,887 --> 00:01:06,020
Yeah, Dad?

28
00:01:06,088 --> 00:01:07,689
We are gonna
find you a hobby.

29
00:01:07,757 --> 00:01:09,557
- What do you think of that?
- Okay.

30
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:10,759
There you go,
that's the spirit.

31
00:01:12,978 --> 00:01:14,229
Yuck.

32
00:01:17,199 --> 00:01:19,851
Hey, Christopher.
What are you up to?

33
00:01:19,919 --> 00:01:21,503
Hi, Mr. Herbert.

34
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,738
My dad's helping me
find a hobby.

35
00:01:23,806 --> 00:01:26,107
Well, you sure got a
pretty morning for it.

36
00:01:26,158 --> 00:01:28,059
Chris, don't waste
our time with the elderly.

37
00:01:28,127 --> 00:01:29,844
They're dying.

38
00:01:32,248 --> 00:01:35,717
Please, God,
let me just sniff his hat.

39
00:01:35,785 --> 00:01:38,653
Let me just sniff his hat,
that's all I want.

40
00:01:41,674 --> 00:01:43,341
(sniffs)

41
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:46,344
Now I want more.

42
00:01:49,615 --> 00:01:52,717
Okay, Chris, this is the
gentle art of philately,

43
00:01:52,785 --> 00:01:54,919
otherwise known as
stamp collecting.

44
00:01:54,987 --> 00:01:56,387
Here's a pile of stamps,

45
00:01:56,455 --> 00:01:59,274
carefully culled from swap
meets and garage sales.

46
00:01:59,325 --> 00:02:00,758
And look at this.

47
00:02:00,826 --> 00:02:02,260
It's a Bolivian airplane.

48
00:02:02,328 --> 00:02:05,213
Now, it says it's worth
eight cents, but really...

49
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,965
it's worth twelve.

50
00:02:07,032 --> 00:02:09,000
See that? Already ahead.

51
00:02:09,084 --> 00:02:11,503
Came right out of the blocks
with a winner here, Chris.

52
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:15,607
Now, we'll just paste this very
carefully into the book.

53
00:02:15,674 --> 00:02:18,026
And that's where it belongs.

54
00:02:18,093 --> 00:02:20,011
Now this is a
loaded handgun.

55
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:22,280
And what we're gonna do
now is kill ourselves

56
00:02:22,348 --> 00:02:23,715
because this is horrible.

57
00:02:23,782 --> 00:02:25,316
Couldn't we just stop
philateling?

58
00:02:25,384 --> 00:02:26,985
Too late.
(gunshot)

59
00:02:30,322 --> 00:02:32,190
All right, Chris, this is
one of the oldest hobbies

60
00:02:32,258 --> 00:02:34,809
in existence: Drinking.

61
00:02:34,877 --> 00:02:37,412
Hey, hey, good times
just walked in.

62
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:39,380
(applause and cheering)

63
00:02:39,448 --> 00:02:41,683
HORACE: Oh, hey, he can't be in here.
He's not 21.

64
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,018
All right, just hang out here
for a little bit, huh?

65
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:48,790
(slurring words): All right,
see you later, gang.

66
00:02:48,857 --> 00:02:50,992
Chris, what are
you doing here?

67
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,894
You're supposed
to be at camp.

68
00:02:52,962 --> 00:02:55,463
What am I paying for?

69
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:59,167
I could have gone pro
if it wasn't for my bum knee.

70
00:02:59,235 --> 00:03:01,669
(snoring)

71
00:03:01,737 --> 00:03:04,639
(sighs)

72
00:03:04,707 --> 00:03:06,241
(gasps)
Wow!

73
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,301
That is so cool. What is it?

74
00:03:16,368 --> 00:03:18,102
MAN (with German accent):
It's a puppet.

75
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,720
Welcome.

76
00:03:19,772 --> 00:03:22,640
I am Franz Gutentag,
and this is my puppet shop.

77
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,042
Puppets.

78
00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:25,310
And I thought I'd
seen everything.

79
00:03:25,377 --> 00:03:26,711
My name is Chris.

80
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:29,898
Well, Chris, puppetry
is a wonderful art form.

81
00:03:29,965 --> 00:03:32,183
You can create an entire world
right before your eyes

82
00:03:32,251 --> 00:03:33,851
and watch it come to life.

83
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,470
Wow.

84
00:03:35,537 --> 00:03:36,738
What's that one
over there?

85
00:03:36,805 --> 00:03:39,891
Ah. That is a work in progress.

86
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:43,011
It is waiting to become
anything we wish it to be.

87
00:03:48,601 --> 00:03:51,019
My name is Chris,

88
00:03:51,086 --> 00:03:53,922
and I like candy and jumping
and colorful birds.

89
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:56,257
Wow! What else do I like?

90
00:03:56,325 --> 00:03:58,259
You like the pop singing
of today.

91
00:03:58,327 --> 00:04:00,428

That was the German-est
thing I've ever seen.

00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:22,967
I'm so glad
you like it, Chris.

104
00:04:23,035 --> 00:04:24,535
Would you like to try?

105
00:04:24,603 --> 00:04:25,937
Oh, boy, would I?!

106
00:04:28,674 --> 00:04:32,894
I'm a vampire, and I'm in love
with this unattractive girl.

107
00:04:32,962 --> 00:04:35,280
Grr, I'm a werewolf,

108
00:04:35,347 --> 00:04:37,982
and I am also in love
with this unattractive girl.

109
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,252
- Boy, she sure can act though, can't she?
- Nope.

110
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,788
The end.
(laughing)

111
00:04:43,856 --> 00:04:45,356
Bravo, Chris!

112
00:04:45,424 --> 00:04:46,824
You have really
tapped into

113
00:04:46,892 --> 00:04:48,910
the wonder and enchantment
that is puppetry.

114
00:04:48,977 --> 00:04:51,829
Plus I move these dolls and
make like they're talking.

115
00:04:51,897 --> 00:04:53,131
Yes. Right.

116
00:04:53,198 --> 00:04:55,199
Thanks for showing
me how to do it

117
00:04:55,267 --> 00:04:57,268
and being so nice to me,
Mr. Gutentag.

118
00:04:57,336 --> 00:04:58,786
Call me Franz.

119
00:04:58,854 --> 00:05:00,855
Okay. Franz.

120
00:05:00,923 --> 00:05:03,308
You know, Chris,
seeing a young person like you

121
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,677
enjoy puppetry
makes me so happy.

122
00:05:05,761 --> 00:05:08,179
I feel like we could
become good friends.

123
00:05:08,247 --> 00:05:10,448
That sounds like fun.

124
00:05:10,516 --> 00:05:12,884
Wow, I think you're just
about my most favorite guy

125
00:05:12,951 --> 00:05:14,519
who's gonna die soon.

126
00:05:14,586 --> 00:05:18,389
That's the nicest thing
anyone has ever said to me.

127
00:05:18,457 --> 00:05:20,942
Oh, no!

128
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,408
(knocking on door)

129
00:05:27,644 --> 00:05:29,895
Mr. Griffin,
I'm sorry to bother you,

130
00:05:29,965 --> 00:05:31,333
but there's a...

131
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:33,709
Well, there's a situation,
and we need to talk.

132
00:05:33,777 --> 00:05:36,045
Look, if this is about those
droppings in your yard,

133
00:05:36,113 --> 00:05:37,747
it was, uh, uh, Brian.

134
00:05:37,814 --> 00:05:39,181
Yeah, Brian.

135
00:05:39,249 --> 00:05:41,484
No, it's this man Chris
is hanging out with.

136
00:05:41,552 --> 00:05:43,219
He's bad news.

137
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,121
Why? What's
the problem?

138
00:05:45,188 --> 00:05:48,391
- Chris is friends with a Nazi!
- What?!

139
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,326
At first I wasn't sure
it was him,

140
00:05:50,394 --> 00:05:54,964
but I got a closer look, and now
there's no question in my mind.

141
00:05:55,032 --> 00:05:57,266
Franz Gutentag is really

142
00:05:57,334 --> 00:06:01,337
Lieutenant Franz Schlechtnacht,
the most sadistic S.S. guard

143
00:06:01,405 --> 00:06:04,006
in all of Hitler's
concentration camps.

144
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:06,776
That's a very
serious accusation.

145
00:06:06,843 --> 00:06:09,445
How do you know this man
was a Nazi prison guard?

146
00:06:09,496 --> 00:06:11,831
'Cause I was there.

147
00:06:11,915 --> 00:06:15,117
<i>It was 1944.</i>

148
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:18,421
<i>I was a young Air Force pilot</i>
<i>assigned as part of an escort</i>

149
00:06:18,472 --> 00:06:20,723

<i>over southern Germany,</i>

150
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,259
<i>when we encountered</i>
<i>the Luftwaffe.</i>

151
00:06:24,912 --> 00:06:27,063
<i>At first we thought</i>
<i>we were in the clear</i>

152
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,848
<i>because the Germans</i>
<i>were frightened</i>

153
00:06:28,932 --> 00:06:31,734
<i>by the scary shark face</i>
<i>on the front of our plane.</i>

154
00:06:31,801 --> 00:06:32,969
Ah! A shark!

155
00:06:33,036 --> 00:06:35,121
How did it get all the way
up here in the sky?!

156
00:06:35,188 --> 00:06:36,606
Who cares, you fool?!

157
00:06:36,673 --> 00:06:38,274
Do you want to get eaten?
Retreat!

158
00:06:41,328 --> 00:06:43,829
<i>But there was one</i>
<i>stubborn pilot</i>

159
00:06:43,914 --> 00:06:45,331
<i>who saw through our disguise.</i>

160
00:06:47,951 --> 00:06:49,285
(machine guns firing)

161
00:07:10,674 --> 00:07:15,962
<i>Most of the surviving American</i>
<i>pilots were taken to POW camps,</i>

162
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:18,280
<i>but for some reason,</i>
<i>they thought I was gay,</i>

163
00:07:18,348 --> 00:07:21,067
<i>so I was taken</i>
<i>to a concentration camp.</i>

164
00:07:21,151 --> 00:07:24,186
<i>Behind those walls,</i>

165
00:07:24,237 --> 00:07:28,057
<i>there was one guard</i>
<i>who decided everyone's fate.</i>

166
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:31,727
<i>If he pointed to the left,</i>
<i>you did hard labor.</i>

167
00:07:31,795 --> 00:07:35,331
<i>If he pointed to the right,</i>
<i>you died.</i>

168
00:07:35,382 --> 00:07:38,501
<i>That man was</i>
<i>Franz Schlechtnacht.</i>

169
00:07:38,552 --> 00:07:42,888
<i>I was spared death,</i>
<i>but I was given hard labor.</i>

170
00:07:42,956 --> 00:07:45,508
<i>He made me sort</i>
<i>the camp recyclables.</i>

171
00:07:45,575 --> 00:07:47,109
<i>But some of those bottles</i>

172
00:07:47,177 --> 00:07:49,178
<i>still had a little bit</i>
<i>of soda in 'em.</i>

173
00:07:49,246 --> 00:07:52,481
<i>It would spill out on my hands</i>
<i>and make 'em kind of sticky.</i>

174
00:07:52,549 --> 00:07:56,519
<i>Dear God, how my hands</i>
<i>would get kind of sticky!</i>

175
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,571
(screaming)

176
00:07:58,655 --> 00:08:01,557
(evil laughter)

177
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:05,144
<i>No one should have to suffer</i>
<i>the way I suffered!</i>

178
00:08:05,212 --> 00:08:09,048
So that's why Chris should stay
away from that puppet store guy.

179
00:08:09,116 --> 00:08:10,616
That all sounds
kind of sketchy.

180
00:08:10,684 --> 00:08:12,184
Wait, are you
Jamie Kennedy?

181
00:08:12,252 --> 00:08:14,487
Am I... Am I being skunked

182
00:08:14,554 --> 00:08:16,022
or puked or whatever
some (bleep)?

183
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:18,090
I'm telling you the truth.

184
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:20,393
I swear on my nephew's grave.

185
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,329
I don't know, Franz seems
like such a nice old man.

186
00:08:23,397 --> 00:08:25,931
Y... You know, maybe we should
just invite him for dinner

187
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:27,333
and clear this
whole thing up.

188
00:08:27,401 --> 00:08:29,502
Yeah, you know, we got
no right passing judgment

189
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:30,870
without getting to know him.

190
00:08:30,937 --> 00:08:32,338
Isn't that right,
Scottish Chipmunk?

191
00:08:34,107 --> 00:08:36,675
Yeah, he doesn't talk,
but, uh, he's a chipmunk,

192
00:08:36,743 --> 00:08:39,478
and he's Scottish, and he
would back me up on this.

193
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,851
Chris, wait.
Where you going?

194
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:48,354
I'm going to
Mr. Gutentag's house.

195
00:08:48,422 --> 00:08:49,789
- You can't.
- Why not?

196
00:08:49,856 --> 00:08:52,725
Chris, his name
isn't Gutentag,

197
00:08:52,793 --> 00:08:55,261
it's Schlechtnacht,
and he's a Nazi.

198
00:08:55,328 --> 00:08:56,562
What?!

199
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,230
It's true.

200
00:08:58,298 --> 00:09:00,433
You got to stay away
from that terrible man.

201
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,802
Mr. Gutentag
isn't a terrible man.

202
00:09:02,869 --> 00:09:04,737
He's my friend.

203
00:09:04,805 --> 00:09:07,907
Chris, you don't understand,
I'm trying to help you.

204
00:09:07,974 --> 00:09:09,108
Help me what?

205
00:09:09,176 --> 00:09:11,043
Clean your pool
with my shirt off,

206
00:09:11,111 --> 00:09:12,378
or wash your car
in jean shorts,

207
00:09:12,446 --> 00:09:14,046
bend over in front of you

208
00:09:14,114 --> 00:09:16,215
to get little bits
of lint out of the rug?

209
00:09:16,283 --> 00:09:18,050
I know what you're about,
Mr. Herbert:

210
00:09:18,118 --> 00:09:21,020
Free labor,
and I'm not into it.

211
00:09:21,088 --> 00:09:23,823
Chris, you have to choose.

212
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,958
It's either Franz or me.

213
00:09:35,685 --> 00:09:38,187
Chris, what's the matter?
You look upset.

214
00:09:38,255 --> 00:09:41,524
Mr. Herbert was saying
terrible things about you.

215
00:09:41,591 --> 00:09:44,894
He said you liked Hitler, and
your name isn't really Gutentag.

216
00:09:44,961 --> 00:09:48,631
Oh, Chris, you can't always
believe what you hear.

217
00:09:48,698 --> 00:09:51,767
For example, everybody thinks
that prostitution is illegal,

218
00:09:51,835 --> 00:09:53,369
but there are ways around it.

219
00:09:53,436 --> 00:09:55,671
All right, let's do it.

220
00:09:55,722 --> 00:09:58,007
Both of you are under
arrest for prostitution.

221
00:09:58,074 --> 00:09:59,375
It's not prostitution.

222
00:09:59,442 --> 00:10:01,277
You paid her to have sex.

223
00:10:01,344 --> 00:10:04,079
No, I paid her to have sex
and we're filming it.

224
00:10:04,147 --> 00:10:06,515
So, technically it's not
prostitution, it's a porno.

225
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,150
Oh, well,

226
00:10:08,218 --> 00:10:10,052
as long as you're filming
and selling it, it's legal.

227
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,687
Enjoy your day.

228
00:10:11,755 --> 00:10:15,024
Remember kids, she's not
a whore if she's an actress.

229
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:17,290
ANNOUNCER:
<i>This has been a message from:</i>

230
00:10:17,313 --> 00:10:19,286
The Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter Day Saints.

231
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,296
(knocking on door)

232
00:10:20,363 --> 00:10:23,115
Oh, that's probably
mean old Mr. Herbert again.

233
00:10:23,183 --> 00:10:24,533
Dad?
Excuse me, Chris,

234
00:10:24,584 --> 00:10:26,452
I got to talk to
Mr. Pupenchest here.

235
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,087
Good day to you,
Mr. Griffin.

236
00:10:28,155 --> 00:10:30,456
Say, listen, my wife and I
appreciate how nice you've been

237
00:10:30,524 --> 00:10:32,391
to my son with all
the puppets and whatnot,

238
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:34,443
and, uh, we wanted
to invite you over for dinner.

239
00:10:34,511 --> 00:10:35,911
Oh, wonderful.

240
00:10:35,979 --> 00:10:37,713
And I shall celebrate
our friendship

241
00:10:37,781 --> 00:10:40,316
by giving you a hand-carved
German wall clock.

242
00:10:40,383 --> 00:10:41,884
Oh, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes.

243
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,287
I could not
find the clock.

244
00:10:45,355 --> 00:10:46,822
Aw.

245
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,791
But you got three of them
on the wall over there.

246
00:10:48,859 --> 00:10:50,226
Yes, those are mine.

247
00:10:50,293 --> 00:10:51,961
Oh.

248
00:10:52,028 --> 00:10:53,062
Yeah, I need those.

249
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:54,663
Uh-huh.

250
00:10:54,731 --> 00:10:56,665
I just don't know why
you said it then.

251
00:10:56,733 --> 00:10:59,235
Mr. Gutentag,
can I use the bathroom?

252
00:10:59,302 --> 00:11:01,170
Of course.
Down the hall to the right.

253
00:11:01,238 --> 00:11:02,738
It's the door marked:

254
00:11:02,806 --> 00:11:05,958
<i>"Gluckmachnichten-</i>
<i>mechwerchtichlieber."</i>

255
00:11:18,371 --> 00:11:19,688
What the...?

256
00:11:32,752 --> 00:11:35,554
So now you know
the truth.

257
00:11:37,357 --> 00:11:39,758
I promise I won't tell anyone!

258
00:11:39,826 --> 00:11:42,194
Just let my dad go!

259
00:11:42,262 --> 00:11:45,831
Oh, I am afraid that
is quite impossible.

260
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,721
You're not gonna get away
with this, Mr. Googlesearch.

261
00:11:52,789 --> 00:11:54,974
Oh, but I think that I will.

262
00:11:55,058 --> 00:11:56,542
You two know my secret.

263
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,478
I must be sure no one
ever finds out the truth.

264
00:11:59,546 --> 00:12:01,146
So what?
Are you gonna kill us?

265
00:12:01,214 --> 00:12:02,982
Perhaps, Mr. Griffin.

266
00:12:03,049 --> 00:12:04,783
I have not yet decided.

267
00:12:04,851 --> 00:12:06,986
Well, you might want to do
something about that first.

268
00:12:07,187 --> 00:12:08,285
What?

269
00:12:10,657 --> 00:12:12,558
Quick, shoot him, Chris!
What are you waiting for?!

270
00:12:12,626 --> 00:12:14,827
I... I... How do I know
which one to shoot?

271
00:12:14,894 --> 00:12:15,527
What?

272
00:12:15,595 --> 00:12:17,997
How do I know
which one is the real Dad?!

273
00:12:18,064 --> 00:12:19,949
I... We... We never switched.

274
00:12:20,016 --> 00:12:21,216
We don't even look the same!

275
00:12:21,284 --> 00:12:22,818
All right, when's my birthday?

276
00:12:22,886 --> 00:12:24,153
Ah, crap.

277
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,087
February eighth.

278
00:12:25,956 --> 00:12:26,972
(gasps)

279
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,040
Dad!

280
00:12:31,328 --> 00:12:32,928
There. That's more like it.

281
00:12:32,996 --> 00:12:34,330
You idiot!

282
00:12:34,397 --> 00:12:36,999
Well, learn my birthday,
(bleep)!

283
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:46,612
Mrs. Griffin!
What a nice surprise!

284
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,747
Come in!

285
00:12:47,815 --> 00:12:50,383
Mr. Gutentag,
I'm sorry to bother you,

286
00:12:50,451 --> 00:12:53,586
but Chris and Peter
didn't come home last night.

287
00:12:53,654 --> 00:12:54,854
Have you seen them?

288
00:12:54,922 --> 00:12:57,757
Oh, wait, is he a
great big fat person?

289
00:12:57,825 --> 00:12:59,725
He's a large man,
yes, sir.

290
00:12:59,793 --> 00:13:01,327
No, I have not seen them.

291
00:13:01,395 --> 00:13:03,396
Well, if you do,
could you please contact me?

292
00:13:03,464 --> 00:13:05,364
I'm just worried sick.

293
00:13:05,432 --> 00:13:06,966
Of course, Mrs. Griffin.

294
00:13:07,034 --> 00:13:09,302
I will let you
know immediately.

295
00:13:09,386 --> 00:13:10,953
Dad, I want to go home.

296
00:13:11,021 --> 00:13:13,556
All right, let's try
and figure a way outta here.

297
00:13:13,624 --> 00:13:15,291
Look around.
See if you can find something

298
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:16,742
to break the door down with.

299
00:13:18,295 --> 00:13:21,481
(gasps)
Dad, there's a window here!

300
00:13:21,548 --> 00:13:23,299
Oh, my God,
maybe we can get outside.

301
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:26,269
No, it's too small.

302
00:13:26,336 --> 00:13:27,870
Wait, Dad, look.

303
00:13:27,938 --> 00:13:30,339
There's Meg walking down
the street.

304
00:13:32,643 --> 00:13:33,810
Hey, Meg!

305
00:13:33,877 --> 00:13:35,578
Hanging out with
all your friends?

306
00:13:35,646 --> 00:13:37,113
(both laugh)

307
00:13:37,164 --> 00:13:40,449
Hey, whale,
the ocean's that way!

308
00:13:40,501 --> 00:13:41,701
That's a good one, too.

309
00:13:41,768 --> 00:13:43,836
All right, let's figure
a way to get outta here.

310
00:13:43,904 --> 00:13:45,371
Now we can't fit
through the window,

311
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:47,206
but maybe there's
some way we can let

312
00:13:47,274 --> 00:13:48,524
people know
we're down here.

313
00:13:48,592 --> 00:13:50,092
We gotta make
as much noise as possible

314
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,527
to get people's attention.

315
00:13:51,595 --> 00:13:55,131
And nothing makes more noise
than unwanted salsa music.

316
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,665
Hand me that radio.

317
00:13:58,685 --> 00:14:00,937
(loud salsa music plays)

318
00:14:02,122 --> 00:14:03,689
(loud salsa music continues)

319
00:14:03,774 --> 00:14:05,641
What the hell?

320
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:08,411
Oh, for God's sake, where's
that white noise machine?

321
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,714
(woman screams)

322
00:14:11,782 --> 00:14:13,049
<i>Help!</i>

323
00:14:13,116 --> 00:14:14,951
<i>Oh, my God, help!</i>

324
00:14:15,018 --> 00:14:16,085
<i>Somebody help me!</i>

325
00:14:16,153 --> 00:14:18,988
(sighs)

326
00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:21,507
(music turns to static)

327
00:14:21,575 --> 00:14:23,910
Aw, man,
the battery's dead.

328
00:14:23,994 --> 00:14:25,294
Now what do we do?

329
00:14:25,362 --> 00:14:27,079
(gasp)
Oh, my God.

330
00:14:28,782 --> 00:14:31,200
Mr. Herbert! Mr. Herbert!

331
00:14:32,953 --> 00:14:34,770
Oh, he can't hear me.

332
00:14:34,838 --> 00:14:37,373
Jesse! Jesse!

333
00:14:37,424 --> 00:14:39,141
(barks weakly)

334
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:42,178
Jesse, what is it, boy?

335
00:14:42,229 --> 00:14:44,146
(gasps)
Chris!

336
00:14:44,214 --> 00:14:46,048
Chris, what happened?!

337
00:14:46,116 --> 00:14:47,633
You were right, Mr. Herbert.

338
00:14:47,701 --> 00:14:49,135
Franz is a Nazi.

339
00:14:49,203 --> 00:14:50,636
And he's keeping us prisoner
down here.

340
00:14:50,704 --> 00:14:51,904
Get help.

341
00:14:51,972 --> 00:14:53,940
Oh, and if you
see Meg, tell her

342
00:14:54,007 --> 00:14:55,608
"Thunder Thighs
are on the move!

343
00:14:55,676 --> 00:14:56,876
Thunder Thighs
are loose."

344
00:14:56,944 --> 00:14:58,828
You know, I gotta say, Chris,

345
00:14:58,895 --> 00:15:02,031
all my life I wanted
to see you locked in a basement,

346
00:15:02,082 --> 00:15:06,168
but now that it's happened,
all I want to do is get you out.

347
00:15:06,236 --> 00:15:10,356
Don't you worry.
I'll be back with help.

348
00:15:10,424 --> 00:15:12,191
You want me to write that Thunder
Thighs thing down for you?

349
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:13,593
Ah, he's not gonna do it.

350
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:42,571
I'm here for the boy.

351
00:15:42,623 --> 00:15:43,605
Who are you?

352
00:15:43,657 --> 00:15:45,825
Oh, you don't remember me?

353
00:15:45,892 --> 00:15:49,362
Well, I remember you,
Lieutenant Schlechtnacht.

354
00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:50,563
(gasps)

355
00:15:50,631 --> 00:15:52,498
But then why should you
remember?

356
00:15:52,566 --> 00:15:54,433
There were so many of us.

357
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:56,802
But, frankly,
I don't give a damn.

358
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,437
And I'll tell you this:

359
00:15:58,505 --> 00:16:02,241
only one of us is gonna
walk outta here alive.

360
00:16:04,144 --> 00:16:05,728
Bring it on!

361
00:16:05,795 --> 00:16:07,430
(dramatic action music plays)

362
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:27,943
(snoring)

363
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:29,979
Wake up. Wake up.
We're fighting.

364
00:17:30,047 --> 00:17:32,081
Where... Where am I?

365
00:17:32,149 --> 00:17:34,767
It's okay.
We're fighting. Wake up.

366
00:18:01,912 --> 00:18:04,280
(rapid beeping)

367
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,185
Uh, hang on.
Hang on. Pills.

368
00:18:09,252 --> 00:18:11,137
Yeah, me, too.

369
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:16,976
Wednesday, right?

370
00:18:17,043 --> 00:18:18,978
Yeah, it's Wednesday.

371
00:18:29,072 --> 00:18:30,656
Uh, you know what?
You know what?

372
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,425
What?

373
00:18:32,492 --> 00:18:34,160
I'm having some trouble
getting up.

374
00:18:34,227 --> 00:18:35,394
Would you mind
calling my nurse?

375
00:18:35,462 --> 00:18:36,629
Her name is Frieda.

376
00:18:36,696 --> 00:18:38,998
Her phone number
is in the kitchen.

377
00:18:48,975 --> 00:18:50,776
(dramatic action music playing)

378
00:18:50,844 --> 00:18:52,628
(singsongy):
Oh, gosh,

379
00:18:52,696 --> 00:18:54,663
look who's stuck
on the couch again.

380
00:18:54,731 --> 00:18:56,098
I'm not stuck on the couch.

381
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,633
Okay, Mr. Cranky.

382
00:18:57,684 --> 00:19:02,104
One, two... three!
There we go!

383
00:19:02,172 --> 00:19:04,573
You didn't need me.
You did that yourself.

384
00:19:04,641 --> 00:19:06,425
Good for you.

385
00:19:06,493 --> 00:19:07,827
You need anything else?

386
00:19:07,894 --> 00:19:09,628
No, I'm fine, thank you.

387
00:19:09,696 --> 00:19:12,331
Okay, you guys have fun.

388
00:19:57,661 --> 00:20:00,296
Franz, grab my hand!

389
00:20:02,382 --> 00:20:04,884
(mournful music plays)

390
00:20:23,353 --> 00:20:26,071
(bones cracking)

391
00:20:29,376 --> 00:20:32,945
Say good night,
you Nazi bastard.

392
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:36,882
(birds chirping)

393
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,617
Thanks for everything,
Mr. Herbert.

394
00:20:38,685 --> 00:20:40,586
If only I had
listened to you,

395
00:20:40,654 --> 00:20:41,887
none of this
would've happened.

396
00:20:41,955 --> 00:20:43,789
You were my real
friend all along.

397
00:20:43,857 --> 00:20:45,424
I'm sorry.

398
00:20:45,492 --> 00:20:46,926
It's okay, Chris.

399
00:20:46,993 --> 00:20:50,429
Sometimes the only way to really
appreciate what you have

400
00:20:50,497 --> 00:20:52,865
is to see what life is like
without it.

401
00:20:52,933 --> 00:20:56,635
And there's nothing I appreciate
more than your friendship.

403
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,011
Dad, Mr. Herbert called
me "Thunder Thighs."

404
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:08,414
Oh, you did it.
Thank you.
