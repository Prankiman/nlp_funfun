00:00:34,182 --> 00:00:36,784
- How's the garage sale going, Quagmire?
- Pretty good.

12
00:00:36,852 --> 00:00:38,786
Just clearing some of my stuff
out of the basement.

13
00:00:38,854 --> 00:00:41,289
It's amazing what you find
when you clean your basement.

14
00:00:41,356 --> 00:00:43,524
Peter, you almost done
down there?

15
00:00:45,193 --> 00:00:46,661
Look what I found.

16
00:00:46,728 --> 00:00:48,396
That's wonderful, Peter.

17
00:00:48,463 --> 00:00:50,998
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go do some skywriting.

18
00:00:59,841 --> 00:01:03,678
Hey, look at all these videos
Mr. Quagmire's selling.

19
00:01:03,745 --> 00:01:06,847
Wow, <i>The Best of the World's
Wildest Police Chases</i>.

20
00:01:06,915 --> 00:01:09,417
and it even has the one with the Flintstones!

21
00:01:12,087 --> 00:01:14,121
<i>Amazingly, this drunk driver</i>

22
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:16,424
<i>turns left
into oncoming traffic!</i>

23
00:01:16,491 --> 00:01:18,726
<i>He narrowly misses
hitting a pedestrian</i>

24
00:01:18,794 --> 00:01:20,895
<i>who jumps out of the way
just in time.</i>

25
00:01:20,963 --> 00:01:22,330
<i>Now the driver can add</i>

26
00:01:22,397 --> 00:01:24,599
<i>attempted battery to the charges.</i>

27
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:26,601
<i>The driver turns right
into the parking lot</i>

28
00:01:26,668 --> 00:01:28,803
<i>of a drive-in movie theater.</i>

29
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,640
<i>At this point,
the dinosaur in the back seat</i>

30
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:34,275
<i>pokes his head up
through the roof</i>

31
00:01:34,343 --> 00:01:37,144
<i>and the driver places two
small children on top of it.</i>

32
00:01:37,212 --> 00:01:40,281
<i>Now he's not only
endangering his own life,</i>

33
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:43,417
<i>but their lives as well.</i>

34
00:01:43,485 --> 00:01:46,387
<i>The driver totals the car
and makes a run for it,</i>

35
00:01:46,455 --> 00:01:49,557
<i>but the pursuing officers
are prepared.</i>

36
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:51,092
<i>Running from the cops?</i>

37
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:53,327
<i>Yabba-dabba-don't!</i>

38
00:01:53,395 --> 00:01:57,264
Hey, Quagmire, I think I might
wanna buy this ham radio off ya.

39
00:01:57,332 --> 00:01:58,633
Sure, Peter, that'll be $50.

40
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,167
50 bucks?

41
00:02:00,235 --> 00:02:01,769
All right, fine,
I'll buy it.

42
00:02:01,837 --> 00:02:04,171
Man, this is a bigger rip-off
than Shrunky Dinks.

43
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,874
They already been shrunk.

44
00:02:06,942 --> 00:02:08,509
Happy "Birthmas."

45
00:02:15,117 --> 00:02:17,551
Peter, you been fiddling with
that ham radio for seven weeks.

46
00:02:17,619 --> 00:02:18,953
Take a shower!

47
00:02:19,021 --> 00:02:21,656
I can barely get any reception
on this stupid thing.

48
00:02:21,723 --> 00:02:24,191
So far the only station that
comes in is some British guys

49
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:26,494
Reading news from places
I'm not sure exist.

50
00:02:26,561 --> 00:02:29,630
<i>Today, in Kuzikistan,
a peaceful demonstration</i>

51

54

<i>But finally, some good news
out of neighboring Kanduzi,</i>

55
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:42,910

56

62
00:02:59,094 --> 00:03:00,828
I'm not sure about any of that.

63
00:03:00,896 --> 00:03:03,264
You know, Dad,
I saw that movie <i>White Noise</i>,

64
00:03:03,331 --> 00:03:05,433
and they said you can
use empty radio static

65
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,201
to talk to dead people.

66
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:08,836
You idiot, ghosts don't exist.

67
00:03:08,904 --> 00:03:11,205
Wait a second. They might.

68
00:03:13,475 --> 00:03:15,476
Hello, ghosts.

69
00:03:15,544 --> 00:03:16,877
Come in, ghosts.

70
00:03:16,945 --> 00:03:18,079
<i>Hello?</i>

71
00:03:18,146 --> 00:03:19,447
Hello? Who's this?

72
00:03:19,514 --> 00:03:21,082
<i>This is Ronald Reagan.</i>

73
00:03:21,149 --> 00:03:22,450
Ronald Reagan?

74
00:03:22,517 --> 00:03:24,485
The guy that used to bang
that seventy-pound witch?

75
00:03:24,553 --> 00:03:27,521
<i>Ronald Reagan, former
President of the United States.</i>

76
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:29,123
Oh, my God!

77
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:34,562
Hey, Quagmire,
guess who I'm talking to right now?

78
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:35,796
Yep!

79
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:41,535
Brian, will you take me
down to Baby Gap?

80
00:03:41,603 --> 00:03:43,404
I want to dress
like a small douche.

81
00:03:43,472 --> 00:03:44,739
No, maybe tomorrow or Tuesday.

82
00:03:44,806 --> 00:03:46,273
But you said you'd do it today.

83
00:03:46,341 --> 00:03:47,341
Eh, I'm kinda tired.

84
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:48,642
Oh, for God's sake.

85
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,077
Cancel my Tuesday appointments!

86
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:51,512
Sure thing, Stewie.

87
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,280
You want me to move it
to another day?

88
00:03:53,348 --> 00:03:54,381
No, no, just cancel it.

89
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:56,751
Okay, will do.

90
00:03:56,818 --> 00:03:58,085
- Who the hell was that?
- Hmm?

91
00:03:58,153 --> 00:03:59,720
There was another
Stewie right there.

92
00:03:59,788 --> 00:04:01,989
Oh, yeah, well, you know,
I've been so damn busy lately,

93
00:04:02,057 --> 00:04:03,457
my schedule's been so packed,

94
00:04:03,525 --> 00:04:05,459
I felt like I needed
some kind of an errand boy

95
00:04:05,527 --> 00:04:07,495
to do all my nitpicky,
pain-in-the-ass stuff.

96
00:04:07,562 --> 00:04:08,729
So I cloned myself.

97
00:04:08,797 --> 00:04:10,431
You... you cloned yourself?

98
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:11,866
What are you deaf?

99
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:14,835
- So he's an exact copy of you?
- Well, not exact.

100
00:04:14,903 --> 00:04:16,270
I have to remain superior

101
00:04:16,338 --> 00:04:17,905
so I bred out some
of the intelligence.

102
00:04:17,973 --> 00:04:19,607
Made him sort of a simpleton,
you know.

103
00:04:19,674 --> 00:04:21,175
I call him Bitch Stewie.

104
00:04:21,243 --> 00:04:23,611
Would you like to meet him?

105
00:04:23,678 --> 00:04:26,547
Would you like
to meet Bitch Stewie?

106
00:04:26,615 --> 00:04:27,848
Uh, yeah, I guess.

107
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,383
Bitch Stewie!

108
00:04:29,451 --> 00:04:30,918
Come here and meet
my friend, Brian.

109
00:04:30,986 --> 00:04:32,219
Hey, there, Stewie.

110
00:04:32,287 --> 00:04:33,921
Oh, what's that?
You got a friend?

111
00:04:33,989 --> 00:04:35,856
Oh, I'm always happy to meet
one of your friends.

112
00:04:35,924 --> 00:04:37,591
Dear God.

113
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:39,593
How do you do?
Pleased to meet you. I'm Bitch Stewie.

114
00:04:39,661 --> 00:04:41,128
He's got quite a grip.

115
00:04:41,196 --> 00:04:43,731
Hey, Bitch Stewie, why are
there no midget accountants?

116
00:04:43,799 --> 00:04:46,100
Because they always
come up short.

117
00:04:47,803 --> 00:04:49,570
Oh, another good one, Stewie!

118
00:04:49,638 --> 00:04:51,038
I don't know where
you come up with them.

119
00:04:51,106 --> 00:04:52,706
Isn't he wonderful?

120
00:04:52,774 --> 00:04:54,175
And all I have to feed him
is a crude peanut paste.

121
00:04:54,242 --> 00:04:55,109
Watch this.

122
00:04:57,145 --> 00:04:59,146
Uh-huh!

123
00:04:59,214 --> 00:05:00,648
It's not much,
but it's healthier

124
00:05:00,715 --> 00:05:02,116
than what people
ate in the '50s.

125
00:05:02,184 --> 00:05:03,617
Steak and donut
sandwich, please.

126
00:05:03,685 --> 00:05:04,919
You want cigarettes
on that sandwich?

127
00:05:04,986 --> 00:05:06,287
What do I look like?
A Mary?

128
00:05:06,354 --> 00:05:07,454
Yes, I want cigarettes!

129
00:05:10,826 --> 00:05:12,726
Okay, next up on the stage,

130
00:05:12,794 --> 00:05:15,996
let's have a big karaoke welcome
for Peter and Ron!

131
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:19,600
Okay, this is one

132
00:05:19,668 --> 00:05:21,802

Hey, Brian!

146
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:13,354
I sure did enjoy talking
to you the other day!

147
00:06:13,421 --> 00:06:15,856
I'm just making sure
Stewie is nice and clean

148
00:06:15,924 --> 00:06:17,958
for his trip to the playground
this afternoon.

149
00:06:18,026 --> 00:06:19,827
We had a little bit
of a problem earlier

150
00:06:19,895 --> 00:06:22,363
because Bitch Stewie was
stooling in the tub, wasn't he?

151
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,597
I did some poos.

152
00:06:23,665 --> 00:06:25,299
I did some poos
I didn't mean to.

153
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:27,401
But we've rectified that now,
and everything's fine.

154
00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:28,736
This is really weird.

155
00:06:28,803 --> 00:06:30,237
I mean, it's one thing
to have him help you out

156
00:06:30,305 --> 00:06:31,672
with a busy schedule.

157
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,073
It's another thing
to let him wash your back.

158
00:06:33,141 --> 00:06:35,042
Well, he does more
than that, Brian.

159
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,744
Bitch Stewie,
give me a bubble beard.

160
00:06:38,146 --> 00:06:41,181
Look at me, I'm
George Bernard Shaw.

161
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:43,450
That's awful funny, Stewie!

162
00:06:43,518 --> 00:06:45,886
I don't know who
George Bernard Shaw is,

163
00:06:45,954 --> 00:06:48,255
but you look like
an Old Stewie, Stewie.

164
00:06:48,323 --> 00:06:50,457
Enjoy your weird bath.

165
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:52,393
I told him I did the poos

166
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,128
Even though you did the poos,
Stewie.

167
00:06:54,195 --> 00:06:55,829
Did I do good, Stewie?

168
00:06:55,897 --> 00:06:57,531
That was very correct
of you, Bitch Stewie.

169
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,133
You're a good helper.

170
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:05,239
<i>And what a lot
of people don't know</i>

171
00:07:05,307 --> 00:07:07,675
<i>is that I was
Jane Wyman's first.</i>

172
00:07:07,742 --> 00:07:09,877
<i>You might say
I broke her Jane Wyman.</i>

173
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,280
Oh, Reagan is a delight!

174
00:07:13,348 --> 00:07:14,982
He sure is,
and you know what else?

175
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,285
The ghost of Reagan is gonna be
the new fourth guy in our group.

176
00:07:18,353 --> 00:07:19,553
I'm all for that.

177
00:07:19,621 --> 00:07:20,955
What other stories you got,
Reagan?

178
00:07:21,022 --> 00:07:22,456
<i>Well, I remember the time</i>

179
00:07:22,524 --> 00:07:25,192
<i>I invited Ed Sullivan
to the White House.</i>

180
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,294
<i>He sounded a little
something like this:</i>

181
00:07:27,362 --> 00:07:29,997
<i>Hey, Ron,
tonight we got a really big show.</i>

182
00:07:30,065 --> 00:07:32,032
Ah, Reagan
does impressions!

183
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,467
<i>That's right.</i>

184
00:07:33,535 --> 00:07:34,835
<i>And you know who else
does impressions?</i>

185
00:07:34,903 --> 00:07:36,370
<i>Rich Little.</i>

186
00:07:36,438 --> 00:07:39,306
<i>In fact, you ought to go see his
show at the Mohegan Sun Casino</i>

187
00:07:39,374 --> 00:07:41,608
<i>next Saturday
at 3:00 pm and 5:00 pm.</i>

188
00:07:41,676 --> 00:07:43,377
Wait a second.

189
00:07:43,445 --> 00:07:45,079
- Yeah, no (bleep).
- What?

190
00:07:45,146 --> 00:07:46,347
Peter, that's not Ronald Reagan.

191
00:07:46,414 --> 00:07:47,514
That's Rich Little!

192
00:07:47,582 --> 00:07:48,949
You're Rich Little!

193
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:50,951
He must be on his
own ham radio!

194
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:52,853
<i>Ah, well, uh, you know, Ed,</i>

195
00:07:52,921 --> 00:07:55,789
<i>the kids say you gotta go viral
to promote yourself these days.</i>

196
00:07:55,857 --> 00:07:57,257
So, this is not Reagan?

197
00:07:57,325 --> 00:07:58,392
No, it's Rich Little.

198
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,626
He's an impressionist.

199
00:07:59,694 --> 00:08:00,828
He's been screwing
with your head.

200
00:08:00,895 --> 00:08:02,296
Well, this thing
is worthless!

201
00:08:02,364 --> 00:08:04,231
Like my Palestinian
alarm clock.

202
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:07,401
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

203
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,076
Hey, Peter, what's up?

204
00:08:16,144 --> 00:08:17,378
Hey, Quagmire, uh, listen,

205
00:08:17,445 --> 00:08:19,680
I'm here to get my money
back for that ham radio.

206
00:08:19,748 --> 00:08:21,248
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow down there, partner.

207
00:08:21,316 --> 00:08:22,683
All sales are final.

208
00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:24,818
Yeah, but you were Agamemnon
with me during the sale.

209
00:08:24,886 --> 00:08:26,153
What?

210
00:08:26,221 --> 00:08:28,255
I just saw that word somewhere.
I wanted to use it.

211
00:08:28,323 --> 00:08:30,624
Look, Peter, why don't you just
go home before you get hurt?

212
00:08:30,692 --> 00:08:31,992
Well, I'm clearly
not the only one

213
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,794
who was dissatisfied
with his purchase.

214
00:08:33,862 --> 00:08:36,096
Whoever bought that baby from
you obviously didn't want it.

215
00:08:36,164 --> 00:08:38,432
A baby? I didn't sell a baby.

216
00:08:41,102 --> 00:08:42,536
Look, there's a note.

217
00:08:42,604 --> 00:08:45,439
"Glenn, this is your child.

218
00:08:45,507 --> 00:08:47,441
Next time wear a condom, jerk."

219
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:49,043
Oh, my God!

220
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,711
Well, now, hang on,
Quagmire.

221
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:52,546
There's no guarantee
it's your baby.

222
00:08:52,614 --> 00:08:53,914
Giggity?

223
00:08:53,982 --> 00:08:56,183
Oh...
I say that.

224
00:09:03,716 --> 00:09:05,451
Well, the DNA test
results are back.

225
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,187
This little girl is definitely
your baby, Quagmire.

226
00:09:08,554 --> 00:09:09,621
Wh... what am I
supposed to do?

227
00:09:09,689 --> 00:09:11,190
I... I don't want a baby.

228
00:09:11,257 --> 00:09:12,991
Look, somebody's gotta take
this kid off my hands.

229
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:14,359
I... I can't be a father.

230
00:09:14,427 --> 00:09:16,395
Well, Glenn,
you don't have a choice.

231
00:09:16,462 --> 00:09:18,630
This baby is
your responsibility.

232
00:09:18,698 --> 00:09:21,133
Now, I brought you a basket
of things to get you started.

233
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:23,902
There's baby clothes,
some toys, and some books.

234
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,238
Now, if you have any questions,
we're right across the street.

235
00:09:31,878 --> 00:09:34,813
Hey, what's going on?

236
00:09:36,282 --> 00:09:39,351
Not really sure what I'm
supposed to do with you.

237
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:42,554
There's some frozen steaks
in the freezer.

238
00:09:42,622 --> 00:09:45,057
Bathroom's down the hall
to the right.

239
00:09:45,124 --> 00:09:47,626
Uh, if you ever come home
and there's a tie on the door,

240
00:09:47,694 --> 00:09:49,328
it means I'm froggin' someone,

241
00:09:49,395 --> 00:09:51,964
so give me at least,
uh, a couple hours.

242
00:09:52,031 --> 00:09:54,266
You smoke?

243
00:09:59,205 --> 00:10:00,672
Stewie,
what are you doing here?

244
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,774
I thought you were going to
Bobby Stalling's birthday party.

245
00:10:02,842 --> 00:10:04,009
Ugh, I hate that kid.

246
00:10:04,077 --> 00:10:06,245
And I hate children's
birthday parties.

247
00:10:06,312 --> 00:10:07,846
I sent Bitch Stewie
in my place.

248
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:13,585
Oh, what a great
little party, Janet.

249
00:10:13,653 --> 00:10:15,954
You know, I've never seen Stewie
come out of his shell so much.

250
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,025
Oh, no, it's not on his tail.

251
00:10:20,093 --> 00:10:22,494
It's on his face.
I've ruined it!

252
00:10:22,562 --> 00:10:24,596
Oh, no, well,
that's okay, though.

253
00:10:24,664 --> 00:10:26,498
Somebody else will come along
and get it right!

254
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:28,867
Thanks for coming to my
birthday party, Stewie.

255
00:10:28,935 --> 00:10:31,003
Oh, I wouldn't have
missed it for anything!

256
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,838
I've never been
to a party before!

257
00:10:32,905 --> 00:10:34,473
Wanna watch me
blow out the candles?

258
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,174
I would love to see that!

259
00:10:36,242 --> 00:10:38,477
And gosh, Bobby,
I'd love to play

260
00:10:38,544 --> 00:10:39,945
with some of your
birthday toys,

261
00:10:40,013 --> 00:10:41,380
but only after you've
played with them

262
00:10:41,447 --> 00:10:43,081
and only if you
say it's okay!

263
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:44,650
You know, Stewie,
I gotta say,

264
00:10:44,717 --> 00:10:46,652
that clone of yours
has come in pretty handy.

265
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:48,787
I, uh, don't suppose
you'd consider

266
00:10:48,855 --> 00:10:50,389
making one of those for me,
would you?

267
00:10:50,456 --> 00:10:52,257
Maybe.

268
00:10:52,325 --> 00:10:54,092
What would you be
willing to do for me?

269
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,594
What do you want?

270
00:10:55,662 --> 00:10:58,130
Take your index finger
and your thumb

271
00:10:58,197 --> 00:11:00,165
and lightly grip
the base of your tail.

272
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:02,067
What?

273
00:11:02,135 --> 00:11:04,069
Lightly grip
the base of your tail

274
00:11:04,137 --> 00:11:06,171
with your index finger
and your thumb

275
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:09,374
and then slide your fingers
up the length of your tail

276
00:11:09,442 --> 00:11:10,575
to the tip.

277
00:11:10,643 --> 00:11:11,777
Why?

278
00:11:11,844 --> 00:11:13,512
Because that's
what I asked you to do.

279
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:14,780
That's kind of weird.

280
00:11:14,847 --> 00:11:16,148
Is this some kind
of sexual thing?

281
00:11:16,215 --> 00:11:17,783
Nobody said anything
about "sexual."

282
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,217
There's nothing
sexual about it.

283
00:11:19,285 --> 00:11:21,620
I'm just asking you
to perform a simple task.

284
00:11:21,688 --> 00:11:24,289
Take your index finger
and your thumb

285
00:11:24,357 --> 00:11:27,059
and lightly grip
the base of your tail

286
00:11:27,126 --> 00:11:30,495
and run your fingers
along the length of your tail.

287
00:11:30,563 --> 00:11:31,830
You mean, stroke it?

288
00:11:31,898 --> 00:11:34,066
Nobody used that word.
This is not a stroking motion.

289
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:37,269
This is a completely nonsexual
thing I am asking you to do

290
00:11:37,337 --> 00:11:39,671
in a completely
nonsexual way.

291
00:11:39,739 --> 00:11:42,174
Squeeze the base
of the tail lightly

292
00:11:42,241 --> 00:11:44,276
with your thumb
and index finger

293
00:11:44,344 --> 00:11:47,145
and then,
while continuing to squeeze,

294
00:11:47,213 --> 00:11:50,449
run them up the length
of your tail to the tip.

295
00:11:50,516 --> 00:11:52,584
And I'll make you a clone.

296
00:11:52,652 --> 00:11:54,219
I only have to do it once?

297
00:11:54,287 --> 00:11:56,154
I'll tell you when to stop.

298
00:11:59,992 --> 00:12:01,293
I don't know why you're stopping.

299
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:03,228
Nobody told you to stop.

300
00:12:05,665 --> 00:12:08,166
Give me a little smile.

301
00:12:08,234 --> 00:12:09,568
Your lips look
a little dry.

302
00:12:09,635 --> 00:12:11,436
Why don't you wet 'em
a little bit?

303
00:12:14,307 --> 00:12:17,008
Oh, my God,
you're so weird!

304
00:12:17,076 --> 00:12:19,044
All right, I'll make you
a clone, buddy.

305
00:12:22,215 --> 00:12:24,916
Oh, she's a beautiful
little girl, Glenn.

306
00:12:24,984 --> 00:12:26,518
Have you given her
a name yet?

307
00:12:26,586 --> 00:12:28,019
Yeah, I named her
Anna Lee,

308
00:12:28,087 --> 00:12:29,821
but I'm probably just going
to call her "Annal" for short.

309
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:30,922
- That's funny.
- Thank you.

310
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,557
Anyway,
thanks for all the baby stuff.

311
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,192
Hey, what's
that big tarp over there?

312
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,595
Oh, that was Chris's blankie
from when he was a baby.

313
00:12:36,662 --> 00:12:37,996
Yeah, he was a big kid.

314
00:12:38,064 --> 00:12:39,898
Almost split Lois in half,
coming out of her.

315
00:12:39,966 --> 00:12:41,533
It's true.

316
00:12:41,601 --> 00:12:43,602
I never mentioned this because
I don't want him to feel bad,

317
00:12:43,669 --> 00:12:46,872
but after he was born, they had
to rearrange most of my organs.

318
00:12:46,939 --> 00:12:49,341
Oh, yeah. He dragged half
of Lois right out with him.

319
00:12:49,409 --> 00:12:51,777
Yeah, the doctors said I'll
be lucky if I live past fifty,

320
00:12:51,844 --> 00:12:55,247
but Chris is healthy,
and I thank God for that.

321
00:12:58,017 --> 00:13:00,252
Oh, there you are, Brian.

322
00:13:00,319 --> 00:13:02,220
All right, you ready
to meet your clone?

323
00:13:02,288 --> 00:13:03,488
Am I ever?

324
00:13:03,556 --> 00:13:05,524
I've got a to-do list
three pages long for him.

325
00:13:05,591 --> 00:13:07,759
Okay, now I want to qualify
this by reminding you

326
00:13:07,827 --> 00:13:09,261
that, as with my clone,

327
00:13:09,328 --> 00:13:11,163
the intelligence level
is reduced a bit.

328
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,798
That's good. We don't
want him thinking too much.

329
00:13:12,865 --> 00:13:15,000
Yeah, well, I might
have dialed yours back

330
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:16,067
a little more than
I ought to have.

331
00:13:16,135 --> 00:13:17,335
What do you mean?

332
00:13:17,403 --> 00:13:19,037
Brian,
meet Bitch Brian.

333
00:13:19,105 --> 00:13:22,908
Hi, Brian. You got some stuff
you want me to do for you?

334
00:13:22,975 --> 00:13:24,242
Oh, my God.

335
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,044
Yeah.
That's kind of what I said, too.

336
00:13:26,112 --> 00:13:27,145
You know, I'll...
I'll be honest with you, Brian.

337
00:13:27,213 --> 00:13:28,346
Here's what happened.

338
00:13:28,414 --> 00:13:29,648
I didn't really want
to do the work,

339
00:13:29,715 --> 00:13:31,650
so Bitch Stewie
sort of did it.

340
00:13:31,717 --> 00:13:33,985
Hey, Stewie,
how'd the clone turn out?

341
00:13:34,053 --> 00:13:36,488
Brian, I can't go
to the bathroom by myself.

342
00:13:36,556 --> 00:13:37,756
Will you please help me?

343
00:13:37,824 --> 00:13:39,458
But I'm good
at other stuff!

344
00:13:45,465 --> 00:13:46,898
Hello, Candy.

345
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:48,099
Hi, Glenn.

346
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:50,035
Come on in.

347
00:13:58,811 --> 00:14:00,545
♪ ♪

348
00:14:21,467 --> 00:14:23,268
So, how long you been
in beauty school?

349
00:14:23,336 --> 00:14:24,569
Two months.

350
00:14:24,637 --> 00:14:25,937
Well, tonight we're
doing facials.

351
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,910
Oh, God. Hang on a second.

352
00:14:33,546 --> 00:14:35,680
Okay, okay. Stop.
Just stop crying.

353
00:14:35,748 --> 00:14:37,282
Stop crying, Anna Lee.

354
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,184
Oh, no wonder.
You dropped your pacifier.

355
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:47,559
You have a baby?

356
00:14:47,627 --> 00:14:48,860
Yeah. It's a long story.

357
00:14:48,928 --> 00:14:50,896
Damn kid's kept me up
every night for two weeks.

358
00:14:50,963 --> 00:14:52,464
Now, where were we?

359
00:14:52,532 --> 00:14:53,798
Giggity-giggity...

360
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,045
<i>Glenn, you fell asleep,
so I took off.</i>

361
00:15:07,113 --> 00:15:08,747
<i>It's probably for the best.</i>

362
00:15:08,814 --> 00:15:10,415
<i>I've never had sex before,</i>

363
00:15:10,483 --> 00:15:12,317
<i>and I probably wouldn't
have been much good at it.</i>

364
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:17,455
That's it.
That kid is out of here.

365
00:15:17,523 --> 00:15:19,624
Hey, there's another note.

366
00:15:19,692 --> 00:15:23,094
"Glenn, this is your child.
Next time wear a condom, jer..."

367
00:15:23,162 --> 00:15:25,730
Oh, that's the note
from earlier.

368
00:15:25,798 --> 00:15:26,998
I...

369
00:15:27,066 --> 00:15:28,333
need a file cabinet.

370
00:15:33,387 --> 00:15:36,089
So, it's just not working out,
me being a father.

371
00:15:36,156 --> 00:15:37,390
And that's why I'm wondering

372
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,425
if you and Lois would be
willing to adopt the baby.

373
00:15:39,493 --> 00:15:41,327
Uh... Oh, boy, Quagmire.

374
00:15:41,395 --> 00:15:42,729
I... I don't know
that we can do that.

375
00:15:42,796 --> 00:15:44,697
We... we... we can barely take
care of the two we have.

376
00:15:44,765 --> 00:15:46,599
Now... now,
this is just a suggestion.

377
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:49,502
Just throwing it out there.
Have you considered abortion?

378
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,571
Uh, Peter,
I think it's too late for that.

379
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:53,640
Oh, don't let the press
put the scare into you.

380
00:15:53,707 --> 00:15:55,742
Wade v. Boggs has
not been overturned.

381
00:15:55,809 --> 00:15:58,211
Yeah, but you can't really
abort a live baby.

382
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:00,380
Ho, boy, they have got you.

383
00:16:00,447 --> 00:16:02,215
Glenn, Glenn.

384
00:16:02,282 --> 00:16:04,083
Give her back to God.

385
00:16:04,151 --> 00:16:06,219
Peter, I'm going to go ahead and
move the conversation forward.

386
00:16:06,286 --> 00:16:08,187
Is there any way
you guys could take Anna Lee?

387
00:16:08,255 --> 00:16:09,355
No, Quagmire.

388
00:16:09,423 --> 00:16:10,657
We got enough kids of our own,

389
00:16:10,724 --> 00:16:11,824
plus ol' Brian over there.

390
00:16:11,892 --> 00:16:13,092
Right, buddy?

391
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,861
I sharpened a
pencil in my bum

392
00:16:14,928 --> 00:16:16,629
and now I need
a band-aid.

393
00:16:21,935 --> 00:16:24,170
You're doing the right thing,
Quagmire.

394
00:16:24,238 --> 00:16:26,205
All right, Quagmire,
just so you're clear on the law,

395
00:16:26,273 --> 00:16:28,608
once you give this child up
to the adoption agency,

396
00:16:28,676 --> 00:16:31,244
you can no longer abort it.

397
00:16:31,311 --> 00:16:32,845
Hello, sir.

398
00:16:32,913 --> 00:16:34,681
Do you wish to put this
child up for adoption?

399
00:16:34,748 --> 00:16:35,848
Yeah.
It's not working out.

400
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,083
I need to get her
out of my hair.

401
00:16:37,151 --> 00:16:38,284
Well, we can
help you there.

402
00:16:38,352 --> 00:16:39,786
Is it a boy or a girl?

403
00:16:39,853 --> 00:16:41,821
It's a girl.
Her name's Anna Lee.

404
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:43,089
Oh, beautiful name.

405
00:16:43,157 --> 00:16:44,223
Let me take her from you.

406
00:16:48,395 --> 00:16:50,596
Well, go on, Quagmire.
Give her the baby.

407
00:16:50,664 --> 00:16:52,131
I... I will.

408
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:53,366
I... I just...

409
00:16:56,003 --> 00:16:57,603
Oh...

410
00:16:57,671 --> 00:16:59,072
Here.

411
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:02,308
She, uh...
She'll go to a good home, right?

412
00:17:02,376 --> 00:17:03,743
Oh, yes.

413
00:17:03,811 --> 00:17:05,244
She'll be
somewhere safe, right?

414
00:17:05,312 --> 00:17:07,647
Like, you're not going to put
her with sand people, right?

415
00:17:07,715 --> 00:17:09,582
You mean like from <i>Star Wars</i>?

416
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,851
No, no, no, no, no.

417
00:17:14,788 --> 00:17:17,890
Brian, I didn't know if
you wanted a God's eye,

418
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,025
but I made you one.

419
00:17:19,093 --> 00:17:20,259
Uh...

420
00:17:20,327 --> 00:17:21,861
Okay, thank you.

421
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:23,596
Did you wash my car,
like I asked?

422
00:17:23,664 --> 00:17:25,298
No, but I hit it with a rock.

423
00:17:25,365 --> 00:17:26,933
Okay, thanks.

424
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,602
Brian,
I think my jaw is falling off.

425
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,337
Oh! Oh, G...

426
00:17:31,405 --> 00:17:32,805
Stewie,
what is happening to this thing?!

427
00:17:32,873 --> 00:17:35,541
Oh, yeah. Turns out the clones
aren't too stable, Brian.

428
00:17:35,609 --> 00:17:37,477
I've been having
some trouble with mine, too.

429
00:17:37,544 --> 00:17:40,680
Hey, Stewie, everything sounds
like rushing water.

430
00:17:40,748 --> 00:17:43,049
And I can't stand up
so very good.

431
00:17:43,117 --> 00:17:44,784
Yeah, I figure they've got
less than a minute

432
00:17:44,852 --> 00:17:46,285
before they
dissolve completely.

433
00:17:46,353 --> 00:17:48,287
Hey, Brian?
Knock-knock.

434
00:17:48,355 --> 00:17:49,489
Who's there?

435
00:17:54,928 --> 00:17:57,396
Whoa. I hope
that doesn't happen to me.

436
00:17:59,233 --> 00:18:00,666
He took my dry cleaning

437
00:18:00,734 --> 00:18:02,802
and I have no idea
what he did with the ticket.

438
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,037
Yeah, this was not
a fruitful endeavor.

439
00:18:05,105 --> 00:18:08,074
I'm not proud of this,
but I need to lick that up.

440
00:18:14,381 --> 00:18:15,615
This will be great,
Quagmire.

441
00:18:15,682 --> 00:18:17,950
A nudie bar is
the perfect way to celebrate

442
00:18:18,018 --> 00:18:19,252
your first night
without a baby.

443
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:20,453
Yeah, Peter,
this is great.

444
00:18:20,521 --> 00:18:21,854
I feel like myself again.

445
00:18:21,922 --> 00:18:24,357
I'll tell ya, my life was
so dominated by that baby.

446
00:18:24,424 --> 00:18:25,691
I'm glad she's gone.

447
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:26,859
Eh, you know sometimes,
you just got

448
00:18:26,927 --> 00:18:28,528
to make a decision
and go with it.

449
00:18:28,595 --> 00:18:30,830
Like when I decided to try
that radical penis enlargement.

450
00:18:32,499 --> 00:18:33,800
Peter, I don't think...

451
00:18:33,867 --> 00:18:35,268
Brian, your objections
are duly noted.

452
00:18:35,335 --> 00:18:36,536
Now hit the gas!

453
00:18:40,207 --> 00:18:43,142
You know that would never work
again in a million years.

454
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,677
Don't need it to, Brian.

455
00:18:47,714 --> 00:18:50,016
Heh. That stripper
has a rash on her ass,

456
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,450
just like Anna Lee
used to get.

457
00:18:51,518 --> 00:18:53,186
Uh, yeah.

458
00:18:53,253 --> 00:18:55,121
And that other stripper's
sitting on that guy's lap,

459
00:18:55,189 --> 00:18:56,789
just like Anna Lee used to do.

460
00:18:56,857 --> 00:18:58,391
I guess.

461
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:01,160
And that stripper only has
one tooth, just like Anna Lee.

462
00:19:01,228 --> 00:19:02,762
Quagmire,
you feeling okay?

463
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,096
I don't know.

464
00:19:04,164 --> 00:19:05,932
I think I might have
made a terrible mistake.

465
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:08,000
I abandoned my daughter!

466
00:19:08,068 --> 00:19:10,503
Why did I give away
my only daughter?!

467
00:19:10,571 --> 00:19:12,271
Oh...

468
00:19:12,339 --> 00:19:14,340
Oh, God.

469
00:19:16,276 --> 00:19:17,710
He'll be fine.

470
00:19:17,778 --> 00:19:19,145
We shouldn't let this
ruin our night.

471
00:19:19,213 --> 00:19:20,913
Let's just enjoy
the strippers.

472
00:19:20,981 --> 00:19:22,281
I guess.

473
00:19:22,349 --> 00:19:24,450
I just hate the way that one
gets so into her work.

474
00:19:24,518 --> 00:19:26,619
You boys have
been very naughty.

475
00:19:26,687 --> 00:19:29,789
I'm going to have to
assign you extra homework.

476
00:19:29,857 --> 00:19:32,725
Darn it.
Fractions are so hard.

477
00:19:32,793 --> 00:19:34,393
What did you get
for number four?

478
00:19:34,461 --> 00:19:36,162
She said,
"Don't share answers"!

479
00:19:39,433 --> 00:19:41,634
All right, here it is:
625 Maple.

480
00:19:41,702 --> 00:19:43,369
That's the family
that adopted Anna Lee.

481
00:19:45,606 --> 00:19:47,373
Hey, wait, wait.
Guys?!

482
00:19:47,441 --> 00:19:51,744
Well, it's just me
and my old nemesis, first step.

483
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,113
Hey, Joe, what you doing?

484
00:19:54,181 --> 00:19:55,348
You out for a walk?

485
00:19:55,415 --> 00:19:57,016
I hate this block.

486
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:00,653
There she is!

487
00:20:00,721 --> 00:20:01,721
There's Anna Lee!

488
00:20:04,691 --> 00:20:06,092
Hang on, Anna Lee.
I'm coming.

489
00:20:08,962 --> 00:20:10,229
It's them.

490
00:20:17,738 --> 00:20:19,872
Look at her.

491
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,108
She looks so happy.

492
00:20:22,175 --> 00:20:25,211
Almost like she belongs there.

493
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:27,914
They look like a real family.

494
00:20:27,981 --> 00:20:30,750
I can't take her
away from this.

495
00:20:30,817 --> 00:20:32,418
What's happening?!

496
00:20:32,486 --> 00:20:33,986
He's not going
to go through with it!

497
00:20:34,054 --> 00:20:36,555
It's a nice family and the kid
will be better off here!

498
00:20:36,623 --> 00:20:38,157
Aw, that's sweet!

499
00:20:38,225 --> 00:20:40,493
What's the inside
of the house look like?!

500
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,994
Colonial!
Furniture's pretty good!

501
00:20:42,062 --> 00:20:43,763
Possibly imported area rug!

502
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,131
Oh, that's nice!

503
00:20:45,198 --> 00:20:47,300
A bit pricey, but for
the money you're spending,

504
00:20:47,367 --> 00:20:49,068
you know,
it's not a bad way to go!

505
00:20:49,136 --> 00:20:50,236
Yeah, for the money!

506
00:20:50,304 --> 00:20:51,437
You ready to go, Quagmire?

507
00:20:51,505 --> 00:20:52,905
Yeah.

508
00:20:52,973 --> 00:20:55,341
You know, I got to tell you,
I think you did a good thing.

509
00:20:55,409 --> 00:20:58,210
Well, I guess I just realized
it's not about me.

510
00:20:58,278 --> 00:21:00,713
This family is what's
best for Anna Lee.

511
00:21:00,781 --> 00:21:02,615
This is her home now.

512
00:21:02,683 --> 00:21:04,317
I got to let her go.

513
00:21:04,384 --> 00:21:05,651
I'm proud of you, Quagmire.

514
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:07,420
Thanks, man.
Hey, who knows?

515
00:21:07,487 --> 00:21:08,888
Maybe I'll bump
into her in eighteen years.

516
00:21:08,956 --> 00:21:10,356
What?!

517
00:21:10,424 --> 00:21:12,325
Did you really think I was
going to change that much?

518
00:21:12,392 --> 00:21:13,726
Good night, everybody!
