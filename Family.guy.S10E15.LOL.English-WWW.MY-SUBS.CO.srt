12
00:00:36,532 --> 00:00:39,115
Oh, my God, Brian, I went
to a baby rave last night.

13
00:00:39,118 --> 00:00:40,218
Dropped a
Flintstones chewable.

14
00:00:40,286 --> 00:00:41,453
It was a purple Betty.

15
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:42,654
I was <i>flyin'!</i>

16
00:00:42,722 --> 00:00:44,106
I was up till
like... like...

17
00:00:44,173 --> 00:00:45,640
I don't even
know how late.

18
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,893
Like, when I came home,
<i>The Mentalist</i> was still on.

19
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,994
Like, that's how late.

20
00:00:49,062 --> 00:00:50,412
Morning, family.
Anyone needs me,

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,981
I'll be out in the yard
using my new riding mower.

22
00:00:53,049 --> 00:00:54,850
A riding mower?
For God's sakes,

23
00:00:54,917 --> 00:00:56,952
stop making all these
frivolous purchases.

24
00:00:57,019 --> 00:00:58,553
You just blew
all that money

25
00:00:58,621 --> 00:01:00,806
hiring that English-
to-raccoon translator.

26
00:01:00,873 --> 00:01:02,674
(whispering
inaudibly)

27
00:01:02,742 --> 00:01:04,176
(chittering)

28
00:01:04,243 --> 00:01:05,877
(angry chittering)

29
00:01:05,945 --> 00:01:07,646
Don't need a translator
for that one.

30
00:01:07,713 --> 00:01:09,915
Tell him to come back when
he's ready to act like an adult.

31
00:01:14,253 --> 00:01:15,654
Hey, what's up, Quagmire?

32
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:17,522
Oh, <i>there's</i> the
sound of the birds.

33
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,024
I thought they
all disappeared,

34
00:01:19,092 --> 00:01:20,959
because all I could
hear was a lawnmower.

35
00:01:21,027 --> 00:01:22,094
Oh, and what's that?

36
00:01:22,161 --> 00:01:23,428
The wind in the trees!

37
00:01:23,496 --> 00:01:24,696
Good-- that
still exists.

38
00:01:24,764 --> 00:01:26,465
What are you doing there,
planting some flowers?

39
00:01:26,532 --> 00:01:28,600
Hey, look, why don't you
go bother Joe, huh?

40
00:01:28,668 --> 00:01:30,335
I can't. He's in Vegas
for the weekend,

41
00:01:30,403 --> 00:01:32,370
seeing that handicapped
Cher impersonator.

44
00:01:40,463 --> 00:01:43,231
Yeah! We <i>all</i> want
to turn back time!

45
00:01:43,316 --> 00:01:46,218
This is the biggest
sitting ovation I've ever seen!

46
00:01:49,188 --> 00:01:51,022
Damn it, where the hell
did I put that?

47
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,307
What are you
looking for, Brian?

48
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,059
That steak bone you
gave me last night.

49
00:01:54,127 --> 00:01:56,161
I can't remember what
the hell I did with it.

50
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:57,512
Didn't you
bring it outside?

51
00:01:59,749 --> 00:02:00,415
(clattering)

52
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,083
(screams)

53
00:02:02,151 --> 00:02:03,885
Holy crap! Quagmire,
you all right?

54
00:02:03,953 --> 00:02:05,320
No, I'm not all right!

55
00:02:05,388 --> 00:02:07,189
My head's gushing
blood, you idiot!

56
00:02:07,256 --> 00:02:08,523
Take your hand away.

57
00:02:08,591 --> 00:02:11,626
Oh, boy! All right,
hold still, Quagmire.

58
00:02:11,684 --> 00:02:12,526
(screams)

59
00:02:12,551 --> 00:02:14,476
Oh, my God, a piece
of your brain came out!

60
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,831
Aah! Well, that
can't be good!

61
00:02:15,898 --> 00:02:17,299
Well, maybe
it's not so bad.

62
00:02:17,366 --> 00:02:19,251
I can feed it
to my pet zombie.

63
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:20,752
Here you go.

64
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,654
Yeah, you're hungry,
aren't ya?

65
00:02:22,722 --> 00:02:24,005
He was a rescue.

66
00:02:24,073 --> 00:02:26,675
When I found him,
he was just walking face-first

67
00:02:26,742 --> 00:02:28,376
into a chain-link fence
downtown.

68
00:02:32,448 --> 00:02:34,232
All right, almost
done here, Glenn.

69
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,168
There we are,
all finished.

70
00:02:36,235 --> 00:02:37,936
Well, look at this.

71
00:02:38,004 --> 00:02:39,804
Look what happened.
(chuckles)

72
00:02:39,872 --> 00:02:42,276
Well, by the laws of
comedy, you and I have

73
00:02:42,277 --> 00:02:43,454
to be roommates now.

74
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:45,577
That's hilarious, Doc.
All right, here we go.

75
00:02:45,645 --> 00:02:48,063
Now, I'm going to prescribe
a course of antibiotics

76
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,615
and some painkillers and...

77
00:02:50,683 --> 00:02:52,017
Hey, Elmer.

78
00:02:52,084 --> 00:02:54,186
Hey.

79
00:02:54,253 --> 00:02:55,787
She sucks.

80
00:02:59,675 --> 00:03:01,359
Okay, Quagmire, before
we get your prescription,

81
00:03:01,427 --> 00:03:02,594
let's grab some bandages.

82
00:03:02,662 --> 00:03:04,462
God, this is such
an East Coast pharmacy.

83
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,810
How are we gonna find
gauze and bandages in the

84
00:03:06,835 --> 00:03:07,999
middle of all this crap?

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,023
Uh, I think he keeps them
next to the thousand-piece

86
00:03:10,048 --> 00:03:11,248
puzzle of a lobster trap.

87
00:03:11,304 --> 00:03:13,705
I don't see it. You mean,
next to the Kadima paddles,

88
00:03:13,773 --> 00:03:16,508
or next to the basic black
sweatshirt with no writing on it?

89
00:03:16,576 --> 00:03:18,072
No, I think they're over
there between the rain

90
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:19,678
ponchos and the cap guns

91
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:21,379
and just below the
balsa wood gliders

92
00:03:21,447 --> 00:03:24,049
and the net-bag of flip-flops
and a beach pail.

93
00:03:24,116 --> 00:03:25,262
Above the set of jacks?

94
00:03:25,287 --> 00:03:28,220
Yes, above the jacks and the
bicentennial playing cards

95
00:03:28,221 --> 00:03:30,655
and across from the giant
cage with the beach balls,

96
00:03:30,723 --> 00:03:33,191
next to the Wiffle ball bats
and the spark-spitting cars.

97
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:36,127
I don't... Oh, next to the
wax bottles of weird juice.

98
00:03:36,195 --> 00:03:39,164
Yes, behind the plastic bag of
Mexican soldiers from the Alamo

99
00:03:39,232 --> 00:03:40,932
and the Super Elastic
Bubble Plastic.

100
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,367
Oh, yeah, I got 'em.

101
00:03:42,435 --> 00:03:43,702
Hey, Mort.
How's it going?

102
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:45,186
Oh, it's awful, Peter!

103
00:03:45,254 --> 00:03:46,087
Why? What's the matter?

104
00:03:46,155 --> 00:03:47,556
The pharmacy's going under.

105
00:03:47,623 --> 00:03:49,391
I can barely pay my bills.

106
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,760
I can't even afford
the real pharmacy music.

107
00:03:51,827 --> 00:03:54,079
That's just me up there. Listen.

112

They say I've got
Jewish honey in my voice.

113
00:04:06,492 --> 00:04:08,093
Jewish honey is mucus.

114
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,644
But I thought you made
a lot of money here.

115
00:04:09,712 --> 00:04:11,813
I used to,
but it's all gone downhill

116
00:04:11,881 --> 00:04:13,415
since Muriel died.

117
00:04:13,482 --> 00:04:15,584
She could get away
with overcharging people,

118
00:04:15,668 --> 00:04:18,103
because they were always
mentally undressing her

119
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,537
and then re-dressing her

120
00:04:19,605 --> 00:04:21,840
once they saw
the horrible mess underneath.

121
00:04:21,907 --> 00:04:24,576
But in that interval,
she robbed them blind.

122
00:04:24,644 --> 00:04:27,412
(sobbing)

123
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,847
Ooh.

124
00:04:28,914 --> 00:04:30,081
Well, look, uh,
I don't know,

125
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:31,316
maybe there's
something we can do

126
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:32,784
to help you drum up
some business.

127
00:04:32,852 --> 00:04:33,885
You know, get
the word out.

128
00:04:33,953 --> 00:04:35,020
Like what?

129
00:04:35,087 --> 00:04:37,272
Hey, you just
leave that to us.

130

- No.
- Okay, then we'll do other stuff.

139
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,181
Okay, Mort, now, if you
want to get more customers

140
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:05,116
in your pharmacy, you're
gonna have to do a promotion,

141
00:05:05,184 --> 00:05:07,152
like... like
"buy one, get one free."

142
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:09,154
- What?
- Buy one, get one free.

143
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:10,455
- Huh?
- Buy one...

144
00:05:10,523 --> 00:05:12,257
- Yeah, I get that.
- Get one free.

145
00:05:12,325 --> 00:05:14,492
- Is that, like, a Spanish word?
- No, it's English.

146
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,631
The whole thing's English.

147
00:05:15,656 --> 00:05:17,194
Oh, 'cause it seems
like you're saying

148
00:05:17,196 --> 00:05:19,931
the first part in English
and then some kind of made-up

149

pha-lumpf-phalumpf

I don't understand you.

151
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:25,169
All right, let me try
explaining it another way.

152
00:05:25,171 --> 00:05:26,871
Let's say we're at
someone else's store,

153
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:29,641
and there's a sign, and it says:
"Buy one, get one free."

154
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:31,176
Get one free? Wow!

155
00:05:31,243 --> 00:05:33,011
What store are
you talking about?

156
00:05:36,465 --> 00:05:39,267
Excuse me, I have been
waiting for my prescription

157
00:05:39,335 --> 00:05:40,769

00:05:42,738 --> 00:05:45,006
We'll have that filled
for you right away.

160
00:05:45,074 --> 00:05:47,375
Guys, what the hell's
going on back there?

161
00:05:47,443 --> 00:05:50,395
Remember, each pill has
to go into the correct bottle.

162
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,781
(mechanical whirring)

163
00:05:54,016 --> 00:05:56,634
Eh, this ain't so hard.

164
00:05:56,686 --> 00:05:58,853
(whirring rises in pitch)

165
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,808
(whirring increases in pitch
as conveyor belt speeds up)

166
00:06:06,912 --> 00:06:09,114
(whirring intensifying)

167
00:06:13,485 --> 00:06:14,919
(vomits)

168
00:06:14,987 --> 00:06:18,089
(woozily): I...
I got a wicked boner.

169
00:06:18,157 --> 00:06:19,307
(thudding)

170
00:06:23,045 --> 00:06:24,345
This was a great
idea, Peter.

171
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,714
We fly this thing
over Providence,

172
00:06:25,798 --> 00:06:27,498
it's bound to get people
into the pharmacy.

173
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,100
That's right, bring
in the city folk

174
00:06:29,168 --> 00:06:31,169
with their big money
and their long cigarettes

175
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,054
and their dogs with shoes.

176
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:34,193
Hey, check it out--

177
00:06:34,218 --> 00:06:36,315
we got a giggity over
there on the 32nd floor.

178
00:06:36,508 --> 00:06:38,560
I'm gonna go in
for a closer look.

179
00:06:39,862 --> 00:06:42,614
QUAGMIRE:
Heh-heh, all right!

180
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:44,515
(gasps)
Quagmire, look out!

181
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:45,817
Oh, no!

182
00:06:49,155 --> 00:06:50,822
Geez, that was a close one!

183
00:06:50,873 --> 00:06:52,424
Yeah, but at least
nobody got hurt.

184
00:06:55,027 --> 00:06:56,861
(tires squealing)

185
00:06:59,165 --> 00:07:00,765
(clattering)

186
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,334
(burbling)

187
00:07:03,402 --> 00:07:05,370
Goldman's Pharmacy!

188
00:07:05,438 --> 00:07:09,541
Now, that could be a good place
to get new shoes for my dog.

189
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,314
Good evening, Quahog.

190
00:07:16,382 --> 00:07:18,583
Grim details continue
to roll in at this hour

191
00:07:18,651 --> 00:07:20,985
in the story of the detached
airplane advertising banner

192
00:07:21,053 --> 00:07:23,755
which caused a school bus to
plummet into the Pawtuxet River.

193
00:07:23,823 --> 00:07:24,956
That's right, Joyce.

194
00:07:25,024 --> 00:07:26,825
<i>Quahog's own Goldman's Pharmacy</i>

195
00:07:26,892 --> 00:07:28,559
<i>made headlines</i>
<i>across the country</i>

196
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:32,363
<i>after a banner of theirs caused</i>
<i>the bus to drive off a bridge,</i>

197
00:07:32,414 --> 00:07:34,449
<i>tragically killing</i>
<i>all the teenagers on board.</i>

198
00:07:34,533 --> 00:07:36,534
<i>Many of the students</i>
<i>tweeted about the accident</i>

199
00:07:36,585 --> 00:07:37,836
<i>as it was happening.</i>

200
00:07:37,903 --> 00:07:39,087
<i>We have a few here.</i>

201
00:07:39,171 --> 00:07:40,955
<i>From @Jenny94:</i>

202
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,475
<i>"Water seriously cold, yo."</i>

203
00:07:43,542 --> 00:07:46,194

204
00:07:46,262 --> 00:07:49,380
<i>"I'm gonna survive this.</i>
<i>LOL jk."</i>

205
00:07:49,448 --> 00:07:51,115
"Jk," indeed.

206
00:07:51,183 --> 00:07:52,717
Oh, God, I'm ruined!

207
00:07:52,785 --> 00:07:55,186
Nobody's ever gonna shop
in my pharmacy again!

208
00:07:55,254 --> 00:07:56,554
I'm gonna lose
everything!

209
00:07:56,622 --> 00:07:58,423
Aw, gosh, Mort,
I feel terrible about this.

210
00:07:58,491 --> 00:08:00,809
I wish there was
some way we could fix it.

211
00:08:00,876 --> 00:08:03,077
You know, my cousin
had the same problem,

212
00:08:03,145 --> 00:08:06,030
but he lucked out, 'cause his
business burned to the ground.

213
00:08:06,098 --> 00:08:08,466
The insurance made him
a very rich man.

214
00:08:08,534 --> 00:08:10,735
(chuckles) Too bad we can't
just torch the pharmacy.

215
00:08:10,803 --> 00:08:12,470
Aw, come on, no,
we can't do that.

216
00:08:12,538 --> 00:08:14,239
That'd be like stealing
from the insurance companies.

217
00:08:14,306 --> 00:08:15,306
It wouldn't be right.

218
00:08:15,374 --> 00:08:16,541
Aw, they're bastards.

219
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:19,077
Last year, after I lost
my beloved Muriel,

220
00:08:19,144 --> 00:08:22,514
our life insurance company
refused to pay on her policy.

221
00:08:22,581 --> 00:08:24,983
They took what should have been
a pleasant experience

222
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,818
and made it into an ordeal!

223
00:08:26,886 --> 00:08:28,386
Well, that doesn't
totally surprise me.

224
00:08:28,454 --> 00:08:30,488
A friend of mine
staying in my house

225
00:08:30,556 --> 00:08:32,190
got, um, injured,

226
00:08:32,258 --> 00:08:35,260
and my homeowner's insurance
wouldn't pay her doctor bills.

227
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:39,163
Said the policy didn't cover
an "act of rod."

228
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:41,332
Yeah, come to think of it,
they wouldn't even pay

229
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,568
for the fetus Lois lost
when we went to visit

230
00:08:43,636 --> 00:08:45,970
the Museum of Staircases
and Spring-loaded Boxing Gloves.

231
00:08:46,038 --> 00:08:48,239
Yeah, you know, they don't seem
to pay out on anything.

232
00:08:48,307 --> 00:08:50,308
- No, not at all, right?
- Yeah, that's true, they don't pay.

233
00:08:50,376 --> 00:08:52,243
Well, then I say,
screw the bastards!

234
00:08:52,311 --> 00:08:53,778
Let's burn
the place down!

235
00:08:53,846 --> 00:08:56,214
What?! Peter, we're talking
about a major crime here.

236
00:08:56,282 --> 00:08:59,167
This is not smuggling Oriental
women into the country in steel cans.

237
00:08:59,235 --> 00:09:00,702
This is a serious felony.

238
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:02,403
Quagmire, this whole
mess was our fault.

239
00:09:02,471 --> 00:09:03,838
We got to make it right.

240
00:09:03,906 --> 00:09:05,740
And, look, as long
as nobody sees us,

241
00:09:05,808 --> 00:09:08,192
and we don't tell anybody,
then we're in the clear.

242
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,029
Well, I guess I did kind of
destroy your business, Mort.

243
00:09:11,096 --> 00:09:13,231
All right, then let's do it--
tomorrow night!

244
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:15,376
Good. I'm just gonna
have to reschedule my

245
00:09:15,401 --> 00:09:17,095
weekly re-circumcision.

246
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:19,437
So, what are we doing today,
a little off the top?

247
00:09:19,505 --> 00:09:20,788
Yeah, but leave
a little up front

248
00:09:20,856 --> 00:09:22,473
so I have something to play with.
- Sounds good.

249
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,058
(unzips zipper) And take a look
at the back.

250
00:09:24,126 --> 00:09:25,193
- You see that there?
- Yeah.

251
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:26,694
Yeah, let's trim that.
I don't know when

252
00:09:26,762 --> 00:09:28,062
that started, but
let's get rid of that.

253
00:09:31,267 --> 00:09:32,667
Okay, guys, listen up.

254
00:09:32,735 --> 00:09:34,469
This is a very
flammable mixture

255
00:09:34,536 --> 00:09:36,004
that's also
undetectable.

256
00:09:36,071 --> 00:09:39,073
If we put it on the electric box
and two of the outlets,

257
00:09:39,141 --> 00:09:42,460
then light them all at once,
it'll look like a short circuit.

258
00:09:42,528 --> 00:09:44,662
Geez, Mort, how the hell do
you know how to do all this?

259
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,431
Oh, it's all covered in
the Torah.

260
00:09:46,498 --> 00:09:48,666
Right after the chapter on
writing complaint letters

261
00:09:48,734 --> 00:09:51,202
that will result in
compensatory merchandise.

262
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,504
Dear stuffed shirts
at Ritz Crackers.

263
00:09:53,572 --> 00:09:56,608
A chain is only as strong
as its weakest link.

264
00:09:56,675 --> 00:09:59,661
Just as a box of crackers
is only as appealing

265
00:09:59,728 --> 00:10:01,946
as its least intact sleeve.

266
00:10:02,014 --> 00:10:04,248
I am paying
for fully formed crackers,

267
00:10:04,316 --> 00:10:05,984
not butter crumbles.

268
00:10:06,051 --> 00:10:08,252
I don't buy your product
with broken quarters;

269
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,688
don't stick me
with broken pieces of cracker,

270
00:10:10,756 --> 00:10:12,357
you miserable dicks!

271
00:10:12,424 --> 00:10:14,726
Regards, Mort Goldman again.

272
00:10:23,085 --> 00:10:26,004
All right, let's get to work.

273
00:10:26,071 --> 00:10:28,006
♪ ♪

274
00:10:42,972 --> 00:10:45,189
(explosion)

275
00:10:45,257 --> 00:10:46,808
Oh, my God, we did it!

276
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,626
Hey, Peter, what
are you gonna tell Lois

277
00:10:48,694 --> 00:10:50,111
when she asks
where you were tonight?

278
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:51,913
Don't worry, I got
it all covered.

279
00:10:51,981 --> 00:10:53,848
(harsh braying)

280
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,950
(screeching bray)

281
00:10:56,035 --> 00:10:58,369
Ha-ha!
This is awesome!

282
00:10:58,437 --> 00:11:00,538
And Peter has no idea!

283
00:11:08,273 --> 00:11:10,557
Well, Mr. Goldman,
we've ruled out foul play.

284
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:13,077
It looks like it was just
a case of faulty wiring.

285
00:11:13,144 --> 00:11:14,912
Well, you're still gonna
have to buy something.

286
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,814
This is rubble,
not a library.

287
00:11:16,881 --> 00:11:19,416
Okay, well...
I'm sorry for your loss,

288
00:11:19,484 --> 00:11:21,018
but the good news is
your insurance

289
00:11:21,086 --> 00:11:23,503
will be covering
all of your damages.

290
00:11:23,555 --> 00:11:26,256
You hear what he said, fellas?
Looks like we pulled it off.

291
00:11:26,324 --> 00:11:27,658
Yeah, for now.

292
00:11:27,726 --> 00:11:28,892
I still got a
bad feeling.

293
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,561
He's gonna find something,
I just know it.

294
00:11:30,628 --> 00:11:32,763
Will you relax?
We got an ironclad alibi.

295
00:11:32,831 --> 00:11:35,532
We were all seeing The Beatles
live at <i>The Ed Sullivan Show.</i>

296
00:11:35,617 --> 00:11:39,036
(song ends,
audience screaming)

297
00:11:39,904 --> 00:11:40,888
(screams)

298
00:11:40,955 --> 00:11:42,723
PETER:
Sorry. I rode a bike here.

299
00:11:45,994 --> 00:11:48,862
All right, guys, all we got
to do now is keep a low profile

300
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,898
and not mention a word
of this to anybody.

301
00:11:50,965 --> 00:11:52,399
Not even the police.

302
00:11:52,467 --> 00:11:53,901
That's right,
not a word to anyone.

303
00:11:53,968 --> 00:11:56,536
Nobody.
Lips are sealed.

304
00:11:56,588 --> 00:11:58,522
I want to tell somebody.

305
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,024
- Peter!
- You shut your mouth!

306
00:12:00,091 --> 00:12:02,242
Hey, Mort, I, uh,
was really sorry

307
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,410
to hear about
the pharmacy.

308
00:12:03,478 --> 00:12:04,978
Oh, thank you, Joe.

309
00:12:05,046 --> 00:12:06,780
I was very,
very sorry, too.

310
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,401
Yeah, he seemed pretty smart.

311
00:12:10,468 --> 00:12:12,870
His shirt was tucked in,
so I bet he went to Harvard.

312
00:12:12,937 --> 00:12:14,304
Well, you're my
friend, Mort.

313
00:12:14,372 --> 00:12:16,407
I want you to know that
I'm going to personally

314
00:12:16,474 --> 00:12:17,708
go over all
the evidence.

315
00:12:17,776 --> 00:12:19,209
I'd hate to think
there's someone in town

316
00:12:19,277 --> 00:12:20,344
who's out to get you.

317
00:12:20,412 --> 00:12:21,945
Hey, Joe, they said
it was an accident.

318
00:12:22,013 --> 00:12:23,530
- Roll away.
- No, I'm just saying,

319
00:12:23,598 --> 00:12:25,199
as your friend, I
wouldn't feel right

320
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:27,000
unless I left no
stone unturned.

321
00:12:27,068 --> 00:12:28,702
Geez, Joe, let it go.

322
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,438
Yeah, Joe, even Robocop
took a day off once in a while.

323
00:12:33,274 --> 00:12:36,043
(phone ringing)

324
00:12:36,111 --> 00:12:37,111
Nope.

325
00:12:37,178 --> 00:12:38,345
(turns ringer off)

326
00:12:41,716 --> 00:12:44,218
I don't like Joe sticking
his nose into this.

327
00:12:44,285 --> 00:12:45,786
Maybe this was all
a big mistake.

328
00:12:45,854 --> 00:12:47,137
You're damn right it was.

329
00:12:47,222 --> 00:12:48,856
Why did I ever
agree to do this?

330
00:12:48,923 --> 00:12:50,174
This isn't who I am.

331
00:12:50,241 --> 00:12:52,376
I looked in the mirror
this morning, and it was like

332
00:12:52,444 --> 00:12:54,428
I was looking at a man
I'd never seen before.

333
00:12:54,496 --> 00:12:55,963
Hi.

334
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,781
Scott Bakula.

335
00:12:57,849 --> 00:12:59,016
Just take it easy, Quagmire.

336
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:00,417
There's nothing to worry about.

337
00:13:00,485 --> 00:13:02,086
(knocking)
JOE: Hey, it's Joe, open up.

338
00:13:02,153 --> 00:13:02,986
(all gasp)

339
00:13:04,205 --> 00:13:05,639
Uh, hey, Joe.

340
00:13:05,707 --> 00:13:06,707
What's going on?

341
00:13:06,775 --> 00:13:08,325
Oh, hey, I forgot,
I brought you guys

342
00:13:08,393 --> 00:13:10,277
souvenirs from
my trip to Vegas.

343
00:13:10,345 --> 00:13:14,281
They're T-shirts that say
"I lost my shirt in Lost Wages."

344
00:13:14,349 --> 00:13:17,184
(laughing)

345
00:13:26,094 --> 00:13:28,078
I think maybe
you should keep them.

346
00:13:28,146 --> 00:13:29,663
All right,
I'll see you guys later.

347
00:13:29,731 --> 00:13:32,716
I got to go see the forensics
team about the pharmacy.

348
00:13:32,784 --> 00:13:34,735
Don't you worry, Mort.

349
00:13:34,803 --> 00:13:37,437
We'll get to the bottom of this.

350
00:13:37,505 --> 00:13:38,772
I don't like
this, you guys.

351
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,990
This is bad.

352
00:13:40,058 --> 00:13:41,842
Joe's gonna find out,
I just know it.

353
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,310
Geez, Quagmire,
you need to relax.

354
00:13:43,378 --> 00:13:44,812
And I know
how to help.

355
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:46,847
Calgon,
take him away.

356
00:13:46,915 --> 00:13:48,782
(harp arpeggio)

357
00:13:54,172 --> 00:13:55,789
QUAGMIRE: This is
worse, Peter!

358
00:13:55,857 --> 00:13:58,158
Relax, this is supposed
to be <i>your</i> time.

359
00:13:58,226 --> 00:14:00,327
This is the right way to
deal with your problems.

360
00:14:03,898 --> 00:14:05,833
All right, guys,
if Joe really is nosing around,

361
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,069
I think I know how to get him
off the case once and for all.

362
00:14:09,137 --> 00:14:10,220
(dialing)

363
00:14:10,288 --> 00:14:11,455
JOE: Hello?

364
00:14:11,523 --> 00:14:13,524
Officer Swanson,
this is the chief of police.

365
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:14,925
I'm afraid
you're fired.

366
00:14:14,993 --> 00:14:17,394
I see. Well,
that's too bad.

367
00:14:17,462 --> 00:14:18,829
I was looking forward

368
00:14:18,897 --> 00:14:21,165
to giving you
your birthday present next week.

369
00:14:21,232 --> 00:14:22,666
Oh.

370
00:14:22,734 --> 00:14:23,951
Apparently,
there was a mistake.

371
00:14:24,018 --> 00:14:25,285
Forget I called.

372
00:14:25,353 --> 00:14:27,704
Guys, I got to become chief
of police by next week.

373
00:14:30,124 --> 00:14:33,193
Chief, this just came in
for you from Officer Swanson.

374
00:14:34,512 --> 00:14:37,047
A Starbucks gift card?!

375
00:14:37,115 --> 00:14:39,433
This has been
an unproductive use of my time.

376
00:14:41,636 --> 00:14:43,103
Okay, I got it.

377
00:14:43,171 --> 00:14:45,105
Joe can't investigate
if he's distracted, right?

378
00:14:45,173 --> 00:14:48,592
Well, what's more distracting
than texts about dinner plans?

379
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,361
Hmm. These burn ignition
patterns aren't consistent

380
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:53,330
with an electrical fire.

381
00:14:53,398 --> 00:14:55,365
(phone chirps)

382
00:14:55,433 --> 00:14:57,534
"Would... love to."

383
00:14:57,602 --> 00:14:59,720
(phone chirps)

384
00:14:59,787 --> 00:15:05,525
"Probably...
about 7:00... or 7:30."

385
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:09,112
(phone chirps, Joe sighs)

386
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,114
"Any... of...

387
00:15:11,182 --> 00:15:14,017
those places would be... fine."

388
00:15:14,085 --> 00:15:15,819
(phone chirps)

389
00:15:15,887 --> 00:15:18,188
God! No way!

390
00:15:18,256 --> 00:15:20,173
"I don't know

391
00:15:20,241 --> 00:15:23,493
"Probably just
a collared shirt

392
00:15:23,561 --> 00:15:25,512
"and jeans.

393
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:27,681
"Have you never been

394
00:15:27,748 --> 00:15:31,501
to... a restaurant before?"

395
00:15:31,569 --> 00:15:32,869
Oh, he's getting annoyed.
Look at that.

396
00:15:32,937 --> 00:15:35,422
He sure is. Okay, now
tell him you want a vegan place.

397
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,857
(phone ringing)

398
00:15:36,925 --> 00:15:38,558
Oh, my God,
he's so pissed, he's calling.

399
00:15:38,626 --> 00:15:39,960
- Well, answer it.
- No, no, no.

400
00:15:40,028 --> 00:15:41,995
I'm gonna send it to voicemail,
then call him back,

401
00:15:42,063 --> 00:15:43,880
but pocket-dial him
while I walk a few blocks.

402
00:15:43,948 --> 00:15:45,782
JOE (muffled,
from Peter's phone): Peter?

403
00:15:45,867 --> 00:15:47,784
Peter? Hello?

404
00:15:47,869 --> 00:15:50,070
I'm getting
very little work done!

405
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:55,592
You guys, I just can't
take this anymore.

406
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,461
I've been giving it
a lot of thought,

407
00:15:57,528 --> 00:15:59,496
and I think
we all just need to confess.

408
00:15:59,564 --> 00:16:00,931
What? Now just
hold on, Quagmire.

409
00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:02,633
If you start yapping
to the cops,

410
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,035
we're gonna rot in prison
for the next 30 years.

411
00:16:05,103 --> 00:16:06,203
JOE:
Evening, gentlemen.

412
00:16:06,271 --> 00:16:07,721
(all gasp)
Joe!

413
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:09,022
Glad I found
you here.

414
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,224
I had a question
for you guys.

415
00:16:11,292 --> 00:16:13,377
Did any of you happen
to be at Mort's pharmacy

416
00:16:13,444 --> 00:16:14,845
on the night of the fire?

417
00:16:14,912 --> 00:16:16,113
- No.
- None of us were.

418
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,215
I'm triplets. Could have
been one of my triplets.

419
00:16:18,283 --> 00:16:20,284
I see. Well, then
it's kind of peculiar

420
00:16:20,351 --> 00:16:21,818
that I would
find this.

421
00:16:21,886 --> 00:16:23,687
A pocket-dial
voicemail from Peter

422
00:16:23,755 --> 00:16:25,455
on the night
of the fire.

423
00:16:25,523 --> 00:16:28,558
PETER: Oh, my God, look at that fire
we started, Quagmire and Mort.

424
00:16:28,626 --> 00:16:30,560
You know
who I don't miss is Joe.

425
00:16:30,628 --> 00:16:33,063
That's a piece of evidence
that hurts all of us.

426
00:16:33,131 --> 00:16:35,999
You three are under arrest for
burning down Goldman's Pharmacy.

427
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:39,303
Well, the pocket-dial giveth,
and the pocket-dial taketh away.

428
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,937
You'll never take me alive!

429
00:16:41,005 --> 00:16:42,706
Aren't you gonna run?

430
00:16:42,774 --> 00:16:45,876
I would, but I don't want
my gym teacher to laugh at me.

431
00:16:45,943 --> 00:16:48,362
He's been following me around
since junior high.

432
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:50,464
Watch this.
Watch this Jewish kid run.

433
00:16:56,966 --> 00:16:58,967
First, I have to read you
the Miranda rights

434
00:16:59,035 --> 00:17:00,435
for Jewish people.

435
00:17:00,503 --> 00:17:03,004
You have the right to remain
silent, even though you won't.

436
00:17:03,072 --> 00:17:05,841
You have the right to infer an
insult where none was intended.

437
00:17:05,908 --> 00:17:07,375
What's that
supposed to mean?

438
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,195
You have the right to a lawyer,
who you are probably related to.

439
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:11,563
This interview
is over.

440
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:15,133
What were you dointhe night
of March 8th?

441
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,601
(Bleep) your mother.

442
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:17,969
Come on, man,
that's not cool.

443
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,138
Oh, yeah? Maybe this
is cool enough for you.

444
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,073
(farting)

445
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:23,175
(blows)

446
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,876
It's gonna take
a lot more

447
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:27,078
than a fart in my
face to make me...

448
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,847
Whoa! Whoa.

449
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:30,816
Yeah, and there's more
where that came from.

450
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,018
(straining)

451
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,553
(sighs)
No, there isn't.

452
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:37,589
Where were you
the night of the fire?

453
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,591
- I was at the movies.
- What did you see?

454
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:40,959
- <i>No Strings Attached.</i>
- How was it?

455
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:43,328
- Sucked.
- Okay, that checks out.

456
00:17:43,412 --> 00:17:45,881
Boy, that Ashton Kutcher
sure was a cad

457
00:17:45,948 --> 00:17:47,349
in that movie, wasn't he?

458
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:48,683
Yeah, totally.

459
00:17:48,751 --> 00:17:50,252
Wrong! He had
a heart of gold.

460
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,753
You're going down.

461
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:57,175
- Your husband's in here, ma'am.
- Lois!

462
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,743
Peter, what's going on?

463
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:01,112
Is it true? Did you really
burn down Mort's pharmacy?

464
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,547
Hi, Lois. Hi.

465
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:04,816
Look, Lois, we were just trying
to help Mort.

466
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:07,185
Peter, how could you do this?
You have a family.

467
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,087
Did you ever stop
to think about us

468
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:11,790
before you did something that
could send you away to prison?

469
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:15,260
(sighs) For once, could you visit me
in jail and not criticize me?

470
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:16,795
Wait a minute.

471
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:18,997
This isn't Carvel,
you lying bitch.

472
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:20,215
All right,
that's enough.

473
00:18:20,283 --> 00:18:21,983
Visiting time
is over.

474
00:18:22,051 --> 00:18:24,202
You know you guys are
gonna do time for this.

475
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,304
Come on, Joe. You're really
gonna put us away?

476
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:27,839
You think I
want to do this?

477
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:30,876
You know how hard it's gonna be
for me to make new friends?

478
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,511
Hey, do you think Chris is
old enough to be my friend?

479
00:18:33,596 --> 00:18:35,697
Old enough? Yes. But I wouldn't
bark down that alley.

480
00:18:35,765 --> 00:18:37,232
You frighten him.

481
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,634
He thinks you're a Transformer
that broke halfway through.

482
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,369
I get that a lot.
I understand.

483
00:18:41,437 --> 00:18:42,637
Look, Mort was
in trouble.

484
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,573
We-we were just trying
to help him out.

485
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,142
Well, insurance fraud is not
the way to help somebody out.

486
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,978
Listen, Joe, insurance agencies
are all scumbags.

487
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,346
They deserve to get hurt.

488
00:18:51,414 --> 00:18:52,781
You don't decide that.

489
00:18:52,848 --> 00:18:54,349
What you did is
against the law.

490
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:55,550
It's easy for you, Joe.

491
00:18:55,618 --> 00:18:56,851
You don't know what it's like

492
00:18:56,919 --> 00:18:58,320
to be screwed over
by an insurance company.

493
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,155
Oh, I don't, do I?

494
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,791
Well, let me tell you
a little story.

495
00:19:02,858 --> 00:19:05,760
<i>It was hours after my accident.</i>

496
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:08,029
<i>I was barely conscious</i>
<i>on the operating table,</i>

497
00:19:08,097 --> 00:19:10,932
<i>but I'll never forget the phone</i>
<i>call that changed my life.</i>

498
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,636
Hello, I'm calling on behalf of
your policyholder, Joe Swanson.

499
00:19:14,704 --> 00:19:16,738
He's badly injured his spine.

500
00:19:16,806 --> 00:19:18,340
Well, there's
a new procedure that,

501
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,075
if administered immediately,

502
00:19:20,142 --> 00:19:22,077
should restore
his ability to walk.

503
00:19:22,144 --> 00:19:24,646
$200,000.

504
00:19:24,714 --> 00:19:27,248
We also have a wheelchair.

505
00:19:27,316 --> 00:19:29,618
$60.

506
00:19:29,685 --> 00:19:31,653
Okay.

507
00:19:31,721 --> 00:19:34,105
They're going with "B."

508
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,658
Those sons of bitches
made it about money.

509
00:19:36,726 --> 00:19:38,627
Yeah, Joe.
So, what do you say?

510
00:19:38,694 --> 00:19:39,928
They didn't
care about you.

511
00:19:39,996 --> 00:19:41,429
Why should you
care about them?

512
00:19:41,497 --> 00:19:43,498
The thing is,

513
00:19:43,566 --> 00:19:45,767
you guys committed a crime,

514
00:19:45,835 --> 00:19:48,269
and I've still got the evidence
to prove it.

515
00:19:48,337 --> 00:19:49,871
Too bad I lost it.

516
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,873
FEMALE AUTOMATED VOICE:
Message deleted.

517
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:55,143
Was that... was that supposed
to mean something?

518
00:19:55,211 --> 00:19:56,978
Yeah, I'm letting
you guys go.

519
00:19:57,046 --> 00:19:58,446
Oh. Oh, well,
that's great.

520
00:19:58,514 --> 00:19:59,948
Yeah, I didn't
get that, either.

521
00:20:00,016 --> 00:20:01,666
Yeah, why didn't you
just say that?

522
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,435
I'm starting to regret
erasing that message.

523
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:04,719
Too late, butt-face.

524
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,338
Have a great summer, Joe.

525
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:12,610
Peter, I don't
understand

526
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,579
how they just
let you out of jail.

527
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,982
Yeah, Joe had all kinds of
evidence against you guys.

528
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,883
Seems like a huge
miscarriage of justice.

529
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,719
I thought if you do
something wrong,

530
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,220
you're supposed
to get punished.

531
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:24,239
(laughing):
Oh, Chris, not if you're white.

532
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,708
Well, now that I've wrapped
things up with you guys,

533
00:20:26,776 --> 00:20:29,411
I better wrap things up
with my basement family.

534
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,246
Well, did you guys
learn your lesson

535
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,681
about eating
uncooked antelope?

536
00:20:34,116 --> 00:20:35,734
(hisses)
