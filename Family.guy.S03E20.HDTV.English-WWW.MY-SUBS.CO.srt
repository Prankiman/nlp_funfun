2
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,210
- It's 4 o'clock! Away with you!
- Change it back!

3
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:47,420
Jolly Farm Revue. The latest indoctrinating
pablum for children with not enough to do.

4
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,420
Hey! Shut up!

5
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,600
- Wakey wakey, children!
- Good morning, Mother Maggie.

6
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,650
The sun has risen on
another day in Jolly Farm.

7
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,980
Let's see what life's rich pageant
has in store for us.

8
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:10,650
She has the voice of an angel! And
a balcony you could do Shakespeare from.

9
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,160
Play your song, Melody Sheep,
to aid the little ones' nourishment.

10
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,910
But play softly,
for Pengrove Pig wishes to read aloud

11
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,670
from his magic tome
that holds every book ever written.

12
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:28,090
"It was difficult for the children of Ipswich
when the lollipop famine cursed them... "

13
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:32,890
How can you stand watching this?
It's dreck and you know it.

14
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,350
Don't have the guts to respond, huh?
No defence of this unmitigated crap?

15
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,390
Commercial!
I'm getting some graham crackers.

16
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:48,320
Welcome to KISS Forum, Rhode Island Public
Access's most popular show about KISS.

17
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,990
- Lois, hurry! It's back on!
- Calm down. You know I wouldn't miss this.

18
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,490
OK, let's take a call.
You're on KISS Forum.

19
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,960
- KISS rules! Whoo!
- OK, good call. Good call.

20
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,460
All right. Hey, you're on KISS Forum.

21
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,380
- Yeah. KISS sucks!
- Whoa, whoa!

22
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,630
- Trace the call!
- They suck big time, man. They bite ass!

23
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,840
Wait... I recognise that voice!

24
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,890
Is this Dennis De Young,
lead singer from Styx? Come clean, man.

25
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,730
Yeah. Yeah, it's me. It's Dennis.

26
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:23,020
You jealous douche. How about I play
"Detroit Rock City" and "Come Sail Away"

27
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:27,940
and let's see how they stack up side by side.
You want that, you high-voiced bastard?!

28
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,820
We'll be right back after this.

29
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,490
Hey, didn't see you come in.
We're getting into shape for our tour.

30
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,200
We're playing five big shows in five days.

31
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,040
- So if you...
- Rock and roll!

32
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,670
Why don't you just
sit in the corner, huh? Go on.

33
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,710
So if you're a KISS fan in the Northeast,

34
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,470
come out for all five shows
of what we're calling KISS-Stock!

35
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:56,390
Hell, the Northeast! At times like this I curse
the fact that we live in French Polynesia.

36
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:02,150
- No, Peter, we're in the Northeast.
- Yeah? And KISS is coming to the Northeast.

37
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,480
That means... uh...

38
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,030
- That means...
- No, no, Lois. Don't help me.

39
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,620
It means we can do something...

40
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,040
Come on, Peter. You're almost there.

41
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,540
We can go to KISS-Stock!

42
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,170
- Yo, Lois!
- What?

43
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,090
I'm packing and can't find
my favourite underwear.

44
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,260
The pair with the rip in the right butt cheek

45
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,930
from stepping on 'em in the airplane
bathroom when you had the trots?

46
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,690
No, with the hole in the left butt cheek
from holding it in for two hours

47
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:43,940
cos it was a long church sermon and
I thought blowing gas would offend Jesus,

48
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,490
so I let it go in the vestibule
and it sounded like Louis Armstrong.

49
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,160
Oh, bottom drawer.

50
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,830
Tell Mother Maggie what you
want to be when you grow up.

51
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,290
- A scientist.
- A novelist.

52
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,410
A Cambridge don.

53
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,670
What's my future, coming from
these squalid surroundings?

54
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,750
Fighting with a dude at the Laundromat

55
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,300
because he hit on my baby's mama?
I should be there, not here!

56
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,470
London.

57
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,430
Dad, can me and Meg stay up late
every night when you're at KISS-Stock?

58
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,980
Do whatever you want.
Just don't eat from the candy tree.

59
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,520
He's right to caution you. I feed on children.

60
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,940
You don't mind
watching Stewie for a few days?

61
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,610
Nah. Since Jolly Farm Revue
came on, he's been distracted.

62
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,120
- It'll be a breeze.
- Bye, everyone.

63
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,750
My stupid parents are spending five days
following stupid old KISS around. It's painful.

64
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,460
Not as painful as a tyre iron
upside your head.

65
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,840
- What?
- I'll miss you!

66
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,510
Hey, Stewie, what do you want for lunch?

67
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,260
"Dear stupid dog, I've gone to live
with the children on Jolly Farm. "

68
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,640
"Goodbye for ever. Stewie. "

69
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,930
I never got a chance to return
that sweater Lois gave me for Christmas. "

70
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,310
"The receipt's on top of my bureau.
I'm probably over the 30-day return limit,

71
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,610
but I'm sure if you make a fuss,
they'll give you a store credit or something. "

72
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,240
"It's actually not a horrible sweater. "

73
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,990
"It's just I can't imagine when
I would ever wear it. You know?"

74
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,290
"I also left a button on the bureau. "

75
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,460
"I'm not sure what it goes to,

76
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,710
but I can never bring myself
to throw a button away. "

77
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:22,800
"I know as soon as I do, I'll find
the garment it goes to, and then it'II... "

78
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,140
"Actually, could it have been from
the sweater? Did it have buttons? Hm. "

79
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,180
"I should wrap this up before I start
to ramble. OK, goodbye for ever. "

80
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:37,190
You know, it might be chilly in London.
I'm going to take the sweater. "

81
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,860
Oh, my God!

82
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,240
One of these planes
must be going to London.

83
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,200
Queue up, children spit-spot.

84
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,660
Here are the tickets, miss. These are all ours.

85
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:57,000
Spit-spot, Albert Hall, meat and two veg,
Big Ben, Dave Clark Five, pip-pip, cheerio.

86
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,150
- Hot towel?
- Yes, thank you.

87
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,690
Well, come on!

88
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:22,150
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Taking you off this plane.

89
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,530
Think again, Rover.

90
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:32,040
Great. I'm stuck on a transatlantic flight
with a petulant runaway. Could it get worse?

91
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,960
You know what I hate
about flying? The peanuts.

92
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,250
First of all, you can't get 'em open.
Who are they trying to keep out of these?

93
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:44,470
And what's with the razor-blade slot in the
bathroom? Do people really shave in there?

94
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:49,890
Hi. Andy Dick here. Excuse me. I've got to
get my bag up in the overhead bin here. Oh!

95
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:52,270
Whoa, no, no! Oh!

96
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,770
Wow, that's wacky!

97
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,910
That wasn't so bad, was it?
Did you sleep at all?

98
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,870
- A little.
- I couldn't. My pillow smelled like farts.

99
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,120
But that's all right because we're in England!

100
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,210
Uh-oh.

101
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:19,300
But where are its verdant fields, rosy-rumped
maidens and bucktoothed solicitors?

102
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,510
About 3,000 miles that way.
We're in the Middle East.

103
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:27,930
- Where are we going?
- I'm not familiar with this Arabian village.

104
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,190
Stuff for sale!
Bad, cheaply made stuff for sale!

105
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,150
Hey, Americans. You like movies?

106
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:37,860
I've got Dude, My Car Is Not Where
I Parked It, But Praise Allah, We Are Not Hurt.

107
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,280
Camels for sale!
This one owned by a little old man

108
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,370
who only drove it to mosque on Sundays.
Just had its knees replaced.

109
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:49,540
- Buy one and let's get out of here.
- Buy one? All I've got is 50 bucks.

110
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,120
We'll have to distract him. Follow my lead.

111
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,840
"You and I are so awfully different

112
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:04,550
"Too awfully different to ever be pals

113
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,430
- Do you want to go first?
- Yeah.

114
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:10,480
"Your favourite hero
is the Marquis de Sade

115
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,850
You're one to talk.

116
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,190
"You get a stiffie from Phylicia Rashad

117
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,110
Oh, one time.

118
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:20,610
"I've a style flair, just look at my hip hair

119
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,320
- That's quite a nice do there.
- Oh, thanks.

120
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,280
- For me to poop on!
- What?

121
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,790
- You look like Charlie Brown.
- Bite me, Snoopy.

122
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:33,750
"There's not a whole lot
that we've got to agree on

123
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,710
"Cos I love the strains of a classical score

124
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,180
"And I like that singer
who looks like a whore

125
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,760
- Ricky Martin?
- Love him!

126
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:48,020
"We're too different to ever be pals!

127
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,310
- " You and I are...
- " Doo doo doo

128
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,020
- " So awfully different...
- " Doo doo doo

129
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,650
- " Too awfully different...
- " Doo doo doo

Oh, very funny.

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,000
"You have a weenie
like a Christmas-tree light

134
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,300
"I'd bet money you'll marry a honey

135

"Who's pretty and funny,
and her name'll be Ted

136
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,890
- A gay joke.
- I work with what you give me.

137
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:26,930
"You might think we're in sync,
but we stink as a duo

00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:42,370
"We're too different to ever be pals

142
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,800
Oh, man, we're screwed.
We're lost in the desert.

143
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,010
We have no food, no water.
Our camel is dead from exhaustion.

144
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,260
And I had named him
and given him a back story.

145
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:03,430
Chucky had the biggest hump of
all the local camels, and was picked on for it.

146
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:08,440
Then there was a drought, and Chucky went
to the oasis at great risk cos he was like that.

147
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:13,230
He drank and stored enough water
in his massive hump to slake the thirst of...

148
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,320
Cut the maudlin crap. We're in trouble.

149
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,370
It's below freezing and getting colder.
We're gonna die unless...

150
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:22,080
- Unless we do something drastic.
- What?

151
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,040
We have to slice open our camel's stomach
and shelter in his entrails.

152
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,250
Eviscerate Chucky?! I won't do it!

153
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:31,380
- We'll die if we don't.
- All right.

154
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,220
Oh, God! It's like Orson Welles's autopsy!

155
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,350
All right, just hold your breath and go.

156
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:43,890
- What are you doing?
- Wiping my feet. I don't want to track sand in.

157
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:47,650
Once you get it in there, you can't get it out.

158
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,820
Oh, God!
I just threw up in his lung!

159
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:56,910
I know it's gross, but when you're staring
death in the face, you have no choice but to...

160
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,700
Oh. There's a Comfort Inn.

161
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,870
- Really?
- Yeah. Good luck for us, huh?

162
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:04,410
Actually, once you feng-shui the organs,
it's kind of cosy.

163
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,760
- Isn't this exciting?
- Hey, anyone got a light?

164
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,760
Thanks.

165
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,930
- Look. There's Dave and Dottie, the nudists.
- Hey there, Griffins!

166
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:23,390
- Dave, Dottie, what a pleasant surprise!
- You're KISS freaks, too?

167
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,230
KISS Army soldier since 1977.
How about you?

168
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:29,980
'76. I don't think anyone
knows more about KISS than I do.

169
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,110
- What was that?
- It's not important.

170
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:37,490
- Let him answer.
- No one knows more about KISS than I do.

171
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:41,330
- Keep it civil.
- I'm not sure I like the tone of your voice.

172
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:45,000
- Well, throw down.
- Name Gene's special-effects mentor.

173
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,920
Amaze-O the magician.
What school did Paul go to?

174
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,420
New York High School of Music.
Their band before KISS?

175
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,550
Wicked Lester. What year were KISS on
The Jim Nabors Halloween Special?

176
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,050
Trick question. It was Paul Lynde. 1975.

177
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,390
Recite the ad that brought Peter
to Paul and Gene's attention.

178
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:03,140
"Drummer willing to do anything to make it. "
Rolling Stone, October, 1972.

179
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,310
- Exemplary!
- Rock and roll!

180
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,650
How in the hell are we gonna get out of here?

181
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:13,150
- Are you going to finish your red paste?
- No.

182
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,160
- What about your sweet, crusty thing?
- Have it.

183
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,120
No more balloon for you! I am sick
of you tooling around the village in it,

184
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,250
honking at the girls, blasting your 1980s
American rock music that we got last week.

185
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,130
- But, Father!
- Go to your palace!

186
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,300
- You know what I'm thinking?
- Yes.

187
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:34,090
Just wait until they have to
suffer through Jesus Jones. Pee-yew!

188
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,760
- Not that. The balloon!
- Oh, yes. The balloon. Let's take it.

189
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,770
- I didn't know it really looked like that.
- Neither did I.

190
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,690
Such lovely printing, too.

191
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,150
Oh, Lois, here comes the best part.

192
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,330
"And have a wonderful... time

193
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,290
Is that it? No, no, it's...

194
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,840
"And... something something... all day

195
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,760
Right?

196
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,050
- Oh, man. I've lost all faith in mankind.
- Music is dead to me now.

197
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,050
- Hey, now's our chance!
- Let's do it!

198
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,400
Where the hell are we?

199
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:36,160
Pope... Pope!

200
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,410
- It's time to get up and put on your hat.
- It's a stupid hat!

201
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,880
- Pope!
- All right, OK. God!

202
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,300
- Pope, the floor is not a hamper.
- Man!

203
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,510
It's time to go on the balcony
and address the people.

204
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,600
Aargh!

205
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,940
We gotta find the American Embassy
to help us get home.

206
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,280
I have no intention of
returning to that disgusting hovel

207
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,450
with that intolerable woman,
that fat slob and that insufferable dog.

208
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:17,040
Oh, you're right here, aren't you?
I stand by it. My future is with Jolly Farm!

209
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,620
- You really think that, don't you?
- I know it.

210
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,080
We've got three days
until Peter and Lois get back.

211
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,090
- Let's go to Jolly Farm.
- Now you're talking!

212
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:31,510
You make the pope look like a fool!
God will make you pay. Smite them!

213
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,310
He's cooking something up.

214
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,650
I say! Brian, look. Three rows down.

215
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,940
- What?
- Is that Tom Bosley?

216
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,860
Why would Tom Bosley
be on a train in Switzerland?

217
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,370
I'm almost certain. Tom!

218
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,660
- Did he look?
- I don't know.

219
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:00,080
If I yell, you have to watch. Tom Bosley!

220
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,080
- No, it's not him.
- Oh.

221
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,760
Besides its beautiful historic architecture,

222
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,630
Munich was ze home of many
great writers, such as Thomas Mann.

223
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,810
You'll find more on Germany's
contribution to ze arts in ze pamphlets.

224
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,100
Yeah, about your pamphlet.

225
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:21,900
I'm not seeing anything about
German history between 1939 and 1945.

226
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,400
- There's a gap.
- Everyone was on vacation!

227
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,530
On your left is
Munich's first city hall, erected in 15...

228
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:31,280
What are you talking about?
Germany invaded Poland in 1939.

229
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:35,540
- We were invited! Punch was served!
- You can't ignore those years.

230
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,290
Thomas Mann fled to America
because of Naziism's hold on Germany.

231
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:43,040
- No, he left to manage a Dairy Queen.
- That's preposterous.

232
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:46,920
I vill hear no more insinuations
about Germans! Nothing bad happened!

233
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,560
- Uh, is that a beer hall?
- Oh, yes.

234
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,270
Munich is renowned
for its historic beer halls.

235
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,480
- Why is everybody glaring at us?
- Why, Lois? I'll tell you why.

236
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,400
Your faux pas at the concert
was so upsetting,

237
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:12,450
I had to call a professor to tell me
what phrase to use to describe it.

238
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,080
- Use "faux pas".
- Thanks, Professor.

239
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,540
You've lived a lie all these years.
You represented yourself as a KISS fan.

240
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:23,420
- And why? To make me look foolish!
- No, to make you happy.

241
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:28,720
I wanted to share in all aspects of your life,
but I just was never that big a KISS fan.

242
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,260
I should've guessed when you were
willing to dress as Peter Criss.

243
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,310
No one wants to be Peter Criss,
not even Peter Criss!

244
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,520
I guess I'm just not
as cool as you thought I was.

245
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,230
I guess not.

246
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,360
I'm exhausted. Come on, let's get a coffee.

247
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:54,160
- The smoke is so acrid.
- A man can hardly breathe in here.

248
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:57,500
You should get some hash, man.
You can't go wrong.

249
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,380
Not true. Ground meat can go
very wrong for me very quickly,

250
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,670
and everyone will suffer the consequences!

251
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,170
You are out there, man, in the ether.

252
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:10,220
I'd love to further pursue our palaver,
but I'm not fluent in "freaker"!

253
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:14,600
So, I'm just gonna turn back over here,
back towards my table.

254
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,890
- Are you hungry?
- I wasn't when I came in.

255
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:20,360
- But isn't that so funny? I'm getting there.
- Same here.

256
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,490
I think
the only reason we die is...

257
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:31,410
Dude, I know what
you're gonna say and I am so...

258
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:34,120
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Shh-shh-shh-shh!

259
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,830
The only reason we die

260
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:41,210
is because we accept it as an inevitability.

261
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:49,140
- D'you think I'll ever find the right woman?
- Oh, God! Yes, man! Dude, you're great!

262
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,350
Are you ever gonna forgive me?

263
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:58,940
Lois, I am obligated to keep loving you
so I will take my rage out on my own body.

264
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,320
Let's go to Denny's.

265
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,200
Oh, man! I don't believe it! KISS is here!

266
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,580
We don't deserve to be
under the same roof. Let's go.

267
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,750
All right. I guess I could fix us
something when we... Chaim?

268
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:17,580
Lois! Do not address KISS
unless they address you first!

269
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:21,250
Oh, my God! Chaim Witz? It is you!

270
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:26,470
- Do you want me to sign the left or right?
- No, no, no. It's Lois. Lois Pewterschmidt.

271
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,760
I knew you before you changed your name.

272
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:31,680
Lois! I don't believe it! It's been ages!

273
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:36,770
Guys, this is the girl I told you about. I knew
her before we formed KISS. Loose Lois!

274
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,070
- Cool! Loose Lois!
- The legend!

275
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:42,320
My Grand Slam
was supposed to be with sausage.

276
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,860
I never realised you
were Gene Simmons, the rock star!

277
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,370
You look great. Anyone nailing you now?

278
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:51,500
Yes, my husband nails me.
This is him. Peter.

279
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,540
- You... are... gods!
- Yeah, thanks. Right.

280
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,840
We're recording in Boston next month.

281
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,090
- You should come on by.
- Oh, we'd love that, Chaim.

282
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:05,140
I mean Gene, you big rock star. Bye.

283
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:10,680
Oh, wow! Such a small world.
He was a nice boy, and he's still nice.

284
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:15,480
Listen, Lois, what I said before...
I've never been more wrong in my life.

285
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,770
You are the coolest girl in the world!

286
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,690
- My wife did KISS!
- And J Geils.

287
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,940
- What?
- Nothing.

288
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,910
There it is! The BBC!

289
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,330
This is it. I'll say goodbye to you now.

290
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:34,750
- Well, have a good life, Stewie.
- Oh, I shall!

291
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:39,130
Hey, did you ever find out
what that button on my bureau was from?

292
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:43,510
- Yeah. Chris's denim jacket.
- Ah. I like that jacket. It looks good on him.

293
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,720
- OK, we'll keep in touch?
- Sure.

294
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,510
Well, I have your address. See ya!

295
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,230
Oh! There's Happy Hill!

296
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,230
What the deuce...?

297
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,990
Pengrove! Pengrove Pig!
Pengrove, I've come to live on Jolly Farm!

298
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,370
Oh, my! The magic tome!

299
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:09,370
It's cardboard! There are no words, there
are just... What is it you've drawn here?

300
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,290
It's Oswald Owl slammin'
Mother Maggie in a Chinese basket, eh?

301
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,380
Dead brill, eh?

302
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:22,930
- Mother Maggie, something's terribly wrong!
- Whose stinky brat is this?

303
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:26,810
That's not your voice! Your voice
is lyrical, like the strum of a lute!

304
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,310
Piss off, ya grotty little wanker!

305
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:35,360
- It's a fake! It's not real!
- I thought you should find out on your own.

306
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,280
I feel like such a fool. Don't even look at me!

307
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:43,780
Hey, come on. You wanna get some
ice cream? That'd make you feel better, right?

308
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,910
You wanna get some McDonald's?

309
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,250
You wanna take a dump
in Mother Maggie's shoes?

310
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:53,920
OK, let's go take a dump
in Mother Maggie's shoes.

311
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:02,760
- Jolly Farm, Stewie. Don't you wanna watch?
- The Stewie who loved Jolly Farm is dead.

312
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:05,390
Meet the Stewie who loves funky fruit hats!

313
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,020
Oh, turn it up! Mom and Dad are on!

314
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:16,110
We're back with KISS Forum. I'm with the
Griffins, and they got something to share.

315
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,150
- Yeah. My wife here did KISS.
- Get outta here!

316
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:22,700
- Hand to God.
- Peter! How does that make you feel?

317
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:26,120
I feel like I've done KISS, too.
And it feels good.

318
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,580
Lois, you got any tips for
the young girls in the audience?

319
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,880
The best advice I can give is,

320
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,130
you never know who's gonna grow up
to be famous, so make yourself available.

321
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:42,510
Cool. Well, that's our show for tonight.
Stay tuned for Battlestar Galactica Forum.

322
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,890
Welcome to Battlestar Galactica Forum.
