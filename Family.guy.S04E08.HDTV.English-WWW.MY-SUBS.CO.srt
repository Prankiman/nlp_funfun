1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:07,337
Thanks for baby-sitting, Meg.
We'll be back in a couple of hours.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,908
I don't understand why
I have to baby-sit Stewie.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,706
I mean, what's he really gonna do
if we leave him by himself?

4
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:15,440
And now to test my teleportation pods.

5
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:19,846
Oh, damn!

6
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:26,885
I'm a monster!

7
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:30,895
It seems today that all you see

8
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:34,160
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

9
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:37,668
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

10
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,535
On which we used to rely?

11
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,636
Lucky there's a family guy

12
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:47,474
Lucky there's a man who
Positively can do

13
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,104
all the things that make us

14
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,443
Laugh and cry

15
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:55,819
He's a family guy

16
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:06,695
So, this is awkward, but...

17
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,301
have we ever actually, you know, met?

18
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:15,003
I mean, you know, I don't even know, say,
for example, if you have a room up there.

19
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,240
You know, a room?

20
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,142
I have a room.

21
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:22,342
You know, Meg, if you kill yourself now...

22
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:24,849
you'll probably get a full page
in the yearbook.

23
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:27,715
So, you know,
that's something to think about.

24
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,282
Just burped.

25
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:31,490
Hi, Meg.

26
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,491
You busy Saturday night?

27
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:37,120
NeiI, you ask me out, like, once a day,
and I always give you the same answer.

28
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,219
No!

29
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:42,062
God, I don't think I could have been any
clearer the last time I turned him down.

30
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:45,194
Ray, your mother insulted
my steak pizzola again.

31
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:48,139
NeiI Goldman of Quahog, Rhode Island...

32
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,936
leave me alone!

33
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:52,443
I hate you! I hate you!

34
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:56,205
- Anyway, your mother insulted-
- I don't care anymore, Patty.

35
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,716
After nine seasons, I just don't care.

36
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:01,412
Maybe you could try not being a bitch.

37
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:10,953
Hey, Mort.
Lois and I are out on our date night.

38
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,463
Why don't you give me some condoms?

39
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:16,558
And some Excedrin.
My wife's got a headache this big.

40
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,861
You know, it's like from the commerciaI.

41
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,270
This big. Only it's my junk.

42
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:24,138
all right, then. $12.43.

43
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:27,179
Jeez, that's more of a rip-off
than that breakfast machine I bought.

44
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,530
Ow! Ow!

45
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,574
What was the point of all that?

46
00:02:56,743 --> 00:03:00,611
all it does is shoot you.
It doesn't make breakfast at all.

47
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:03,079
Besides, I forgot my wallet.

48
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,048
Well, that's okay. I'll just open up a tab.

49
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:08,211
Wait a minute, what the hell's a tab?
Does that mean I don't gotta pay?

50
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,346
- Well, not right now, but-
- Ah, sweet!

51
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,981
Hey, while I'm at it,
give me all these copies of Marie Claire.

52
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:15,026
You know, in case I want to
rub out that easy one...

53
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,459
before I get Lois into bed tonight.

54
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,827
Kathleen Turner's on Page 45.

55
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,730
Kathleen Turner, huh?
Let's see how she looks.

56
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,096
Oh, that's a shame.

57
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:27,370
And now back to
The Kids' Choice Awards...

58
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,270
with host Paula Poundstone.

59
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,071
I choose you and you and you.

60
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,404
So, come on.

61
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,171
I said, let's go!

62
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,048
Meg!

63
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:44,313
Meg, I'm hungry!

64
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:48,218
There's a granola bar in the cupboard.
I want it.

65
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,718
Hey.

66
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,019
Hey.

67
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,356
What's this?

68
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:54,858
What's going on?

69
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:56,396
Am I talking to myself up there?

70
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:59,528
Oh, my God.
Stewie, just shut up and go to bed!

71
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:03,166
Do you know what I do, Meg?
I spit in your mouth while you sleep.

72
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:08,073
Finally. Look, Mom, I've had it.
I am not baby-sitting anymore.

73
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,547
It's Saturday night,
I could be out having a life.

74
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,141
Meg, if you don't want
to baby-sit anymore, that's fine.

75
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,483
But don't you stand there and lie to me.

76
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:19,456
Meg, she torched your ass, man.
She torched your ass.

77
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,891
Why can't you just hire a reaI baby-sitter?

78
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,519
Well, I guess we could do that.

79
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,757
Damn! I'm terrible at meeting new people.

80
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,492
Like the time I was on Blind Date.

81
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:30,265
- I'm having a great time, Stewie.
- Me, too.

82
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,930
So, you ready to go grab some 'za?

83
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,764
Yeah.

84
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,410
So, a wild guess here...

85
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:44,244
but from the looks of your arm hair,
I'm guessing you're Itallan?

86
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:53,689
all right, you guys, I got eight crates
of ipecac from Mort, all on my tab.

87
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,658
Now, whoever goes the longest
without puking...

88
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,957
gets the last piece of pie in the fridge.

89
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,427
Okay, here we go.

90
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,694
- How's everybody doing?
- Good. Good so far.

91
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,102
all right, all right.

92
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:09,003
- Nothing yet.
- CooI, cooI.

93
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:12,900
You know, I don't know if you guys
had any of that pie already...

94
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:17,307
but that is some tasty stuff.
That's from the bake sale that Lois-

95
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:21,850
One down. I know somebody
who won't be having any-

96
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,586
I'm starting to feeI funny.

97
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:26,916
Well, I feeI fine. I guess I'm-

98
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,252
Oh, boy! That means I win. I get to eat-

99
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,929
Oh, God! Why didn't anybody tell me...

100
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:41,039
Oh, my God! My insides are on-

101
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,037
No. No, please. No more, no more. No-

102
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:48,475
Dad, I'm scared.

103
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:51,747
Get the phone. Call 911-

104
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,319
Lois! Lois! Lois, get in here...

105
00:05:56,956 --> 00:06:00,255
Okay, okay. I think it's all gone.

106
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,224
I think-

107
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,027
I don't wanna, I don't wanna...

108
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:08,456
Peter. Peter, I need you to hold my ears...

109
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,338
Who wants chowder?

110
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,611
What the hell?

111
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,412
Hey, Meg, you better check this out.

112
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,872
Oh, God, this is so embarrassing.
I can't believe this is happening to me.

113
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:55,277
Looks like someone could use
a greeting card to cheer them up.

114
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:57,872
I put these on my tab.
Here, take a Far Side one.

115
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,952
The vulture thinks he's a cowboy.

116
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:02,781
It's kind of funny.

117
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:06,381
Hey, Peter, you got a card for
if you transferred VD to somebody?

118
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:07,959
Let's see here.

119
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,925
Yup. "Sorry I accidentally gave you VD."

120
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,863
That's all you got is accidentaI, huh?
all right, I'll take it.

121
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:16,730
Well, first let me thank you
for answering the ad.

122
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:21,205
Now, what do you feeI quallfies you
to be an effective baby-sitter for Stewie?

123
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:29,209
Yeah. We couldn't run an ad
that said "no Portuguese," but...

124
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,312
no Portuguese.

125
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,578
So, I see here you worked for a family
for a number of years.

126
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,557
Can I call the Herculoids for a reference?

127
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:43,789
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

128
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:46,991
The position has been filled.

129
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:51,825
The position has been filled.
Thank you very much. You can go now.

130
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,139
Leave! Now!

131
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,774
I didn't think it was gonna be this hard
to choose a baby-sitter.

132
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,472
Yes, if only you were this discerning...

133
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:05,278
when you picked that happening
Bruce Jenner hairdo.

134
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,017
Sorry I'm late. Can I still apply for the job?

135
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:18,557
My God, I haven't been this exhilarated
since Brian took me to see Les Miserables.

136
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,321
Attention, ladies and gentlemen.

137
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,458
There will be a slight change
in the cast tonight.

138
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:23,557
Oh, no.

139
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,966
For this evening's performance...

140
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:28,529
the role of Jean Valjean
will be played by Kirk Cameron.

141
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,164
Oh! Oh!

142
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:34,336
Unbelievable! Oh, my God!
How lucky are we, huh?

143
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:36,108
"Hey, Stewie,
what are you doing tonight?"

144
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:39,241
"Oh, nothing. Just watching
Kirk Cameron play Jean Valjean. "

145
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,411
Oh, my God! Curtain up.

146
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,691
Hey, Mort, do these suppositories
come in other flavors?

147
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,191
Peter, are you eating those?

148
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:49,625
No, I'm shoving them up my butt.

149
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,321
Of course I'm eating them.
Give me a carton.

150
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,297
Peter, it's the end of the month,
and I'm calling your tab.

151
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,699
- You owe me $34,000.
- What?

152
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:00,271
Oh, man, how am I gonna come up
with that kind of money?

153
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,364
Peter, I'm waiting.

154
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:07,711
all right, all right.
Listen, I got another idea.

155
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:09,405
What if I sold you my daughter?

156
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,474
You drop the tab,
and your son can have Meg.

157
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:13,807
What?

158
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,751
Yep, all you gotta do is sign this contract.

159
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:19,552
Are you out of your mind?
You can't sell me, you fat son of a bitch!

160
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,093
Whoa! CarefuI getting this fish
off the hook, Mort.

161
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:23,786
She's got some fangs.

162
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,362
What do you think of that, NeiI?
Daddy bought you a girlfriend.

163
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:31,334
Excuse me. If anybody is interested,
I already have a girlfriend.

164
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,268
There's no way... Wait, what?

165
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:34,600
You ready to go, honey?

166
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:37,972
You rejected me too many times, Meg.
I couldn't wait for you forever.

167
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:41,706
Besides, Cecilia thinks
my psoriasis is sexy.

168
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:43,547
I can't believe he's over me.

169
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,981
I can't believe I'm out $34,000.

170
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,076
I can't believe it's not butter.

171
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,545
Stick around. More Family Guy coming up.

172
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:58,291
Peter, how could you have tried
to sell our daughter?

173
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:02,493
all right, Lois, I don't want this to ruin
our date night, so I'll make it up to you.

174
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,335
Oh, Peter.

175
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,030
"I'm sorry I tried to sell our daughter. "

176
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:10,006
Yeah, you don't know how hard it was
to find one of those in English.

177
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,578
Tonight the baby-sitter comes, Rupert.

178
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,976
Lovely LaDawn.

179
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,215
Hey, LaDawn. Hey, what's going on?
How are you?

180
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,115
Yeah. Just me, Stewie.

181
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,050
Just being myself.

182
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,821
Yeah. Well, this here? It's just my package.

183
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,629
Just my package.
God delivered it, I signed for it.

184
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,463
World keeps on spinning. Yeah.

185
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:39,597
Oh, no!

186
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,768
Jenga, there it is.

187
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,374
Well, I guess that's why they call it Jenga.

188
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,907
Stewie, you're so cute,
I can't even stand it.

189
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,245
Thank you. I'm having a good time, too.

190
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,318
I hope I don't make any sociaI faux pas...

191
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,252
like I did at Pamela and Tommy Lee's
dinner party.

192
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:58,983
Hi, sorry I'm late.
I was visiting my aunt in the hospitaI.

193
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:02,720
She has hepatitis.

194
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:06,926
Sorry.

195
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,029
NeiI is such an amazing guy.

196
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,506
We just make
an absolutely perfect couple.

197
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,509
You know, NeiI liked me first.

198
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:21,910
And I was gonna go out with him
when I was ready to settle for him.

199
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,447
Get your own spaz.

200
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,980
all right, ladies, enough chitchat.

201
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,747
Take it off, get in the shower
and bounce around for me.

202
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,782
Sweetie, your daddy and I
are going to the movies tonight.

203
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,588
How would you like LaDawn to baby-sit?

204
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,528
Yes! I'm going to wow her tonight, Rupert.

205
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:41,532
I'm gonna be cooler than Brian
when he hangs out at the bowling alley.

206
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,261
That's what I love about high-schooI girls.

207
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,271
I keep getting older,
they stay the same age.

208
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,737
Yes, they do. Yes, they do.

209
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,980
Please go out with me.
I'm just trying to make NeiI jealous.

210
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,811
I promise, I'll pay and everything.

211
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:01,717
Yeah. That sounds cooI,
but I'm gonna be in the hospitaI that night.

212
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:18,661
- Hi, gorgeous man.
- Oh, you.

213
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:22,172
Must I lock up your tongue
with the rest of the silver?

214
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,706
Stewie, this is Jeremy.

215
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:28,371
Hey, little man. So you're the guy
who's been trying to steaI my girlfriend.

216
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,573
What... You...

217
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:30,943
Girlfriend?

218
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,484
What kind of sick, twisted game
are you playing at?

219
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,384
Stewie sounds a little cranky.
I'll put him to bed.

220
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:39,047
I got your hat! Take that, hatless!

221
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:42,353
Now go back to the quad
and resume your Hacky Sack tourney!

222
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,827
I'm not gonna lie down
for some frat-boy bastard...

223
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,421
with his damn Teva sandals
and his SkoaI Bandits...

224
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,297
and his Abercrombie & Fitch
long-sleeved, open-stitched...

225
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:53,235
crew-neck Henley smoking his sticky buds
out of a soda can...

226
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,536
while watching his favorite downloaded
Simpsons episodes every night!

227
00:12:56,642 --> 00:13:00,009
Yes, we all love Mr. Plow.
You've got the song memorized, do you?

228
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,306
So does everyone else!

229
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:04,940
That is exactly the kind of idiot you see
at Taco Bell at 1:00 in the morning.

230
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,780
The guy who just whiffed his way
down the bar-skank ladder.

231
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,149
Good night, Stewie.

232
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,314
If he wants to throw hands,
I'll throw hands.

233
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:12,913
I tell you...

234
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,893
Hey! NeiI and Cecilia.

235
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:25,560
I didn't expect to see you here.

236
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,535
Meet Jake, my boyfriend.

237
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,507
I want some BB's.
My dad lets me shoot at cats.

238
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:31,667
Hi, Meg.

239
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:34,937
NeiI and I are celebrating
our two-week anniversary.

240
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,605
It seems like only yesterday...

241
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:39,513
he was just a stranger
videotaping me through the window.

242
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:42,212
Big deaI.
He did that to me three years ago.

243
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,312
And he gave me the tapes for Christmas.

244
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:45,913
He gave me DVDs.

245
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:49,893
The production values were amazing,
much better than Kramer vs. Predator.

246
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:50,962
You want him back?

247
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:53,827
You can't just disappear for three months
and then suddenly decide...

248
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,094
you want him back! You can't have him!

249
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:02,033
Well, I'm glad NeiI's over me, anyway.

250
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,132
I'm with Jake now. Right, Jake?

251
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:07,269
Maybe someday we'll get married
and you can go up on me.

252
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,078
- NeiI, I wanna be your girlfriend.
- What?

253
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,447
I was wrong to drive you away.
We belong together.

254
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:17,511
Of course, I'm understandably skepticaI
of your newfound affection for me.

255
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:20,023
You still got that contract
our dads drew up?

256
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:21,654
Give me that.

257
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:27,723
- You wanna hook up?
- Buy me something.

258
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:36,372
I can't believe we're going out.
This is so cooI.

259
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,145
NeiI. NeiI, not so fast.

260
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:44,010
Meg, you need to fulfill
your contractuaI obligations.

261
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:45,606
What are you talking about?

262
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,583
all right, Meg, according to the contract...

263
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:51,918
every night,
you have to put on my pajamas.

264
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,787
My mom's record is 12 seconds.

265
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,952
- NeiI, I think you're old enough to-
- Go!

266
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:59,053
- Would you stop kicking? Just hold still.
- That's tickling. It tickles.

267
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:01,724
- My thumb.
- Hold still. Quit it...

268
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:07,436
LaDawn, I thought
we could watch a DVD together.

269
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:09,939
I picked up the first season
of Jiminy Glick.

270
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,976
Imagine being that guy for a day.

271
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:16,104
Colin Farrell, so I was talking
to my wife, Dixie, the other day...

272
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:19,013
and she was saying
that you weren't a very good actor.

273
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,608
And I agreed with her.

274
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:24,120
Now, why, Colin,
why would we both say that?

275
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:30,223
all right, that's it.
Jeremy must be destroyed.

276
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:38,761
Mom?

277
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:41,806
Dad?

278
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,302
Mom? Is anyone there?

279
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,775
Little man? You in here?

280
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:06,325
I say, I think this is how you change a tire.
But what do I know? I'm just a baby!

281
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:12,061
Here's your iPod, so you can listen
to The Streaks while you gasp for air.

282
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,567
The Strokes. Right.

283
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:19,439
Boy, this was a better acquisition
than I thought.

284
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:22,446
We may even be able to put in
some sorghum this year.

285
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,112
So, anyway...

286
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,654
Hey, I made you a mix tape.

287
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,121
I don't have a duaI cassette player...

288
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:34,784
so, you know, I had to hold
the tape recorder up to the radio...

289
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:36,656
so the quallty is kind of sucky...

290
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:39,629
but, you know,
all the songs describe my feelings.

291
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,199
I'm sorry, Stewie. I'm just upset.

292
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,632
Jeremy stopped calling me.

293
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,672
He what? That blaggard!

294
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:51,071
Come here,
let me just hold you for a while.

295
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,243
Stewie! No! That is a bad place to touch.

296
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,407
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

297
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,541
But...

298
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,048
But I... You...

299
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:06,550
No more TV.

300
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:09,957
Well, how about no more job?
You hear that, Miss Fussy Britches?

301
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:12,030
I shall see you fired, damn you!

302
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:16,067
I thought we were going to go all the way
and die together like Hitler and Eva Braun.

303
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:19,927
- We do everything together, ja?
- Ja.

304
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,301
You got your poison?

305
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,035
Okay. One, two, three.

306
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,977
- You didn't do it.
- You didn't do it, either.

307
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,344
Okay, okay.
This time we really have to do it.

308
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,508
- Okay, all right. You ready? Okay, okay.
- Okay.

309
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:35,143
- One, two.
- One, two.

310
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:42,318
You want me to kill myself
and you're not going to.

311
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:45,488
- You suck. You suck.
- You suck.

312
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:53,433
Hey, Stewie, there's something
thunking around in the trunk of my car...

313
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,700
and I can't get in there
'cause somebody busted the lock.

314
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,469
You have any idea what that's about?

315
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,272
That. It's this whole...

316
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:03,437
It's this whole crazy thing.

317
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,883
Hey, this is not a barn, young lady.

318
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:11,850
I'm just so exhausted.

319
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:14,958
You know, I thought I'd be happy
being with NeiI, but I'm not.

320
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,118
This is horrible.

321
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:19,061
Sweetheart, we'll figure some way
to get you out of this.

322
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:21,166
Brian, did you find any loophole
in the contract?

323
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,528
Nope, it's airtight.

324
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,761
The only way out
is if NeiI commits an infidelity.

325
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,998
Well, that's it then.
We got to find somebody to seduce NeiI.

326
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,974
- Who, me?
- Well, if not you, Lois, then who?

327
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:32,566
Beverly D'Angelo?

328
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:34,236
'Cause I don't think she'd do it.

329
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:36,177
And I don't even know
how to get ahold of her.

330
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,018
Hello, LaDawn.

331
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,021
Listen, I certainly hope you'll excuse
last night's indiscretion.

332
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,388
It was just... Oh, my God, LaDawn!
What's that on your neck?

333
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:56,159
Lois! Thank God you're here, Lois.

334
00:18:56,268 --> 00:19:00,068
It was all her friends.
They were doing marijuana and heroin.

335
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,936
And they were taking eczema
and touching each other.

336
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,373
- LaDawn, wake up this instant.
- What?

337
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:08,242
- I don't-
- You know what? Don't bother, LaDawn.

338
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:09,405
You are fired.

339
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:13,017
Well, I really don't know
how this happened...

340
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,211
but I guess this is the last time
I get to see you.

341
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,386
I'm gonna miss you, little guy.

342
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:20,691
This is for you.

343
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,126
She made me a mix tape.

344
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:27,596
Oh, dear God, what have I done?
I've made a terrible mistake.

345
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,227
LaDawn! LaDawn!

346
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:35,138
LaDawn!

347
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:37,934
all right, you all set, honey?

348
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:40,944
I can't believe I'm doing this.
It's so disgusting.

349
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:42,479
But it's for my little girI.

350
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,310
Dad, how do you know NeiI will show up?

351
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,783
Don't worry, Meg.
I sent him an invitation he couldn't refuse.

352
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:57,589
Strange. These conventions
usually have Segway parking.

353
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,155
Hello? Am I too late for the Q&A?

354
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:05,565
Yeah, but you're just in time for the T&A.

355
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,202
Mrs. Griffin, what are you-

356
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,741
You can call me Mystique.

357
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:13,674
Mrs. Griffin, this is wrong.

358
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:16,077
Well, well, well, look at this, Meg.

359
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:19,275
Your boyfriend is violating
both your contract and my wife.

360
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:23,946
Meg, I wasn't doing anything.
Mrs. Griffin was just... You're bending it.

361
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,080
I don't care.

362
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,284
You've nullified the contract. I'm free!

363
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:30,086
Free?

364
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:33,754
I don't understand, Meg.
You don't want to be my girlfriend?

365
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:36,800
Well, I thought I did.
But I guess I was just jealous.

366
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:37,891
I see.

367
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:41,166
Well, Meg, I want you to be with me
because you want to be with me...

368
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,002
not because you have to.

369
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,374
Thank you, NeiI.

370
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:48,010
Cecilia, it's The Goldman.

371
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:49,910
How about we fire up the old Segway...

372
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:52,677
and find a nice quiet field
to do long division in?

373
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:57,016
I mean, a nice quiet field
in which to do long division. Sorry.

374
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,756
Sorry, everybody.

375
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:00,085
Okay, I'm on my way.

376
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:04,151
He's going back to Cecilia?
I can't believe I'm actually jealous.

377
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,254
I can't believe I actually touched him.

378
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,526
I still can't believe it's not butter.

379
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,432
Next week I run for mayor of Quahog.

380
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,902
Do I have what it takes?
We'll find out. Don't miss it.

381
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:27,480
Well, here we are again.
Another Saturday night with basic cable.

382
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:29,811
Yep.

383
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:33,523
I suppose neither of us
is really cut out for love, and we...

384
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,025
Oh, my God! Jeremy's still in the trunk!

385
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,595
Oh, God, how long has it been?

386
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:40,494
Let's see. Two weeks. Yep.

387
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:42,563
Yeah, he's dead.

388
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:44,867
Definitely dead.
