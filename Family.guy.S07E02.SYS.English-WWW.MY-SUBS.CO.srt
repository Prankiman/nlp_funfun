1
00:00:04,844 --> 00:00:10,870
Family Guy 7x02
I dream of Jesus

2
00:00:12,871 --> 00:00:16,720
made by reaper

3
00:00:24,844 --> 00:00:31,871
You know kids, there's a lot of history here. This 50's dinos were very popular in the 80's.

4
00:00:30,871 --> 00:00:32,482
Boy, I'm gonna enjoy this meal.

5
00:00:32,483 --> 00:00:35,952
Not like last night when I didn't have time to poop before the guests arrived.

6
00:00:36,532 --> 00:00:38,972
Left time? You know what, I'm gonna go for it.

7
00:00:38,973 --> 00:00:44,932
Son of a bitch! Looks like I have to pile dinner on top of... HEY GUYS HOW ARE YE!

8
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:48,802
Look at  this place. They don't serve any of this 1950-food anymore.

9
00:00:48,803 --> 00:00:55,039
Hamburgers, french fries, cokes. He-he, you kids don't know what I'm talking about.

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,488
I love how service looks like stars from the 50's.

11
00:00:58,773 --> 00:01:04,838
Marilyn Monroe. Elvis. And look there's James Dean after the accident.

12
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:07,569
Can I tell you about tonights specials?

13
00:01:08,223 --> 00:01:10,349
Oh, look, Cleveland finally made it.

14
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,079
Oh, hey there Griffins.

15
00:01:14,214 --> 00:01:16,313
Oh, that takes me back.

16
00:01:19,332 --> 00:01:21,068
Hey! What are you, a robot?

17
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:24,628
No son. It's the 1950's and I have polio.

18
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:27,091
Wow, I've never heared of that before.

19
00:01:27,092 --> 00:01:32,734
Oh yeah Chris. Poilo back then was like AIDS today. Except people who have polio get in to heaven.

20
00:01:36,377 --> 00:01:41,733
Oh my God! This is Surfin' Bird by The Thrashmen. This is my favorite song of all time.

21
00:01:54,927 --> 00:01:57,226
Chris don't you know about the bird?

22
00:01:57,227 --> 00:01:59,621
Meg, everybody knows that the bird is the word!

23
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:04,445
Hey, the guy behind the counter, the bird is the word!

24
00:02:04,446 --> 00:02:06,910
Hey, frightened little child, the bird is the word.

25
00:02:06,911 --> 00:02:09,337
Lady on the toilet, the bird is the word.

26
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,769
Hey, don't you know about the bird?

27
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,206
Sure, everybody knows that the bird is the word.

28
00:02:17,495 --> 00:02:19,416
I get it, I get it, I love repetition.

29
00:02:21,852 --> 00:02:23,116
Hey what the big idea?

30
00:02:23,117 --> 00:02:26,195
This song from the 1960's, it shouldn't be in this jukebox.

31
00:02:26,196 --> 00:02:28,556
Wait wait! Can I have that record? I love that song.

32
00:02:28,557 --> 00:02:31,022
I'll let you have sex with my daughter.

33
00:02:31,023 --> 00:02:33,215
I don't know, let's see what you daughter looks like.

34
00:02:33,216 --> 00:02:37,048
She's... er... right there.

35
00:02:38,429 --> 00:02:42,207
Okay. I'll do her. But can you tell her to cry and beg me to stop?

36
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,839
I think this can be arranged.

37
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:54,258
Peter will you give this song a rest? It've been playing since we've got home.

38
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:56,897
No way Lois, it's my new favorite thing in the world.

39
00:02:56,898 --> 00:02:57,480
Argh...

40
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,791
Lois... I'm gonna ask you this only once

41
00:03:01,792 --> 00:03:06,504
Do you or do you not know about the bird?

42
00:03:06,505 --> 00:03:07,487
Oh God!

43
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:09,826
'Cause everybody's heared that the bird is the word...

44
00:03:15,516 --> 00:03:16,095
Aw...

45
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,101
Oh God! Sorry, sorry, sorry.

46
00:03:18,102 --> 00:03:20,070
Look, just go to sleep all right?

47
00:03:35,705 --> 00:03:37,698
Peter, I have a mammogramm in the morning.

48
00:03:42,383 --> 00:03:43,932
Brian, can I see this paper for a sec?

49
00:03:46,133 --> 00:03:49,665
Huh... That's odd I thought that would be big news.

50
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,148
You thought what would be big news?

51
00:03:51,149 --> 00:03:55,542
Well there seems to be an absence of a certain onophylogical piece.

52
00:03:55,543 --> 00:04:00,678
A headline regarding mass awareness of a certain avion variety

53
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:01,780
What are you talking about?

54
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:02,982
Oh, have you not heared?

55
00:04:02,983 --> 00:04:05,558
It was my understanding that everyone have heared.

56
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:06,728
Heared what?
Brian, don't!

57
00:04:16,463 --> 00:04:18,827
Brian don't you know about the bird?

58
00:04:18,828 --> 00:04:21,301
Well, Peter's gonna tell you about the bird.

59
00:04:36,983 --> 00:04:38,374
Oh my God! Peter are you all right?

60
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,582
Peter I was just at the bank and they told me you withdrew six thousand dollars cash from our savings.

61
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:02,403
That's almost everything we have! What the hell was it for?

62
00:05:02,404 --> 00:05:07,416
I bought some local TV air time, Lois, and I did a public service announcement of vital importance.

63
00:05:08,293 --> 00:05:09,398
Thank you.

64
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,715
Hi. I'm Peter Griffin.

65
00:05:10,716 --> 00:05:15,396
You know there's an issue facing many americans today that are no concern a great number of us.

66
00:05:15,397 --> 00:05:20,735
According to Gallup polls one in twelve americans is unaware that the bird is the word.

67
00:05:20,736 --> 00:05:24,604
I for one dream of an America where everybody knows that the bird is the word.

68
00:05:30,074 --> 00:05:31,838
My God! It's agrossable.

69
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:33,925
Have the boys at the lab confirm this?

70
00:05:33,926 --> 00:05:38,375
Sir! Our math show that the bird is equal to or greater than the word.

71
00:05:38,376 --> 00:05:39,381
Sick(?) it again!

72
00:05:44,194 --> 00:05:46,043
Brian?
Yeah.

73
00:05:46,044 --> 00:05:48,531
I don't feel so good.

74
00:05:51,082 --> 00:05:52,984
All right, that's it! We gotta do something about this.

75
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,267
We have to get this record and destroy it.

76
00:05:55,268 --> 00:05:58,950
Just like that fat person surgery destroyed Star Jones' arms.

77
00:06:00,324 --> 00:06:03,394
I look so good. I lost almost weight.

78
00:06:03,395 --> 00:06:04,813
TAXI!

79
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:09,303
Coming to show to people how good I look.

80
00:06:41,147 --> 00:06:43,000
WHO!? DID IT!?

81
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:44,745
Who did what, pop?

82
00:06:44,746 --> 00:06:46,441
Yes Peter, what has you upset?

83
00:06:46,442 --> 00:06:49,159
Surfin' bird is gone!

84
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,009
I took it to bed, had sex with it. It fell asleep in my arms and this morning it's gone.

85
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,476
Well Peter, nobody here would steal from you.

86
00:06:55,477 --> 00:06:57,093
Oh, no one had a motive Lois?

87
00:06:57,094 --> 00:06:58,852
You all had a motive, every one here.

88
00:06:58,853 --> 00:07:01,163
You knew that I changed my will and left everything to the record.

89
00:07:01,164 --> 00:07:02,587
And that's why you wanted the record out of the way.

90
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:06,294
Meg wanted to get a passport for her twin sister to get her out of the country but the record wouldn't allow it.

91
00:07:06,295 --> 00:07:08,845
But Meg didn't count on me discover she has no twin sister.

92
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:11,309
And Meg itself was recently released from the sanitarium.

93
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,842
And that's where Chris came into the picture.

94
00:07:12,843 --> 00:07:14,812
So you got it all figured out, do you?

95
00:07:14,813 --> 00:07:17,084
You couldn't leave well enough(?) alone.

96
00:07:17,085 --> 00:07:19,421
You won't fire Chris, you don't got the stomach for it.

97
00:07:21,465 --> 00:07:23,644
I'm sorry dad, I've no idea what are you talking about.

98
00:07:23,645 --> 00:07:27,376
Well, it's sure is odd. A record doesn't just get up and walk away.

99
00:07:27,377 --> 00:07:29,481
Except for my old Allen Shaman record.

100
00:07:29,742 --> 00:07:32,539
If you ain't gonna play me, don't complain when I try to split.

101
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:36,458
There's a lot of jews out there still get a laugh of a "hello mother, hello father".

102
00:07:37,232 --> 00:07:40,150
Whoo, such heat this morning I don't need this jacket.

103
00:07:40,311 --> 00:07:44,170
Well, a hell with all of you. I'm going downtown and buy another copy of Surfin' Bird.

104
00:07:44,911 --> 00:07:48,015
Peter that's not necessary. I'm sure it'll turn up somewhere.

105
00:07:48,016 --> 00:07:49,400
I wouldn't count on it Lois.

106
00:09:01,989 --> 00:09:04,387
Do you have Surfin' Bird by The Thrashmen?

107
00:09:04,388 --> 00:09:08,454
No, I'm sorry. Dog and a baby came in and bought all 63 copies.

108
00:09:08,455 --> 00:09:11,457
Damn it, this is third used record store with the same story.

109
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:16,008
You are... You look familiar. Do I, do I know you?

110
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:18,253
Did you go into North Providence high school?

111
00:09:18,254 --> 00:09:18,681
No.

112
00:09:18,682 --> 00:09:21,028
You friends with Gary who owns a drycleaners?

113
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:21,623
No.

114
00:09:22,524 --> 00:09:23,705
Are you Jesus Christ?

115
00:09:23,706 --> 00:09:24,276
No...

116
00:09:24,277 --> 00:09:27,315
Oh my God! You are, you Jesus Christ!

117
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:30,095
No, I'm not. I'm just the guy working at a record store.

118
00:09:30,096 --> 00:09:35,212
Huh! Well if you're not Jesus Christ, then you won't mind if I pee on this Amy Grant CD's.

119
00:09:35,213 --> 00:09:35,711
Don't...

120
00:09:35,712 --> 00:09:37,147
Aha, you are Jesus.

121
00:09:37,148 --> 00:09:38,794
Yes. I am.

122
00:09:38,795 --> 00:09:43,280
Oh my God! Jesus Christ, the Messiah, you've returned.

123
00:09:43,281 --> 00:09:45,351
You've returned to bring us the good word!

124
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:46,344
What word?

125
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:05,317
Jesus Christ has returned to Earth. I can't believe it.

126
00:10:05,318 --> 00:10:06,393
The Second Coming.

127
00:10:06,394 --> 00:10:08,723
Will you keep it down? It's not the second coming.

128
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:10,550
Okay, so what are you doing here?

129
00:10:10,551 --> 00:10:13,939
Well, believe it or not, I pop in every hundred years or so.

130
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,611
Kinda incognito. Just to get away from the family.

131
00:10:16,612 --> 00:10:20,820
Plus the timing seem good, 'cause my dad just quit smoking and is a little on edge.

132
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:26,984
Who took my checkbook? Helen! Why is there pencap and no pen?

133
00:10:26,985 --> 00:10:29,927
You're the first person to reckognize me in two thousand years.

134
00:10:29,928 --> 00:10:33,180
You seem like a nice guy. Won't you come over to my house for dinner tonight?

135
00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:35,086
Okay. But I don't get off until 7.

136
00:10:35,087 --> 00:10:40,324
Great! We'll have a blast. After we eat we can watch that youtube footage of Milly Metlin calling moviephone.

137
00:10:40,325 --> 00:10:44,233
Please say the name of the movie you'd like to see NOW.

138
00:10:44,234 --> 00:10:45,787
De nast memty.

139
00:10:45,788 --> 00:10:47,759
I'm sorry I didn't catch that.

140
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,363
Please say the name of the movie you'd like to see NOW.

141
00:10:51,364 --> 00:10:53,810
De nast memty.

142
00:10:53,811 --> 00:10:56,272
You have selected Three Hundred.

143
00:10:56,273 --> 00:10:59,997
If this is the movie you'd like to see, say yes NOW.

144
00:10:59,998 --> 00:11:00,843
NO!

145
00:11:00,844 --> 00:11:03,714
You have confirmed Three Hundred.

146
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:12,656
Wow! Jesus Christ at our dinner table. I still can't get over it.

147
00:11:12,657 --> 00:11:14,678
I'm actually glad you're all here tonight.

148
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:17,635
I wanted tell you that one of you will betray me.

149
00:11:19,186 --> 00:11:19,867
Just kidding.

150
00:11:19,868 --> 00:11:23,279
He's doing this thing he did in this story book.

151
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,686
So Jesus finish that story you were telling us.

152
00:11:25,687 --> 00:11:30,764
Oh, all right. So there I was. They just beaten me senseless. Stuck thorns in my head.

153
00:11:30,765 --> 00:11:35,423
Nailed me to the piece of wood. Showed the spunch full of vinegar in my mouth and killed me.

154
00:11:35,424 --> 00:11:39,234
Then they put me into hole with a rock in front of it for two whole days.

155
00:11:39,235 --> 00:11:41,922
And come sunday BAM, I rise from the dead.

156
00:11:41,923 --> 00:11:45,046
Okay, that's a naughty weekend but I can trump it.

157
00:11:45,047 --> 00:11:48,426
So me and Cleveland and Joe are just wrecked on certain comfort right?

158
00:11:48,427 --> 00:11:52,088
We know we gonna puke but Joe says
"Hey let's see Chronicles of Riddick"

159
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:56,926
Sat through the whole thing without puke and when I get home wouldn't you know I lost my glasses.

160
00:11:56,927 --> 00:11:59,619
Huh? Peter 1 - Jesus 0

161
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:04,349
Ah, you know Jesus if I go get myself on, would you mind talking to my friend Neil Goldman?

162
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:07,046
I really just want to rub her jewish nose in this.

163
00:12:07,047 --> 00:12:10,652
All right, I'll be the one to say it. How do we know you really Jesus?

164
00:12:10,653 --> 00:12:11,890
Can you perform miracles?

165
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:14,060
Sure. How about this?

166
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:19,046
Oh boy! Sundays!
I love you Jesus.

167
00:12:19,047 --> 00:12:20,851
I love you too fella.

168
00:12:20,852 --> 00:12:22,670
Hey Jesus can you do something for me?

169
00:12:22,671 --> 00:12:24,000
Sure Peter, what is it?

170
00:12:33,168 --> 00:12:36,578
Say listen Jesus, I know you try to keep a low profile but

171
00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:39,038
there's one person I really want you to meet.

172
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,158
Oh yeah, who's that?

173
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:45,194
The american people may have turned against the war but I answer to a higher power.

174
00:12:45,195 --> 00:12:48,280
I answer to a power of Jesus Christ.

175
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:51,525
Oh, that's funny, because I happen to have Jesus Christ right here.

176
00:12:51,526 --> 00:12:55,135
I've heared what you're saying. You know nothing of my work.

177
00:12:55,136 --> 00:12:58,264
How you ever got to be president of anything is totally amazing.

178
00:12:58,265 --> 00:13:00,378
Wouldn't it be great if life will like this?

179
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,458
Hey listen Jesus, thanks for coming by tonight and hanging out with us.

180
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:08,667
You may look like bum but you've got a lot of talent, young man.

181
00:13:08,668 --> 00:13:11,682
Yeah, I've forgot how great it is interacting with other people.

182
00:13:11,683 --> 00:13:14,884
Well, I better get some sleep, I gotta open the store tomorrow.

183
00:13:14,885 --> 00:13:18,191
Ah, you don't wanna get back to that record store. You gotta get back out there.

184
00:13:18,192 --> 00:13:20,125
Color an eggs and hide them for kids.

185
00:13:20,126 --> 00:13:22,958
What? You mean reveal myself?

186
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:28,766
Absolutely. This world needs you, Jesus. It needs you like the guy who can't get it up needs a distraction.

187
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:33,811
I'm so ready to have sex with you. Oh, is that my phone?

188
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,243
I don't hear anything.

189
00:13:35,244 --> 00:13:36,770
Is that John Aston?

190
00:13:36,771 --> 00:13:38,355
I don't see anyone out there.

191
00:13:38,356 --> 00:13:41,262
Oh, well now, there's so much going on.

192
00:13:41,805 --> 00:13:44,782
You know you're right, Peter. It may be time. But how do we do it?

193
00:13:45,096 --> 00:13:52,264
Everyone, may I have your attention please. I would like to introduce you to the one, the only... Jesus Christ.

194
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:55,801
That's right. That's Jesus Christ. Right here.

195
00:13:56,979 --> 00:13:59,103
Jesus Christ
Yeah right.

196
00:13:59,491 --> 00:14:03,557
Look at these idiots, they don't even listening. You know what, we gotta prove it to them.

197
00:14:03,558 --> 00:14:07,337
Listen, I'm gonna go to that supermarket and get some water and you gonna turn it into wine.

198
00:14:07,338 --> 00:14:10,359
Okay, cool. Can you get me a Cracked magazine?

199
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,163
Cracked?

200
00:14:11,361 --> 00:14:11,529
Yeah.

201
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:14,803
Jesus Christ unbelieveable. All right, I'll be back.

202
00:14:18,573 --> 00:14:19,410
Ah, crap!

203
00:14:19,411 --> 00:14:20,428
Don't worry, I'll get it.

204
00:14:27,038 --> 00:14:31,858
Ah... Woo... Oh my god... Jesus...
It's Jesus Christ...

205
00:14:31,859 --> 00:14:35,571
And his best pal Peter, ah-ah... wow...

206
00:14:42,543 --> 00:14:43,960
15 minutes Mr. Christ.

207
00:14:43,961 --> 00:14:47,993
Wow, Jesus, can you believe you gonna get to meet Jay Leno.

208
00:14:47,994 --> 00:14:55,291
Mom, why is it there when Jesus revealed himself to the world, he become famous and when I did, I've got suspended for 5 days.

209
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:59,226
You know, I ove this all to you Peter. You game me the confidence I needed.

210
00:14:59,227 --> 00:15:02,380
Ah, never mind about that pal. You just go out and knock 'em dead.

211
00:15:02,381 --> 00:15:04,599
Now, who are you?
Jesus Christ.

212
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,387
Who are you?!
Jesus Christ!

213
00:15:06,388 --> 00:15:08,138
WHO ARE YOU?!!
JESUS CHRIST!!!

214
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:08,793
NOW GO GET 'EM!!!

215
00:15:09,118 --> 00:15:14,679
My face again to Dave Coulier. Season 3 of Full House is out on DVD March 5th.

216
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,783
My next guest died for our sins and now it looks like he's back on the scene.

217
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:21,882
Please welcome from the Bible, Jesus Christ. Oh, Jesus.

218
00:15:27,546 --> 00:15:29,202
Oh well, Jesus, welcome to the show.

219
00:15:29,203 --> 00:15:30,702
Thanks Jay, glad to be here.

220
00:15:30,703 --> 00:15:32,921
So, Jesus, so what've you been doing since you been back?

221
00:15:32,922 --> 00:15:37,805
Oh, you know kinda buming around, playing a little color duty for even a lot of pinkberry.

222
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:41,392
blah-blah-blah

223
00:15:41,393 --> 00:15:43,377
I've been sampling the night life out here.

224
00:15:43,378 --> 00:15:47,608
I raised River Fenix from the dead then we went out to the viperome and DOD again.

225
00:15:47,609 --> 00:15:52,632
blah-blah-blah

226
00:15:52,633 --> 00:15:55,682
Jesus Christ everybody. Will be right back with Jess Stone.

227
00:15:59,909 --> 00:16:05,673
Did you see that? He made Jay Leno laugh. This guy is gonna be huge.

228
00:16:20,232 --> 00:16:24,058
Now back to the MTV Movie Awards hosted by Dane Cook.

229
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:29,685
Hey everybody watsup? Dane Cook here indahaus. At the MTV Movie Awards. Watsup, watsup.

230
00:16:29,686 --> 00:16:32,712
Hey you know what I hate? When you eat an ice cream cone and it's all like cold.

231
00:16:34,402 --> 00:16:36,905
And you like "Why didn't you warn me that it's so cold?"

232
00:16:36,906 --> 00:16:38,611
And he's like "It's ice cream, dude".

233
00:16:38,612 --> 00:16:42,122
And you like "Oh, man". But chicks don't do this because they use a spoon.

234
00:16:42,123 --> 00:16:45,489
Argh. Watsup. Sufight. Poo. MySpace.

235
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,230
Is he saying something funny?

236
00:16:47,231 --> 00:16:50,136
I don't know but he's moving around a lot, so I guess.

237
00:16:50,137 --> 00:16:52,414
Ha-hah. He was on the internet Neumann college. Ha-hah.

238
00:16:52,415 --> 00:16:57,909
And now to present the award for sickest unscreen gangsta pimpbound breathness...

239
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,556
Jesus Christ and the pussycat dolls.

240
00:17:04,807 --> 00:17:07,438
Hey Jesus. That's my buddy Jesus.

241
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:14,762
Boy. Who would have thought, me, Peter Griffin, the guy you just two weeks ago drew a smily face on his own testicle to make his son laugh.

242
00:17:15,926 --> 00:17:19,069
Well, I've lost my trained thought. But yeah, that's my buddy Jesus.

243
00:17:19,363 --> 00:17:23,085
Hey, It's a pleasure to be here with you, six interchangeable women.

244
00:17:23,213 --> 00:17:26,694
Last time I was down here on earth I only hung around with one whore.

245
00:17:36,711 --> 00:17:38,631
C'mon guys, let's head over to my crib.

246
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,702
Hey, you guys mind scooting over around a little bit?

247
00:17:41,703 --> 00:17:44,559
Oh, sorry Peter, doesn't look like there any room.

248
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,344
What? What do you mean?

249
00:17:46,345 --> 00:17:49,524
Well, there's only one space left and I promised it to that cow.

250
00:17:49,525 --> 00:17:55,493
This is gonna be so much fun. I'm gonna stick my head out the sunroof and wave my arms "Whoo, I'm in Hollywood!"

251
00:17:56,846 --> 00:17:59,892
Whoo, I'm in Hollywood! Gee, I've said I'll do it.

252
00:18:03,797 --> 00:18:06,324
Peter, would you put that thing away, we're trying to eat dinner.

253
00:18:06,325 --> 00:18:10,198
I can't believe Jesus hasn't call me back. I left him a message like 4 hours ago.

254
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:12,189
Well, maybe he doesn't have his phone with him.

255
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,850
No, no, I rang twice and then a voice mail picked up.

256
00:18:14,851 --> 00:18:17,790
If it gone straight to voice mail that means the phone was off.

257
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:21,650
If I rang like 6 times that means he didn't hear it but I rang twice Lois.

258
00:18:21,651 --> 00:18:26,608
That means a phone rang, he saw it was me and then he pressed a button and sent it straight to voice mail.

259
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:28,732
You know what, give me your phone, I bet he'll pick up.

260
00:18:30,441 --> 00:18:32,251
Hehey Lois.

261
00:18:32,252 --> 00:18:35,872
Hey you. It's Peter. What the hell we were supposed to do something today.

262
00:18:35,873 --> 00:18:40,294
Ah... Forgot to tell you, I've a doctor's appointment today, I'm actually there now.

263
00:18:40,295 --> 00:18:42,755
Hey look, Lindsay Lohan took her top off.

264
00:18:42,756 --> 00:18:46,722
Heeey, I've just drink a beer, who wants to do me?

265
00:18:46,723 --> 00:18:50,041
I do.
Me too.
I just did you, but I'll go again.

266
00:18:50,042 --> 00:18:50,748
I gotta go.

267
00:18:50,749 --> 00:18:53,568
Can you believe the way Jesus has treatened me?

268
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:55,102
I thought he was my friend.

269
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,566
Fame and success do crazy things to people Peter.

270
00:18:58,567 --> 00:19:01,836
I'm sure deep down he's still the same old Jesus.

271
00:19:01,837 --> 00:19:04,306
He may just need to figure that out in his own way.

272
00:19:04,307 --> 00:19:06,741
Maybe. But one thing is for sure Lois.

273
00:19:06,742 --> 00:19:11,537
None of this would have happen if somebody haven't stolen my fucking Surfin' Bird record!!!

274
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:20,060
Tonights top story: Local record shop employee Jesus Christ was found

275
00:19:20,061 --> 00:19:23,468
in Mary-Kate Olsons apartment this morning face down and unconcious.

276
00:19:23,469 --> 00:19:27,367
Police revived and arrested disoriented Jesus who was quoted to saying:

277
00:19:27,368 --> 00:19:30,570
"Jews are responsible for all the world's wars"

278
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:32,595
Brian, you think that's our Jesus?

279
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:35,492
Griffins residence, Peter speaking.

280
00:19:36,548 --> 00:19:38,495
Oh yeah?.. Why should I?..

281
00:19:39,658 --> 00:19:42,650
Yeah, well, get someone else to bail you out, 'cause it ain't gonna be me.

282
00:19:44,096 --> 00:19:46,008
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do about it?

283
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:48,476
All right, I'm coming.

284
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:59,282
Jesus Christ look at you. You've had it all: money, fame, eternal life. And you blew it. You let it all go to your head.

285
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:03,801
I know Peter. I guess it turns out I'm just as human as anyone else.

286
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:06,374
Yeah, well, what are do now?

287
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,498
You want the truth? I think it's time for me to go.

288
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,612
This world's not ready for me yet and I'm not ready for it.

289
00:20:12,613 --> 00:20:17,984
I don't know. Maybe I'll try coming back in another thousand years when I'm a little more mature.

290
00:20:17,985 --> 00:20:21,224
Well, that's a very mature thing to say right there.

291
00:20:21,225 --> 00:20:22,788
I think you're on your way.

292
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,310
Well, before I go Peter, there's something I wanna give you.

293
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:28,884
Hold out your hands.

294
00:20:36,122 --> 00:20:39,005
Well, I guess that's it then. Jesus is gone.

295
00:20:39,006 --> 00:20:41,130
I sure am gonna miss him.

296
00:20:41,131 --> 00:20:44,514
Me too. Also he did give me something right before he disappeared.

297
00:20:44,882 --> 00:20:45,445
What?

298
00:20:45,446 --> 00:20:47,311
Something very special Lois.

299
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:48,417
What is it dad?

300
00:20:48,418 --> 00:20:49,508
What? You haven't heared?

301
00:20:49,509 --> 00:20:50,257
Crap!
