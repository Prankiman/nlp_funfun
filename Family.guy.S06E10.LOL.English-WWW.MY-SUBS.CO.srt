3
00:00:34,306 --> 00:00:36,682
Um, Mom, Dad, um,

4
00:00:36,683 --> 00:00:39,824
I decided I want a big party
this year with all my friends.

5
00:00:39,825 --> 00:00:42,428
And maybe a band. Is that cool?

6
00:00:42,556 --> 00:00:45,569
- Yeah, sure...
- Yeah, sure. Why not?

7
00:00:45,702 --> 00:00:48,165
Oh, thanks, guys! You're the best!

8
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:50,892
What's she talking about?
A party for what?

9
00:00:50,897 --> 00:00:53,980
I don't know. She have her period
or something? She getting married?

10
00:00:53,983 --> 00:00:55,461
No. If she was getting married,

11
00:00:55,461 --> 00:00:57,441
we probably would've seen
a guy around, right?

12
00:00:57,448 --> 00:00:59,277
- Sound reasoning.
- You guys,

13
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:01,703
it's Meg's birthday next week.

14
00:01:01,716 --> 00:01:05,221
Oh, my God, it is!
Peter, we got to put together a party!

15
00:01:05,225 --> 00:01:07,631
Ah, man, I hate kids' birthday parties.

16
00:01:07,638 --> 00:01:10,472
This is gonna be worse than that time
I was stuck behind Robert Loggia

17
00:01:10,485 --> 00:01:11,513
at the airport.

18
00:01:11,516 --> 00:01:14,401
- May I have your name, please?
- Robert Loggia.

19
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:18,360
- Can you spell that for me?
- Certainly. That's Robert Loggia.

20
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:21,052
"R" as in Robert Loggia,

21
00:01:21,057 --> 00:01:24,701
"O" as in "Oh, my God,
it's Robert Loggia,"

22
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:28,370
"B" as in "By God, that's Robert Loggia,"

23
00:01:28,377 --> 00:01:32,350
"E" as in everybody loves Robert Loggia,

24
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:35,480
"R" as in Robert Loggia,

25
00:01:35,548 --> 00:01:39,412
"T" as in "Tim, look over there,
it's Robert Loggia,"

26
00:01:39,448 --> 00:01:40,752
space,

27
00:01:40,807 --> 00:01:44,162
"L" as in "Look, it's Robert Loggia..."

28
00:01:49,298 --> 00:01:51,103
- Here you are, Brian.
- What's this?

29
00:01:51,106 --> 00:01:53,930
It's an invitation to Meg's party.
I'm the party planner.

30
00:01:53,936 --> 00:01:56,592
You have to RSVP.
You can do it right now if you want.

31
00:01:56,607 --> 00:01:58,320
All right, fine,
I'll come to Meg's party.

32
00:01:58,325 --> 00:02:00,843
No, you have to call the RSVP line.

33
00:02:00,957 --> 00:02:03,602
- You got to be kidding me.
- I'm waiting.

34
00:02:04,338 --> 00:02:06,592
Ring, ring.

35
00:02:06,886 --> 00:02:08,392
Aren't you gonna pick it up?

36
00:02:08,398 --> 00:02:11,262
No, I'm not gonna pick it up
on the first few rings. I'm busy.

37
00:02:11,267 --> 00:02:12,863
Maybe I'm in the other room.

38
00:02:12,907 --> 00:02:14,382
Ring, ring.

39
00:02:15,157 --> 00:02:16,693
Ring, ring.

40
00:02:17,827 --> 00:02:19,423
Ring, ring.

41
00:02:20,547 --> 00:02:22,771
- Ring... Oh, come on!
- Hello!

42
00:02:22,786 --> 00:02:24,802
- Stewie?
- No, this is Stewie's housekeeper,

43
00:02:24,805 --> 00:02:26,532
Mrs. Pennyapple. I'll see if he's in.

44
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,160
Stewie! Stewie!

45
00:02:28,226 --> 00:02:30,722
- Yes, Mrs. Pennyapple?
- You've got a telephone call.

46
00:02:30,728 --> 00:02:32,102
- Who is it?
- He didn't say.

47
00:02:32,117 --> 00:02:33,952
- Well, find out, would you?
- Who is this?

48
00:02:33,956 --> 00:02:35,613
- It's Brian.
- It's Brian!

49
00:02:35,616 --> 00:02:38,591
Oh, Brian. Probably RSVPing
about Megan's party.

50
00:02:38,597 --> 00:02:40,112
- Hello, Brian.
- Hi, Stewie.

51
00:02:40,117 --> 00:02:42,313
- What can I do for you?
- I'm coming to Meg's party.

52
00:02:42,317 --> 00:02:44,930
Oh, splendid. Just give your
information to Mrs. Pennyapple.

53
00:02:44,937 --> 00:02:48,361
Hello, it's Mrs. Pennyapple again.
Shall I put you down for two, Brendan?

54
00:02:48,365 --> 00:02:49,503
- Brian.
- Ryan?

55
00:02:49,508 --> 00:02:50,622
- Brian!
- Mitchell?

56
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:51,932
- What?
- Good-bye.

57
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:55,472
Hey, Lois, I'm ordering a birthday cake,

58
00:02:55,478 --> 00:02:58,571
and the guy wants to know how old
Meg is. I didn't know what to tell him.

59
00:02:58,575 --> 00:03:00,581
- You're asking me?
- Yeah. How old is Meg?

60
00:03:00,588 --> 00:03:02,793
- I don't know.
- Well, my God, Lois,

61
00:03:02,805 --> 00:03:04,713
I thought you were the one
keeping track of that.

62
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:06,581
No, no. I have no idea.

63
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:09,282
Don't you remember me faking
my way through her last birthday?

64
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:13,933
<i>You are hmm-hmm.
Going on hmm-hmm.</i>

65
00:03:13,948 --> 00:03:16,873
<i>Fellas will fall in line...</i>

66
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,252
Should we...

67
00:03:18,345 --> 00:03:21,202
Should we just ask her how old she is?

68
00:03:21,207 --> 00:03:22,361
That, uh...

69
00:03:22,366 --> 00:03:23,921
that'd be kind of awkward, huh?

70
00:03:23,925 --> 00:03:26,883
Hey, maybe we should just cut off
her leg and count the rings.

71
00:03:27,056 --> 00:03:29,831
Yeah. Or maybe try carbon dating.

72
00:03:30,327 --> 00:03:31,913
I don't know what that is.

73
00:03:31,915 --> 00:03:34,151
You know, we're gonna have
to talk to her

74
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:37,960
and kind of steer the conversation
in a way that gets her to spill it.

75
00:03:38,638 --> 00:03:39,711
Come in.

76
00:03:39,715 --> 00:03:41,972
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hey, Meg.

77
00:03:41,977 --> 00:03:45,213
So, Meg, your birthday's coming up, huh?

78
00:03:45,218 --> 00:03:47,440
You excited about turning...

79
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:51,823
Uh, Meg,

80
00:03:51,827 --> 00:03:55,090
I got 16 candles for your birthday cake.

81
00:03:55,096 --> 00:03:57,803
- How does that sound?
- That's not right.

82
00:03:57,806 --> 00:03:59,893
So... less...?

83
00:04:00,326 --> 00:04:03,940
More...?
Too many...?

84
00:04:04,105 --> 00:04:06,873
- Not enough?
- You stupid son of a bitch!

85
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,741
You didn't even know how old I am!

86
00:04:08,755 --> 00:04:12,153
Meg, that kind of language is not
appropriate for a girl your age.

87
00:04:12,487 --> 00:04:17,123
- Or is it?
- I'm gonna be 17, you jerks!

88
00:04:18,155 --> 00:04:20,183
She's the jerk.

89
00:04:23,985 --> 00:04:26,700
All right, come on in, everybody.
Have a seat anywhere.

90
00:04:26,705 --> 00:04:29,033
Meg's gonna open her
presents in a little bit.

91
00:04:29,106 --> 00:04:32,372
Oh, Francis,
I'm glad you could make it.

92
00:04:32,377 --> 00:04:34,153
Here! This for Megan!

93
00:04:34,156 --> 00:04:36,821
- Oh. What is it?
- It's a cookie

94
00:04:36,826 --> 00:04:40,822
- from lunch period at the home!
- Well, I'm sure she'll love this.

95
00:04:40,826 --> 00:04:42,530
I want to see her eat it!

96
00:04:42,537 --> 00:04:44,883
So the man asks the bartender
to recommend a good drink.

97
00:04:44,887 --> 00:04:47,931
The bartender says, "A Grasshopper."
So the guy orders a Grasshopper.

98
00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:49,901
Then he's walking home
and along the way,

99
00:04:49,907 --> 00:04:51,752
he notices a grasshopper on the ground.

100
00:04:51,755 --> 00:04:53,413
So he says to the grasshopper : "Hey,

101
00:04:53,425 --> 00:04:55,223
you know there's a drink
named after you?"

102
00:04:55,236 --> 00:04:58,143
The grasshopper says :
"You mean there's a drink named Irving?"

103
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:04,562
So which one of you wants
to lose your virginity?

104
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,392
Mom, this party sucks!

105
00:05:06,398 --> 00:05:10,670
I mean, balloons? Pin the tail on
the donkey? I'm not five years old.

106
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:13,771
Meg, your father worked very
hard to put this party together.

107
00:05:13,777 --> 00:05:16,111
He says he's got a big surprise for you.

108
00:05:16,117 --> 00:05:20,070
Hey, kids, I'm Peepants,
the inebriated hobo clown.

109
00:05:20,077 --> 00:05:24,633
I'm an adorable tramp who wears found
clothing and eats out of your garbage can.

110
00:05:24,638 --> 00:05:27,483
A clown?! Dad, I'm 17!

111
00:05:27,487 --> 00:05:30,541
Meg, guess what Peepants
got you for your birthday.

112
00:05:30,547 --> 00:05:32,982
- A scarf.
- I don't want a scarf, Dad.

113
00:05:32,995 --> 00:05:36,332
Well, then how about...
a dozen scarves?!

114
00:05:42,357 --> 00:05:46,083
Peter, I don't think you're actually
supposed to swallow those.

115
00:05:52,155 --> 00:05:54,382
- Here you go, Meg.
- I don't want them!

116
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:55,590
Take them!

117
00:05:55,597 --> 00:05:58,243
Are my long john stied
to the end of those?

118
00:05:58,247 --> 00:05:59,702
- No.
- Oh, God.

119
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,663
Mom, can I just open my presents now?

120
00:06:12,668 --> 00:06:15,071
- All right, Meg.
- Thank you.

121
00:06:15,078 --> 00:06:17,633
- What the...?
- Let's see what else we've got here.

122
00:06:17,638 --> 00:06:21,132
The first season of
Sister, Sister on DVD?

123
00:06:21,135 --> 00:06:22,513
You're welcome.

124
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:25,790
Stewie, what are you doing?!
You can't open Meg's gifts!

125
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:28,710
These are mine, you hear me?
Mine!

126
00:06:28,718 --> 00:06:32,522
Oh, God, not the "mine" phase.
I've been dreading this day.

127
00:06:32,538 --> 00:06:34,310
I'm entitled to these things, Lois.

128
00:06:34,318 --> 00:06:38,132
Especially after I got shafted
by that Asian Santa at the mall.

129
00:06:38,138 --> 00:06:40,062
What you want?!
What you want for Christmas?!

130
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:42,643
I was thinking maybe
one of those old-timey...

131
00:06:42,648 --> 00:06:45,002
Too late! Take too long!
Sad Christmas!

132
00:06:45,006 --> 00:06:46,422
- What you want?!
- Fire truck!

133
00:06:46,427 --> 00:06:47,381
- What color?!
- Red!

134
00:06:47,388 --> 00:06:48,212
Next!

135
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,920
Peter, have you been drinking?

136
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:55,492
- Well, a little. It is a party.
- Take off that stupid costume!

137
00:06:55,595 --> 00:06:57,090
You look like a damn fool.

138
00:06:57,096 --> 00:07:01,022
Ah, Dad, you won't say that when
you see my grand unicycle finale.

139
00:07:01,028 --> 00:07:02,573
Everyone, I'll be right back.

140
00:07:02,585 --> 00:07:06,753
In the meantime, I leave you with
the musical stylings of Chris Griffin.

141
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:14,671
<i>I don't know what we're afraid of</i>

142
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:21,230
<i>Nothing would change if we made love</i>

143
00:07:21,653 --> 00:07:26,574
<i>So I'll be your friend</i>

144
00:07:28,411 --> 00:07:33,721
<i>And I'll be your lover...</i>

145
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,867
All right, this is gonna blow you guys...

146
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,131
- Grandpa!
- Oh, my God!

147
00:07:42,136 --> 00:07:44,421
- Is he breathing?
- Somebody call an ambulance!

148
00:07:44,426 --> 00:07:47,501
Uh, Lois, maybe you better
call two ambulances.

149
00:07:51,688 --> 00:07:53,111
How is he, Doctor?

150
00:07:53,115 --> 00:07:56,293
Mrs. Griffin, his internal injuries
were much too severe.

151
00:07:56,298 --> 00:07:58,673
I'd estimate he'll be dead
within the hour.

152
00:07:58,676 --> 00:08:01,121
Dad, I'm so sorry I broke all your ribs

153
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,581
and busted your spleen
and punctured your lung.

154
00:08:03,586 --> 00:08:06,192
I don't if you can hear me right now, but

155
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:07,733
I hope you know...

156
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:09,511
I love you, Dad.

157
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:10,831
Peter...

158
00:08:11,267 --> 00:08:12,831
come closer.

159
00:08:13,288 --> 00:08:15,962
There's something...
I need to say to you.

160
00:08:15,965 --> 00:08:17,943
I'm here, Dad. What is it?

161
00:08:17,975 --> 00:08:19,223
Peter...

162
00:08:19,785 --> 00:08:22,753
you're a fat, stinking drunk.

163
00:08:23,996 --> 00:08:27,032
Oh, my God, he's dead. He can't be dead.

164
00:08:27,037 --> 00:08:29,010
There's got to be something I can do.

165
00:08:29,027 --> 00:08:31,331
Maybe I'll bury him in the pet cemetery.

166
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:37,593
Okay, I'll bury him in
a regular cemetery.

167
00:08:41,825 --> 00:08:46,391
- I can't believe Grandpa's dead.
- Well, he did kind of treat us like crap,

168
00:08:46,395 --> 00:08:50,140
- but, yes, it is a tragedy.
- It is a tragedy.

169
00:08:50,148 --> 00:08:52,580
- Excuse us.
- Yeah, we'll be right back.

170
00:09:02,968 --> 00:09:05,242
- We're all gonna miss him.
- Tragic.

171
00:09:05,248 --> 00:09:06,873
You know what the worst part is?

172
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,680
All I wanted was for my dad
to tell me he loved me.

173
00:09:09,688 --> 00:09:12,461
But instead, he called me a fat,
stinking drunk.

174
00:09:12,465 --> 00:09:14,271
Those were his last words.

175
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:16,951
Well, I hate to side
with your father, Peter,

176
00:09:16,965 --> 00:09:19,671
but you do kind of drink a lot, and,

177
00:09:19,678 --> 00:09:22,610
you know, sometimes
it affects the people you love.

178
00:09:22,615 --> 00:09:24,643
Oh, my God. Lois, you're right.

179
00:09:24,645 --> 00:09:26,983
Booze made me fall down all those stairs.

180
00:09:26,987 --> 00:09:28,713
Booze killed my father.

181
00:09:28,718 --> 00:09:31,522
Well, from this day forward,
I, Peter Griffin,

182
00:09:31,526 --> 00:09:33,660
will never drink again.

183
00:09:37,297 --> 00:09:39,711
- Peter, what are you doing?
- Crack.

184
00:09:39,715 --> 00:09:42,791
- What the fuck?!
- Hey, at least I'm not drinking, Brian.

185
00:09:42,798 --> 00:09:46,163
This isn't exactly a good substitute.
Where'd you get crack?

186
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,621
- From blacks.
- What?

187
00:09:47,627 --> 00:09:50,482
Right behind Black's Hardware Store.
There's a white guy selling it.

188
00:09:50,488 --> 00:09:52,842
Doing crack is not the way
to stop drinking.

189
00:09:52,848 --> 00:09:56,642
You need to get to the heart of why you
feel the need to drink in the first place.

190
00:09:56,648 --> 00:10:00,260
Look, here, this is the number of
a hypnotherapist I want you to see.

191
00:10:00,277 --> 00:10:02,373
- All right, Brian.
- Good.

192
00:10:06,967 --> 00:10:09,963
Peter, just thought I'd check on you.
Oh, my God!

193
00:10:09,968 --> 00:10:13,110
Gov'ment came and took my baby!

194
00:10:15,647 --> 00:10:19,982
This is mine, and this is mine,
and that's mine, and this is mine.

195
00:10:19,988 --> 00:10:21,433
Oh, what's this?

196
00:10:21,437 --> 00:10:25,541
"Hot Monogamy,
the board game for failing marriages."

197
00:10:25,716 --> 00:10:28,750
"Dare card : Have her do a strip tease

198
00:10:28,755 --> 00:10:31,882
and see how long
it takes you to get a bonner."

199
00:10:31,886 --> 00:10:33,410
What's a "bonner"?

200
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:36,143
Stewie, what are you doing
with my jewelry box?

201
00:10:36,148 --> 00:10:38,952
- You give that back to Mommy.
- No! Go to hell!

202
00:10:38,955 --> 00:10:43,242
Stewie, I have had just about enough
of this new selfish attitude of yours.

203
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:45,891
- Now, give that back to Mommy!
- Very well, then.

204
00:10:45,897 --> 00:10:49,001
- If I can't have it, nobody can!
- That is enough!

205
00:10:50,287 --> 00:10:53,743
- You... you struck me!
- Oh, my God.

206
00:10:53,955 --> 00:10:58,261
Stewie, honey, I am so sorry.
Are you okay, sweetie?

207
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:06,061
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Mommy would never hurt you.

208
00:11:06,068 --> 00:11:08,291
- Let me give you a hug.
- No!

209
00:11:10,885 --> 00:11:14,743
I haven't been this scared since
Mother Teresa OD'd in my car.

210
00:11:14,755 --> 00:11:16,340
She is messed up, man!

211
00:11:16,347 --> 00:11:18,572
Shut up! Just shut up!
Let me fucking think!

212
00:11:19,226 --> 00:11:21,251
- Push her out.
- We can't leave her alone.

213
00:11:21,257 --> 00:11:22,732
Push the bitch out!

214
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:30,793
Okay, now let's go back in
your mind to your childhood,

215
00:11:30,895 --> 00:11:35,133
- to some of your deepest memories.
- Yeah, I'm getting something.

216
00:11:36,136 --> 00:11:39,523
- Happy Father's Day, Dad.
- I'm not your father!

217
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,623
Oh, my God!

218
00:11:41,626 --> 00:11:44,502
Francis Griffin wasn't my real father!

219
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:46,523
I wonder what else I've repressed.

220
00:11:46,527 --> 00:11:48,213
Oh, my God!

221
00:11:48,226 --> 00:11:50,100
I could've had a V8.

222
00:11:52,726 --> 00:11:55,411
It was horrible, Rupert.
It was like a nightmare.

223
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:59,223
Lois came at me like a wild animal.
I had no way to defend myself.

224
00:11:59,546 --> 00:12:02,673
Mother, I'm sorry I went
against your wishes.

225
00:12:04,478 --> 00:12:07,793
I'm sorry I misbehaved, mother!
I'm sorry I misbehaved!

226
00:12:10,547 --> 00:12:12,390
I love you, Mommy Dearest!

227
00:12:17,648 --> 00:12:20,373
Oh, it was awful, Rupert.
I felt terrified and

228
00:12:20,376 --> 00:12:22,902
brutalized and humiliated and... and...

229
00:12:23,297 --> 00:12:25,081
and alive.

230
00:12:25,237 --> 00:12:28,611
My God, I...
I haven't felt that alive in years.

231
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:32,701
Rupert, you know, I think perhaps
I may be one of those people who...

232
00:12:32,848 --> 00:12:37,302
- gets a jolly out of being hit.
- Oh, Stewie, there you are.

233
00:12:37,308 --> 00:12:39,882
Mommy is so sorry she hit you.

234
00:12:39,886 --> 00:12:42,622
I promise I will never lay
a hand on you again.

235
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:45,803
Well, let's not make any rash decisions.
I mean, I did provoke you.

236
00:12:45,808 --> 00:12:48,983
Come on, Lois, hit me! Beat the
crap out of me! Step on my cubes.

237
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:58,891
Oh, hi, Peter. Are you here
to bring back the TV set?

238
00:12:58,895 --> 00:13:02,103
No, I sold it for crack. But listen,
Mom, I've got to ask you something.

239
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,852
Who's my real father?

240
00:13:04,586 --> 00:13:08,832
I knew this day would come.
All right, Peter, here it is.

241
00:13:08,838 --> 00:13:12,220
About 40 years ago,
I was vactioning in Ireland,

242
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:15,481
and I met a young rogue
named Mickey McFinnegan.

243
00:13:15,487 --> 00:13:18,912
Peter, Mickey is your real father.

244
00:13:18,917 --> 00:13:22,042
Oh my God! I gotta find him!

245
00:13:23,877 --> 00:13:25,300
To Ireland!

246
00:13:30,286 --> 00:13:33,313
- Sweetheart, when will you be back?
- I don't know, Lois.

247
00:13:33,317 --> 00:13:36,312
All I know is somewhere
in the great land of Ireland,

248
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,991
is a big fat bastard who looks like me.

249
00:13:38,997 --> 00:13:43,081
Call me as soon as you can, Peter. And
I really hope you find your real father.

250
00:13:43,087 --> 00:13:47,462
- We're going to miss you, Dad.
- Come back soon, Daddy. I love you.

251
00:13:47,468 --> 00:13:49,873
That'll do, pig. That'll do.

252
00:13:53,006 --> 00:13:54,172
There she is, Rupert.

253
00:13:54,178 --> 00:13:56,163
If I can just get her to
hit me one more time,

254
00:13:56,175 --> 00:13:57,980
it'll give me the rush
I've been looking for!

255
00:14:00,318 --> 00:14:03,621
What's next? What's next?
Oh, God, I've been so bloody naughty,

256
00:14:03,626 --> 00:14:06,431
and I need to be taught a lesson
and you're the one to do it.

257
00:14:07,406 --> 00:14:09,800
Oh! Thank you!

258
00:14:09,918 --> 00:14:12,283
Thank you!

259
00:14:12,415 --> 00:14:15,553
Yeah, all that stuff.
Let's make that happen.

260
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:19,960
- Hi, sweetie. You want some juice?
- Ooh, that'll be lovely.

261
00:14:21,598 --> 00:14:23,563
- Oh, Stewie!
- Yeah?

262
00:14:23,646 --> 00:14:27,743
- Look at the mess you made.
- I've made a terrible mess, haven't I?

263
00:14:27,745 --> 00:14:30,581
Yes, I made you take time out
of your day to clean my mess

264
00:14:30,598 --> 00:14:34,260
- and I should be punished for it. Go!
- Well, I guess it's not that big a deal.

265
00:14:34,265 --> 00:14:36,163
- Accidents happen.
- I don't know.

266
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:38,971
Don't you think you should
spank me or slice my nostril?

267
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:42,453
- It's all right, Stewie. Now go play.
- All right.

268
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:48,010
Look! I've drawn heavy weight pugilist
David Tua on the wall.

269
00:14:48,018 --> 00:14:50,870
- Punish me!
- Sweetie, you've really gotta stop...

270
00:14:50,876 --> 00:14:52,632
huh, looks like David Tua...

271
00:14:52,638 --> 00:14:56,032
You really got to stop misbehaving.
You're getting on Mommy's nerves.

272
00:14:56,035 --> 00:14:59,640
Well, you know what'll ease your stress?
Slap me across the face like a bitch!

273
00:14:59,645 --> 00:15:01,873
It's all right. I'll get some windex.

274
00:15:01,937 --> 00:15:03,611
Come on! Discipline me!

275
00:15:03,626 --> 00:15:07,211
Make me wear panties, rub dirt in my
eye, violating me with a wine bottle.

276
00:15:07,216 --> 00:15:09,562
My God, I really do
have problems, don't I?

277
00:15:12,988 --> 00:15:15,882
<i>Welcome to Ireland.
We'll be landing in five minutes.</i>

278
00:15:15,885 --> 00:15:17,440
This is quite a country, Brian.

279
00:15:17,445 --> 00:15:20,273
You know, Ireland has more
drunks per capita than people.

280
00:15:20,275 --> 00:15:21,750
That's a negative stereotype.

281
00:15:21,758 --> 00:15:24,352
I don't think the Irish drink
as much as people say they do.

282
00:15:35,218 --> 00:15:38,202
Uh, excuse me?
Is this McSwiggen Village?

283
00:15:38,206 --> 00:15:40,690
Ah, did ***** who say a word *****, hmm?

284
00:15:40,698 --> 00:15:42,042
Is that a yes or a no?

285
00:15:42,047 --> 00:15:46,433
Aye, tis McSwiggen Village. Where the
hills are green, the streams are clear,

286
00:15:46,435 --> 00:15:48,122
and the sweaters are so thick,

287
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,892
even the boniest-fingered nun
could poke you in the chest

288
00:15:50,895 --> 00:15:52,223
and it wouldn't bother you none.

289
00:15:52,228 --> 00:15:56,043
Don't be so bold with your
dark hair and your proud ways!

290
00:15:56,045 --> 00:15:57,480
I can't feel a thing!

291
00:16:04,366 --> 00:16:06,773
You heard of a man
named Mickey McFinnegan?

292
00:16:06,775 --> 00:16:09,000
Have I heard of him?
Of course I've heard of him!

293
00:16:09,005 --> 00:16:11,371
- He's the town drunk.
- Town drunk?!

294
00:16:11,376 --> 00:16:14,471
Oh, my God, you mean he's
the disgrace of the whole town?

295
00:16:16,148 --> 00:16:18,530
You lads aren't from around here, are ya?

296
00:16:18,536 --> 00:16:21,851
Top of the morning, ladies!
Let me cut you an Irish rose.

297
00:16:24,768 --> 00:16:27,550
I don't know exactly
where the county Cork is

298
00:16:27,558 --> 00:16:29,383
but I know where it should be!

299
00:16:32,477 --> 00:16:36,592
Around here, the town drunk
is a person of great honor.

300
00:16:36,598 --> 00:16:39,012
Excuse me, sir? My name is Peter.

301
00:16:39,016 --> 00:16:41,083
Pleased to meet you, lad.
My name's Mickey.

302
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:44,331
Listen, uh, this maybe hard
for you to believe but...

303
00:16:44,445 --> 00:16:47,542
- You're my father.
- Oh, am I now?

304
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,170
Yeah, I came all the way
from America to find you.

305
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:54,191
I suppose it's money you're wanted.
I owe you some allowance and so forth.

306
00:16:57,058 --> 00:17:00,931
Oh, no, I don't want money. I just
want to get to know you and be friends.

307
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:04,290
So I can finally have a real dad
who loves and respects me.

308
00:17:04,295 --> 00:17:07,403
You can't be me son.
You and me are nothing alike.

309
00:17:07,407 --> 00:17:09,132
Just ask me sheep, O'Brian.

310
00:17:09,138 --> 00:17:12,411
Who's leg do you have to hump
to get a pint of Guiness around here?

311
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,653
Boy it's amazing, isn't it?
You get two fathers

312
00:17:16,656 --> 00:17:18,872
and neither one of them
wants anything to do with you.

313
00:17:18,878 --> 00:17:23,042
There's got to be some way I can make
him see that I'm worthy of being his son.

314
00:17:23,048 --> 00:17:27,233
About the only way I can ever impress
him is if I was a fat stinkin' drunk.

315
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:30,882
<i>Peter! You are a fat stinking drunk.</i>

316
00:17:30,885 --> 00:17:34,323
- What?
- You're a fat stinking drunk!

317
00:17:34,327 --> 00:17:36,680
Yes, from was he told us.
That's right on the money.

318
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:39,663
- Challenge him, you must.
- And I'm Hayden Christensen.

319
00:17:39,738 --> 00:17:43,622
Wait a minute, Brian, that's it!
I'm a fat stinkin' drunk

320
00:17:43,636 --> 00:17:47,880
because my father is a fat stinkin'
drunk. I gotta prove it to him.

321
00:17:47,885 --> 00:17:50,291
I have gotta drink him
so far under the table,

322
00:17:50,295 --> 00:17:53,650
he'll have no choice but to respect me.
Get me a beer, Brian.

323
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,101
I am going to prepare
for this as thoroughly as

324
00:17:56,106 --> 00:17:58,322
Ben Affleck prepares for a role.

325
00:17:58,915 --> 00:18:01,691
Wow, I got to be Henry VIII
in twenty minutes!

326
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:04,163
Allo? Allo? Alloo? Alloo?

327
00:18:04,215 --> 00:18:05,192
Got it!

328
00:18:07,685 --> 00:18:11,850
Mickey McFinnegan,
I challenge you to a drinking contest.

329
00:18:13,098 --> 00:18:16,421
And what makes you think you can
hold your own with the *likes* of me?

330
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,021
Because I'm your son. And I'm tough.

331
00:18:19,026 --> 00:18:21,560
I mean it half way through
Failure to Launch.

332
00:18:21,565 --> 00:18:24,493
I just never managed
to get my life together.

333
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:26,172
Isn't that hilarious?

334
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,580
You're cute.

335
00:18:28,636 --> 00:18:29,950
Done!

336
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,893
As we say in Ireland,

337
00:18:32,908 --> 00:18:37,552
Let's drink until the alcohol in our
system destroy ours livers and kills us.

338
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:43,182
<i>- I've got twenty on the fat one.
- Which one's the fat one?</i>

339
00:19:33,128 --> 00:19:35,401
- What happened?
- Peter, you won!

340
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:39,073
My God, nobody's ever beat me
at the game of drink.

341
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:41,310
Now do you believe that you're my dad?

342
00:19:41,316 --> 00:19:44,562
Nobody but a McFinnegan could
handle that much of the creature.

343
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:47,492
You're the broth of me own
stubby shillelagh, all right.

344
00:19:47,498 --> 00:19:50,202
- Welcome to me family, Peter.
- You hear that, Brian?

345
00:19:50,205 --> 00:19:53,331
I'm a McFinnegan now!
I can forget all about Francis.

346
00:19:53,338 --> 00:19:55,692
You know, there's something
you should always remember, Peter.

347
00:19:55,697 --> 00:19:57,773
Francis may not have been your father,

348
00:19:57,776 --> 00:20:01,402
but he raised you as if you
were his own. And if that isn't love,

349
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:04,661
- I don't know what is.
- Wow, I guess you're right.

350
00:20:04,665 --> 00:20:06,203
But there is one thing, Mickey.

351
00:20:06,215 --> 00:20:08,573
You knocked up my mom and
never called her again.

352
00:20:08,586 --> 00:20:10,291
- Yeah, so what?
- So what?

353
00:20:10,295 --> 00:20:11,620
So let's dance!

354
00:20:11,918 --> 00:20:15,863
<i>He doesn't smell like Irish Spring
And he never taught me anything</i>

355
00:20:15,865 --> 00:20:19,333
<i>But still I slap my chest and
sing of my drunken Irish dad</i>

356
00:20:19,466 --> 00:20:23,072
<i>His face looks like a railroad map
And he never shuts his freakin' trap</i>

357
00:20:23,075 --> 00:20:26,482
<i>But all the ladies catch the clap
from your drunken Irish dad</i>

358
00:20:26,486 --> 00:20:28,250
<i>Ask a Hennesy, Tennesy, Morrison,</i>

359
00:20:28,255 --> 00:20:30,491
<i>Shaughnessy, Riordan and Rooney,
they'll tell you the same</i>

360
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:32,211
<i>McNutley, Mulrooney and
Cotter and Clooney</i>

361
00:20:32,215 --> 00:20:34,163
<i>All feel the same mixture
of pride and the shame</i>

362
00:20:34,165 --> 00:20:35,920
<i>Finnegan, Hannigan, Kelly and Flannigan</i>

363
00:20:35,927 --> 00:20:37,743
<i>Look to the ground when
their dad passes by</i>

364
00:20:37,756 --> 00:20:39,620
<i>Cafferty, Rafferty, Joyce and O'Lafferty</i>

365
00:20:39,627 --> 00:20:43,703
<i>Fight for his honor and then start to cry...</i>

366
00:21:00,086 --> 00:21:03,680
<i>We Irish lads are all infirm
And our moods infect us like a germ</i>

367
00:21:03,686 --> 00:21:07,182
<i>'Cause we're all the spawn
of a pickled sperm...</i>

368
00:21:07,185 --> 00:21:09,220
And we don't tan well, either.

369
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:11,312
<i>From our drunken Irish dad!</i>
