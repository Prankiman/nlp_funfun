00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:04,699
In the television comedy
world, the people are entertained...

2
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:07,500
by two separate yet equally important
types of shows.

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:10,508
TraditionaI sitcoms that get laughs out
of everyday situations...

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,376
like trying to fix your own plumbing
or inviting two dates to the same dance.

5
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:18,008
And animated shows that make jokes
about farting. This is the latter.

6
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:22,254
Sorry. I just farted.

7
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:56,952
I'm glad you guys could come tonight.

8
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,151
Chris, honey, we wouldn't miss
your open house.

9
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,127
You kids are the most important thing
in our lives.

10
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,821
Oh, my God! We forgot Meg.

11
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:07,525
Don't worry about Meg. She's got
everything she needs in her room.

12
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,113
Most of the time,
the kids'll exercise out in the field.

13
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:27,117
But if it's raining or I'm hung-over,
they stay inside and play dodge ball.

14
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,620
I love dodge ball! Heads up!

15
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,989
And this week in Home Ec,
we're teaching your kids...

16
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,254
how to make bundt cake.

17
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,556
I love bundt cake! Heads up!

18
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:42,292
The schooI band offers a wide variety
of instruments...

19
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:43,994
from the kettledrum to the trombone.

20
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,833
I love the trombone!

21
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,510
Wow!

22
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:03,880
I know, isn't he wonderfuI?
He took lessons in junior college.

23
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,048
Heads up!

24
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:10,896
I like meeting Chris's teachers.
This ought to be more interesting than...

25
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,692
that time I met Ted Danson.

26
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:15,663
Wow! Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen!

27
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:17,702
Always nice to meet a fan.

28
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:20,905
Oh, shoot! I forgot my umbrella.

29
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:22,668
That's okay, honey. Come on over here.

30
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:23,764
Thanks, dear.

31
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:27,369
Sometimes it's good to be a freak.
Do you want to sleep together later?

32
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,281
No. Thanks, though.

33
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:35,953
Good evening, parents. I'm Ms. Clifton.
I'd like for you to fill out these...

34
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:39,252
contact information sheets.
Now, who would like to pass them out?

35
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,460
Ms. Clifton, over here!

36
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:46,591
Ms. Clifton! Ms. Clifton! Ms. Clifton!
Ms. Clifton! Ms. Clifton!

37
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,172
Mrs. Griffin.

38
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:59,035
I'm sorry. Will you all please excuse me
for a moment?

39
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,110
Tonight's winning
lottery numbers are...

40
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:04,809
6, 21, 18, 7, 42.

41
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:08,281
Oh, my God! I won!

42
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:11,915
I'm free from all those
snot-nosed, little bastards!

43
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:15,116
I'm free!

44
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:21,093
- Is she coming back?
- I don't know.

45
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:32,004
I can't believe Ms. Clifton's gone.
Who's gonna teach my class now?

46
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:34,602
Brian, why don't you teach Chris's class?

47
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,512
You're very knowledgeable, the kids
might knock you down a few pegs...

48
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:38,606
which would be good for you.

49
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:42,620
You know, that is a terrific idea, Lois.
I probably have a lot to offer young people.

50
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,848
What's he going to teach them?

51
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,983
How to lick the Dorito crumbs
from between the sofa cushions?

52
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,754
Or how to leave a dead bird on the carpet?

53
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:50,522
That was a gift, you bastard.

54
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,461
That was a gift for the family.

55
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,696
Good morning, class.
I'm your substitute teacher, Brian Griffin.

56
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:01,431
Good morning, Mr. Griffin.

57
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:05,374
Please. Call me Brian.
Mr. Griffin is my father.

58
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:09,710
I thought your father's name was Cocoa,
and he was hit by a milk truck!

59
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:12,717
all right. Our goaI here is to gain
a command of the English language.

60
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:16,152
So you can be successfuI writers
like Ben Affleck and Matt Damon.

61
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:20,724
There. Finished.
Good Will Hunting by Matt Damon.

62
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,259
You think we could put
both our names on that?

63
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:26,127
What? You've done nothing
but eat Breyer's and smoke pot...

64
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:27,460
for the last six months.

65
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:30,195
Oh, that's... Come on! I helped.

66
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:33,431
Oh, yeah? Okay, write a line.
Just right now.

67
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,063
- Just pitch me a line right now.
- Okay.

68
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:37,266
How about that?

69
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:40,505
- That wasn't a line. You just farted.
- Is there anymore pot?

70
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,909
So, how was your first day, Mr. Kotter?

71
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,052
Yeah, Chris.
What's it like to have Brian as a teacher?

72
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:55,116
It sucks! Mr. Griffin gave me an F
on my first assignment!

73
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:58,493
What? An F, Brian?
After all Chris has done for you?

74
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:01,993
Yeah. Just kind of pull it out. Yeah.

75
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:05,597
If dogs aren't supposed to eat
dentaI floss out of the garbage...

76
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,172
why do they make it mint-flavored?

77
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:10,135
Chris, when I was in schooI,
you know what we used to do...

78
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:11,471
when a teacher gave us a bad grade?

79
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:13,238
- What?
- We'd egg his house.

80
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,974
- Come on. Where's this bastard live?
- I'll show you.

81
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:18,709
That's his house!

82
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,880
- Take that!
- I got it!

83
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,182
Take that, you bum!

84
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:24,414
What the hell are you doing?

85
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:25,786
- Is that him?
- Yeah!

86
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:26,859
Oh, crap!

87
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,159
Hello, class.
Mark Twain here, filling in for Brian Griffin.

88
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,327
I understand you children read my book,
The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.

89
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,735
Yeah, we read it.

90
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,364
Now, who can tell me...
Bobby, stop screwing around back there!

91
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:45,911
Who can tell me the significance of
the carpetbaggers in my noveI?

92
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,980
Yeah. They stood for corruption and greed.

93
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:52,313
That's exactly right.
Just like the presidency of James Garfield.

94
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,980
He died in office.

95
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:58,888
You kids are mighty smart.
You must have a powerfuI good teacher.

96
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,961
Well, I gotta catch my time steamboat
back to the 1800s.

97
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:11,025
- Sorry I'm late. Did I miss anything?
- Yeah! Cap'n Crunch was here.

98
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,230
Didn't you pass him on the stairs?

99
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:16,035
Well, I hope the rest of you kids
learned something today.

100
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,632
Yeah.

101
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,905
Good morning,
this is PrincipaI Sloan.

102
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:21,172
Mr. Griffin, you've been reassigned.

103
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,804
Please report to RemediaI English.

104
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:26,544
Reassigned? Can I at least come down
to your office and talk to you about this?

105
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:29,883
No. I'm afraid I'm far too busy today.

106
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:33,220
Estoban, mucho tension lower.

107
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,895
Little lower. Lower.

108
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,158
Lower.

109
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,791
On top of
old Smokey

110
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,500
Gosh, I was really starting to like this job.

111
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,766
It was nice interacting with
intelligent people.

112
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,102
I usually hang out with an idiot.

113
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,938
Brian, check it out.
I made a water slide in the house.

114
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:06,286
I'm not gonna call the hospitaI
because you won't learn anything if I do.

115
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,924
Well, kids, I'll see you later.

116
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:13,059
Pardon me. Is this first-period English?

117
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:17,059
I'm your new teacher, Mrs. Lockhart.

118
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:24,772
Oh, my God. I'm in love.

119
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,845
Watch out for the stairs!

120
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:40,283
- Good morning, class.
- Good morning, Mrs. Lockhart.

121
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:43,851
I graded your quizzes from yesterday.
Most of you did well.

122
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:48,124
Some of you, I think, can do better.
What do you see here, Chris?

123
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,703
Two D's and an F.

124
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,948
Hi. I'm Mr. Griffin.
But you can call me Brian.

125
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,686
Mr. Griffin is my father.

126
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:11,856
Well, has anybody read Huckleberry Finn?

127
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:15,217
all right. How about we go around
the room and everyone can say...

128
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,955
a little something about themselves?

129
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,428
Let's start with you there in the front.

130
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:20,999
My name's Tim. I'm 28 years young.

131
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,328
And I love weed.

132
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:27,338
My name is Carlos. And beneath
my tough exterior is a boy aching to learn.

133
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,470
And beneath that is a rapist.

134
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:32,339
My name is Amanda.
And my water just broke.

135
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,572
- Oh, my God!
- Yo, it's my turn to deliver.

136
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,877
Can I have this one?
My mom keeps giving mine away.

137
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:44,317
Dad, I need some advice. I need to know
how to get a girI to like me.

138
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,755
Chris, buddy, there's a million ways
to do that.

139
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,054
You just got to do something simple,
like Vincent van Gogh.

140
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:51,953
It's... What is this?

141
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,929
It's my ear. Do you like it?

142
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,592
You don't like it.

143
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,898
No, I like it. But it's just... Why your ear?

144
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,131
Because I love you.

145
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:03,402
Well, at least this will be a funny story
to tell our kids someday.

146
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:06,569
You want kids? Oh, yikes.

147
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,776
I wish you'd told me that
before I got you this.

148
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:15,280
Did I hear my big boy say he's got
a crush on some lucky girI?

149
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,789
You know, Chris, I knew this day
would come. So, I brought you a condom.

150
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,052
Use it wisely, though.
It wasn't easy to obtain.

151
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,121
What the hell are you doing?

152
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,928
Give that back!
Man!

153
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:32,436
Now, where were we?
This is much better.

154
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:36,808
Chris, honey, the way to win a girI is
to do something romantic and unexpected.

155
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,537
Remember the naked spaceman, Lois?

156
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:42,512
Yeah. You remember the naked spaceman.

157
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:46,649
On my 25th birthday,
your father surprised me by showing up...

158
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,482
in nothing but a space helmet
and moon boots.

159
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,450
It just came to me.

160
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:56,421
- You want some Tang, Mr. Spaceman?
- Do I?

161
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:01,994
Just remember, fat man,
those jugs are mine untiI the milk dries up.

162
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,292
Then you can have the remains.

163
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:11,741
So, basically, what Orwell was saying
was, "It's not perfect but I'll take it. "

164
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,341
all right, moving on-

165
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,414
Sorry, I'm late, Mrs. Lockhart.

166
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:18,278
Oh, my God, Chris! What are you doing?

167
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,614
Being romantic and unexpected.

168
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,777
Chris, you can't be so impulsive.

169
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,879
People have gotten
into a lot of trouble that way.

170
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,653
- Marie?
- Yeah, Donny?

171
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,760
We cannot tell Mom.

172
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:39,805
So, Chris, what's the latest with
your little girlfriend?

173
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:43,306
I don't think Mrs. Lockhart likes me at all.

174
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,842
Mrs. Lockhart? Your teacher?

175
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,535
Whoa!

176
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,671
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

177
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,283
Lois, this is not my Batman glass.

178
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,014
Peter, are you listening?
Chris has a crush on his teacher.

179
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,385
Gross!

180
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,788
You know what else is gross?

181
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,018
Broke a damn blood vesseI!

182
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,290
How's it coming, dog?

183
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:11,529
God! Just listen to this kid's report
on Great Expectations.

184
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:15,266
"Miss Havisham should have throwed
that cake out so it don't like...

185
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,569
"mess all up the bitch's house. "

186
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:21,613
I don't know what to do, you know?
Society's given up on these kids.

187
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,614
I feeI like I may be the only one
who can help them.

188
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:26,116
I think your problem is
you're not communicating in a way...

189
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:27,378
that speaks to their experience.

190
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:28,714
You know what you should do?

191
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,812
Get in there tomorrow and do the robot.

192
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,322
Wow. You know, you're right.
Maybe I should just try...

193
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,421
a whole new approach. Thanks.

194
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,535
Okay, you can stop that now.

195
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,263
I can't hear you. I'm a robot.

196
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,635
- Come on, knock it off.
- Does not compute.

197
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,874
- I'm going to bed.
- I do not require sleep.

198
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,976
Let's see the kid with the hearing aid
from Barney do this.

199
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:05,089
all right. So's I'm chilling in Verona
when my homie busts out with:

200
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:08,991
"Yo, Romeo. Check out
that biotch Juliet in the window. "

201
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,596
Problem is, Juliet's peeps are, like,
East Coast rappers...

202
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:14,689
and my posse's representing West Side.

203
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,894
Just like my boys Tupac and Biggie.
Know what I'm saying?

204
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:21,162
- That's racist, man.
- Yeah, that's just straight ignorant, dog.

205
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,236
It's good to meet you, Mr. and Mrs. Griffin.

206
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:28,370
We wanted to talk to you about
our son. You see, Chris really-

207
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:32,144
Lois, honey, let's make sure
we do this delicately, all right?

208
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,277
Mrs. Lockhart, our son...

209
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:38,656
would like to plow you.

210
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:42,421
I had a feeling that's what was going on.

211
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:45,725
Sorry. Our son can sometimes be a boob.
I mean a melon.

212
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:50,461
I mean, a sopping-wet pair of breasts
barely covered by a racing t-shirt.

213
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:52,469
Mrs. Lockhart,
we just wanted you to know...

214
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:55,199
so you could spare his feelings
and let him down gently.

215
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:58,105
Don't worry.
I know exactly what to say to Chris.

216
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,407
Thank you so much.
You've been very understanding.

217
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:06,946
Gosh. You know, I don't mean to impose,
but do you have a picture of yourself...

218
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:09,111
that I could tape
to the back of Lois's head?

219
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,991
- Mrs. Lockhart?
- Chris, come down here.

220
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,964
I need to talk to you.

221
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,362
Why are you here?

222
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,370
'Cause I couldn't stand to be away
from you for another moment.

223
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,032
I think I'm falling in love with you.

224
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:32,440
- I love you, too!
- The only problem is I'm married.

225
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,539
Therefore, there's only one thing to do.

226
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:40,579
Make a flip book of a stick figure
whose head gets bigger and bigger...

227
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:42,313
and bigger and then pops?

228
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:47,151
This isn't a flip book, Chris.
They're instructions.

229
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:51,389
If we're going to be together,
I need you to kill my husband.

230
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:56,029
Do you have any idea what time it is?

231
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,500
Get in the house, fatty!

232
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:10,214
Chris, you big beautifuI man,
I'm so glad you came.

233
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,583
Up the stairs, second door on the left.
He should still be asleep.

234
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,985
- Mrs. Lockhart, I don't think I can do this.
- What?

235
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,888
Maybe you could just get a divorce,
and we could live together...

236
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,358
in the fort under my bed.

237
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:25,487
Fine. I'll do it myself. But we're through.

238
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:29,125
Okay. But I got to give you the password,
or you can't get into the fort.

239
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,234
It's taco. Taco!

240
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,739
Good God!
Look at the fat man's underwear.

241
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:41,176
It looks like a Jackson Pollock painting.
Don't put that in with my things!

242
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,542
What's this?

243
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:46,345
You know, Stewie, Mommy doesn't
usually read things out of Chris's pockets.

244
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:47,942
She's more respectfuI than that.

245
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,385
Yeah, whatever helps you
sleep at night, bitch.

246
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,821
Oh, my God!

247
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,393
Chris is gonna murder
Mrs. Lockhart's husband!

248
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,121
We got to stop him!

249
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:01,356
Can we stop at the supermarket?
I want a Granny Smith apple.

250
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:06,902
How's your oatmeaI, honey?

251
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,736
You know,
it tastes kind of different than usuaI.

252
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:13,539
Oh, my God! There's a bear in my oatmeaI.

253
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:27,690
Yeah, I know. I'm late.
Okay, let's just get started.

254
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:35,731
Yo, man, what's that thing in the middle?

255
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:39,296
What, this?
You got to be freaking kidding me.

256
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:42,531
That's an ampersand.
It's a symboI for the word "and. "

257
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:46,372
My God, nobody can be this stupid.
Not even Peter when he took...

258
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,742
that blow to the head and thought he was
Larry from Three's Company.

259
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,912
Jack, there's a hot tub party
across the street and we're invited.

260
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:56,010
And don't worry. If Mr. Furley comes by,
I'll make sure he thinks you're...

261
00:15:56,588 --> 00:16:00,217
Mr. Griffin, chillax.
We're doing the best we can.

262
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:03,386
There is nothing I would like to do
more than chillax, Amanda.

263
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:06,589
But without a decent education,
you could spend the rest of your life...

264
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,826
as a ditch digger or a moteI maid
or a hooker.

265
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:11,494
- I could be a ditch digger?
- A moteI maid?

266
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:12,763
I could be a hooker?

267
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,930
Well, no. You don't want to be a hooker.

268
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,601
Wow, Mr. Griffin! You're the first teacher
that ever told us we could do anything.

269
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:21,339
Well, I didn't mean sell your body
for money.

270
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,305
"O, Captain! my Captain! "

271
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:24,677
No, you're actually misunderstanding.

272
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:25,909
"O, Captain! my Captain! "

273
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,349
Well, if it works for you, I guess...

274
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:28,920
"O, Captain! my Captain! "

275
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:30,886
What the hell?
Be the best damn hooker you can be.

276
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,548
"O, Captain! my Captain! "

277
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,649
In your case, I'd get the money up front.

278
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:43,557
Jack, twins! Swedish. My place. Now.

279
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:50,466
We're too late! Oh, my God.

280
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,677
Okay, I gotta call the police.

281
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,337
What's that smell?

282
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,608
Dead body, right. That's what that is.

283
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:02,011
I just had a dream I was an egg, and I was
being hatched by Elisabeth Hasselbeck.

284
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,851
No, wait a minute. I can't call the police.

285
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,620
I have to get rid of this body,
or Chris'll go to prison!

286
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:12,185
And we all know what happens in those
prison showers. I've seen Oz.

287
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,455
Scrub scrub here,
scrub scrub there

288
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:16,033
Whether you're white or bronze

289
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:20,071
A man can wash another man
in the merry old land of Oz

290
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:29,474
all right, wait here, Stewie,
while Mommy gets the cement blocks.

291
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,844
- Everything all right here?
- Fine, Officer. Just enjoying the sunset.

292
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,924
No law against that, is there?

293
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:44,052
- What happened to your shirt?
- You know, just a pizza party at the office.

294
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,528
Yeah? Where do you work?

295
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:48,065
First Fidelity Insurance
over on Wabossette Street.

296
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:51,364
- My cousin, Arnie, works over there.
- Arnie's your cousin, is he?

297
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,835
- You know him?
- Somewhat.

298
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:55,805
Good middle-management type.
Just blends in with the furniture there.

299
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,739
Never really wowed anyone at the office.

300
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:00,937
Yeah, that's always been Arnie's problem.
Well, take it easy.

301
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:04,209
Yes. You, too.
And if you see Arnie, tell him:

302
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,884
He'll know what it means.

303
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:16,088
You know what I hate?
A guy in a blue suit.

304
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:20,632
There's one right behind me, isn't there?

305
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:26,260
You know, Lois, Chris is cooI and
everything, but since he killed that guy...

306
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,464
I don't know. Maybe he shouldn't be
living with us here now.

307
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:29,563
Peter, I'm scared.

308
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,303
Don't worry, sweetheart.
You'll have plenty of time to escape...

309
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:35,039
while he's killing Meg.
He hates her the most.

310
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:38,310
Hey, everybody. What's for dinner?
I'm starving.

311
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,147
My God, his blood lust is unquenchable!

312
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:44,017
Chris, why don't you take your sister
into the kitchen for a sandwich?

313
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,784
I don't want to die!

314
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,352
Why is everybody acting weird?

315
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,087
Chris, honey, we know what you did.

316
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:52,823
And I have to say,
honestly, I don't approve.

317
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:57,630
What I did? That I lied about my age
to get into Indian Bingo?

318
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,294
No.

319
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:01,895
That I had hard gas and pooed myself?

320
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,099
Close, but still no.

321
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,197
How is that close?

322
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,709
For God's sake, Chris!
You murdered Mr. Lockhart!

323
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,279
What? No, I didn't!

324
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,940
Come on. Everybody's done
something they're not proud of.

325
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,482
Like when I used to be a Wonder Twin.

326
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:15,553
Peter, the old schoolhouse is on fire!
Let's go!

327
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:17,655
Wonder Twin powers, activate!

328
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:19,280
Form of a hawk!

329
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:23,055
- Come on, Peter.
- Yeah, I'll be right behind you.

330
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:27,360
Shape of Jayna's tampon.

331
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:34,171
And now I play the waiting game.

332
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,007
Chris, I saw the body.

333
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:39,942
Premeditated murder is one thing,
but I will not have Iying in this house.

334
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:43,014
Wait, hold it.
Can we finish this after Joan of Arcadia?

335
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,707
Is Joan of Arcadia on?

336
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,009
all right.

337
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,210
Must be good.

338
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,308
Enjoyable program.

339
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,389
We interrupt this broadcast
to bring you a breaking news story.

340
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,550
We apologize to Joan of Arcadia's
sanctimonious, fear-based...

341
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,389
and probably overweight viewers.

342
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,793
That's right, Diane.
It appears Ronald Lockhart...

343
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:02,025
has been brutally murdered by his wife,
Lana, and a locaI bear.

344
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:06,303
Well, I'll be damned.
Chris, I guess we owe you an apology.

345
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:10,535
That's okay. I just wonder what happened
to Ms. Lockhart and that bear.

346
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,939
The whereabouts of these suspects
are currently unknown.

347
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:16,814
- You ready?
- What's that?

348
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,711
I thought we'd try that lobster place
we passed in the car.

349
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:24,221
- Yeah, can I just finish watching this?
- You can watch TV anytime. I'm starving.

350
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:28,157
Lana, this is gonna be a reaI long trip
if you don't knock off the crap!

351
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:31,920
Love you.
