11
00:00:34,003 --> 00:00:35,638
Hi. It's me, Peter.

12
00:00:35,639 --> 00:00:38,137
You may be wondering
what I'm doing in a library.

13
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,543
Well, I actually drove my car
into this rich guy's house,

14
00:00:40,544 --> 00:00:42,979
and he locked me in here
until the police come.

15
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,313
Don't believe me?

16
00:00:44,314 --> 00:00:46,629
I don't know. I just
locked him in the library.

17
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,951
Seems like he's on something.
He's got crazy eyes

18
00:00:48,952 --> 00:00:50,786
and keeps screaming,
"I don't care."

19
00:00:50,787 --> 00:00:52,054
I don't care!

20
00:00:52,055 --> 00:00:53,622
Anyway, I've got
some time to kill

21
00:00:53,623 --> 00:00:55,458
before this room
is filled with tear gas,

22
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:57,226
so I thought,
"Why not finally read

23
00:00:57,227 --> 00:00:59,762
some of the classics
I never read in high school."

24
00:00:59,763 --> 00:01:02,198
Here's one right here,
<i>The Great Gatsby.</i>

25
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:06,235
A book by the only respected guy
in the world named Scott.

26
00:01:19,033 --> 00:01:21,884
<i>It was my first
summer staying at the shore,</i>

27
00:01:21,885 --> 00:01:25,221
<i>but I had a feeling that I,
Nick "The Situation" Carraway,</i>

28
00:01:25,222 --> 00:01:26,889
<i>would fit right in.</i>

29
00:01:29,426 --> 00:01:31,460
Hey, it's Nick
from<i> The Great Gatsby.</i>

30
00:01:31,461 --> 00:01:34,830
I just checked in, and somebody
left their teeth here.

31
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:37,633
I-I don't know,
it's just a set of teeth.

32
00:01:37,634 --> 00:01:39,468
I-I guess men's?

33
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:41,237
No, I'm not putting them
anywhere.

34
00:01:41,238 --> 00:01:42,938
You come and get them.

35
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:46,008
Yecch. The neighbors are having a party

36
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:47,710
with loud jazz music.

37
00:01:47,711 --> 00:01:49,945
Well, at least
annoyingly scatting over jazz

38
00:01:49,946 --> 00:01:51,514
hasn't been invented yet.

39
00:01:55,852 --> 00:01:58,203
Oh, that must have
been invented today!

40
00:02:11,385 --> 00:02:12,902
Hey, whose party is this?

41
00:02:12,903 --> 00:02:15,704
I'm not sure. Women aren't
allowed to ask questions yet.

42
00:02:15,705 --> 00:02:17,106
So, what's your name?

43
00:02:17,107 --> 00:02:18,874
Madam, you forget yourself.

44
00:02:23,264 --> 00:02:25,448
<i>That's when I first
laid eyes on him.</i>

45
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:26,982
<i>Jay Gatsby.</i>

46
00:02:26,983 --> 00:02:29,151
<i>He was clearly playing with
himself through his pocket,</i>

47
00:02:29,152 --> 00:02:30,686
<i>but I pretended not to see.</i>

48
00:02:30,687 --> 00:02:31,987
Hello. Welcome
to my party.

49
00:02:31,988 --> 00:02:33,989
Name's Gatsby. Good to
meet you, old sport.

50
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,424
Yeah, just a wave is fine.

51
00:02:35,425 --> 00:02:37,326
I-I'm your new neighbor,
Nick Carraway.

52
00:02:37,327 --> 00:02:39,328
Oh, I hope we weren't
too loud, old sport.

53
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:40,963
Yeah, this
"old sport" thing,

54
00:02:40,964 --> 00:02:42,832
is this... is this something
you're trying out,

55
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,867
- or is this a keeper?
- I just met you,

56
00:02:44,868 --> 00:02:46,836
so I want to tell you
something very private.

57
00:02:46,837 --> 00:02:48,237
Let's go out to the dock.

58
00:02:52,026 --> 00:02:53,943
I come down here
to think every night

59
00:02:53,944 --> 00:02:55,611
and gaze at that green light.

60
00:02:55,612 --> 00:02:57,746
It's where the love
of my life lives,

61
00:02:57,747 --> 00:02:59,131
Daisy Buchanan.

62
00:03:01,368 --> 00:03:02,985
Um, I hate to
break it to you,

63
00:03:02,986 --> 00:03:04,487
but that light you've
been looking at

64
00:03:04,488 --> 00:03:06,455
is a gay gym called
The Pump House.

65
00:03:06,456 --> 00:03:09,925
I-I only know that because I saw a
coupon that came with my rental.

66
00:03:09,926 --> 00:03:12,495
Um... anyway, Daisy's
house is over there.

67
00:03:12,496 --> 00:03:14,864
- She's my cousin.
- Daisy's your cousin?!

68
00:03:14,865 --> 00:03:18,300
Yeah. Lot of weird coincidences
for an American classic, huh?

69
00:03:18,301 --> 00:03:19,835
Wha... I have to see her!

70
00:03:19,836 --> 00:03:21,136
Well, I can set that up.

71
00:03:21,137 --> 00:03:22,738
Um, only thing is she's married.

72
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:25,207
Yeah, and I hear
her husband's a real heel.

73
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,942
Whoa-hoa! Language!

74
00:03:26,943 --> 00:03:28,410
But yeah, I'll set it up.

75
00:03:28,411 --> 00:03:30,813
Um, tea tomorrow at
my house, 2:00 p.m.

76
00:03:30,814 --> 00:03:33,616
Great. She's...
she's gonna be there, right?

77
00:03:33,617 --> 00:03:34,984
Yeah. Why wouldn't
she be there?

78
00:03:34,985 --> 00:03:37,686
I don't know, I'm just getting
a funny vibe from you.

79
00:03:37,687 --> 00:03:39,688
You asked me down
to the docks alone,

80
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:42,691
and<i> you're</i> getting
a funny vibe from<i> me?</i>

81
00:03:47,047 --> 00:03:49,331
Wow. What an ugly
little house.

82
00:03:49,332 --> 00:03:52,701
Oh, yeah, it's not that palace
of domestic abuse<i> you</i> live in.

83
00:03:52,702 --> 00:03:54,970
Whassup...?

84
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:57,439
Oh, my God! Is it really you?

85
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,958
Oh, I've missed you, Daisy.
You're as beautiful as ever.

86
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,111
You know what else
is beautiful?

87
00:04:02,112 --> 00:04:03,913
My bank account. Boom!

88
00:04:03,914 --> 00:04:05,981
- Rich guy.
- You're rich now?

89
00:04:05,982 --> 00:04:08,150
- Oh, my God, I love that!
- I know, right?

90
00:04:08,151 --> 00:04:10,085
Come on, I'll show
you my place.

91
00:04:10,086 --> 00:04:11,186
Oh, you're leaving?

92
00:04:11,187 --> 00:04:13,188
But I made
all these deviled eggs.

93
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:15,357
<i>- You</i> made?
- You know what I meant.

94
00:04:15,358 --> 00:04:17,660
Yeah, you made them.
Great job.

95
00:04:28,489 --> 00:04:31,006
You know, one of the best parts
of having an enormous mansion

96
00:04:31,007 --> 00:04:33,576
is being able to come out here
and get some fresh air.

97
00:04:33,577 --> 00:04:35,911
You know, sometimes I just want
to jump off this balcony

98
00:04:35,912 --> 00:04:37,796
and into that pool down there.

99
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,449
So do it.

100
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,117
Yeah, I know, right?
Do it!

101
00:04:42,118 --> 00:04:43,352
Yeah. Do it.

102
00:04:43,353 --> 00:04:45,220
I know. I totally should,
right? Here I go.

103
00:04:45,221 --> 00:04:46,755
One, two, three...

104
00:04:46,756 --> 00:04:48,657
Whoa!
Can you imagine?

105
00:04:48,658 --> 00:04:50,593
Yeah, I-I can imagine.
It would be fun.

106
00:04:50,594 --> 00:04:53,162
- You should do it.
- If only it were that easy, right?

107
00:04:53,163 --> 00:04:54,830
It is. It looks
deep enough.

108
00:04:54,831 --> 00:04:56,498
It's your pool.
It's your house.

109
00:04:56,499 --> 00:04:58,500
- You can do whatever you want.
- I know, right?

110
00:04:58,501 --> 00:05:00,202
Ah, you know what?
I can't right now.

111
00:05:00,203 --> 00:05:01,470
My pool guy's cleaning it.

112
00:05:01,471 --> 00:05:04,573
Are you going to bone her?

113
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,213
This is amazing!

114
00:05:11,214 --> 00:05:13,482
I've never seen
so many shirts.

115
00:05:13,483 --> 00:05:15,584
D-Do you have enough to,
you know, throw?

116
00:05:15,585 --> 00:05:17,720
Yeah, you know, they're
actually kind of expensive...

117
00:05:17,721 --> 00:05:18,988
Ah, there she goes.

118
00:05:18,989 --> 00:05:22,424
Shirt! Shirt! Shirt!

119
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:24,326
Shirt! Shirt!

120
00:05:24,327 --> 00:05:25,561
Okay, five is good.

121
00:05:25,562 --> 00:05:26,996
Five is-is probably good.

122
00:05:26,997 --> 00:05:28,497
Shirt! Shirt!

123
00:05:28,498 --> 00:05:29,865
Were you, uh...

124
00:05:29,866 --> 00:05:32,751
were-were you this crazy
when we dated before?

125
00:05:37,725 --> 00:05:39,375
Mm, Gatsby, is it?

126
00:05:39,376 --> 00:05:41,944
I've been hearing about your
vast newly acquired wealth

127
00:05:41,945 --> 00:05:43,946
and your attentions
to my wife.

128
00:05:43,947 --> 00:05:45,881
So I thought I would
have you over

129
00:05:45,882 --> 00:05:47,549
to my equally
large and fancy

130
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,551
but imperceptibly
more classy mansion

131
00:05:49,552 --> 00:05:50,853
for an awkward dinner.

132
00:05:50,854 --> 00:05:52,988
And, Nick, have
you met Jordan?

133
00:05:52,989 --> 00:05:56,925
She plays golf, and is what kids
will someday call a "DUFF."

134
00:05:56,926 --> 00:05:59,028
Hey, yeah.
Nice tam-o'-shanter.

135
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:01,330
I'll drink your finger bowl
if you don't want it.

136
00:06:01,331 --> 00:06:04,333
<i>In the book, I actually
go on a few dates with Jordan.</i>

137
00:06:04,334 --> 00:06:05,934
<i>We're gonna skip all that.</i>

138
00:06:05,935 --> 00:06:08,070
Anyway, like I was saying,
you're a trash,

139
00:06:08,071 --> 00:06:11,006
'cause you earned your money a
little bit more recently than me.

140
00:06:11,007 --> 00:06:13,742
- What are you getting at?
- I'm saying I invited you over

141
00:06:13,743 --> 00:06:15,611
and sat you next
to my wife to say,

142
00:06:15,612 --> 00:06:17,312
"Stay away from my wife!"

143
00:06:17,313 --> 00:06:18,447
You know what we should do?

144
00:06:18,448 --> 00:06:19,948
Let's all drunk-drive
into Manhattan

145
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:21,350
and get a hotel room

146
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:22,918
and have the same conversation
we're having here.

147
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:25,504
I'm starting to think this
isn't a very good book.

148
00:06:28,075 --> 00:06:30,059
I'd like to add another bit
of pointless confusion

149
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,360
that will make sense later.

150
00:06:31,361 --> 00:06:33,328
Let's everyone drive
somebody else's car.

151
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:34,811
Someone can take my coupe.

152
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:36,232
I'm riding with Gatsby,
I don't care which car.

153
00:06:36,233 --> 00:06:37,566
I'll take someone
in Daisy's car.

154
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,401
I don't think Daisy said
you could drive her car.

155
00:06:39,402 --> 00:06:40,869
Tom, why don't you take
Jay's car?

156
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,371
- Who's Jay?
- Gatsby.

157
00:06:42,372 --> 00:06:44,740
Okay, I have never heard
anyone call him that.

158
00:06:44,741 --> 00:06:47,559
Look, if you're in your own car
you're in the wrong car.

159
00:06:55,502 --> 00:06:57,119
All right,
you guys get gas.

160
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,987
I got to talk to this
random mechanic's horny wife

161
00:06:58,988 --> 00:07:00,155
about some business.

162
00:07:00,156 --> 00:07:02,157
Wilson? Gonna need
to fill 'er up!

163
00:07:02,158 --> 00:07:05,110
Wilson's wife? Fill 'er up?
Get it?

164
00:07:10,834 --> 00:07:13,035
I don't know what
they do up there,

165
00:07:13,036 --> 00:07:15,871
but they sure do listen
to Def Leppard pretty loud.

166
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,944
So, seen any good movies lately?

167
00:07:21,945 --> 00:07:24,613
We just saw<i> Woman Tied</i>
<i>to Railroad Tracks 5.</i>

168
00:07:24,614 --> 00:07:26,181
Pretty similar to 4.

169
00:07:26,182 --> 00:07:28,317
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

170
00:07:28,318 --> 00:07:30,719
Wow, looks like you guys
are getting a head start

171
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,154
on the Depression here.

172
00:07:34,023 --> 00:07:36,458
Thanks for stopping
by, Mr. Buchanan.

173
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:39,128
Yeah, sure. Don't tell anyone
how bad I look naked.

174
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:42,231
Have fun raising my bastard.

175
00:07:42,232 --> 00:07:43,465
All right,
let's head out.

176
00:07:43,466 --> 00:07:44,967
Wait, but first
I want to see

177
00:07:44,968 --> 00:07:46,568
if we're in the
funny horn era.

178
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:49,087
Ah-ooga! Ah-ha! We are!

179
00:07:53,127 --> 00:07:55,577
All right, Gatsby,
you think you're so hot?

180
00:07:55,578 --> 00:07:58,914
Let me show you how a classy guy
does classy stuff.

181
00:07:58,915 --> 00:08:00,716
Hello, room service?
I'd like a bottle

182
00:08:00,717 --> 00:08:03,218
of your
second most expensive champagne.

183
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:06,455
And<i> I'd</i> like your
<i>most</i> expensive bottle.

184
00:08:06,456 --> 00:08:08,524
Wow. Walked right
into that one.

185
00:08:08,525 --> 00:08:11,160
Okay, fine. Well, then let's
see who has higher socks.

186
00:08:11,161 --> 00:08:12,494
Nya-ha!

187
00:08:12,495 --> 00:08:14,496
Whatever, Tom.
None of that matters.

188
00:08:14,497 --> 00:08:15,998
Daisy's in love with<i> me.</i>

189
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:18,167
In fact, she's<i> never</i> loved you.

190
00:08:18,168 --> 00:08:19,601
Oh, is that so?

191
00:08:19,602 --> 00:08:23,105
Well, I hear Gatsby didn't
even fight in World War I.

192
00:08:23,106 --> 00:08:24,640
Wait, why is he calling it that?

193
00:08:24,641 --> 00:08:26,358
Is there gonna be
<i>another</i> big war?

194
00:08:27,795 --> 00:08:29,344
I'm sorry, Tom.

195
00:08:29,345 --> 00:08:31,346
That's right.
I'm in love with Daisy,

196
00:08:31,347 --> 00:08:33,532
and she loves me, old sport.

197
00:08:34,568 --> 00:08:36,852
Would anyone like
a deviled egg

198
00:08:36,853 --> 00:08:39,638
from a tea I had
several days ago?

199
00:08:42,976 --> 00:08:44,560
Well, that was awful.

200
00:08:44,561 --> 00:08:46,762
But I sure do enjoy
driving your car

201
00:08:46,763 --> 00:08:48,497
instead of you driving it,

202
00:08:48,498 --> 00:08:50,499
even though we came
in a different car.

203
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,434
Drunk. Don't forget drunk.

204
00:08:52,435 --> 00:08:54,519
You're drunk-driving my car.

205
00:08:56,456 --> 00:08:57,706
Gas and sandwiches!

206
00:08:57,707 --> 00:09:00,175
Get your gas and sandwiches!

207
00:09:02,963 --> 00:09:07,132
Oh, that must be Tom, since
I saw him in that car earlier!

208
00:09:08,368 --> 00:09:10,786
Tom! Tom! It's me!

209
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,190
Oh-ho, no!

210
00:09:15,191 --> 00:09:16,558
Myrtle!

211
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:18,694
Where will I ever
find another woman

212
00:09:18,695 --> 00:09:21,713
with a hotter name
than Myrtle?

213
00:09:25,853 --> 00:09:28,237
All right, pool,
do your thing.

214
00:09:28,238 --> 00:09:31,006
You hungover?
Uh, a little bit,<i> yeah.</i>

215
00:09:31,007 --> 00:09:33,909
Okay, we're sort of racing
to the end here.

216
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,178
And with that,
I shall step

217
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:38,247
slightly out of range.

218
00:09:38,248 --> 00:09:40,866
All right, I'm just
gonna take a quick swim.

219
00:09:41,902 --> 00:09:43,685
Oh, my God!
Where are the stairs?

220
00:09:43,686 --> 00:09:46,004
There's no stairs!
I'm never gonna make it!

221
00:09:47,908 --> 00:09:50,058
You were standing
earlier in the day

222
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:52,310
next to the car
that hit my wife.

223
00:09:59,168 --> 00:10:02,070
<i>I would soon return
to New York a changed man,</i>

224
00:10:02,071 --> 00:10:04,773
<i>because, for me,
that will always be the summer</i>

225
00:10:04,774 --> 00:10:07,376
<i>that I finally put my head
underwater.</i>

226
00:10:07,377 --> 00:10:09,711
I did it! I did it!

227
00:10:09,712 --> 00:10:11,596
Aw, I wish somebody
had seen that.

228
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,626
Hi. Me again.

229
00:10:18,627 --> 00:10:20,428
I'm not
in that guy's library anymore.

230
00:10:20,429 --> 00:10:22,931
I snuck up to the attic
just before the cops busted in.

231
00:10:22,932 --> 00:10:24,882
They're down there now. Look.

232
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,404
Only problem is,
I really want to get

233
00:10:29,405 --> 00:10:31,673
to that trunk of costumes
in the corner.

234
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:34,609
On the one hand, I don't want
to give away my location.

235
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:37,445
On the other hand,
there might be a pirate hat.

236
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,717
Hmm, no pirate hat,
but I'll make it work.

237
00:10:42,718 --> 00:10:45,453
Argh! I'm a chef
aboard a pirate ship!

238
00:10:45,454 --> 00:10:47,589
Now, who be wantin' pancakes?

239
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,324
I think I hear
something in the attic.

240
00:10:49,325 --> 00:10:51,326
Oh, crap.
While I figure out my options,

241
00:10:51,327 --> 00:10:52,994
here's<i> Huckleberry Finn.</i>

242
00:11:01,888 --> 00:11:03,872
Hi, Huckleberry Finn!

243
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:05,473
Hi, Tom Sawyer.

244
00:11:05,474 --> 00:11:07,409
You're Tom, I'm Huck.

245
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,743
Everybody good? Yup?

246
00:11:08,744 --> 00:11:10,078
All right, let's do this.

247
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,680
Huckleberry Finn, you get inside
this house this minute.

248
00:11:12,681 --> 00:11:15,150
It's Tuesday morning.
It's time for church.

249
00:11:15,151 --> 00:11:16,351
Aw, Widow Douglas,

250
00:11:16,352 --> 00:11:18,553
I already been to church
three times today.

251
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:21,039
I want to stay home
and play Angry Birds.

252
00:11:25,995 --> 00:11:27,996
This is addictive.

253
00:11:27,997 --> 00:11:29,798
Hey, I'm your abusive dad,

254
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:32,467
and I've been drinkin' all
day from this here jug.

255
00:11:32,468 --> 00:11:34,969
Oh, my God, is that
a jug full of porn?

256
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,905
Hey, Widow Douglas,
I want to live with my dad!

257
00:11:36,906 --> 00:11:37,906
Shut your hole!

258
00:11:37,907 --> 00:11:39,507
Now come on,
I need to use your pee.

259
00:11:39,508 --> 00:11:42,126
I'm taking a wagon test
in the morning.

260
00:11:44,264 --> 00:11:46,915
I wish you wouldn't
drink so much.

261
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,383
Stop countin' my drinks!

262
00:11:48,384 --> 00:11:50,535
Now get over here
so I can whip you!

263
00:11:51,571 --> 00:11:54,089
Ow! Pap! No!

264
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,690
Yeah, that's
right, bitch.

265
00:11:55,691 --> 00:11:57,158
Now it's your turn...

266
00:11:58,494 --> 00:12:00,829
Geez, this is worse
than the Widow Douglas' house.

267
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,113
I got to get out of here.

268
00:12:04,551 --> 00:12:06,734
I know. I'll fake my own death.

269
00:12:06,735 --> 00:12:09,204
I just need enough blood
to make it look real.

270
00:12:09,205 --> 00:12:10,738
Hey there!
You must be Huck.

271
00:12:10,739 --> 00:12:11,940
Great to finally
meet you.

272
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:13,141
I hope you
like it here.

273
00:12:13,142 --> 00:12:14,676
I'm gonna stab you
for your blood.

274
00:12:14,677 --> 00:12:17,479
Oh, come on! I just got shot
in the pool in the last one.

275
00:12:22,936 --> 00:12:26,154
I can't remember
why I needed the blood.

276
00:12:33,113 --> 00:12:34,829
Lord, I'm-a tell ya,

277
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,965
being a slave is
a much worse job

278
00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:38,967
than the temp agency
made it sound.

279
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:40,502
You gonna eat
all that possum?

280
00:12:40,503 --> 00:12:42,303
I am. My name's Huck Finn.

281
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:43,705
What's half of your name?

282
00:12:43,706 --> 00:12:45,373
Jim. Nice to meet you.

283
00:12:45,374 --> 00:12:46,975
I'm a runaway slave.

284
00:12:46,976 --> 00:12:48,576
I'm runnin' away
'cause people want me

285
00:12:48,577 --> 00:12:50,311
to wear shoes
and comb my hair.

286
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:52,997
So I guess we got
the exact same problem.

287
00:12:56,035 --> 00:12:58,153
Hey, what's that sound?

288
00:12:58,154 --> 00:13:00,822
Oh, no!
It sounds like...

289
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:03,892
a waterfall!

290
00:13:03,893 --> 00:13:05,860
Hold on!

291
00:13:14,254 --> 00:13:16,521
<i>We died.</i>

292
00:13:18,224 --> 00:13:19,707
So wait.
We<i> didn't</i> die?

293
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,759
I don't know.
It's all just jokes.

294
00:13:28,735 --> 00:13:30,285
- Ah! Did you see that?
- What?

295
00:13:30,286 --> 00:13:32,387
I just skipped that
rock six times!

296
00:13:32,388 --> 00:13:34,055
That's a once-in-
a-lifetime skip!

297
00:13:34,056 --> 00:13:36,257
- That's nice.
- You don't believe me, do ya?

298
00:13:36,258 --> 00:13:38,593
I believe we've been
out here a long time,

299
00:13:38,594 --> 00:13:41,396
and a man's mind begins
to play tricks on him.

300
00:13:41,397 --> 00:13:42,630
It happened for real!

301
00:13:42,631 --> 00:13:44,766
I can't believe
you didn't see it!

302
00:13:44,767 --> 00:13:46,367
<i>Of course I saw it.</i>

303
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:49,237
<i>Most amazing damn thing
I ever did witness.</i>

304
00:13:49,238 --> 00:13:51,573
<i>But I wasn't gonna tell Huck,
'cause he claimed</i>

305
00:13:51,574 --> 00:13:54,108
<i>he didn't see me hook-shot
that apple core</i>

306
00:13:54,109 --> 00:13:56,778
<i>into the garbage
from way far away.</i>

307
00:13:56,779 --> 00:13:58,546
Hello, friends.

308
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:00,615
Why are you so friendly?
You con men?

309
00:14:00,616 --> 00:14:02,150
No, we're businessmen.

310
00:14:02,151 --> 00:14:04,152
We're fake-selling
the Brooklyn Bridge.

311
00:14:04,153 --> 00:14:05,553
Don't say
"fake-selling."

312
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:07,655
We're real-selling
the Brooklyn Bridge.

313
00:14:07,656 --> 00:14:08,957
Stop qualifying
the selling.

314
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,625
We're just selling
the Brooklyn Bridge.

315
00:14:10,626 --> 00:14:12,460
- I'll buy it.
- Hold on, now, Huck.

316
00:14:12,461 --> 00:14:14,395
These fellas
<i>are</i> con men.

317
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:15,964
Push off,
you grifters.

318
00:14:15,965 --> 00:14:18,032
We don't want
to ever see you again.

319
00:14:18,033 --> 00:14:19,584
Fine, we're going!

320
00:14:22,822 --> 00:14:25,640
It's a river... we can't
control how fast it goes.

321
00:14:25,641 --> 00:14:27,658
We can barely steer!

322
00:14:31,598 --> 00:14:33,081
Sorry.

323
00:14:36,936 --> 00:14:39,487
Hey, what if it's spelled
with an A at the end of it?

324
00:14:39,488 --> 00:14:40,722
Is that okay?

325
00:14:40,723 --> 00:14:43,174
Jim? Jim?

326
00:14:45,678 --> 00:14:47,562
Jim? Jim?

327
00:14:47,563 --> 00:14:50,965
If you're looking for a gym,
Ye Olde Pump House is that way.

328
00:14:50,966 --> 00:14:53,935
Can't miss it.
Green light on a dock.

329
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:57,305
Tom Sawyer? What are you
doing so far from home?

330
00:14:57,306 --> 00:14:59,307
Rush is playing
here tonight.

331
00:14:59,308 --> 00:15:01,309
They wrote a
song about me.

332
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,645
Oh. Well, I'm looking
for my friend, Jim.

333
00:15:03,646 --> 00:15:05,847
Huck! Great news!
I'm free!

334
00:15:05,848 --> 00:15:08,116
You are? That's awesome!
When did that happen?

335
00:15:08,117 --> 00:15:09,784
It's just being
revealed now,

336
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:12,053
but it happened
hundreds of pages ago.

337
00:15:12,054 --> 00:15:13,721
Oh. Huh. Weird.

338
00:15:13,722 --> 00:15:15,890
So, uh, what's left to do?

339
00:15:15,891 --> 00:15:17,392
I'll tell you what:

340
00:15:17,393 --> 00:15:18,960
Rush concert!

341
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:32,373
Hey. I'm Mark Twain.

342
00:15:32,374 --> 00:15:34,042
Pretty cool book, huh?

343
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:39,358
Well, while I'm being
booked and processed downtown,

344
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:42,633
we have time for one more
classic of American literature.

345
00:15:42,634 --> 00:15:44,885
This one's about
idiots choking rodents.

346
00:15:44,886 --> 00:15:46,987
I give you<i> Of Mice and Men.</i>

347
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:49,023
- Read him his rights.
- You know what?

348
00:15:49,024 --> 00:15:51,025
I'm like to read 'em myself.

349
00:15:51,026 --> 00:15:54,128
"Chapter one:
eat my ass, pigs."

350
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:56,380
Aah! The bones in my nose!

351
00:16:04,323 --> 00:16:09,109
Wow. I remember when this used
to be all orange groves.

352
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:12,396
It's... it's currently
all orange groves.

353
00:16:15,634 --> 00:16:17,918
Tell me again about
our dream, George.

354
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,320
All right, all right.

355
00:16:19,321 --> 00:16:21,722
We're going to open a
bed-and-breakfast in the country,

356
00:16:21,723 --> 00:16:24,325
and we won't be afraid
to let our guests know

357
00:16:24,326 --> 00:16:26,527
that we are Steelers fans
in<i> this</i> house.

358
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:29,430
- What about the rabbits?
- Yeah, we'll have rabbits, too.

359
00:16:29,431 --> 00:16:31,765
But we'll also have a sign
in the front that says,

360
00:16:31,766 --> 00:16:33,867
"Steelers fan parking only."

361
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:36,537
And sometimes we'll give
our guests a fake hard time.

362
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,806
Like if they're Jets fans,
we'll be all like,

363
00:16:38,807 --> 00:16:40,941
"Okay,
I hope you don't get towed."

364
00:16:40,942 --> 00:16:42,109
But obviously, you know,

365
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,827
of course, we're
not gonna tow 'em.

366
00:16:53,706 --> 00:16:54,888
Hey there, strangers.

367
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,557
Welcome to Phelps Ranch.

368
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:58,959
- People call me Slim.
- Ironically, I assume.

369
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,494
Listen, we're looking
for field work,

370
00:17:00,495 --> 00:17:02,296
uh, if you need
any extra hands.

371
00:17:02,297 --> 00:17:04,498
Well, three of our guys
did just get squished,

372
00:17:04,499 --> 00:17:06,717
so we just might.
Come on in.

373
00:17:07,886 --> 00:17:10,104
So, have you done this
kind of work before?

374
00:17:10,105 --> 00:17:12,072
Have we pulled an object
off a plant

375
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,841
and placed it
in a burlap bag?

376
00:17:13,842 --> 00:17:16,844
Yes, I think we understand
the nuances of this profession.

377
00:17:16,845 --> 00:17:19,246
Good, good. And how about you?
Tell me about yourself.

378
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:22,549
I like to kill animals
and then a lady.

379
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:25,669
I got a good feeling
about you guys.

380
00:17:28,974 --> 00:17:31,091
All right, you guys
are doing great.

381
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,793
Hey, listen,
my dog just had puppies,

382
00:17:32,794 --> 00:17:35,996
and I thought, since you're covered
with feces and I barely know you,

383
00:17:35,997 --> 00:17:39,032
I'd give you a delicate,
snow-white, newborn puppy.

384
00:17:39,033 --> 00:17:40,968
Okay, just don't give me
to Dead-Eyes over there,

385
00:17:40,969 --> 00:17:42,369
'cause I've already
been killed twice

386
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,904
in the other two stories,
and I don't want...

387
00:17:43,905 --> 00:17:45,739
- Puppy!
- Aw,!

388
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,527
This puppy doesn't work!

389
00:17:52,064 --> 00:17:54,615
Well, well, well...

390
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:56,483
As you can tell by
the "well, well, well",

391
00:17:56,484 --> 00:17:57,551
he's the bad guy.

392
00:17:57,552 --> 00:17:59,720
Looks like we got us
some new employees.

393
00:17:59,721 --> 00:18:01,555
That's right, Curley,
I hired 'em this morning.

394
00:18:01,556 --> 00:18:02,956
Well, tell 'em to get out.

395
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,659
This is where I practice
my karate, 'cause I'm a dick.

396
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,961
I understand you like
to pick fruit.

397
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,597
You ever pick something
bruised and pear-shaped?

398
00:18:10,598 --> 00:18:13,100
Fruit has seeds you can poo out!

399
00:18:13,101 --> 00:18:15,669
Hey, Hodor, stop coming on
to my slutty wife!

400
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:18,272
Look, I can tell by the
fact that you wear a single,

401
00:18:18,273 --> 00:18:21,175
Vaseline-filled leather glove
that you're a reasonable man.

402
00:18:21,176 --> 00:18:23,343
So, let's all take a deep
breath and calm down.

403
00:18:23,344 --> 00:18:25,045
No!
Karate chop!

404
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,217
Damn it!

405
00:18:30,218 --> 00:18:32,419
I tuck my jeans into my boots!

406
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,838
I'll get you,
you stupid, giant moron.

407
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:38,625
Not great timing, I know,

408
00:18:38,626 --> 00:18:41,478
but can I leave early
for a dentist appointment?

409
00:18:45,184 --> 00:18:46,934
So, I should be home by 10:00.

410
00:18:46,935 --> 00:18:49,203
It's just this
piano-bar-slash-cabaret place

411
00:18:49,204 --> 00:18:50,237
called "Tinkles."

412
00:18:50,238 --> 00:18:51,572
Rory told me about it.

413
00:18:51,573 --> 00:18:52,840
Who's Rory?

414
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:54,041
You remember him.

415
00:18:54,042 --> 00:18:55,642
The field hand who gave me
a shoulder ride

416
00:18:55,643 --> 00:18:56,677
back to the house?

417
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:57,878
That was Rory.

418
00:18:57,879 --> 00:18:59,713
Anyway, it sounds like
it's just a hoot.

419
00:18:59,714 --> 00:19:03,784
Wow, maybe you'll meet a pretty
lady to get married to there.

420
00:19:03,785 --> 00:19:05,986
Yeah, well, that's the idea.

421
00:19:05,987 --> 00:19:08,522
While you're gone,
can I touch myself?

422
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:11,024
Uh, again, you don't have
to schedule that with me.

423
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:12,693
But remember,
if there's any trouble,

424
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:14,895
we meet by the big tree
on the edge of town.

425
00:19:14,896 --> 00:19:17,297
Everything in my
head is screaming.

426
00:19:17,298 --> 00:19:20,617
All right, then, I am off.

427
00:19:24,056 --> 00:19:25,539
Well, hello there.

428
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,841
If it isn't the sexy imbecile.

429
00:19:27,842 --> 00:19:29,109
Oh, hi.

430
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,678
Sorry about what I did
to your husband earlier.

431
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,515
Yes, that was quite
a hand job you did on him.

432
00:19:34,516 --> 00:19:37,618
You know, I'm not so bad
at those myself.

433
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:38,886
I'm not gonna lie to you,

434
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:41,588
you're wasting your
double entendres on me.

435
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:43,490
I want you to destroy me.

436
00:19:43,491 --> 00:19:44,725
Okay!

437
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:55,068
♪ Jeepers creepers ♪

438
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:57,504
♪ Where'd you get
those peepers ♪

439
00:19:57,505 --> 00:20:00,240
♪ Jeepers creepers ♪

440
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:02,409
♪ Where'd you get those eyes ♪

441
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:05,145
Thank you, thank you.

442
00:20:05,146 --> 00:20:08,482
Oh, I just love a song that
explains what it just said.

443
00:20:10,852 --> 00:20:13,153
All right, evidently
I have to go to the big tree

444
00:20:13,154 --> 00:20:15,155
on the edge of town
to take care of something.

445
00:20:15,156 --> 00:20:16,156
This shouldn't take too long.

446
00:20:16,157 --> 00:20:19,259
Do not take my songs
off the list.

447
00:20:23,982 --> 00:20:26,667
I'm sorry, George,
I didn't mean to kill the girl,

448
00:20:26,668 --> 00:20:29,369
and now the whole town's
gonna hang me by a rope.

449
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,204
Oh, I would never
let that happen.

450
00:20:31,205 --> 00:20:32,539
Thanks.

451
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,275
- Tell me about the rabbits, George.
- Yeah, sure thing.

452
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,277
But while I do that, why
don't you face away from me

453
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:38,545
and count the stars.

454
00:20:38,546 --> 00:20:41,048
Okay.

455
00:20:41,049 --> 00:20:43,850
All right, so the B&B will
have a rack of single-gear bikes

456
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:46,520
for every guest, and yes,
next to that, of course,

457
00:20:46,521 --> 00:20:48,989
is going to be
the big, giant rabbit hutch.

458
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,640
Buh-bye, Lennie.

459
00:20:51,677 --> 00:20:52,826
Goodnight, kids.

460
00:20:52,827 --> 00:20:54,260
Good luck with
those book reports.

461
00:20:54,373 --> 00:20:57,242
