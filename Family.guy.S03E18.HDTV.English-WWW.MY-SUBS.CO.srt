Thanks for coming, Lois. Mark's wanted me
to see his one-man show for weeks.

11
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,000
I think it's wonderful
you're supporting your old pal.

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,010
Go long, Eddie. Go long.

13
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,090
Further. Further!

14
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,970
Ahhh...

15
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,180
Life was crazy growing up in Brooklyn.

16
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,140
We had some real characters in my
neighbourhood, like Frank the mailman.

17
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,770
Hey, Mark.
The ants for your ant farm came today.

18
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,070
And my friend Lonny - that knucklehead.

19
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,570
Yo, Marky! Let's play some b-ball.

20
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,110
B-ball. That's what we called it.

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,830
And my grandma -
boy, was she somethin' else.

22
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:18,250
Marky,
don't forget to take your cod-liver oil.

23
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,010
What a piece of self-indulgent crap.
All the characters sounded the same.

24
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,800
- Great show.
- You did me perfectly.

25
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,090
Me too. You are so talented.

26
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,970
That was awful. With practice
I could act circles around that guy.

27
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,350
Oh, yeah? Well, put up or shut up.

28

"This Thursday, auditions for
the Quahog School of Performing Arts. "

29
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,070
- You should try out.
- That's not a bad idea, Lois.

30
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:46,110
Ready for the best acting
you've seen all night?

31
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,040
Mark! Wow, what a journey! Thank you.
Those three and a half hours just flew by.

32
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:59,040
Hey, Santos, Pascoal. You've done such
good work today, I got a surprise for you.

33
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,010
Doritos!

34
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,300
Not now. Later.

35
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,440
Help! Help!

36
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,020
Oh, my God!

37
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:26,450
Thank you. I was boogie-boarding
and I got sucked out by the riptide.

38
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,200
- I thought I was a dead man.
- You gotta be starving. Eat these.

39
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,710
My God! He was just floating
out there by himself?

40
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,680
Yep. He was so grateful,
he invited us all over for dinner tonight.

41
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,430
Good. I don't have to cook.

42
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,890
Cook anyway and we'll throw it out.
I don't want you to get rusty.

43
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:53,060
Peter, my audition's coming up.
Would you listen to my monologue?

44
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,570
Sure, buddy. Let's hear it.

45
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:01,700
- Julie, there's somethin' I gotta tell you...
- Ha! That's awesome. Go on.

46
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:07,330
- Uh... tell you. I saw Dr Philips...
- Wow! Yes! Yes! I love it.

47
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,080
...Dr Philips today.
I might not make it to Christmas.

48
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,550
Oh, drop the bomb. There's not
a dry eye in the house. Keep goin'.

49
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,470
No. I'm gonna stop.
Maybe we'll work on it later.

50
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:21,510
Well, just so you know, it was good,
but I was also being generous.

51
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,940
Well, you little jaybird! You wanna tell your
mommy and daddy the Griffins are here?

52
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,310
Come on in.

53
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,980
Welcome, Griffins.

54
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,490
Oh... uh...

55
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:39,160
- We must be early.
- Nonsense. You're right on time.

56
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,120
Oh, my God! She's got hair growin'
out of her boobs and up to her head.

57
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,620
You're, uh... You're completely...

58
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:49,380
- Nude? Yes, we're nudists.
- Permission to freak out.

59
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,800
- Peter, did you know this?
- I thought he lost his bathing suit.

60
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,680
So you're the man who saved
my husband's life. Dottie Campbell.

61
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,800
- What am I doing? Come here!
- Watch my hands, Lois.

62
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,970
See where they are? No touchie.

63
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:08,560
This is the back yard. That's premium
blue-tip Bermuda. Real hardy, but soft.

64
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,150
- Good Lord.
- Don't look directly into it, Lois.

65
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,490
The hot dogs and burgers are ready.
Can I get you a beer, Peter?

66
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,530
- What do you got?
- I've got Busch.

67
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,870
Oh, and Busch Light.

68
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:21,790
Sounds like Jeff's home.

69
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,040
- Hey, sport! How'd you do?
- I got first place, Dad.

70
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,710
Way to go, champ. Jeff plays
varsity tennis for Saint Genevieve High.

71
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,760
- Cool.
- Is this the biggest thing you've ever seen?

72
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,720
Don't get too cocky. I had a big one
like that when I was your age.

73
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,680
You were a show-off yourself, Dave.
You brought it out on our first date.

74
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,190
Lois, I'm scared. Oh, I'll get that.

75
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,310
Hey!

76
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,440
Oh, God! Oh, Dave, sorry! Oh, God!

77
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,570
- Boobies!
- That's enough. I'm glad to be out of there.

78
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,490
What those people are doing
just ain't natural.

79
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,660
- Boobies!
- Did you hear me, young man?

80
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,790
- What was the big deal? They were nice.
- Boobies!

81
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,670
- Peter.
- Do it.

82
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:09,340
- Did you have fun at the circus today, Chris?
- Elephants are bigger in person.

83
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,730
- Break a leg up there, Brian.
- You seem awfully enthusiastic.

84
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:23,310
At first I wanted you to fail. But then
I realised you'd be out five days a week,

85
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,440
which means I'd be free to throw
some of my sexy parties.

86
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,120
- Brian Griffin.
- Good luck, Brian.

87
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,920
Hi. I'm Brian Griffin, and this is
from John Waltz's Leaving Wichita.

88
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,340
Julie, there's somethin' I gotta tell you.

89
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,520
I saw Dr Philips today.
I might not make it to Christmas.

90
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,100
- Thank you. Next.
- Next?

91
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,520
Hold on, Brian. Stay up there.

92
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,900
See here! Brian Griffin is a brilliant actor
with talent and passion.

93
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,700
But you alleged experts
obviously didn't notice.

94
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,780
Well, I did notice.
I saw a man bare his soul up here.

95
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,790
His pain ran through my heart
like an errant locomotive.

96
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,830
But it was wasted. Wasted on all of you!

97
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,920
Well, it looks like we have to
reconsider. Brian, we want you...

98
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,920
- Yes!
... off the stage.

99
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:28,090
But your young friend would be perfect
for our rising-star programme.

100
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,520
Splendid! This calls for a sexy party.

101
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,690
OK, funcakes, let's do a scene.

102
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:47,070
Stewie, how about you and, let's see...
one of our veterans... Olivia.

103
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,080
I'm not doing a scene with him.
He's inexperienced.

104
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,290
He'll drag my whole performance down.

105
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,670
Are you serious? Is she serious?

106
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,790
OK, Stewie, I'll give you a solo exercise.

107
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:02,170
You're gonna do an exercise we call
"The Life Cycle". Without using words,

108
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,350
you're gonna act out your entire life
from birth to death as I describe it.

109
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,850
Ready? Lie down.

110
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:13,850
Now you're being born. Ready?
And burst through the placenta!

111
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:18,360
Now fast-forward. It's your first day of school.
You're alone and scared.

112
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,900
But it's all right. It's Sloppy Joe day.

113
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,740
Pull it back. The lady touched the bun
and she's not wearing gloves.

114
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,410
Fast-forward. You're a businessman,
you manage a lot of people.

115
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,670
Here comes Henderson.
He lost the big account. You're mad.

116
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:36,090
Madder. Madder!

117
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,380
Come on. Hot, hot.
There it is. You got it.

118
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:42,010
And fast-forward. You're an old man now.
You're on your deathbed.

119
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:45,680
Your son is holding your hand.
You tell him you accept his lifestyle

120
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:50,480
and regret humiliating him at his sister's
wedding by calling him your other daughter.

121
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,690
And... scene. OK, any comments?

122
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:58,490
You are the weakest link. Goodbye.

123
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:04,120
Ha, ha, ha! Oh, gosh, that's funny.
That's really funny.

124
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,200
Do you write your own material?

125
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:09,670
That is so fresh.
"You are the weakest link. Goodbye. "

126
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,710
I've never heard anyone make
that joke before. You're the first.

127
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,800
I've never heard anyone reference that
outside the programme before.

128
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,260
That's what she says on the show, right?
"You are the weakest link. Goodbye. "

129
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:29,270
You've taken that and used it out of context
to insult me in this everyday situation.

130
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,900
What a clever, smart girl you must be

131
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,820
to come up with a joke like that
all by yourself.

132
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,030
Mm. That's so fresh, too.

133
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,620
Any Titanic jokes you want to throw at me

134
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,000
while we're hitting these phenomena
at the height of their popularity?

135
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,000
Cos I'm here.

136
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,170
God, you're so funny!

137
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,340
- Meg?
- Jeff! Wow, hey!

138
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,970
- What are you doing here?
- They had a sale on Super Soakers.

139
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,310
Agh! What the heck...?

140
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:05,770
- Nudist!
- My dad's a tailor, you jerk!

141
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,230
- Gosh, that's awful.
- That's all right. I'm used to it.

142
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,610
I'd better go. So, um... would you
wanna do something sometime?

143
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:19,200
- Sure. That'd be great.
- Cool. I'll call you later.

144
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,510
Holy moly! It must be my birthday.

145
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,150
Thank you. Thank you. That was, um...

146
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,240
"Me Farting" by Chopin.

147
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,910
Thank you. Thank you very...

148
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,590
- So, Olivia. Beautiful day.
- You're not gonna fart again, are you?

149
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:10,300
Well, I'd love to stay and chat,
but you're a total bitch.

150
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,900
The quarterly review's tomorrow.
Think your kids will pass?

151
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,860
I'll tell you who won't.
It starts with an O and rhymes with Bolivia.

152
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,360
- Give up? Olivia.
- Really?

153
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,410
She's such a frosty box.
She won't work with anybody.

154
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:33,870
Stewie Griffin is also on the fence.
If he and Olivia don't deliver at their reviews,

155
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,210
I'll have to kick their
cute little bottoms out of here.

156
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,630
This table is reserved for people with talent.

157
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,590
Stow the 'tude, queenie.
You and I have a problem. Read it and weep.

158
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,140
- "Doesn't work well with others"?
- Mine's no better.

159
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:57,150
I'll spare you the details, but the phrase
"garden variety" appears a number of times.

160
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:00,150
- What am I going to do?
- What are we going to do?

161
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:03,690
Our evaluation's tomorrow.
You need someone to work with,

162
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,110
and I need someone to make me look good.

163
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,410
- I don't know.
- Fine. Refuse my offer.

164
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:11,330
Get booted out
and wind up like Linda Evans.

165
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:16,120
Linda Evans, we have a spill in aisle 9.
Linda Evans, a spill in aisle 9.

166
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,760
- Do you like yours with crust or without?
- How do you like yours?

167
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,720
Let's both answer at the same time.
One, two, three.

168
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,850
- Without.
- Without.

169
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,760
Holy moly! That's eight things
we have in common.

170
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,890
- Kids, we're home.
- Hello, Mr and Mrs Griffin.

171
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:36,360
- You remember Jeff?
- Sure. Lois, I'm gonna borrow your mace.

172
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,020
Agh! That's better.

173
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:41,440
Meg, did any of the neighbours
see Jeff come over?

174
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:44,070
Mom! Come on, Jeff.
Let's go in the other room.

175
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,870
Now, Meg, no need to get so testes... testy.

176
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,080
Oh, nuts... I mean crap!

177
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,920
- You wanna sit down?
- Wait a second. Don't sit down yet.

178
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,000
- Dad, what are you doing?
- I'm, uh... keepin' the couch fresh.

179
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,550
- Dad!
- It's OK, Meg.

180
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:01,170
I understand what's goin' on. I'm gonna go.

181
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,300
Oh! Just step on these coasters
on your way out.

182
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,560
Don't step on the hot lava.
The carpet is hot lava.

183
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,480
I can't believe you guys!

184
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,190
How could you bring
that naked kid to our house?

185
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:17,030
Because I like him. He remembers my name.

186
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:21,200
I'm sorry, honey, but we don't think
you should see him any more.

187
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,740
I hate the sound of her cryin'.

188
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,540
You know what sounds even worse?

189
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,830
Ahh! Listen to that.

190
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,380
Don't you hate that?

191
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,880
That is awful.

192
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:40,470
I think it's easier on me
cos I'm the one makin' the sound.

193
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,350
Nice effort, Brad. But let's remember
our performance hierarchy:

194
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,440
Legitimate theatre, musical,
stand-up, ventriloquism, magic, mime.

195
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,400
Next up is Olivia. Liv, what monologue
are you doing for us this time?

196
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:58,410
I'm not doing a monologue.
I'm doing a piece with Stewie.

197
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,910
A duet? Really? Let's see it.

198
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:04,040
Five, six, seven, eight.

199
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,090
- " Who's got the greatest gal around?
- " You do

200
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:13,630
- " Who's got the sweetest man in town?
- " You do

201
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,010
"Who's got a guy
who makes her smile all day?

202
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,720
By the way, I'm not so bad to look at either.

203
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,270
- " Who's got a guy with lots of brains?
- " You do

204
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:27,810
- " Who's got a girl who loves chow mein?
- " You do

205
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,650
"Who's got the greatest love in the world?

206
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,610
- " You do
- " And you do

207
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,280
"Thank goodness I've got you

208
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,820
- " Who's got a guy to tell her jokes?
- " You do

209
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,370
- " Who's got a girl to show the folks?
- " You do

210
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,120
"Who's got a girl
he'd like to one day undress?

211
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:49,210
"Give it a rest -
I told you not until we're married

212
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,760
- " Who's got the gal with all the snazz?
- " You do

213
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,390
- " Who's got the fella with pizzazz?
- " You do

214
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:00,770
"Who's got the greatest love in the world?

215
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,850
- " You do
- " And you do

216
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:10,070
"Thank goodness I've got you

217
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,070
Watch this. Are you watching?

218
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,620
That's for me ever having
doubted you. A-plus!

219
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:23,630
That's for you wearing purple pants
with blue socks. Eww!

220
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,500
I totally called him on it.

221
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:33,300
No secrets. I wanna share
Stewie and Olivia with the world.

222
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,430
They're awfully young.
Is this really a good idea?

223
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,100
It's a great idea. I've always
dreamed of becoming an actress.

224
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,860
That's not why I'm pushing Olivia.
Is it suspicious that I said that?

225
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,030
Well, I guess it might be OK.

226
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:50,110
Sure, Lois. Look at Elroy Jetson. He was
a child actor and he turned out fine.

227
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,490
Do you know who I am? I'm Elroy Jetson.

228
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,000
Yeah, yeah. Come back
when you have some money.

229
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,500
- Take him home, Bamm-Bamm.
- Bamm-Bamm, bam!

230
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,920
I don't wanna go home.
Take me to Astro's grave.

231
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,010
- " You do
- " And you do

232
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:14,100
"Thank goodness I've got you

233
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,650
Do you hear that? They love us!

234
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,780
- Yes, we're a hit. You were amazing.
- So were you.

235
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,200
It was a good crowd. They didn't
notice you missed that F sharp.

236
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,700
- Yes, well... Beg pardon?
- The F sharp, darling. You were slightly off.

237
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:36,710
- I'm sure I wasn't.
- Well, maybe it was me.

238
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,000
- Must've been you.
- I was being sarcastic.

239
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:41,710
- Well, it wasn't me.
- Well, it wasn't me.

240
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,060
Like this. Listen to me.

241
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,770
Hi, Meg.

242
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,860
Peter, was it unfair of us to tell Meg
she couldn't see that boy?

243
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:05,610
Completely. We totally reamed her. Did you
see that look in her eyes? She hates you.

244
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,710
There it is, kids. Your first marquee.
Meet you inside.

245
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,510
- Exciting.
- The marquee or the other thing?

246
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,840
- What other thing?
- The sex... with Simon.

247
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:26,970
- Why else would your name be first?
- It's obvious.

248
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,930
Lead with strength, put your best foot
forward, et cetera, et cetera.

249
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,520
So the sex was good?

250
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,570
- Shut up, you egotistical jerk.
- You shut up, you sack-bellied strumpet!

251
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,280
- Blimp-headed jackass!
- Mealy-mouthed crotch pheasant!

252
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:46,490
"Thank goodness I've got you

253
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,960
Jeff! What are you doing here?
I'm not supposed to see you.

254
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,670
- Your parents invited me.
- But they wouldn't...

255
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,470
- Yes, we would.
- Oh, my God! What are you doing?!

256
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:01,930
We were wrong, Meg. If you like Jeff,
we should give him a chance.

257
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,310
We wanted him to feel welcome in our home.

258
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:07,220
Mom, I need new batteries for my Walkman.

259
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:10,270
Hey! Why is everybody else naked?

260
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,690
Yahtzee! I win!

261
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:16,940
Yeah! In your face! In your face! In your face!

262
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,320
- I gotta go. Thanks, Mr and Mrs Griffin.
- Our pleasure.

263
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,780
Nice hanging with you.

264
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:27,790
- I hope my parents didn't embarrass you.
- Are you kidding? I think they're great.

265
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:31,750
It took a lot of guts for them to do that.
I'll see you later.

266
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,380
Thanks, you guys. That was really cool.

267
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:39,340
Peter, can I borrow your lawn mower?
Agh... You got a towel?

268
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:43,310
Simon, would you be a dear and ask Stewie
to dance on his own feet tonight?

269
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:47,060
Could you provide Olivia with a bucket
so she can carry a tune?

270
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,150
People, stop this craziness!

271
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:53,940
The Providence Journal's critic is here.
If we get a good review, the doors'll fly open.

272
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,030
Go get 'em, my little silly-billies.

273
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,530
- Let's just get through this.
- Fine with me.

274
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:03,870
Wait a minute. You're wearing ruby lipstick.
You're painted up like some jezebel.

275
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:07,420
You're one to talk. You've been
stuffing your diaper since day one.

276
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,590
It's where I keep my peppermint Mentos.

277
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:14,380
Just because your breath reeks of rotten
Lunchables doesn't mean mine has to.

278
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,490
Break it up! Break it up!

279
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:36,910
I don't need this act and I don't need you.
You've done nothing but hold me back. I quit!

280
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:39,410
All I've held you back from is failure.

281
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,250
Come on, Simon.
We don't need that Bebe No-worth.

282
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:47,250
I don't know, Stewie. Without Olivia, this act
is like Fire Island after Labor Day: Over.

283
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,170
Fine. I don't need you.
I can manage my own career.

284
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,390
Yes. Yes, I'm quite capable of that.

285
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,060
"I've got my top hat and cane

286
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:07,360
"And a pocketful of miracles,
pocketful of miracles

287
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,360
- Somebody get a hook!
- This is worse than Seussical!

288
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,080
No, wait. I was about to do this thing.

289
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,000
Oh, hello. Didn't notice you there.

290
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:29,180
It's not easy living with my family.
Bunch of characters, they are.

291
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:34,470
Like my father. "Holy crap, Lois.
Check out the freakin' log in the toilet. "

292
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,680
Get off the stage!

293
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,190
What do you say, Bernie?
Two nights at the old rate?

294
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:45,530
I told you before, kid,
I can't book you without Olivia.

295
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:49,070
But that's the good news.
We're back together. She's here.

296
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:54,410
Hi, Bernie. Glad to be back.
Ask Stewie about his sexy parties.

297
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,670
"Ask Stewie about his sexy parties. "
What were you thinking?

298
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,460
- I was...
- I'm not speaking to you.

299
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,590
- But...
- Shut up!

300
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,180
I guess the best advice I got
was from Marty Scorsese.

301
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,930
I was having a problem understanding
why I'd been taking abuse

302
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,350
from this lower-ranking officer
played by Chris O'Donnell.

303
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,360
And... he told me "You don't have to
understand it. Your character does. "

304
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,230
That always stuck with me.

305
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,950
- Stewie?
- Olivia! What are you doing here?

306
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:28,700
I must be an absolute mess.
The studio made me fire my make-up girl.

307
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:34,750
I just wanted to stop by and see how
you were doing. I heard some things...

308
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,250
That it's going great for me? You heard right.

309
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,380
- Glad to hear that.
- But, hey... um...

310
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,880
If you're not busy... what say
you and I get the old team back together?

311
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:48,430
Well, actually, I can't.
I'm on my way to Hollywood.

312
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:52,600
- I got this part in a movie and...
- Oh, oh, oh, oh... What am I thinking?

313
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,230
I'd love to, but I just... I'm booked solid.

314
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,570
I'm doing a three-episode guest shot
on The Gilmore Girls.

315
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:03,110
I play Rory's motorcycle-driving boyfriend.

316
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,080
He's a bad boy at heart,
but there's some good in there, Olivia.

317
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,290
And it comes through absolutely.

318
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:13,750
That's really good to hear, Stewie.
Please, take care of yourself.

319
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,340
See you on the coast.

320
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,090
- So, did you let him have it?
- No. He let himself have it.

321
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,770
This is it.

322
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,150
Hey. How ya doin', kid?

323
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:37,440
- Are you from Wardrobe?
- No, it's Brian. I brought what you wanted.

324
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:42,120
- But they won't let me leave it so...
- Hit it once. Please, just once.

325
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,490
Oh, my God. I was flat.

326
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:48,580
Help me up. Let's go home.
