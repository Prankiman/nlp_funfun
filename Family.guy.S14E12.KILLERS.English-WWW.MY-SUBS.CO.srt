to the NBA on TNT... on LSD.

00:00:40,016 --> 00:00:42,916
Man, I'm out my mind!

14
00:00:42,952 --> 00:00:46,754
Okay, my mom will be here
any minute for our spa day.

Yes, very good, Peter.

And remember, while we're
off getting our massages,

00:00:53,663 --> 00:00:55,629
you and Daddy are gonna
spend the day together here.

19
00:00:55,665 --> 00:00:57,631
Aw, I don't want
to hang out with him.

20
00:00:57,667 --> 00:00:59,466
He's, like, not
ticklish anywhere.

21
00:00:59,502 --> 00:01:01,468
Look, I'm sorry,
but my mom said

22
00:01:01,504 --> 00:01:03,303
he can't be left alone
at home anymore.

23
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:07,041

29
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:21,655
Hello, dear.

30
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:23,657
Oh, I always forget

31
00:01:23,693 --> 00:01:26,160
you walk right into
the living room in your house.

32
00:01:26,195 --> 00:01:27,594
Hey, do you have
a Band-Aid?

33
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,430
Nothing happened,
but I'm bleeding.

34
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:31,625
You know what, I'll just
rummage through your bathroom.

35
00:01:33,035 --> 00:01:34,835
(sighs) Man, spending
a whole day with him

36
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,037
is gonna be worse
than eating at a ball park.

37
00:01:37,073 --> 00:01:38,872
Uh, I'll take
one terrible beer,

38
00:01:38,908 --> 00:01:40,874
filled up way too high,
so I spill most of it,

39
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,711
and a too-long hot dog
on a too-short bun.

40
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:45,145
And do you have
mustard and relish?

41
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:46,780
Yeah, it's right there
between the entrance

42
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:48,182
and the exit to
the bathroom.

43
00:01:48,217 --> 00:01:50,184
Perfect. And can I get
a bag of unsalted peanuts?

44
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:51,618
You know, something
I would never eat

45
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:53,020
anywhere else in the world?

46
00:01:53,055 --> 00:01:54,021
Sure, here you go.

47
00:01:54,056 --> 00:01:55,656
Great, great.

48
00:01:55,691 --> 00:01:58,292
I can't wait to have diarrhea
in the stall with no door

49
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:00,661
while 20 guys wait
for me to finish.

50
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:06,800
(girls giggling) No.
Ah, no.

51
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:08,802
MEG: All right,
left cankle, red.

52
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:10,804
(girls giggling)

53
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,639
Right muffin top, blue.

54
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:14,641
(girls giggling)

55
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:16,043
(farting)

56
00:02:16,078 --> 00:02:17,478
GIRLS: Sorry.

57
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:19,713
Ugh, God, kill me.

58
00:02:19,749 --> 00:02:22,549
Stewie, I can't take any more
of Meg and her gross friends.

59
00:02:22,585 --> 00:02:23,984
Ah, ah,
hang on, hang on.

60
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,853
I'm just finishing up
an e-mail to Delta.

61
00:02:25,888 --> 00:02:28,689
"I have never not screamed
at the top of my lungs

62
00:02:28,724 --> 00:02:32,092
during air pressure changes, and
I do not intend to stop now."

63
00:02:32,128 --> 00:02:33,093
Okay, what was it?

64
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:34,728
Meg's friends.

65
00:02:34,764 --> 00:02:36,563
They're just so loud
and boring and annoying.

66
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,399
Well, not everybody can be
as fascinating as you, Brian.

67
00:02:39,435 --> 00:02:40,834
Thanks for coming by.

68
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,836
Hey, Brian, Mom
took the car.

69
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:45,239
Can you give me and my friends
a ride to field hockey practice?

70
00:02:45,274 --> 00:02:49,243
Uh, I'm kind of helping Stewie
with an e-mail to Delta.

71
00:02:49,278 --> 00:02:50,744
Please, Brian.

72
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,746
It would get them
out of the house.

73
00:02:52,782 --> 00:02:54,748
Well, that's true.
And I gotta do something,

74
00:02:54,784 --> 00:02:57,184
'cause they're more annoying
than ants at a picnic.

75
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,585
(ranchera music blaring)

76
00:02:58,621 --> 00:03:00,053
Would you mind
turning that down?

77
00:03:01,457 --> 00:03:02,856
(volume increases)

78
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:05,259
And you're not supposed
to be grilling.

79
00:03:05,294 --> 00:03:07,995
I know you can
understand me.

80
00:03:12,902 --> 00:03:16,470
So... what, uh, what
do you want to do?

81
00:03:16,505 --> 00:03:17,905
I don't know.

82
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,306
Sucks that we're
stuck here alone.

83
00:03:19,341 --> 00:03:21,742
Wait a minute,
here alone.

84
00:03:21,777 --> 00:03:23,610
You thinking what
I'm thinking?

85
00:03:23,646 --> 00:03:25,445
This was not
what I was thinking.

86
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:27,314
That's weird, it's not
what I was thinking either.

87
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:28,916
I don't even know
how it happened.

88
00:03:28,951 --> 00:03:30,918
No, me neither, but this
spaghetti's not half bad.

89
00:03:30,953 --> 00:03:32,953
A "happy mistake,"
we'll call it.

90
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:37,958
Now what do you
want to do?

91
00:03:37,993 --> 00:03:39,226
Well, we could
watch porn.

92
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:40,627
Have you heard
of porn?

93
00:03:40,663 --> 00:03:42,062
Is that something
you're aware of?

94
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,997
You have postcards
from France?!

95
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:45,632
No, no, no, like...
like, on the computer.

96
00:03:45,668 --> 00:03:47,434
There's like tons
and tons of videos

97
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:48,836
of people doing
it on there.

98
00:03:48,871 --> 00:03:50,270
Wait, l-let me understand:

99
00:03:50,306 --> 00:03:52,673
You want to watch
<i>that</i> with<i> me?</i>

100
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,508
Well, not anymore,
you just made it weird.

101
00:03:54,543 --> 00:03:56,076
But there's other
stuff on there.

102
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,345
You want to see a guy in
a human-sized hamster ball

103
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,346
roll off a mountain?

104
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:00,814
Uh, yeah.

105
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:04,618
So this is in Russia?

106
00:04:04,653 --> 00:04:06,453
Somebody's gonna
slow him down, right?

107
00:04:06,488 --> 00:04:07,855
Whoa!

108
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,690
(chuckles) I got
to e-mail that to Babs.

109
00:04:09,725 --> 00:04:10,924
She hates people.

110
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,926
Huh, got a new e-mail here.

111
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:14,928
And it's from a Nigerian prince.

112
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:17,764
It says he's got millions
frozen in an account.

113
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,767
All he needs is a hundred grand
to pay legal fees,

114
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:23,670
and then as soon as he gets his
money, I get a million bucks.

115
00:04:23,706 --> 00:04:25,672
Wow, and he must
need it quick,

116
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,674
'cause there was, like, a
bazillion typos in that e-mail.

117
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,109
You got to send
that money.

118
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,944
You think so?
Absolutely.

119
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,347
I mean, can you imagine if
you make a million bucks?

120
00:04:33,382 --> 00:04:35,682
You'll be happier than the
guy on his wedding day.

121
00:04:35,718 --> 00:04:37,117
Thanks, everyone.

122
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,518
Good-bye, Mom. Good-bye, Dad.

123
00:04:38,554 --> 00:04:40,354
Good-bye, friends.
Good-bye, free time.

124
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:43,190
Farewell, sex.
So long, golf on TV.

125
00:04:43,225 --> 00:04:45,025
I'll miss you, privacy.

126
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,461
Good-bye, being honest
about how many beers I've had.

127
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,296
Nice knowing you,
my own choices.

128
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:50,731
See ya later, money!

129
00:04:55,738 --> 00:04:56,904
Thanks for
the ride, Brian.

130
00:04:56,939 --> 00:04:58,338
Yeah, and thanks
for the lecture

131
00:04:58,374 --> 00:05:00,374
on what real music is,
Mr. Griffin.

132
00:05:02,878 --> 00:05:04,845
Geez, how many Snickers
could they eat

133
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,680
in a five-minute car ride?

134
00:05:06,715 --> 00:05:09,383
Ah, crap, somebody left
their gym bag.

135
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:14,655
God, it would've been real
easy to bring a gun in here.

136
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,957
Where the hell'd they go?

137
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,195
Oh, whoops.

138
00:05:22,264 --> 00:05:24,264
(sultry music playing)

139
00:05:27,603 --> 00:05:29,202
Wow.

140
00:05:31,573 --> 00:05:32,739
(gasps)

141
00:05:32,775 --> 00:05:34,174
Holy crap.

142
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,575
That was Patty.

143
00:05:35,611 --> 00:05:37,344
And she's got
a smokin' hot body.

144
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,413
This is a bigger surprise
than when I found out

145
00:05:39,448 --> 00:05:41,281
Joe was a clown.

146
00:05:41,317 --> 00:05:43,216
(car alarm chirps)

147
00:05:43,252 --> 00:05:45,252
JOE: I think
that belongs to me.

148
00:05:46,655 --> 00:05:48,622
I'm sorry you had
to find out this way.

149
00:05:48,657 --> 00:05:50,057
Okay.

150
00:05:50,092 --> 00:05:51,892
You won't tell
anyone, will you?

151
00:05:51,927 --> 00:05:52,893
No.

152
00:05:52,928 --> 00:05:55,295
You can tell people.

153
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:01,735
Hey, so how
was the spa?

154
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,137
Oh, it was fine, though
I don't know why they made us

155
00:06:04,173 --> 00:06:06,573
face each other during
the mother-daughter bikini wax.

156
00:06:06,608 --> 00:06:08,976
Did you two have

00:11:40,746 --> 00:11:44,882
All right, let's find our
"prince" and get my money back.

317
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:46,150
Get down!

318
00:11:46,185 --> 00:11:47,551
On the ground!
(yelps)

319
00:11:47,586 --> 00:11:48,819
This is unacceptable.

320
00:11:48,854 --> 00:11:50,688
I demand to speak
to Anthony Anderson.

321
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,559
(phone ringing)

322
00:11:55,594 --> 00:11:57,394
Okay, hold on.
Shoot me if you must,

323
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,663
but it is imperative
that I answer this call.

324
00:12:01,801 --> 00:12:03,300
Yello?

325
00:12:03,335 --> 00:12:04,868
Yes, this is Peter Griffin.

326
00:12:04,904 --> 00:12:08,205
Yes, I did call you about the
eight-piece lawn croquet set.

327
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,008
Now, it says "weathered,"
just how weathered is it?

328
00:12:11,043 --> 00:12:14,011
Yeah, go ahead and send me
a pic, that'd be very helpful.

329
00:12:14,046 --> 00:12:15,245
(phone chimes)

330
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:16,880
Sir, shoot me if you must,

331
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,483
but it is imperative
that I look at these pictures.

332
00:12:25,853 --> 00:12:27,085
The hell with this.

333
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,220
I'm getting my money back

334
00:12:28,255 --> 00:12:29,655
if it's the last
thing I do.

335
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,557
Hey, here's the guys.

336
00:12:31,592 --> 00:12:33,592
Who are you
and why are you here?

337
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,060
I'm Carter Pewterschmidt,

338
00:12:35,095 --> 00:12:36,862
and I'm here because
you stole my money!

339
00:12:36,897 --> 00:12:39,198
You?
You are Carter Pewterschmidt?

340
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:40,499
You're damn right I am!

341
00:12:40,534 --> 00:12:41,867
Oh! It's him!

342
00:12:41,902 --> 00:12:44,069
It's the Great Father
Pewterschmidt!

343
00:12:44,104 --> 00:12:46,438
What's happening?
What's he talking about?

344
00:12:46,473 --> 00:12:48,507
You are a great hero to us.

345
00:12:48,542 --> 00:12:50,242
It is with the money
that you sent

346
00:12:50,277 --> 00:12:51,877
that we have been able to make

347
00:12:51,912 --> 00:12:53,946
many wonderful improvements
to our village.

348
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:56,114
And he used my computer.

349
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,450
I'm Griff, by the way,
that's what everybody calls me.

350
00:12:58,485 --> 00:13:00,619
That's not true.
Nobody calls him that.

351
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,958
It was your money that
paid for the school,

352
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,594
a well to provide
clean drinking water,

353
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:10,796
our first health clinic,

354
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:13,398
and a Redbox with
one movie in it.

355
00:13:13,434 --> 00:13:14,867
It's<i> Baby Geniuses.</i>

356
00:13:14,902 --> 00:13:16,835
Which I, personally,
could begin watching

357
00:13:16,871 --> 00:13:18,904
at any point in the film
and enjoy from there.

358
00:13:18,939 --> 00:13:20,772
Oh, yeah, that's how
I feel about that video

359
00:13:20,808 --> 00:13:22,474
of Kelsey Grammer
fallin' off the stage.

360
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:23,809
I don't understand.

361
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,577
So there never was
a Nigerian prince?

362
00:13:25,613 --> 00:13:29,381
No. You see, no one will
actually give money to Africa

363
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:30,949
unless they are tricked into it.

364
00:13:30,985 --> 00:13:32,718
So again, we thank you

365
00:13:32,753 --> 00:13:34,620
for your generosity,
Father Pewterschmidt.

366
00:13:34,655 --> 00:13:36,121
Well, I hope you enjoyed it...

367
00:13:36,156 --> 00:13:37,389
'cause I'm taking it all back.

368
00:13:37,424 --> 00:13:38,156
What?
What?

369
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,324
You heard me!

370
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,592
Nobody steals
from Carter Pewterschmidt

371
00:13:40,628 --> 00:13:41,827
and gets away with it!

372
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,395
Carter, why you
bein' so mean?

373
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,630
The money's spent.

374
00:13:44,665 --> 00:13:46,632
And look how happy
you made these people.

375
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:48,734
Talk to me--
it's your buddy Griff.

376
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:50,335
Tear it all down! Now.

377
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,304
Or I'm canceling Kwanzaa.

378
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:53,572
What is Kwanzaa?

379
00:13:53,607 --> 00:13:55,507
Ah!
I knew it wasn't real!

380
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,612
Hey, there, babe.

381
00:14:00,648 --> 00:14:01,847
Hey, Brian.

382
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,282
You ready?

383
00:14:03,317 --> 00:14:05,150
Got the Smash Mouth
cued up in the Pri.

384
00:14:05,185 --> 00:14:06,425
Brian, what are you doing here?

385
00:14:06,453 --> 00:14:08,320
I'm here to
pick up Patty.

386
00:14:08,355 --> 00:14:10,355
We're going to see a movie
called<i> Brittany Finds a Lump.</i>

387
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,357
You're parked in
Mr. Tackleman's space.

388
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,959
You're going on a date
with Patty?

389
00:14:13,994 --> 00:14:15,427
I told you to back off.

390
00:14:15,462 --> 00:14:17,429
And since when
do you wear high-tops?

391
00:14:17,464 --> 00:14:18,430
What, my kicks?

392
00:14:18,465 --> 00:14:19,665
Ah, it's nothin'.

393
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,099
I just use these
for Instagram.

394
00:14:21,135 --> 00:14:22,334
That's something I like!

395
00:14:22,369 --> 00:14:23,602
Ah, shut up, Esther!

396
00:14:23,637 --> 00:14:25,337
All right, we're out of here.

397

warmer, keep that box hot.

Geez, I can't believe you're
going through with this, Carter.

401
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,157
Paying these thugs
to tear down the village

402
00:14:45,192 --> 00:14:46,391
isn't gonna bring
your money back.

403
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,026
This isn't about the money.

404
00:14:48,062 --> 00:14:50,395
This is payback for Sammy
Davis dating Kim Novak.

405

Oh, come on, Carter,
don't do this.

406
00:14:52,466 --> 00:14:54,399
You don't want to be

Are you about done?

409
00:14:57,004 --> 00:14:58,203
I'm supposed to go
lion shooting

00:15:15,522 --> 00:15:16,922
I won't stand by

and let you further ruin
this terrible place!

418

Oh, is that right?

419
00:15:20,361 --> 00:15:22,060
Yes, that is right.

420
00:15:22,096 --> 00:15:23,762
Here's 5,000 bucks.

421
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,063
Lock up that fat-ass.

422
00:15:30,604 --> 00:15:33,071
Damn it, this sucks.

423
00:15:33,107 --> 00:15:34,773
I may never get out of here.

424
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,843
Well, as a man
falsely imprisoned in Africa,

425
00:15:37,878 --> 00:15:40,579
I have no choice but to write
a memoir of my struggles.

426
00:15:40,614 --> 00:15:42,881
"Chapter One:

427
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:46,284
"Harry Potter's aunt and uncle
were super mean.

428

"'Spank me harder,' the lady
says to Fifty Shades of Grey.

"And then he turned her butt
inside out.

00:15:56,263 --> 00:15:58,196
Because, sexy."

433
00:15:58,232 --> 00:16:00,932
"'Isn't that special,'

Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.

00:16:27,928 --> 00:16:30,462
Our top story:
sinking newscaster.

444

Just kidding, it's the chair.

445
00:16:33,434 --> 00:16:36,501
But, in other news, domestic
abuse enthusiast Paul Simon

446
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:39,104
has released a new song
inspired by a memoir

447
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:41,440
written by Quahog's
own Peter Griffin,

448
00:16:41,475 --> 00:16:43,842
who has been falsely imprisoned
by his father-in-law

449
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,310
in an African jail.

450
00:16:45,345 --> 00:16:47,446
Oh, for God's sake.

451
00:16:47,481 --> 00:16:50,449
I bet there's not one word
about you in that book.

452
00:16:54,354 --> 00:16:56,254
Wow, what a beautiful night.

453
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,090
Yeah.

454
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,592
Hey, I wonder if any of those
stars are wishing on us, huh?

455
00:17:00,627 --> 00:17:02,594
You're so deep.

456
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:04,529
I betcha you're
pretty deep, too.

457
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,432
Aw, you're so sweet.

458
00:17:07,468 --> 00:17:09,434
Why are you so nice to me?

459
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,169
Most guys never give me
the time of day

460
00:17:11,205 --> 00:17:12,804
because I'm so plain-looking.

461
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,473
Well, I'm not
like most guys.

462
00:17:14,508 --> 00:17:15,974
I can see past
that sweater.

463
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:17,442
Speaking of which,

464
00:17:17,478 --> 00:17:19,158
why don't we get rid
of that big old thing?

465
00:17:20,314 --> 00:17:21,513
Brian, stop!

466
00:17:21,548 --> 00:17:23,215
You don't have
to do this, Patty.

467
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,950
Brian's just taking
advantage of you.

468
00:17:24,985 --> 00:17:26,451
What? That's crazy!

469
00:17:26,487 --> 00:17:28,553
What?
Why would he do that?

470
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,522
Because you have
an amazing body.

471
00:17:30,557 --> 00:17:31,790
I do?

472
00:17:31,825 --> 00:17:33,291
But... you're always saying

473
00:17:33,327 --> 00:17:35,794
dumpy girls like us
only have each other.

474
00:17:35,829 --> 00:17:37,362

you'd become popular

so can you maybe
just get out of here?

Meg, that's silly.

Hey, Pumpkin, welcome!

Whatever you do, don't tell
them you have a clitoris.

Yeah, they told me
that at the embassy.

Look, I'm sorry
you got swindled,

520
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,669
but you can't treat
people this way.

521
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,005
You let Peter out of
that jail right now.

families work, Lois.

Lois, how much was your flight

535
00:19:47,427 --> 00:19:48,793
and which card
did you put it on?

536
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:50,996
Daddy, I don't
understand any of this.

537
00:19:51,031 --> 00:19:52,897
I mean, you've
always been grouchy,

538
00:19:52,933 --> 00:19:55,433
but why are you being
so mean-spirited?

539
00:19:55,469 --> 00:19:57,168
What's gotten into you?

540
00:19:57,204 --> 00:19:59,604
What's gotten into me?
I'm angry!

541
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,206
For God's sake, I can't
even be left alone

542
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,841
in my own house
for an afternoon.

543
00:20:02,876 --> 00:20:04,643
You have to drop me
off at your house

544
00:20:04,678 --> 00:20:06,711
so this fat idiot
can babysit me!

545
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,546
I'm old and it sucks!

546
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,448
I'm sorry, Daddy.

547
00:20:10,484 --> 00:20:12,617
I realize growing old is no fun,

548
00:20:12,653 --> 00:20:14,686
but this is no way to act.

549
00:20:14,721 --> 00:20:16,054
I know.

550
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,123
I'm sorry I almost had you shot.

551
00:20:18,158 --> 00:20:19,357
Oh, that's all right.

552
00:20:19,393 --> 00:20:20,892
I got a fever
of a 108.

553
00:20:20,927 --> 00:20:22,627
I'm not gonna
remember any of this.

554
00:20:22,663 --> 00:20:25,030
And I'm sorry for what
I did to your village, Dave.

555
00:20:25,065 --> 00:20:26,298
His name is "Dave"?

556
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,700
Yeah. Get to know
these people, okay?

557
00:20:28,735 --> 00:20:30,835
Listen, when I get home,
I'll transfer enough money

558
00:20:30,871 --> 00:20:32,470
so you can rebuild your town.

559
00:20:32,506 --> 00:20:34,172
You've all been very kind.

560
00:20:34,207 --> 00:20:35,573
Yeah, this has been great, guys.

561
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,309
Now all I need is a group photo

562
00:20:37,344 --> 00:20:39,010
of me kneeling
in the front of the village,

563
00:20:39,046 --> 00:20:41,112
so I can brag about
what a good person I am.
