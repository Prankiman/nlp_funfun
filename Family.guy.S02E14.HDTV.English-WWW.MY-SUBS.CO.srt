00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,000
It seems today that all you see

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,400
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,000
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,100
On which we used to rely?

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,400
Lucky there's a family guy

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,400
Lucky there's a man who positively
can do all the things that make us

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,000
Laugh and cry

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:30,400
He's a family guy

9
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,800
Cuando la jefe oye de esto somos muertos! 

10
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,600
Recuerda si yo cierra la puerta
de la garaje esta manana? 

11
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,000
Dude, the Bronze Age
was so much cooler than the Iron Age.

12
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,400
The Iron Age could kick
the Bronze Age's butt any day of the week.

13
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,200
- Could not!
- Could too!

14
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,000
Ew, gross, man!

15
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,400
- You OK?
- Whoa! Everything's so... significant.

16
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,600
- Dude, you gotta try this.
- Not even! It's got your germs on it.

17
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,700
Not this end.

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,000
Ahh! I can see the air!
And you know what else?

19
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:57,000
I finally get Aaron Sorkin's Sports Night. 
It's a comedy that's too good to be funny.

20
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,100
Dude, you're trippin'!

21
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,700
Double the freshness, life is more fun

22
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,600
When you're chewing
the great taste of Doublefresh gum

23
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,800
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

24
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,400
With Doublefresh gum! 

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,700
Hey, we should go to the circus.

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,800
In local news, a new drug craze may have
Quahog students licked. It's called "toad". 

27
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,400
The Colombian spotted toad, to be precise. 

28
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:44,500
When licked, these toads trigger an intense
psychedelic euphoria that's... that's just great. 

29
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,800
This is awful. Now the drugs
are in the schools?

30
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,000
For you parents, toad-licking
is also known as lily-padding, 

31
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,400
Frenching the prince, and doing Kermit. 

32
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,200
Well, at least our kids know better.

33
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,700
What the...? Aargh!

34
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,700
Hello, little sea monkeys.

35
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,300
He's back. Don't look at him, honey.
Eat your potatoes.

36
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,600
- Steve, do something.
- Brenda, we've been over this.

37
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,900
Let's just pick up our plates
and go eat in the hollow castle.

38
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,300
- Young man, where did you get this toad?
- It's not mine.

39
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,200
Believe me, you don't wanna mess with
drugs. I tried 'em once-big mistake.

40
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,500
Things got way too real.

41
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,700
Holy crap, I am freakin' out!

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,500
Peter, may I? You're walking down a hallway.
You take a left. You keep walking.

43
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,000
- Take a right. Then a left. Brick wall!
- Yargh!

44
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,900
- Yeah, he's tweaked.
- Am not! Hey, maybe it's Meg's toad.

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,900
Oh, now, don't you try to palm this off
on your sister. She's a good girl.

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,300
Oh, yeah? What about the time
she strangled our other sister?

47
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,800
Now, Chris, we told you
that was just a very bad dream.

48
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,300
- But I remember it so...
- It was a dream!

49
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,900
- Mom, can you sign this for my field trip?
- Sure, sweetheart.

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,500
Meg, you have a wart!

51
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,600
How could you bring a toad into this house?

52
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,100
It's not mine. I was just holding it for a friend.

53
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,600
See... it was lunchtime.

54
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,400
OK, Connie, you're up.

55
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,200
Connie Demico does toad?

56
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,600
I guess Miss Wears-A-Hat-All-The-Time
is gonna nark on us, aren't you?

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,900
- Mr Berler's coming!
- Oh, man, we are so busted!

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Put it in here. He won't check me.

59
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:34,500
What's going on back here? Oh, hello, Megan.
Wait, you're not part of the popular clique.

60
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,500
Run along and play alone somewhere. Shame
on you all, getting her hopes up like that.

61
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,600
I thought if I held Connie's toad,

62
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,500
she'd make one of the cool guys
ask me to the Snow Ball.

63
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,200
You're holding drugs so someone
will invite you to a dance?

64
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,600
Meg, haven't we taught you better than that?

65
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,200
Hold on, Lois. People do a lot of
crazy things just to be accepted.

66
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,000
I don't know about this.

67
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,000
We all did it. If you want to be
a Supreme Court justice,

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,800
you gotta pick up that cherry
with your butt cheeks and drop it in that beer.

69
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,200
- Come on! Come on!
- Go, Suitor! Get busy!

70
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,000
- Go, Suitor! Go, Suitor!
- Cherry! Cherry! Cherry!

71
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,000
Oh, my God! I can't believe he did that!

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
- Go, Suitor! Go, Suitor!
- Get busy! Get busy!

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,600
Ohhh!

74
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,500
I can't believe he did that!

75
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,900
I can't believe he did that! This guy is so in!

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,100
Oh, sweetheart, I'm sure all the boys
wanna ask you to the dance.

77
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,400
They're probably just shy or scared.

78
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,400
Yeah, I was terrified of askin'
Phoebe Diamond to the prom.

79
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,000
I finally got up the guts,
but I had this damn nervous twitch.

80
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,400
- Um, Ph-Ph-Phoebe?
- Yeah?

81
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,800
Uh, I was wonderin' if... if... if you'd, uh,
d-do me the honour of, uh...

82
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,300
I had such a crush on her.
Until I met you, Lois.

83
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,700
You're my silver medal.

84
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,200
Mr Toad, how many licks of you does it take

85
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,200
to get to the centre
of a Rhode Island state prison? 

86
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Just one.

87
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,600
How could this happen? I thought
we lived in such a nice small town.

88
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,300
There's no such thing. Things
are different than when we were kids.

89
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,500
- Well, it just makes me sad.
- It makes me sad too, but, uh, you know.

90
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,500
I mean, if Meg's at risk, then so is Chris, and
Stewie'll be in preschool before we know it.

91
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Well, we just have to trust
our kids to stay off drugs.

92
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,300
I do trust our kids.
It's the other kids I don't trust.

93
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,200
Yeah. Yeah, well, you know, I guess it's up to
us as parents to be a part of the solution.

94
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,000
- I'll go talk to the principal tomorrow.
- Thanks, honey.

95
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,100
- The safety word is banana.
- I love you.

96
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,000
And that's my plan, Principal Shepherd.
So, are you with me?

97
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,700
But... you didn't tell me anything. You just
sat down and said "And that's my plan."

98
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,400
Oh. Oh, right. OK, here's my idea.

99
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,700
- And that's my plan, Principal Shepherd.
- Well, Mr Griffin, I don't like it.

100
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,400
I love it! You have the faculty's full support.
But how will you pull it off?

101
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,500
You let me worry about that, kitten.

102
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,100
Great.

103
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,600
Hey, Meg. What's got four arms,
four legs and one set of lips?

104
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,800
You and me at the Winter Snow Ball.
Heh-heh!

105
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,100
Look, Neil, I don't... Oh, my God!

106
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,000
Dad? Dad?!

107
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,700
I'm not responding because
I'm not this "Dad" person.

108
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,500
I'm the new kid in town, Lando Griffin.

109
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,600
Are you crazy? What are you doing here?

110
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,200
I've gone undercover
to get rid of the toad problem,

111
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,700
so your school can be safe
and innocent like the good old days.

112
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,200
Negative B plus or minus
radical B squared minus 4AC over 2A.

113
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,500
That's correct. A girl answered a math
problem. You know what that means.

114
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
A witch!

115
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,400
- Witch! She's a witch!
- Witch!

116
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,400
Witch!

117
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:28,000
God, please tell me I have a brain tumour and
this is all just a side effect from the chemo.

118
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,200
- Hey, what are you doin' in my locker?
- Your locker?

119
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,400
Say, Phil, what do you say
to happy hour after work?

120
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,400
I'd say Cheryl's gonna have another
black eye to explain to the neighbours.

121
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,000
- Come on, I'm buyin'.
- Oh, yeah.

122
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,700
- Hey, man, cool specs.
- Thanks, G.

123
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,800
I'm the new kid in town, Lando Griffin.

124
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:53,800
No relation. So, tell me, homeboy, how 'bout
the baggy clothes we kids are wearin'?

125
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,100
Aren't they phat and stupid
and poppin' fresh?

126
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,000
Hey, does anybody have any drugs?
I'm lookin' to score some drugs.

127
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,800
- Dad, get away from me. Connie is looking.
- So that's toad girl, huh?

128
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,000
Yeah. And that's Connie.

129
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,300
I see. Well, I'm gonna have
a little talk with that Connie.

130
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,200
Huh! Good luck.
She only talks to the cool kids.

131
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,400
- Oh, yeah? Watch this.
- No!

132
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,300
Heeey!

133
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,700
Agh! Agh! Ow! Oh, God! Agh! Ow! Ow!

134
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,800
- Cool! He's bleeding!
- Just like in the movies!

135
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,800
Hm.

136
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,400
Holy crap, it's The Breakfast Club. 

137
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,100
You know what I got for Christmas?
It was a banner year at the Tiger house.

138
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,100
I got a carton of cigarettes. Old man
grabbed me, said "Hey, smoke up, Tony."

139
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,300
"They're grrreat!" Bastard.

140
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,300
Hey, Lando.

141
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,000
Everyone's talking about how you
trashed the jukebox. Classic cool.

142
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,600
- We're gonna do some toad. You in?
- You're gonna do toad?!

143
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,300
- What's the big deal?
- Lemme tell you about it, stud.

144
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,400
You'll get chills

145
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,100
All through your body

146
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,500
And you'll lose all control

147
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Of your bladder

148
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
And your sphincter

149
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,600
That's your butt hole!

150
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Cos if you use toad

151
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,700
Then I'm tellin' you

152
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,900
You can kiss your life goodbye

153
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,400
Yeah, when you use toad

154
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,800
It'll mess you up

155
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,000
It'll make your mama cry
That's no lie

156
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,200
You'll choke on your tongue and die

157
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,900
Gotta give it up

158
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,200
Give up the toad now

159
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,700
It's no joke

160
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,100
Buddy, give it up

161
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,800
Gotta give up the toad now

162
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,200
Or you'll croak

163
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,500
Buddy, give it up

164
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,300
You gotta give up the toad now

165
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,600
And don't smoke

166
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,600
Or you'll see

167
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,900
It hurts to pee

168
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,300
There'll be blood

169
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,500
Gushin' from ya

170
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,800
Every time that you cough

171
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,200
And forget gettin' lucky

172
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
It falls off

173
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah, you'd better wise up

174
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,300
Cos I'm tellin' you

175
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,200
Toad is what Lando forbids

176
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,000
Gotta give it all up

177
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,600
Or you're gonna see

178
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,600
Your whole life will hit the skids

179
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,200
And your kids will be born without eyelids

180
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,600
Gotta give it up

181
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,000
Give up the toad now

182
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,700
Thanks to you, Lando

183
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,900
Give it up

184
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,500
Give up the toad now

185
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,400
Thanks to you, Lando

186
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,000
Give it up
Gotta give up the toad now

187
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,400
Ooh, ooh, ooh

188
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,300
I'm no fool

189
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,700
Lando's cool

190
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,100
Yeah!

191
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,400
- You're the coolest, Lando.
- Yeah.

192
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,600
We never broke into song and dance
before you arrived.

193
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,100
I'll never touch another toad. None of us will.

194
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,600
- Yeah.
- No way, man.

195
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,600
- I know I won't.
- You never did it in the first place.

196
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,200
- God! You're such a wannabe loser.
- Oh, yeah? If I'm such a loser,

197
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,900
how come I'm going to
the Snow Ball with Lando?

198
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,200
Meg, you got a date?!
Oh, wait till I tell your mother!

199
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,300
Who I'm looking forward to meeting.

200
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,000
And I hope is making Steak Ums tonight.

201
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,300
- Hey, Meg, wanna ditch and go to the mall?
- Sure! See ya, Lando.

202
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,600
This is great. Not only did I live long
enough to see Meg go to her first dance,

203
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,400
but I'm takin' her too. Thanks, Geritol.

204
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,600
And they swore they'd never do toad again.

205
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,900
Dad never came to sing at my school.
I don't want dessert!

206
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,800
I tell you, Lois, high school's
a lot more fun this time around.

207
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,400
And it's a lot safer now that all the kids
have guns. And today in study hall,

208
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,500
I farted real loud on purpose
to make the guys laugh,

209
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,800
and I swear to God it was so heinous Susie
Johnson ralphed up her Salisbury steak.

210
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,900
I'm sorry, is this really
proper dinner conversation?

211
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm glad you taught those kids
they don't have to do drugs to be popular.

212
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,500
He sure did! Who needs drugs when you go
to the dance with the coolest guy in school?

213
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,000
Going with Dad is gonna skyrocket
me up the popularity food chain.

214
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,200
It's true. Soon members of the math club will
be attaching themselves to your underbelly.

215
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,600
Wait a minute. Peter, you can't
take Meg to a school dance.

216
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,600
How long do you think
you can keep up this charade?

217
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,000
Just till Friday! Please, Mom?

218
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,400
Well, if this is what you want.

219
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,000
Oh, it's probably Connie calling for me.

220
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,000
Hello?

221
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,900
Oh. Yeah, hold on. It's for Lando.

222
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,500
Aloha!

223
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,200
No way!

224
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,700
Uh... uh, hold on. I'm gonna
take this in the other room.

225
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,800
I got it!

226
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
Hang up!

227
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,400
Mother, this could almost have
passed for a palatable banana pudding,

228
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:11,100
but without Nilla wafers, it's just another one
of your wretched culinary abortions!

229
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,400
Clean it up!

230
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,900
I don't think so.

231
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Neil, I'm a little out of your league.
Besides, I'm going with Lando.

232
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,800
Really? My underground
sources have informed me

233
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,500
that Lando is taking Connie Demico.

234
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,800
What?!

235
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,900
Hey, I thought you were
taking me to the dance!

236
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,900
Uh...

237
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,200
Something suddenly came up.

238
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,900
- How could you do this to Meg?
- Not now, I gotta write about Oliver Twist. 

239
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,600
Oliver Twit,  if you ask me. I would have done
things rather differently, I can tell you that.

240
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,200
Please, sir, I want some more.

241
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,900
- What?
- Please, sir, I want some more.

242
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,400
More?!

243
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,200
All right. Stop it. Stop it right there.
Now, go on, fill up the bowl.

244
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,500
Go on! That's it.

245
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,300
Now put on this dress.

246
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,400
Put it on!

247
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,900
Now dance.

248
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,400
Hey. Hey, Brian, the guy who wrote this,
his name? Charles Dickens.

249
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,000
- Oh, yeah.
- I want an explanation, mister.

250
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,800
Hey, Connie pulled a power move.
When the most popular girl in school

251
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,400
asks you to the dance, you don't say no,
you say "Haba-haba-haba... OK."

252
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,500
I can't understand why you'd dump
your daughter for Connie Demico.

253
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,400
It's simple transference.

254
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,500
To Peter, Connie Demico is Phoebe Diamond,
the most popular girl in his school.

255
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,900
Oh, my God. I think he's right.

256
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,400
When I try to speed things up in bed, I'm not
thinkin' of Connie, I'm thinkin' of Phoebe.

257
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,100
This whole thing is ridiculous.
I forbid you from goin' to that dance.

258
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,200
You can't tell me what to do.
You're not my real mom!

259
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,300
- End of discussion!
- Thank you for ruining my life!

260
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,700
You don't remember
what it's like to be my age!

261
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,200
I'm two years younger than you!

262
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,400
I hate you!

263
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,000
Greg Allman, how did you handle it
when life got you down?

264
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,600
Me? I did a lot of drugs,
married some broad named Cher...

265
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,500
and I wouldn't recommend either one of 'em.

266
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,000
I gotta fight for my right to party.

267
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,000
Whoa-ah! Argh!

268
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,400
- Thanks, Spider-Man.
- Everybody gets one.

269
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,800
- Sweetie?
- You married a total jerk!

270
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,300
Honey, he didn't mean to hurt you. And,
you know, you could still go to the dance.

271
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,800
Alone? Why don't I just tattoo
a big L on my forehead while I'm at it?

272
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,100
Now, Meg, you know my feelings on tattoos.

273
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,600
If you stay home, you're just proving to
the other kids that you don't belong there.

274
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,500
- Yeah.
- And you might have a really good time.

275
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,200
I'll tell you one thing.
I still regret not goin' to my junior dance.

276
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,900
But, Daddy, if you don't do
what they say, they'll kill me!

277
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,600
Sorry, pumpkin, we don't negotiate
with kidnappers-family policy.

278
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,900
Daddy, no. Please! Please!

279
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,900
She'll be all right.

280
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,400
Come on, what do you say?

281
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,500
Well... I do have that
really slutty dress you hate.

282
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,800
So, uh, Lando, how old
did you say you were again?

283
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,400
17.

284
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,700
And a half.

285
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,200
Sweet statutory, you look beautiful!

286
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:04,200
Don't worry, I'll take good care of your kid.
I got a daughter of my own, you know.

287
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,800
Please leave the light off.
I don't want to be seen.

288
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,000
I imagine you wouldn't,
the way you've been acting.

289
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,800
- I thought you might say something like that. 
- Well, you do have it coming.

290
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,300
I convinced Meg to go to the dance,
so I'm gonna go drop her off.

291
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,000
Please don't yell. I've learned my lesson. 

292
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,900
- I wasn't yelling. I was just sayin' that...
- Oh, you would bring that up. 

293
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,600
- Can't you leave the past where it belongs? 
- What's wrong with you?

294
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:38,200
Because I've already explained that to you. 
It was a scavenger hunt. 

295
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,400
What the hell is goin' on here?

296
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:45,800
Lois, if you still haven't discovered I'm gone, 
please flip the tape over to side B. 

297
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,200
Nice moves, Lando.

298
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,400
OK, everyone. The votes are in.
This year's king and queen are...

299
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,000
Lando Griffin and Connie Demico!

300
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,200
Oh, my goodness! Oh!

301
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,200
Hold it. I can't be your king.

302
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,800
I have a confession. I've been living a lie!

303
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,900
I shouldn't be here... with Connie.

304
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,900
- My first choice was Meg Griffin.
- What?

305
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,400
Meg Griffin! She's right
over there in the back.

306
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,000
Ri... No, no, no, to the left. No, no,
you had her. No, no, go back, go back.

307
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,900
You got a monkey workin' the spotlight.
No, to the right, genius. Th-there. Stop. Stop.

308
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,800
That's my dream girl. But I'm not
good enough for her and she dumped me.

309
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:58,700
So now, heartbroken, I will ride recklessly
into the night and up Dead Man's Curve.

310
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,200
Goodbye, Meg. I love you.

311
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,000
- Meg, wanna dance?
- I was here first. Meg, dance with me?

312
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
- Neil, would you...?
- I would be honoured.

313
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,600
Thanks!

314
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,700
And Lando Griffin, 
a popular student at a local high school, 

315
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,700
was killed last night when his motorcycle
careened off Dead Man's Curve. 

316
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,900
Police were baffled when no body was found, 
but they decided not to ask questions

317
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,800
and just let everyone get on with their lives. 

318
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,800
- I'm so proud of you.
- Oh, Daddy, thank you so much!

319
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:02,200
- I was the most popular girl at the dance.
- Oh, anything for you, sweetheart.

320
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,400
Well, I'm off to popularity. Ciao!

321
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,200
God, I hate that manly walk of hers.
