00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,400
"It seems today that all you see

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,800
"Is violence in movies and sex on TV

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,400
"But where are those
good old-fashioned values

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,480
"On which we used to rely?

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,280
"Lucky there's a family guy

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,080
"Lucky there's a man who positively
can do all the things that make us

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,680
"Laugh and cry

"He's a family guy

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,600
Whoo-hoo, baby! 12 in a row!

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,280
You must have had a great body
before it went all fun-house mirror.

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,800
- I can't believe how terrific you look.
- I've been taking tae-jitsu classes.

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,280
- You should come with me sometime.
- I'd love to.

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,280
- Oh! The baby's kicking. Wanna feel?
- Sure.

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,680
- You are freakin' dead, kid.
- Peter!

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,800
- Oh, I love this time of year.
- Me, too.

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,800
The tourists are gone and
we have the town to ourselves

18
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,800
before those idiots from New York show up
to watch the leaves change and take over.

19
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,400
Leafers!

20
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,000
Holy crap. We gotta get outta here.

21
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,480
- What about the boat?
- Leave it!

22
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,880
- Hurry, Peter. They're almost here.
- We're too late.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,800
Yo, check out those colours. Yellow like
a taxi, orange like the ball at the Knicks game,

24
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,600
and red like the sauce
on my mamma mia's gugotz.

25
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,480
Yeah, and brown, like the guys
I don't pick up in my cab.

26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,000
- Bea-utiful!
- Aagh!

27
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,080
Good evening. Tonight's top story:

28
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,680
Quahog is infested with loud, hairy
creatures, also known as New Yorkers.

29
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,400
They migrate north
every autumn to see the foliage.

30
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,480
I think I speak for all of us when I say

31
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,480
New Yorkers can fornicate
themselves with an iron stick.

32
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,000
- We're gonna be late for church.
- Move it! Damn leafers.

33
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,680
Christ, quit it! Mom,
Chris put his foot on my side again.

34
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,680
- I can't help it. I have long dancer's legs.
- Move it.

35
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,800
Stop whining. Stay on your side.
Lois, get off your ass and do some parenting.

36
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,000
If you don't stop, we won't
go to McDonald's after church.

37
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,680
- Mom!
- Don't worry. We're goin'.

38
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,080
- But you don't get the Super Size.
- Oh!

39
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,400
- OK, you can Super Size, but no apple pie.
- Come on.

40
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,600
OK, but you can't blow on it.

41
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,200
Peter, don't contradict me in front of the kids.

42
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,000
Brothers and sisters fightin' is as natural as
a white man's dialogue in a Spike Lee movie.

43
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,200
Wassup? Can I get two slices of pepperoni?

44
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,680
- Who are all these people?
- Damn New Yorkers.

45
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,800
They took all the good seats.

46
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,880
Aren't you precious!

47
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,600
Some of my novelty items
were provided by Jack's Joke Shop.

48
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,000
If it ain't funny, it ain't worth Jack.

49
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,800
I'd like to welcome
all our out-of-town parishioners.

50
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,480
My cousin, Father Sapienza,
is in from New York to see the leaves.

51
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,680
I'd like to invite him
to do the opening prayer.

52
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,880
Yo, God is good, huh?
And he expects us to be good.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And if you're not, he's gonna come down
and bust your freakin' skull. Amen.

54
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,200
Who do you think you're talking to?
God ain't tougher than me.

55
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,280
You can't talk to the father like that,
you stupid gavone.

56
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,680
I oughta come and break your freakin' arm!

57
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,000
Wanna go, tough guy?
I'll snap you in half like an almond biscotti

58
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,080
from Valero's on 51st Street, best in the city.

59
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,680
Fellas, this is God's house.
And the Patriots kick off in 45 minutes.

60
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,200
- Can we move this along?
- Patriots suck.

61
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,280
Blasphemy!

62
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,080
It burns!

63
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,000
Holy water? Where's that acid I ordered?

64
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,200
Hey, Guido, watch this.

65
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,600
Whoa! I've got to lay off the coffee.
Ha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha!

66
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,880
That's Jack's. Exit 14 off 295.

67
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,600
Tae-jitsu is about power -
for your body and your mind.

68
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,200
Don't be afraid to free the beast inside you.

69
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,480
Left kick, right kick, punch combo, stomp.

70
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,680
Beautiful. Again. Left kick...

71
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,480
- You're doing great for your first lesson.
- I'm really cuttin' loose.

72
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,800
Like Julie Andrews in that movie
where she showed her breasts.

73
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,280
Mary, you'll never leave us, will you?

74
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,880
Lovely, but it doesn't quite
answer our question.

75
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,000
Jets rule!

76
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,400
Watch where you're going. Horace, put the
Pats game on the TV and get me a few beers.

77
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,280
Sorry, Peter. Someone stole the remotes.

78
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,800
And the kegs. And I'm not sure,
but I think I've been shot.

79
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,480
Yep.

80
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,680
Hey, pal, watch my seat.
I gotta bleed the lizard.

81
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,000
Public urination is just wrong.
Except during the Million Man March

82
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,680
when protesters burned our Porta-Pottis.

83
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,000
Then I used my stream of justice
to put out the hate.

84
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,480
I don't know, fellas. I think
there's potential in this crowd.

85
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,800
Honey, why don't you turn around
and show me the Lower East Side?

86
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,880
- Sure.
- Transvestite! Back off.

87
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,000
- Wait a sec. Pre-op or post-op?
- Pre-op.

88
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,200
Transvestite! Back off. This place blows.
We gotta send these strap-hangers back.

89
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,280
Don't worry. I got an idea.

90
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:35,480
An idea so smart, my head would explode if I
even began to know what I was talking about.

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,880
Aagh! I am a man-eating tree.

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,680
Go back to New York or I will eat you.

93
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,200
Just like I ate insane
New York anchorman Dan Rather. Pah!

94
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,400
And look who I had for dessert.
Asexual former mayor Ed Koch. Pah!

95
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,880
Leave my land or I will smite you
with my powerful limb.

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,200
What are you, nuts? Give me that branch.

97
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,280
Get off of me!

98
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,480
Oh, my God! Stop fighting!

99
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,880
- Holy crap!
- Oh, my God!

100
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,000
Mom, you could be a world champion,

101
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,200
and no one could hit you below the belt
cos girls don't have anything down there.

102
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,000
- Can you teach me to kick ass?
- No. I do not condone violence.

103
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,480
I won't be responsible for
bringing fistfighting into our schools.

104
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,480
Gee, can you hear me
all the way back there in the '50s?

105
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,800
- That was lame.
- Poor Peter.

106
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,200
I emasculated him in front of all those people.
I think he's really upset.

107
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,600
Gather round, everybody.
10 bucks is all it takes.

108
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,080
Step right up and fight my wife.

109
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,800
Come one, come all. She floats like a
butterfly and stings like when I pee.

110
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,080
Peter, I am not a sideshow attraction.
At least, not any more.

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,280
Me likey bouncy! Me likey bouncy!

112
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,400
I want you to get rid of all of this right now,
cos I am never fighting again, ever!

113
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,880
Come on, Chris. We'll have to go to plan B.

114
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,280
No! Oh, God! Oh, my God!

115
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,880
Help me! Help me!
For God's sake, he's gonna kill me!

116
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,280
Don't worry. It's a trained bear.
He's in no real danger.

117
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,400
He's teaching a class. I can't bother him now.

118
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,680
Sure you can. Hey, Ralph Macchio!
My wife here needs to talk to you.

119
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,280
There you go, honey.

120
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,400
- What is it, Lois?
- I don't think I should do tae-jitsu any more.

121
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,200
- I'm afraid I'm gonna hurt someone.
- But, Lois, you're my star pupil.

122
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,000
- I want you in my advanced class.
- Advanced class? No, no, no.

123
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,680
- I'm trying to quit.
- Well, fine. Quit.

124
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,080
- But get used to people walking all over you.
- Hold on, there.

125
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,880
Nobody walks all over my wife,
cos I won't let 'em.

126
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,880
- Peter...
- Quiet. Men are talking.

127
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,480
She learns things eventually.
It just takes her longer. Come on.

128
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,800
If you hurry, I'll let you try on hats.
I won't let you buy, but you can try 'em on.

129
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,200
I'll do it.

130
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
Ow!

131
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,880
- Stewie, you wanna swing?
- Yes, why not? I'll have a go at it.

132
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,600
Perhaps a quick stretch first.

133
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,280
Damn. Must have pulled something
playing hoops last week.

134
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,680
I know you're not puttin' that rock
up from here. You ain't got no J.

135
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,400
- Yo, man, that's trippin'!
- You're the one who's trippin'.

136
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,600
Cry home to your mama. She waitin' for ya.

137
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,480
Now don't make me put
my size 13s up your narrow ass!

138
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,200
I don't sweat you. Bring it on, bitch!
Now how you gonna act?

139
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,800
Sheesh! Bringin' that trash in here.
This is my house.

140
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,800
Excuse me. We were about to use that.

141
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,800
- You snooze, you lose, lady.
- You have two choices.

142
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,280
Either my baby swings from
this jungle gym, or you do.

143
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,200
Ooh, Lois! Someone's wearing
their ovaries on the outside.

144
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,200
- She saw me walking to the swing.
- She saw you. Easy, now.

145
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,800
Nobody walks all over me. Those days
are over. Lois Griffin demands respect.

146
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,800
I smell a messy diaper.
God, why does that turn me on?

147
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,800
- Hold it, Meg. Those two are mine.
- What?

148
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:41,080
That's Randy, and that's Fred.
Randy is the messy one. Fred's very neat.

149
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,000
When you get 'em together,
hold on to your sides!

150
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,880
Nice to meet you both.

151
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
Murderer!

152
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,880
Stop it, both of you. Starting now,
you two are gonna love each other.

153
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Now stay that way.

154
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,200
It's gonna be weird to potty.

155
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,480
Sheesh, Lois, look at the garbage
those damn leafers dumped on our lawn.

156
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,080
New York Post, New York Magazine,
the New York Mets.

157
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,680
Peter, I'm sick and tired of hearing you whine
about the leafers. Take some action.

158
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
Free the beast!

159
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,400
That was strangely arousing. Aagh!

160
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,480
Hello? 911? It's Quagmire.
Yeah. It's in a window this time.

161
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,480
- Wow, look at them run.
- Wait a second, Brian. That gives me an idea.

162
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,880
The Drunken Clam? Why couldn't we go
someplace fancy, like The Olive Garden?

163
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,680
The breadsticks!
Me likey breadsticks! Me likey...

164
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,680
- You're a big girl now. Stop it.
- Hold on, Lois.

165
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,480
Excuse me, New Yorker. You're in my seat,
and I had sex with your mother last night.

166
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
- Are you crazy?
- What did you say?

167
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,680
About the seat, or about
my ploughing your father's wife?

168
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,480
- What the hell are you doing?
- Excuse me. Is your refrigerator running?

169
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,680
If it is, it probably runs like you -
very homosexually.

170
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,080
- What?!
- Oh, you wanna dance?

171
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,600
Jets suck, Yankees suck, Knicks suck.

172
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Krypton sucks.

173
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,000
That's right. Go back where
you came from, you bastards!

174
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,880
We'll conclude the graduation ceremony
with a demonstration by the black belts.

175
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,880
Let's show 'em what we've learnt.

176
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,480
- Kathy, get in there with Lois.
- I can't. I have cramps.

177
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,880
Why are you putting me up
against the scrubs?

178
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,800
- Be a man and fight me yourself.
- Lois, the sensei is a sacred position.

179
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,200
I could never violate the spiritual bond
of the student-master relationship.

180
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,680
- Then allow me.
- Ooh!

181
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,280
- The bond is broken.
- Then spin the wheel, raggedy man!

182
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,480
Go, Lois! Pummel him
with your powerful fists of female fury.

183
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,200
And then when he's weary,
emasculate him with your incessant nagging.

184
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,080
Women! Yakety-yak, yakety-yak, yak, yak.

185
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,800
You know, huh? Enjoy the fight.

186
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,880
Yah!

187
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,280
Lois, that was amazing. Congratu...

188
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,200
This is mine.
This is where my babies come from.

189
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,600
And now back to the movie of the week.

190
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,880
If this glacier goes slower
than one mile a year, we're all dead!

191
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,000
Tell me something I don't know!
Get out of the way!

192
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,080
Lois, I was watching that.

193
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,080
- What you looking at?
- The underpants. Lose 'em.

194
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,480
Actually, I kinda...
I sorta have a headache, kinda.

195
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,880
- Maybe tomorrow or...
- Take 'em off.

196
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,400
Yeah, OK, honey.

197
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,400
Whoa! What the hell are you doing?
Those are my graham crackers.

198
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,400
Run along, Stewie. Daddy had a rough night.

199
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,280
Why, you tottering, fem-sucked dewberry!

200
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,600
I'm going to go find something
to strike you with. Excuse me.

201
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,280
Good morning.
Peter, you look terrible. What happened?

202
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,080
Last night Lois was... the man!

203
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,400
- Good Lord.
- I just want you to know, Brian, I didn't cry.

204
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,480
It's OK. Shh.

205
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,400
Oh, no! Peter! Stewie, what did you do?

206
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,200
He freed the beast
all over the back of Peter's head.

207
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,800
Oh, my God. This is my fault.

208
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,000
This is my fault!
I brought violence into this house!

209
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,680
- I'm the worst mother in the world!
- Ah-ha! I got it all on tape.

210
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,400
OK, this is me
interviewing Ed Sullivan.

211
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,000
What's new, Ed?

212
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,080
Well, Stewie,
tonight we have a really big show.

213
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,080
OK, and now a word
from our sponsors.

214
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,880
It takes a very steady hand.
Don't touch the sides!

215
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,280
Butterfingers!

216
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,880
I was making radio shows for fun.

217
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,080
Everybody does it.
At least, everybody I know. Shut up!

218
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:41,680
Stewart, take this mommy doll and daddy
doll and show me how they act together.

219
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,280
Oh. Yes, very well. All right.

220
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:50,400
"Margaret, after 20 years of marriage, your
curious indiscretions no longer faze me. "

221
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,280
"Really? And I suppose
you think I enjoy hanging onto

222
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,880
those hammocky deposits of
gin sugars you call buttocks?"

223
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,200
- What was that? What did you just write?
- Give me that.

224
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:05,400
"Insecurity. Gender confusion. "
I'll give you something to write about.

225
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,600
Look at me. I'm insane!
I'm Martin Lawrence on a bender.

226
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,080
Mr and Mrs Griffin, does Stewart
have a history of aggression?

227
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,480
No. Hitting Peter is the first
violent thing he's ever done.

228
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,480
Technically, the first was that time bomb
I left ticking in your uterus before I came out.

229
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,800
Happy 50th birthday, Lois.

230
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,880
Your son is learning
misbehaviour from someone.

231
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,400
I... I know who's responsible
for Stewie's behaviour,

232
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,800
but if I told you,
Lois'd beat the crap out of me.

233
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,880
Now, just a minute! The whole reason
I started fighting is because of you.

234
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,600
I felt weak. You never listen to me.
You undermine me in front of the kids.

235
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,880
And besides, you're not exactly
Father of the Year yourself.

236
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,080
Well, there seems to be a lot
of anger in your household.

237
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,400
You owe it to your son to learn
how to manage these feelings.

238
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,600
Manage what?

239
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,880
I know I went a little overboard
with my tae-jitsu,

240
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,600
but from now on we're not gonna have
any more anger in this house, OK?

241
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,600
Tell Chris to quit drawing
pictures of me with a pig's body.

242
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,200
- Don't censure me!
- No more anger!

243
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:17,480
OK. The psychologist wants us
to try an exercise called role reversal,

244
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,200
where we pretend to be
the person who makes us angry.

245
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,680
I'll go first.

246
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,280
"Don't listen to your mother, kids.
She's worthless and dumb. "

247
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,800
"Lgnore her and only listen to me - Peter. "

248
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,480
"I'm Lois. I brake for yard sales,
but I don't let Peter buy anything he likes,

249
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,280
like that Narragansett beer sign
where the hot chick has two mugs for jugs. "

250
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,880
It was eight freakin' dollars,
and we have a dozen places to put it!

251
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,080
Me next, me next!

252
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,000
"I'm the dog. I'm well-read
and have a diverse stock portfolio,

253
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:52,000
but I'm not above eating grass clippings and
regurgitating them on the rug by the door. "

254
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,200
"I'm a pompous antichrist who will probably
drop my plans for world domination

255
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,680
when I grow up and fall in love
with a rough trick named Jim. "

256
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,200
Whoa, Peter, calm down.

257
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,080
I'm sick of Lois's anger-management
techniques. They're not working.

258
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,080
What about writing angry letters
and not sending them?

259
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,680
- I wasn't supposed to send those?
- I got a letter from Dad.

260
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:29,200
"Dear Meg. For the first four years of your
life, I thought you were a house cat. " Dad!

261
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,880
"Dear Stewie. Get out. " That's nice.

262
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,680
Mine just says "Dear Lois. " And after that
it looks like someone just spit on the paper.

263
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,800
- You got somethin' to say to me?
- Yeah. PS:

264
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,200
Hold on a sec.

265
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,800
Hold on. Relax. Everybody, relax.

266
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,080
I was hoping it wouldn't come to this,

267
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,480
but we need to get our anger under control
before we kill each other.

268
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,080
My psychiatrist gave me
these mood elevators.

269
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,480
I think they could help even us out.

270
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,480
We're not taking pills. It's not natural.

271
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,400
Nor is bleaching the hair
on your upper lip, Martin Mull.

272
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,200
Give us the pills.

273
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,800
- " Ah-um
- " Ba-ba

274
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
- " Ah-um
- " Ba-ba

275
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,880
"Ay-oh, Mother Africa

276
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
"Ah-um

277
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,480
"Ba-ba

278
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,480
That was fun. What country shall we do next?

279
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,080
Monaco. Wait - that's a principality.

280
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:31,280
Wanna hear something really funny? Those
pills I gave you were placebos. Sugar pills.

281
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,200
Are you telling me I just sang
Ladysmith Black Mambazo for nothing?

282
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,800
Did it kill you to be
multicultural for a minute?

283
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,280
- I died a little inside, yes. You happy now?
- Don't you use that tone of voice, you...

284
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,080
- What were you gonna say? Fat ass?
- Wide load?

285
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,600
- Dough boy?
- Country virtuoso Roy Clark?

286
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,280
- How about all of the above?
- How's this for a name?

287
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,080
"Pony Express is in. "
"What have you got for me, Joe?"

288
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,600
"Let me see. It's here somewhere. "

289
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,000
"Here we are. A big bag
of liver spots for Lois. "

290
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,600
- You... You just hit me.
- That's right.

291
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,400
- You can't hit me! I'm a girl!
- Sometimes I wonder.

292
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,280
- Kicking, Lois?
- Ha! Hurts, doesn't it?

293
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,280
You tell me.

294
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,000
Go, Dad! Kick her ass!

295
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,280
- Shut up! This is all Dad's fault.
- I don't like to be touched!

296
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,680
Aaagh!

297
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,680
Aaaaagh!

298
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,680
Man, I'm glad we got that out of our systems.

299
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,200
- I wonder what came over us.
- Maybe people are naturally violent.

300
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,600
I don't believe that.
I think it's all the TV we watch.

301
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,200
- There's so much violence.
- Yeah, TV is dangerous.

302
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,280
Why the hell doesn't the government
tell us what we can and can't watch?

303
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,880
Shame on the network
that puts this junk on the air!

304
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,200
Peter, maybe you shouldn't say
anything bad about the network.

305
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,680
What are they gonna do? Cut our budget?
I'm gonna go get a beer.
