1
00:00:37,908 --> 00:00:39,249
Mom, where's Dad?

2
00:00:39,344 --> 00:00:40,759
Over across the street.

3
00:00:40,779 --> 00:00:43,221
He's collecting Cleveland's
mail while he's out of town.

4
00:00:43,256 --> 00:00:44,478
Black guy mail.

5
00:00:44,513 --> 00:00:47,097
Peter, you're just supposed
to pick up Cleveland's mail,

6
00:00:47,132 --> 00:00:48,211
not go through it.

7
00:00:48,246 --> 00:00:50,544
Lois, black people are
different than you and I.

8
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,554
And me, I find
that hilarious.

9
00:00:52,698 --> 00:00:55,282
Boy, Cleveland gets
a lot of magazines.

10
00:00:55,605 --> 00:00:57,000
Grape Soda Today.

11
00:00:57,404 --> 00:00:59,018
Orange Soda Quarterly.

12
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,708
The Fruit Punch Reader.

13
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,313
Hey, what you got
there, Stewie?

14
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,903
Ooh, Mustache Aficionado.

15
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:07,341
Wow, look at these men.

16
00:01:07,406 --> 00:01:09,213
What class, what grace.

17
00:01:09,358 --> 00:01:11,650
And all because
of a little upper lip hair.

18
00:01:11,685 --> 00:01:12,350
Lois,

19
00:01:12,518 --> 00:01:14,482
I am going grow a mustache.

20
00:01:14,526 --> 00:01:16,821
Then I'll have it made
like the Monopoly guy.

21
00:01:17,107 --> 00:01:18,682
Except when he goes
directly to jail.

22
00:01:19,408 --> 00:01:22,271
I wish I could tell you
that the Monopoly guy

23
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:25,143
fought the good fight
and the Sisters let him be.

24
00:01:25,295 --> 00:01:27,151
I wish I could tell you that.

25
00:01:27,308 --> 00:01:30,172
But prison is no
fairy-tale world.

26
00:01:34,487 --> 00:01:36,273
Hey, Rupert,
what if the refrigerator

27
00:01:36,316 --> 00:01:38,071
was a monster that
talked like this?

28
00:01:38,795 --> 00:01:39,792
I am a monster.

29
00:01:40,085 --> 00:01:42,230
I am going to bite
your fingers.

30
00:01:42,388 --> 00:01:43,492
Here I come.

31
00:01:43,525 --> 00:01:44,822
I'm going to get you.

32
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:46,002
Ah! I don't want to play anymore

33
00:01:46,037 --> 00:01:47,151
Normal voice, normal voice!

34
00:01:47,187 --> 00:01:48,261
The refrigerator can't hurt me.

35
00:01:48,307 --> 00:01:49,123
Okay?

36
00:01:49,846 --> 00:01:52,281
Oh, my God, Dad,
what's on your face?

37
00:01:52,437 --> 00:01:54,011
It's a mustache, Meg.

38
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,300
Oh, I think it's sexy.

39
00:01:56,347 --> 00:01:57,472
I think it's gay.

40
00:01:57,515 --> 00:01:58,573
It's not gay, Brian.

41
00:01:58,605 --> 00:02:00,761
If I'm gay, then
Freddie Mercury was gay.

42
00:02:00,797 --> 00:02:02,912
Freddie Mercury
the lead singer of Queen?

43
00:02:02,968 --> 00:02:04,063
He was incredibly gay.

44
00:02:04,135 --> 00:02:04,812
He was not!

45
00:02:04,855 --> 00:02:07,800
He had a mustache
which is praal like wedding ring

46
00:02:07,847 --> 00:02:10,331
I imagine you're going to be
much more of a stern father,

47
00:02:10,377 --> 00:02:11,630
now that you have a mustache.

48
00:02:11,676 --> 00:02:14,250
Well, Chris, there may bemore lap sitting
than there'sn.

49
00:02:14,297 --> 00:02:16,843
And I might answer most of
your questions with a story.

50
00:02:16,877 --> 00:02:18,671
But, mostly,my mustache tells people

51
00:02:18,707 --> 00:02:21,582
that there is a 90% chance
that I am poorly educated,

52
00:02:21,806 --> 00:02:24,732
that I keep upscale pornziou the open

53
00:02:24,746 --> 00:02:27,570
and that I listen tothe Little River Band
with giant headphones.

54
00:02:27,617 --> 00:02:31,343
Ugh! That's the ugliest thing the Fatman's grown
since that horse leg.

55
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,353
Hey, Peter, have you seen my...

56
00:02:33,495 --> 00:02:36,083
Aw, Brian, I'm sorry, but what do I keep saying?

57
00:02:36,116 --> 00:02:37,901
Do not stand behin me.

58
00:02:38,108 --> 00:02:39,902
Because I will get scared.

59
00:02:43,557 --> 00:02:45,562
And now back to One Tree Hill.

60
00:02:45,805 --> 00:02:47,860
Dude, let me tell
you something:

61
00:02:48,007 --> 00:02:51,373
There is nothing that'll ever
happen in the rest of our lives

62
00:02:51,418 --> 00:02:54,753
that's as important as what's
going on right here, right now,

63
00:02:54,786 --> 00:02:57,040
in high school,
by these lockers.

64
00:02:57,088 --> 00:02:59,051
I've got so many problems.

65
00:02:59,207 --> 00:03:02,643
Hey, nothing that can't be
fixed by staringa.

66
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:10,202
High school is sucha serious thing
These problems matter.

67
00:03:11,697 --> 00:03:13,841
God, these high school
students are lame.

68
00:03:13,996 --> 00:03:16,282
I'm a freakin' baby, andI'm cooler than they are.

69
00:03:16,328 --> 00:03:17,720
What the hell do youknow about high school?

70
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:18,691
Are you kidding?

71
00:03:18,736 --> 00:03:20,990
These kids today areso easy to manipulate.

72
00:03:21,026 --> 00:03:23,320
If you plopped me inthe middle of a high school,

73
00:03:23,365 --> 00:03:25,331
cobe the mpukid there in a week.

74
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,051
Really?

75
00:03:26,345 --> 00:03:28,353
Would you
care to placea wager on that?

76
00:03:28,388 --> 00:03:29,753
Absolutely.What are the stakes?

77
00:03:29,787 --> 00:03:32,941
Okay, if I winand you cado
yoveput your nose

79
00:03:35,858 --> 00:03:36,531
Okay, it's a bet

80
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,072
Great

81
00:03:37,118 --> 00:03:38,002
- Kiss on it?

82
00:03:43,578 --> 00:03:45,582
Wow, Dad, you're up early.

86
00:03:51,756 --> 00:03:54,482
Gosh, mustache cultureis pretty cool.

00:07:08,765 --> 00:07:10,483
Nooooo!

165
00:07:10,775 --> 00:07:13,933
God bless you, sir,you saved my life.

166
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:15,002
But at what cost?

167
00:07:15,305 --> 00:07:16,602
At what cost?!

168
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,260
Peter, have youseen Brian?

169
00:07:22,298 --> 00:07:24,380
No, Lois,
I have not.

170
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,001
Well, I haven't seen him since this morning and I..

171
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:28,802
What isthat on your head?

172
00:07:28,836 --> 00:07:30,260
It's a mustache, Lois.

173
00:07:30,307 --> 00:07:32,131
What, you never seena mustache before?

174
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:34,172
Lois, would you mind callingthe police
or something?

175
00:07:34,218 --> 00:07:35,182
Quiet, mustache!

176
00:07:35,217 --> 00:07:36,150
Oh, my God!

177
00:07:36,185 --> 00:07:38,481
Peter, I know you're upsetabout losing that thing,

178
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:40,060
get a grip on yourself.

179
00:07:40,105 --> 00:07:41,070
Let Brian down.

180
00:07:41,256 --> 00:07:44,083
No. I'm not living my life without a mustache.

181
00:07:44,236 --> 00:07:47,670
Even if, sometimes,my mustache
has Alpo gas

182
00:07:47,715 --> 00:07:49,110
Mustache fart.

183
00:07:51,128 --> 00:07:53,131
Hello, I'm lookingfor Peter Griffin.

184
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:53,961
I'm Peter Griffin.

185
00:07:53,998 --> 00:07:55,972
Mr. Griffin, my nameis Todd Meyers.

186
00:07:56,006 --> 00:07:58,262
I'm the man you rescuedfrom McBurgertown.

187
00:07:58,306 --> 00:08:00,801
Oh yeah,
you're the guywho cost me my mustache.

188
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:03,312
What, you come over here to rape
my daughter?

189
00:08:03,328 --> 00:08:06,593
No, I own the restaurant,
and to show my gratitude,

190
00:08:06,638 --> 00:08:11,001
I'd like to offer you
a lifetimesupply of McBurgertown burgers.

191
00:08:11,805 --> 00:08:12,913
Free burgers?

192
00:08:12,945 --> 00:08:16,532
Oh, man, this isa way better offer
than the one I gotfrom Helen Hunt.

193
00:08:16,967 --> 00:08:18,263
You wanna have sex?

194
00:08:18,548 --> 00:08:20,273
No...

195
00:08:20,556 --> 00:08:25,011
No, no, no, no...no..

196
00:08:25,157 --> 00:08:26,300
no..

197
00:08:30,616 --> 00:08:32,181
Peter, you shouldreally slow down.

198
00:08:32,228 --> 00:08:33,761
You've already hadlike 30 hamburgers.

199
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:34,453
Shut up, Brian.

200
00:08:34,488 --> 00:08:36,781
It relieves the painof mustachelessness.

201
00:08:37,505 --> 00:08:38,611
And it's working.

202
00:08:38,656 --> 00:08:40,340
I no longer feel the pain.

203
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,670
Come to think of it,I can't really feel anything

204
00:08:42,706 --> 00:08:44,252
on the left half of my body.

205
00:08:44,286 --> 00:08:44,963
Really?

206
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:46,541
That doesn'tsound good.

207
00:08:46,906 --> 00:08:48,550
Peter, are youwinking at me?

208
00:08:51,356 --> 00:08:53,442
Oh, my God, someonecall an ambulance!

209
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:57,941
Doctor, what happened?

210
00:08:57,987 --> 00:08:59,293
Is he gonna be okay?

211
00:08:59,328 --> 00:09:01,873
Mrs. Griffin, your husbandhas had a stroke.

212
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:04,921
The left half of his bodyis completely paralyzed.

213
00:09:04,966 --> 00:09:06,222
Oh, my God!

214
00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:08,511
Peter, sweetheart,how do you feel?

215
00:09:08,665 --> 00:09:11,243
Uh... had better days, Lois.

216
00:09:11,286 --> 00:09:12,820
Had better days.

217
00:09:15,985 --> 00:09:17,700
Mom, it's beenthree months.

218
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:19,750
When is Dad gonnaget better?

219
00:09:19,795 --> 00:09:22,120
Chris, I've alreadyexplained this to you.

220
00:09:22,168 --> 00:09:25,603
Your father had a stroke
and it may take him along time to recover.

221
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:26,860
Lois!

222
00:09:26,896 --> 00:09:28,833
Bring me anotherbeer, please!

223
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:36,160
Uh, Lois,
you mind telling me

224
00:09:36,207 --> 00:09:38,520
what the hellyou think you're doing?

225
00:09:38,565 --> 00:09:40,003
I'm handing you a beer.

226
00:09:40,036 --> 00:09:42,801
You are handing itto my stroke arm.

227
00:09:42,837 --> 00:09:45,851
This is my good arm!
Bring the beer over here!

228
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:47,602
That's better.

229
00:09:52,746 --> 00:09:55,322
So, I'm shaving last nightat this make-out party.

230
00:09:55,366 --> 00:09:56,443
I took a bunch of pictures.

231
00:09:56,476 --> 00:09:58,450
You can see them onmy MySpace page,

232
00:09:58,486 --> 00:10:00,781
along with my favorite songsand movies and things

233
00:10:00,826 --> 00:10:02,181
that other people have created,

234
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,233
but that I use toexpress my individualism.

235
00:10:04,268 --> 00:10:06,111
I have a MySpacepage too.

236
00:10:06,157 --> 00:10:07,750
Yeah, I havemine ironically.

237
00:10:07,788 --> 00:10:09,351
Hey, why don't youguys get lost.

238
00:10:09,386 --> 00:10:10,800
I have to talk to Connie.

239
00:10:13,135 --> 00:10:14,601
- Hey, guess what?
- What?

240
00:10:14,637 --> 00:10:15,262
That's what.

241
00:10:15,308 --> 00:10:16,231
No, but seriously,

242
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:17,732
there's something I wantto talk to you about.

243
00:10:17,765 --> 00:10:19,991
Sure, Zac.Anything for you.

244
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:21,750
You wanna go out toAnal Point this weekend,

245
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,303

246
00:10:23,338 --> 00:10:24,872
OMG!

247
00:10:24,905 --> 00:10:27,061
That'd be so awesome!
Sweet.

248
00:10:27,108 --> 00:10:29,183
We're gonna havea real ragin' time.

249
00:10:29,218 --> 00:10:31,381
Before you know it,
we'll belike an old married couple.

250
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,153
- Uh, Lois?
- Yeah?

251
00:10:59,297 --> 00:11:01,500
Uh, Peter's getting in the car.

252
00:11:07,308 --> 00:11:08,462
...baffled, trumped,tethered, cropped

253
00:11:08,508 --> 00:11:12,292
Look at that low plane,fine then, uh-oh, overflow

254
00:11:12,328 --> 00:11:14,013
Population, common food,but it'll do

255
00:11:14,055 --> 00:11:15,063
Shave yourself,serve yourself

256
00:11:15,106 --> 00:11:17,423
World serves its own needs,listen to your heartbeat

257
00:11:17,466 --> 00:11:20,103
Dummy with the rapture and therevered and the right, right

258
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,650
Your vitriolic, patriotic,slam, fight, bright light

259
00:11:22,685 --> 00:11:24,461
Feeling pretty psyched

260
00:11:24,506 --> 00:11:28,663
It's the end of the worldas we know it...

261
00:11:33,836 --> 00:11:36,990
Stroke, stroke,stroke!

262
00:11:37,028 --> 00:11:39,000
Stop mocking me!

263
00:11:43,885 --> 00:11:45,280
Well, Brian, you'velost your bet.

264
00:11:45,328 --> 00:11:48,150
I- or rather, myalter ego, Zac Sawyer-

265
00:11:48,198 --> 00:11:51,060
am currently the most popular boy
at James Woods High.

266
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:53,583
Well, Stewie, you got
the best of meon this one.

267
00:11:53,607 --> 00:11:54,803
Congratulations.

268
00:11:54,855 --> 00:11:56,803
I guess you'll behanging up your wig now?

269
00:11:56,845 --> 00:11:57,630
Oh, no, Brian.

270
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,353
I'm enjoyingmyself to much

271
00:11:59,397 --> 00:12:01,083
Do you know thatI've got a date

272
00:12:01,118 --> 00:12:03,983
with Connie D'Amico
this Saturday night,at Anal Point?

273
00:12:04,108 --> 00:12:05,953
Ah, I've heardabout that place.

274
00:12:05,988 --> 00:12:06,991
Really?What's it like?

275
00:12:07,036 --> 00:12:08,001
'Cause I haveno idea.

276
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:13,170
Well, uh, I supposeif you imagine it
like a parking spacethat you think,

277
00:12:13,215 --> 00:12:15,472
"Gosh, there's no way
I'm gonna be ableto fit in there."

278
00:12:16,008 --> 00:12:17,902
But then you fold inthe sideview mirrors and

279
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,491
sure enough,well, look at that.

280
00:12:19,616 --> 00:12:21,501
Well, in that scenario,
it sounds like I'd rather be

281
00:12:21,546 --> 00:12:22,903
the parking spacethan the car.

282
00:12:22,945 --> 00:12:24,661
Yeah, that's whatI've always guessed.

283
00:12:28,686 --> 00:12:30,983
I hate being all strokey.

284
00:12:31,275 --> 00:12:33,851
This is all your fault,McBurgertown.

285
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,452
You and your delicioushamburgers!

286
00:12:36,495 --> 00:12:39,020
I swearI'll get back at you someday

287
00:12:39,315 --> 00:12:42,432
for what you did to meand what you did to Wimpy.

288
00:12:42,478 --> 00:12:47,893
I would gladlypay you Tuesday
for a hamburger today.

289
00:12:47,926 --> 00:12:52,231
If only there were some way
I could belike everybody else again.

290
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:08,603
How long was I in there?

291
00:13:08,637 --> 00:13:09,711
About five minutes.

292
00:13:09,757 --> 00:13:12,053
Why are we notfunding this?

293
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:16,782
Sweetheart, that's incredible.

294
00:13:16,828 --> 00:13:18,623
And it only took five minutes?

295
00:13:18,655 --> 00:13:20,573
Five minutes.I went in there
they injected me

296
00:13:20,616 --> 00:13:22,500
with a little bitof that fetal crap,and bam

297
00:13:22,538 --> 00:13:24,062
good ol'gambling man Peter.

298
00:13:24,108 --> 00:13:26,693
And now I can
take my revengeon McBurger Town.

299
00:13:26,736 --> 00:13:27,521
Wait. What?

300
00:13:27,555 --> 00:13:29,561
It's their fault
I had a stroke, Brian.

301
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,161
And I'm gonna sue 'em for it.

302
00:13:31,306 --> 00:13:32,723
Peter, you ate 30 hamburgers.

303
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:33,842
It was your own fault.

304
00:13:33,878 --> 00:13:35,123
Yeah, besides, Peter,

305
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,601
those companies have
huge legal divisions.

306
00:13:37,645 --> 00:13:38,752
You can't fight that.

307
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:40,762
I'll find a way with the help

308
00:13:40,808 --> 00:13:42,203
of my snarky cat lawyer

309
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,312
Meowsy McDermott.

310
00:13:43,358 --> 00:13:45,071
You've got to be kitten me!

311
00:13:45,107 --> 00:13:46,511
Ha!

312
00:13:51,105 --> 00:13:53,741
This court finds in
favor of the defendant,

313
00:13:53,747 --> 00:13:55,121
McBurgertown Industries.

314
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,151
What?! Hey, come on!
That's not fair!

315
00:13:57,187 --> 00:13:59,112
Mr. Griffin, what did you expect?

316
00:13:59,148 --> 00:14:01,033
They have a hundred lawyers,

317
00:14:01,035 --> 00:14:02,712
and you tried to bribe me

318
00:14:02,755 --> 00:14:05,441
with a subscription to Grape Soda Today

319
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:06,901
which I already have.

320
00:14:06,938 --> 00:14:08,333
Case dismissed.

321
00:14:10,927 --> 00:14:12,032
What did I tell you, Peter?

322
00:14:12,077 --> 00:14:13,391
One man can't take on a

323
00:14:13,396 --> 00:14:15,513
multinational fast food conglomerate.

324
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:18,060
Oh, yes, I can.
This ain't over, Brian.

325
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,202
Those people are bad and

326
00:14:19,217 --> 00:14:20,683
I'm gonna prove it to the world.

327
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22,123
How do you expect to do that?

328
00:14:22,156 --> 00:14:23,231
Are you kidding?

329
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:24,950
I've tackled tougher jobs before.

330
00:14:24,995 --> 00:14:26,520
Remember that time I was Robin

331
00:14:26,526 --> 00:14:27,950
Williams' jumping-off point?

332
00:14:28,446 --> 00:14:30,702
- Okay... religion.
- Oh, religion.

333
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:32,700
You kill me, I kill you,
we both go to heaven.

334
00:14:32,736 --> 00:14:34,660
72 virgins, huh!

335
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,533
You might have to help me out

336
00:14:35,538 --> 00:14:36,191
with the last ten or so

337
00:14:36,226 --> 00:14:38,770
because Mr. Happy
gets tired- religion.

338
00:14:40,286 --> 00:14:41,283
Politics.

339
00:14:41,365 --> 00:14:45,090
Well, we're gonna come down there
and take all your oil.

340
00:14:45,138 --> 00:14:46,210
But this is our oil.

341
00:14:46,246 --> 00:14:48,220
Yee-haw!
Well, here's my missile.

342
00:14:48,257 --> 00:14:50,261
Okay, take it, take it.
Politics.

343
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:51,951
Uh, you know what?

344
00:14:51,987 --> 00:14:53,130
I'm gonna take a
five-minute break.

345
00:14:53,178 --> 00:14:54,251
Huh, five-minute break.

346
00:14:54,285 --> 00:14:55,862
What are you,
a construction worker?

347
00:14:55,907 --> 00:14:57,411
Hey, baby, I'm not gay.

348
00:14:57,445 --> 00:14:59,350
Does this yellow hat make
my ass look fat?

349
00:14:59,386 --> 00:15:00,550
Five-minute break.

350
00:15:03,768 --> 00:15:05,162
You enjoyed the movie, baby?

351
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,981
Yeah, but I think I'm gonna

352
00:15:06,987 --> 00:15:08,371
enjoy this even more.

353
00:15:08,665 --> 00:15:10,512
Ugh! No, thanks.
I am stuffed.

354
00:15:10,555 --> 00:15:12,302
So, we just gonna sit here and talk

355
00:15:12,306 --> 00:15:13,403
or are we gonna do it?

356
00:15:13,436 --> 00:15:15,531
All right, baby,
those are the magic words.

357
00:15:15,955 --> 00:15:16,971
Now check this out!

358
00:15:17,405 --> 00:15:18,692
Oh, my God!

359
00:15:18,907 --> 00:15:20,961
Yeah, I am ready for sex.

360
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:23,001
I drank eight gallons
of water today.

361
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,751
This baby's ready to explode.

362
00:15:25,205 --> 00:15:26,001
Is..

363
00:15:26,107 --> 00:15:28,463
is there more underneath
of is that it?

364
00:15:28,496 --> 00:15:29,211
I'm sorry?

365
00:15:31,626 --> 00:15:34,493
Zac, just get the hel
lout of my car.

366
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:41,160
That's it?
That was sex?

367
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:41,941
What a rip-off.

368
00:15:41,945 --> 00:15:42,780
I should sue her.

369
00:15:42,828 --> 00:15:45,400
Be careful you're not held
in contempt of cat.

370
00:15:51,438 --> 00:15:51,903
Pardon me.

371
00:15:51,907 --> 00:15:53,181
We're two Asian businessmen

372
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:53,980
looking to invest

373
00:15:54,026 --> 00:15:55,323
in McBurgertown Industries

374
00:15:55,326 --> 00:15:57,180
and we'd like a tour of your facility.

375
00:15:57,215 --> 00:15:58,293
You don't look Asian.

376
00:15:58,328 --> 00:16:00,103
Well, I guess we'll just take

377
00:16:00,105 --> 00:16:02,062
our millions of Dongs elsewhere.

378
00:16:02,096 --> 00:16:03,171
Wait, wait!

379
00:16:03,215 --> 00:16:04,933
Let me get our
general manager.

380
00:16:05,508 --> 00:16:07,801
Peter, what the hell do you
expect to accomplish here?

381
00:16:07,845 --> 00:16:08,910
Evidence, Brian.

382
00:16:08,956 --> 00:16:10,641
I'm gonna find just
the right piece

383
00:16:10,677 --> 00:16:13,250
of incriminating evidence to
bring down this company.

384
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:16,670
Over here is a menu from our first

385
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:19,001
McBurgertown restaurant in 1952.

386
00:16:19,047 --> 00:16:20,441
At that time, our value meal

387
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:21,702
consisted of a hamburger,

388
00:16:21,737 --> 00:16:23,602
a cup of coffee and a Lucky Strike.

389
00:16:23,907 --> 00:16:25,852
Wow. How much did all that cost?

390
00:16:25,886 --> 00:16:27,802
Back in the '50s,
one straw penny.

391
00:16:27,835 --> 00:16:30,782
- A whole strawpenny?
- Indeed. Follow me.

392
00:16:32,507 --> 00:16:33,611
Hey, what's in there?

393
00:16:33,656 --> 00:16:35,340
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's off limit.

394
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,063
Now if you'll excuse me for a second,

395
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:38,430
I have to go to the bathroom

396
00:16:38,438 --> 00:16:39,390
for about 30 minutes

397
00:16:39,436 --> 00:16:40,792
as I eat a lot of meat.

398
00:16:40,836 --> 00:16:42,131
Please give me your word that

399
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:43,301
you won't go in that door.

400
00:16:43,327 --> 00:16:43,952
Okay.

401
00:16:43,996 --> 00:16:45,423
Good.
See you in a half hour.

402
00:16:46,577 --> 00:16:48,081
Peter, this is your chance!

403
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,562
Brian, I gave him my word.

404
00:16:49,606 --> 00:16:50,262
The hell with that.

405
00:16:50,266 --> 00:16:51,450
Let's see what's behind this door.

406
00:16:55,196 --> 00:16:56,871
My God, what is this?!

407
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,493
This must be the
McBurgertown slaughterhouse.

408
00:16:59,607 --> 00:17:01,600
Sir, you are correct.

409
00:17:01,798 --> 00:17:03,853
But in here, we call it "DaCow."

410
00:17:03,886 --> 00:17:05,403
- DaCow?
- DaCow.

411
00:17:05,506 --> 00:17:08,073
Except we spell the
"chau" part C-O-W,

412
00:17:08,117 --> 00:17:12,702
Like "cow," so it's
kind of a... eh, sort of a dark joke.

413
00:17:12,748 --> 00:17:14,433
Yeah, yeah, it's a Holocaust joke.

414
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:15,860
That's, that's really funny.

415
00:17:15,905 --> 00:17:17,390
Unfortunately, life in a

416
00:17:17,397 --> 00:17:19,700
slaughterhouse is no laughing matter.

417
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:22,682
They have killed a great many of us,

418
00:17:22,685 --> 00:17:24,772
including my beloved wife.

419
00:17:24,906 --> 00:17:25,882
Peter, this is it.

420
00:17:25,918 --> 00:17:27,641
This is the evidence
you've been looking for.

421
00:17:27,927 --> 00:17:30,513
If we can get you out of here,
would you be willing to testify

422
00:17:30,548 --> 00:17:32,203
publicly about these atrocities?

423
00:17:32,238 --> 00:17:33,243
Oh, absolutely.

424
00:17:33,247 --> 00:17:35,392
But how do you intend to escape?

425
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:38,260
You leave that to us.
Come on.

426
00:17:41,716 --> 00:17:42,501
Hey!

427
00:17:42,705 --> 00:17:44,292
There they are!

00:18:41,005 --> 00:18:42,310
What the hell's your problem?

What the hell is going on here?

Nothing, baby penis.

00:18:50,356 --> 00:18:51,502
Well, yes, I have a baby-

439
00:18:53,228 --> 00:18:54,560
Well, for your information,

440
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:55,800
I don't want a big penis.

441
00:18:55,847 --> 00:18:57,532
I think they're messy.

442
00:18:59,107 --> 00:19:00,610

my reign of coolness,
haven't you?

444
00:19:02,417 --> 00:19:03,813
You're a disgrace,
you know that?

445
00:19:03,848 --> 00:19:06,142
Hey, you're the one
with the tiny penis.

446
00:19:06,807 --> 00:19:08,733
You know, Connie, look,
you're right.

447
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,852
I behaved like a fool.
And I apologize.

448
00:19:11,888 --> 00:19:13,010
But, before I go,

449
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,202
could I maybe have one last kiss?

450
00:19:15,605 --> 00:19:17,631
Well, I guess so.

451
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,503
Look, this girl
is making out with a baby!

452
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:25,101

453
00:19:27,396 --> 00:19:28,201
Hey!

00:19:29,128 --> 00:19:30,552
That's right.

<i>For something that he never done...</i>

459
00:19:46,637 --> 00:19:47,783
Quiet, everybody, this is it.

460
00:19:47,907 --> 00:19:50,052
The McBurgertown
franchise suffered

461
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:52,602
a publicity setback today
from which it may not recover,

462
00:19:52,707 --> 00:19:54,530
thanks to testimony regarding

463
00:19:54,538 --> 00:19:56,693
its practices by a very brave cow.

464
00:19:57,108 --> 00:20:00,262
I have revealed to you,
today, these horrors

465
00:20:00,308 --> 00:20:03,003
in the hope that you will
see the need for change.

466
00:20:03,297 --> 00:20:06,163
But always remember what
I have done here today

467
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,422
is not a courageous act.

468
00:20:08,466 --> 00:20:11,331
The courage lies with a
man who has the guts

469
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,476
to say no to a fast food restaurant

470
00:20:13,476 --> 00:20:16,500
and eat a salad instead.

471
00:20:16,505 --> 00:20:19,453
To say, "I will eat
this salad with pride.

472
00:20:19,456 --> 00:20:22,270
I don't care if I look
like a gay person."

473
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:25,121
So to all of you
salad-eating homosexuals,

474
00:20:25,156 --> 00:20:27,133
I say thank you.

475
00:20:27,705 --> 00:20:30,460
And thank you, Peter,
for all you've done

476
00:20:30,468 --> 00:20:32,873
to help expose
this grave injustice.

477
00:20:33,077 --> 00:20:35,171
Where will you go now,
Mr. Cow?

478
00:20:35,207 --> 00:20:36,322
I cannot stay here?

479
00:20:36,407 --> 00:20:38,333
Peter said I could stay here.

480
00:20:38,408 --> 00:20:41,200
Oh... gosh...yeah, I don't,

481
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,501
I don't really see how
that's gonna work out.

482
00:20:43,906 --> 00:20:48,771
Oh. Well, as I said,
Peter just promised...

483
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:50,182
Yeah, I should stop you there.

484
00:20:50,186 --> 00:20:51,542
I didn't really promise anything.

485
00:20:51,575 --> 00:20:54,282
I just said "Maybe, if it was okay with Lois."

486
00:20:54,327 --> 00:20:56,990
Boy, it just it seems like
a real burden to me.

487
00:20:57,607 --> 00:21:01,012
