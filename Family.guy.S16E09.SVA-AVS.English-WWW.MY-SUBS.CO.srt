160
00:06:32,051 --> 00:06:34,719
We need four netted bags
of cinnamon pinecones.

161
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,889
Get the bags at Hobby Lobby
and the pinecones at Pier 1.

162
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,959
Next, inflate the giant snowman
and put it on our front lawn.

163
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,361
The pump's broken, so you'll
have to do it by mouth.

164
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:45,664
Then it's just laundry,
take out the trash,

165
00:06:45,665 --> 00:06:47,502
and move the house a
little bit to the left.

166
00:06:47,887 --> 00:06:50,156
Ugh. Can I do some of that tomorrow?

167
00:06:50,157 --> 00:06:52,493
No, because tomorrow we're
going down to volunteer

168
00:06:52,494 --> 00:06:54,863
- at the homeless shelter.
- What time will you be back?

169
00:06:54,864 --> 00:06:56,065
You're coming with us.

170
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:58,402
What? What does that have
to do with Christmas?

171
00:06:58,403 --> 00:07:00,404
Peter, it's a holiday of giving back.

172
00:07:00,405 --> 00:07:01,772
Yeah, but bums?

173
00:07:01,773 --> 00:07:04,241
What kind of presents would
they possibly have for us?

174
00:07:04,242 --> 00:07:06,343
Bags full of bags full of bags?

175
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:07,844
You know what, Peter, I've had it.

176
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:09,513
I'm tired of your selfishness.

177
00:07:09,514 --> 00:07:11,581
It's setting a bad example
for our children.

178
00:07:11,582 --> 00:07:13,150
Kids, get your coats!

179
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,419
Oh, is this it? Is this the divorce?!

180
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,421
Coats? Where are you guys going?

181
00:07:17,422 --> 00:07:19,823
Every year, my parents
invite us to their house

182
00:07:19,824 --> 00:07:21,425
to enjoy Christmas in Newport.

183
00:07:21,426 --> 00:07:24,194
And every year, we don't go
because you don't want to.

184
00:07:24,195 --> 00:07:27,264
Well, this year, I am going and
the kids are coming with me.

185
00:07:27,265 --> 00:07:28,598
Go ahead!

186
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:30,100
I'm fine by myself!

187
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:32,035
I'll just watch my Patrick Swayze movie

188
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:33,838
and take a too-full bath.

189
00:07:36,608 --> 00:07:38,943
Aw, now I want to be on that side.

190
00:07:40,645 --> 00:07:42,179
Well, that didn't work.

191
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,114
Now to take a slidey-toilet-seat,

192
00:07:44,115 --> 00:07:45,850
soaking wet dump.

193
00:07:51,489 --> 00:07:53,724
<i>Merry Christmas, kids.</i>

194
00:07:53,725 --> 00:07:56,360
<i>Merry Christmas in Wonderland!</i>

195
00:07:56,361 --> 00:07:58,128
Aha, ha!

196
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:00,064
I love you, Patrick Swayze.

197
00:08:13,177 --> 00:08:15,112
Peter.

198
00:08:15,113 --> 00:08:17,657
Peter Griffin!

199
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,517
Hello?

200
00:08:20,518 --> 00:08:21,686
Santa?

201
00:08:23,187 --> 00:08:24,688
Santa?

202
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:28,125
You think Santa could fit into
a pair of 22-inch-waist jeans?

203
00:08:28,126 --> 00:08:29,626
Patrick Swayze?

204
00:08:29,627 --> 00:08:31,795
How is that even possible? You're dead!

205
00:08:31,796 --> 00:08:33,330
Haven't you ever seen <i>Ghost?</i>

206
00:08:33,331 --> 00:08:34,631
Peter, you're in trouble.

207
00:08:34,632 --> 00:08:36,266
So, I've come back to help you

208
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:38,335
recapture the true spirit of Christmas.

209
00:08:39,371 --> 00:08:41,239
- Ghost House.
- Road House.

210
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,951
- Ghost Road.
- House House.

211
00:08:42,952 --> 00:08:43,953
Road Ghost.

212
00:08:48,447 --> 00:08:50,566
The ghost of Patrick Swayze!

213
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:51,625
I can't believe it!

214
00:08:51,626 --> 00:08:53,322
I just want to run through your hair

215
00:08:53,323 --> 00:08:55,625
like a dog bouncing in tall grass.

216
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:56,993
Go ahead.

217
00:09:00,497 --> 00:09:01,875
Yay!

218
00:09:06,317 --> 00:09:07,652
That was awesome!

219
00:09:07,653 --> 00:09:08,888
Hey, where are we?

220
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:10,924
Peter, you've lost
your Christmas spirit,

221
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:14,695
so I'm taking you on a journey
to "Christmas Past" to find it.

222
00:09:14,696 --> 00:09:16,029
Oh, wow.

223
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,865
Th-This is my old house from
when I was a little kid.

224
00:09:18,866 --> 00:09:20,200
That's right, Peter.

225
00:09:20,201 --> 00:09:24,204
I've taken you all the way
back to the year 1970/80/90.

226
00:09:24,205 --> 00:09:26,106
I'll never forget that year,

227
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,076
when President Richard Reagan Clinton

228
00:09:28,077 --> 00:09:29,853
lied to the American people.

229
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,580
Hey, hey, that's me!

230
00:09:33,581 --> 00:09:35,282
Look how skinny I am.

231
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,584
Yay! It's Christmas!

232
00:09:37,585 --> 00:09:41,288
And I made your favorite, peanut
butter chocolate chip cookies.

233
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,090
Wow, these are all for me?!

234
00:09:43,091 --> 00:09:44,257
Of course, Petey.

235
00:09:44,258 --> 00:09:46,960
It's Christmas, everything's for you.

236
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,196
Yay! Cookies at 7:00 a.m.!

237
00:09:49,197 --> 00:09:50,731
Thank you, careless parent!

238
00:09:50,732 --> 00:09:52,399
I'm gonna eat 'em and hum!

239
00:09:55,903 --> 00:09:58,138
See? Look how happy I was.

240
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,906
That's the Christmas spirit.

241
00:09:59,907 --> 00:10:01,808
I haven't felt that in years.

242
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,977
Yeah, looks like your mom
really went out of her way

243
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,645
to make Christmas special for you.

244
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,247
She sure did.

245
00:10:07,248 --> 00:10:08,949
Oh, hey, look, there's my friend Holden!

246
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,472
Merry Christmas, Peter!

247
00:10:10,952 --> 00:10:12,385
He could still talk then.

248
00:10:12,386 --> 00:10:13,954
I wonder what happened to him.

249
00:10:13,955 --> 00:10:15,989
I gotta go! I gotta go!

250
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,494
Hold it in! Hold it in! Hold it in!

251
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,331
Hold it in! Hold it in!

252
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,966
Hold it in!

253
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:28,935
Hold in! Hold in!

254
00:10:28,936 --> 00:10:30,470
Holden.

255
00:10:30,471 --> 00:10:32,272
You died before <i>Game of Thrones,</i>

256
00:10:32,273 --> 00:10:34,442
but a-a lot of people will like that.

257
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,613
What is this? Are we still in the past?

258
00:10:39,614 --> 00:10:41,348
No, this is the present.

259
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:44,451
And I just want you to see
that not everyone in Quahog

260
00:10:44,452 --> 00:10:46,353
has lost the Christmas spirit.

261
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,354
Christmas!

262
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,622
- What's this?!
- Coal!

263
00:10:48,623 --> 00:10:49,656
- Why?!
- Bad!

264
00:10:49,657 --> 00:10:50,992
Aw!

265
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:55,996
Ho, ho, ho!

266
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,302
Thank you, Santa!

267
00:11:02,303 --> 00:11:04,037
Daddy, you missed Santa.

268
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,205
He was right here.

269
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:35,903
♪ Night... ♪

270
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:44,344
Wow, no wonder I don't see
Cleveland until New Year's.

271
00:11:44,345 --> 00:11:45,846
At least they're together.

272
00:11:45,847 --> 00:11:48,583
Well, I know one family that
isn't together for Christmas.

273
00:11:54,522 --> 00:11:56,656
That was a delicious meal, Daddy.

274
00:11:56,657 --> 00:11:59,192
You all laughed when I
suggested Boston Market.

275
00:11:59,193 --> 00:12:00,894
Well, who's laughing now?

276
00:12:02,797 --> 00:12:04,030
I guess I am.

277
00:12:04,031 --> 00:12:05,932
All right, everyone,
grab your hot ciders

278
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,634
and gather around the speakerphone.

279
00:12:07,635 --> 00:12:11,072
It's time to call my
grandmother, Nana Pewterschmidt.

00:12:31,325 --> 00:12:32,492
What did she say?

289
00:12:32,493 --> 00:12:34,327
She wishes you a merry Christmas.

290
00:12:34,328 --> 00:12:35,829
That's not what she said.

291
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,330
Time for figgy pudding!

292
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:39,666
Yay!

293
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:41,668
Seems like they're having
a good time without you.

294
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:43,169
Oh, they're just pretending to have fun.

295
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,540
I'm sure they miss me.

296
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,106
We should probably call Durd.

297
00:12:46,107 --> 00:12:47,741
You mean Dad?

298
00:12:47,742 --> 00:12:49,976
No, the fat guy who sleeps with Mom.

299
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,728
You guys talking 'bout Durd?

300
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,581
More champagne, miss?

301
00:12:54,582 --> 00:12:56,683
Miss? Oh, my!

302
00:12:56,684 --> 00:12:59,052
It's been a long time since
anybody's called me miss.

303
00:12:59,053 --> 00:13:01,688
Wow! Merry Christmas, huh?

304
00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:04,124
Oh, Merry Chris-miss! Ha!

305
00:13:05,593 --> 00:13:08,707
Oh, my God, she's doing
that flirty laugh she does.

306
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:11,031
It's subtle, but when you've
been married as long as we have,

307
00:13:11,032 --> 00:13:12,465
you notice these things.

308
00:13:15,069 --> 00:13:16,636
You're very funny, Lance.

309
00:13:16,637 --> 00:13:18,638
You're a very handsome, funny man.

310
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,206
Now, let's see that penis!

311
00:13:20,207 --> 00:13:22,242
Yeah, see, again, if you
read between the lines,

312
00:13:22,243 --> 00:13:23,410
she's flirting.

313
00:13:23,411 --> 00:13:25,487
Why, this isn't a merry
Christmas at all.

314
00:13:25,488 --> 00:13:27,276
I don't like anything
you're showing me, Pat...

315
00:13:27,277 --> 00:13:28,677
Oh, my God, they got Joe.

00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,529
spending Christmas with me tomorrow!

323
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,837
Wha... Wh-Wh...

324
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,071
What's happening?

325
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:01,474
I'm the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come.

326
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:03,375
I'm shaping your future.

327
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:05,911
And you will see...

328
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:10,416
Oops. That's what happens when
I talk while I'm doing this.

329
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:12,752
Is this how Jonah Hill was made?

330
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:17,756
I can't believe our buddy's dead.

331
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:21,594
I know. And it's so sad, he
left his family with nothing.

332
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:24,663
Yeah, Lois had to sell
her clothes to get by.

333
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:27,066
I mean, I love having
this underwear, I just...

334
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,101
I just don't love why I have it.

335
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:31,036
God, it's so sad.

336
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,272
Who's this poor Benjamin that just died?

337
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:35,074
Nobody ever said Benjamin.

338
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,509
Poor, dead Benjamin.

339
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,010
All right, you're not getting it.

340
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:40,013
Let me just take you to your house.

341
00:14:45,855 --> 00:14:48,120
Boy, I love the holiday
season with my husband

342
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:50,523
who's right upstairs, just out of frame.

343
00:14:50,524 --> 00:14:51,690
Oh, am I coming down?

344
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:53,259
Oh, please tell me I lost the weight

345
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,627
and kept it off this time.

346
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:56,395
Merry Christmas!

347
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,935
Who's that guy?

348
00:14:57,936 --> 00:15:00,007
That's Lois's new husband, Lance.

349
00:15:00,008 --> 00:15:01,233
Wow.

350
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,782
I finally had the guts to leave her.

351
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:05,135
Good for you, Peter.

352
00:15:05,136 --> 00:15:06,639
What about the kids? How are they doing?

353
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,907
See for yourself.

354
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,743
All right, everybody,
I'm off to Colombia...

355
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,390
Chris got into Columbia?

356
00:15:12,391 --> 00:15:13,746
South America.

357
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,581
Where I will attempt to smuggle drugs

358
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,917
back into the country in my rectum.

359
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:20,352
Aw, I knew there was some
kind of rug-pull coming.

360
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:22,755
- And I'm off to Yale...
- The lock maker?

361
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:26,091
The lock maker, where I
have a minimum wage job.

362
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,260
All right, okay, yeah, I'm-I'm
getting ahead of these.

363
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,828
I'm going to Brown...

364
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:34,066
four boxes of Jimmy Dean pure
pork sausage for my breakfast.

365
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:36,735
Well, I'm proud all my kids
got into Ivy League puns,

366
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,238
but what happened to Brian?

367
00:15:41,575 --> 00:15:44,077
Hey, what's Brian doing out
here in the graveyard?

368
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:45,851
He usually sleeps at the foot of my bed.

369
00:15:45,852 --> 00:15:47,155
He still does.

370
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,952
Oh, my God!

371
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:55,387
I'm dead? But how?

372
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:59,058
You died from a fire started
by your MILF-On-A-Shelf.

373
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:01,150
Want to see some pictures
of my teenagers?

374
00:16:01,151 --> 00:16:02,162
No, Karen.

375
00:16:02,163 --> 00:16:03,869
Look, I haven't watered
my Christmas tree

376
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,197
for a few weeks now, so could you watch

377
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:06,699
your really long cigarette, please?

378
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,001
Did I tell you I went to
the mall with my daughter

379
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:10,903
and an employee thought we were sisters?

380
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:13,072
Yes, many times.

381
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:14,573
I don't understand.

382
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:16,997
Why didn't someone in my family save me?

383
00:16:16,998 --> 00:16:20,139
They went to Newport because
you wanted to be by yourself.

384
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,199
Remember?

385
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,249
Looks like you got what you wanted.

386
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,628
Oh, my God, look, it's my ghost!

387
00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:26,788
Not exactly.

388
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:28,563
Ugh, why do I smell so bad?

389
00:16:28,564 --> 00:16:31,133
- Because I'm a dog fart now.
- What? Why?

390
00:16:31,134 --> 00:16:33,568
Because that's what happens when
you lose your Christmas spirit.

391
00:16:33,569 --> 00:16:35,470
You spend all of eternity as a dog fart.

392
00:16:35,471 --> 00:16:38,073
- Was this in the book?
- Yes, it was an obscure chapter

393
00:16:38,074 --> 00:16:41,243
written during Dickens' opium
and spoiled lamb phase.

394
00:16:41,244 --> 00:16:42,511
But how do I...

395
00:16:42,512 --> 00:16:44,146
Where'd... where'd he go?

396
00:16:44,147 --> 00:16:46,481
Don't worry, Brian's a 13-year-old dog.

397
00:16:46,482 --> 00:16:48,483
You're around a lot.

398
00:16:48,484 --> 00:16:51,253
Please, Peter, don't lose
your Christmas spirit.

399
00:16:51,254 --> 00:16:52,754
It's disgusting in there.

400
00:16:52,755 --> 00:16:55,590
He eats garbage and his own poo.

401
00:16:55,591 --> 00:16:58,093
Please, Peter, don't lose
your Christmas spirit.

402
00:16:58,094 --> 00:17:00,328
This is no life for a person.

403
00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:02,697
Please, Peter, he ate Lois's trash.

404
00:17:02,698 --> 00:17:04,866
There's tampons in there!

405
00:17:04,867 --> 00:17:06,535
- Please, Peter.
- Keep your Christmas spirit.

406
00:17:06,536 --> 00:17:08,703
- Please, Peter.
- This is no life for a person.

407
00:17:08,704 --> 00:17:10,839
- Please, Peter.
- I'm the tampon one.

408
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,841
No! No!

409
00:17:12,842 --> 00:17:15,210
No!

410
00:17:15,211 --> 00:17:17,179
No, please, spirits, no.

411
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,280
No!

412
00:17:18,281 --> 00:17:19,881
Wh-Where am I?

413
00:17:19,882 --> 00:17:21,190
What day is it?

414
00:17:22,385 --> 00:17:25,987
All the porn girls I follow on
Instagram have Santa hats on.

415
00:17:25,988 --> 00:17:27,389
It must be Christmas!

416
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,891
Merry Christmas, P. O. V. Angie!

417
00:17:29,892 --> 00:17:32,160
Merry Christmas, triple-X underscore

418
00:17:32,161 --> 00:17:34,296
Tara Kink underscore triple-X!

419
00:17:34,297 --> 00:17:37,333
Merry Christmas to all the thirst traps!

420
00:17:43,406 --> 00:17:44,573
Thanks, Grandpa.

421
00:17:44,574 --> 00:17:47,142
This Christmas is
perfect, isn't it, Mom?

422
00:17:47,143 --> 00:17:48,910
Almost, Meg.

423
00:17:48,911 --> 00:17:50,078
Almost.

424
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,513
Yeah, it is,

425
00:17:51,514 --> 00:17:54,416
except every time Grandpa
bends over to get a present,

426
00:17:54,417 --> 00:17:56,017
his robe opens up.

427
00:17:56,018 --> 00:17:58,820
Let's see, I think this is for Chris.

428
00:17:58,821 --> 00:18:00,856
Good God!

429
00:18:00,857 --> 00:18:03,525
Looks like two eggs in
an old handkerchief.

430
00:18:03,526 --> 00:18:06,027
Merry Christmas, everybody!

431
00:18:06,028 --> 00:18:07,413
- Peter!
- Durd!

432
00:18:07,414 --> 00:18:08,541
Dad!

433
00:18:08,542 --> 00:18:10,165
Oh, Peter, you did come.

434
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,800
Yes, Lois, I'm here,

435
00:18:11,801 --> 00:18:13,928
all loaded up with Christmas spirit

436
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:16,838
and a sack full of hastily
bought gifts from the CVS.

437
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:19,608
For Chris, a special
<i>People</i> magazine look-back

438
00:18:19,609 --> 00:18:21,933
at Robin Williams, 'cause
he killed himself.

439
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,702
Wow, look how thick the cover is.

440
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,537
It's almost like a real book!

441
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:29,574
For Stewie, a two-dollar
Styrofoam cooler.

442
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,843
Awesome! I can probably fit 16...

443
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,344
Oh, the top blew away.

444
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,546
For Brian, a Rhode Island sweatshirt

445
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:38,283
with both "Rhode" and
"Island" misspelled!

446
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,285
Wow, it hurts when I put it on!

447
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,287
And for my beloved wife,

448
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,724
a lawn chair that was 80%
off because it's winter.

449
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:49,961
Oh, Peter, I can't wait
to drink outside in this.

450
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:53,965
And finally, for Meg, a clock
radio with an iPod jack

451
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,134
for the iPods they don't make anymore.

452
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,737
Dad, you've never bought
me anything before.

453
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,572
Are you sure this is for me?

454
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:03,241
Of course, Meg, sweetie.

455
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,744
It's Christmas, everything is for you.

456
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,914
I love you, Peter.

457
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:12,984
I love you, too, Lois.

458
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,354
And, Patrick Swayze,
thanks for helping me find

459
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:17,234
the true spirit of Christmas.

460
00:19:17,235 --> 00:19:19,190
I wish there was some
way I could repay you.

461
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:20,525
Who are you talking to?

462
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,560
Well, actually, there's
one thing in heaven

463
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,262
that Chris Farley won't do with me.

464
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,597
I know exactly what
you're talking about.

465
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,709
- Hit it!
- Hit what?

466
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,375
♪ Everyone's watching ♪

474
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,268
Mom, what's he doing?

475
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:05,536
I don't know, Chris.

476
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,071
Let-let's just keep opening presents.

477
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:08,806
He'll tire himself out.

478
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:09,807
Great idea.

479
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:11,277
Here's one for Meg.

480
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:14,612
And here's one for Stewie.

481
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:16,914
And here's one for my
beautiful daughter.

482
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,684
