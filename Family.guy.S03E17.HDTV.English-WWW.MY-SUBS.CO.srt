"It seems today that all you see

00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,220
"Is violence in movies and sex on TV

00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,100
"But where are those
good old-fashioned values

"On which we used to rely?

- So, tell me about yourself, Tina.
- I really love music.

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,810
Me, too. I just saw Don Giovanni. In my
opinion, the best opera of the 18th century.

12
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,640
- Definitely.
- And the use of recitative throughout...

13
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:52,110
- Mozart was a genius.
- Oh, yeah, re... cita... tive...

14
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,490
is really, you know, where it's at.

15
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,620
- Sir, are we ready to order?
- Whoa. Hold on a second.

16
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,910
- You don't know what I'm talking about.
- Sure I do. Opera's bitchin'!

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,840
OK. I guess I'll have the escar-got
and a glass of chab-lis.

18
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,550
Same here. Escar-got and the chab-lis.

19
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,890
Don't dawdle, Jonas. Play your exercises.

20
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,390
Brian, what happened with your date?

21
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,020
- Same as always. She was an idiot.
- Oh, Brian.

22
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,230
Don't slow down, Jonas. Keep the rhythm.

23
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,660
"Bum, bum, bum, bum
Brian, your standards are ridiculously high

24
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:34,960
"You'll never find a girl unless
you compromise so you can find your love

I have to compromise a thing

"I'd rather be alone
if someone doesn't get me

"How long has the coffee
been on the burner?

- " Some crappy movie on TNT

32
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,660
Very good, Jonas. I'll see you next week.

33
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,660
So, you don't think
these women understand you?

34
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,540
I'm not comfortable
talking about this a-melodically.

35
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,880
- Peter, could you...
- Hang on a second.

36
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,630
Now back to "The Life and Times
of Grizzly Adams".

37
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,640
- Grizzly? Who's Steve?
- What?

38
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,770
There's a message
on the machine from Steve.

39
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:26,400
Oh, yeah, Steve. He's... new to the mountain.
I met him down at the general store.

40
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,240
- He makes canoes.
- Oh.

41
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,410
- How come I've never met him?
- He hasn't really been here that long.

42
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,170
- Long enough to get your number!
- Ben! Ben!

43
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,840
Dammit.

44
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,010
Look at that Grizzly Adams.
Look at how confident he is, how majestic.

45
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,350
- I'm gonna grow a beard.
- Peter, you know I hate beards.

46
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:51,230
Oh, no, it's time I joined the ranks
of great men with beards.

47
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:56,650
Why do you think Jesus Christ was
so popular? Because of all the magic tricks?

48
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:01,330
Brian's depressed. Could you take him
with you to the laser rock show tonight?

49
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,790
Sure. That's one thing I'm good at -
cheering people up.

50
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:10,000
Mr and Mrs Ramsey,
JonBenet's untimely death is a tragedy.

51
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,630
And I will not rest until
I find her killer, or killers.

52
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,510
Oh, really, don't bother.
Nothing's going to bring our baby back.

53
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:22,310
- No, I insist. I will make it my life's work...
- We're fine. Drop it.

54
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,950
The next laser rock show
will begin in 20 minutes.

55
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,910
You hear that, Brian? A laser rock show!
Come on, cheer up, would you?

56
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,370
I don't feel like it.

57
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,960
Binary code is a computer language in which
words are translated into zeroes and ones.

58
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,260
Anything can be expressed in binary,

59
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,510
as we demonstrate in this scene
from The Miracle Worker.

60
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,930
0-1-1-0-1-0-0-1.

61
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,310
0-1-1-0-1-0-0-1.

62
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,360
0-1-1-0-1-0-0-1.

63
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,490
01! 01!

64
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,960
You don't think this is amazing?
When I saw this at the 1904 World's Fair,

65
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,760
I nearly crapped my pants!

66
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,340
All right! Virtual reality!

67
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,050
Whoa! You guys gotta try this!

68
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,520
Hey, look at me.
I'm a pole in a strip club! Oh!

69
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,900
It's showtime.

70
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,780
Oh! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh!
Hey, stop! False alarm! Agh!

71
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,950
Oh, my God! I'm flying. I'm flying!

72
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,660
I'll have a Diet Sprite.

73
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,310
You are a filthy whore.

74
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,950
- OK, Johnny Depp or Richard Grieco?
- Oh, that's gross!

75
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,160
- Yeah, let's not do this.
- Come on.

76
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,130
If you're secure in your masculinity,
you can answer a hypothetical.

77
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:12,460
Johnny Depp, cos he kind of
looks like a chick.

78
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,840
- What about you, Peter?
- Oh, man. I don't know.

79
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,020
Richard Grieco would probably appreciate
you more. Not take you for granted.

80
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,150
With Johnny Depp,
he wouldn't really need you.

81
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,860
He'd probably sneak out
after you fell asleep.

82
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,240
Of course, with Johnny, you'd get
financial security. I'd go with Johnny.

83
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,990
Oh, great.

84
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,540
- Brian?
- Hey, Joe. How's it going?

85
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,880
Good. You were doing
a little swerving back there.

86
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,050
- Me and the boys were just...
- Whoa! You're off the meter, Brian.

87
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,930
- You're under arrest.
- Come on.

88
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,220
Move it!

89
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,190
- One of you guys all right to drive?
- Yeah, I can do it.

90
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,860
I'll meet you at The Drunken Clam.
We'll tie one on.

91
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,200
I'm very disappointed in you.

92
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,500
God, a DUl. I can't believe this.
I could actually go to jail.

93
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:15,470
It's OK. You'll get through this DUl
and you'll be a better person for it.

94
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:20,140
Hold on. Don't disguise his alcohol
dependence as a ticket to self-realisation.

95
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:26,110
You're not one to talk. Remember when I gave
you apple juice and told you it was wine?

96
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:30,900
- You are a special person.
- Thanks.

97
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,910
Now, come on. I'm being serious.
I will be serious here for a second.

98
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,210
Are you gonna listen to me?

99
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:44,760
Are you gonna listen to me
so I can tell you that I respect you?

100
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,770
Brian, I know this is a bad time for you.

101
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:55,730
And if I have any advice to give you,
it is this: Grow a beard.

102
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,730
I wish you'd shave that thing.
Beards are so ugly.

103
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,240
- Hey!
- Oh, relax, Wooly Willy.

104
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,660
There's lots of fun things you can do.

105
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,620
- There we go.
- Thanks!

106
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:10,540
On the charge of driving under
the influence, we find you guilty.

107
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,250
Good call. Churn the butter.

108
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,130
Ooh! Ooh!

109
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:19,590
In lieu of jail time, I sentence you
to 100 hours of community service.

110
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,010
Next item.

111
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,980
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
to join these two in holy matrimony.

112
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:31,190
If anyone objects to this union,
speak now or for ever hold your peace.

113
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,070
Quiet! You had your chance!

114
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,460
- What are you doing for community service?
- I got assigned to Outreach to the Elderly.

115
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,000
I gotta take care of an old woman
who hasn't been out in 30 years.

116
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,050
When I got caught at school
with my hand down my pants,

117
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:51,100
I had to keep it there for a whole week.
Ha! What a week!

118
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,390
Taking care of this old woman'll be
like baby-sitting, with bigger diapers.

119
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:58,110
Aha! So they do make bigger diapers!

120
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,440
That deceitful woman told me
I'd have to use the toilet.

121
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,660
Fie on the toilet! It's made slaves of you all.

122
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,620
I've seen it sitting in there,
lazy, slothful porcelain layabout

123
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,790
feeding on other people's doo-doos
while contributing nothing to society!

124
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,460
You get a job!

125
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:23,350
Pearl Burton? My name's Brian. I'm here
from the Outreach to the Elderly programme.

126
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,520
You're late!

127
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,900
- What the hell is this?
- Delousing powder!

128
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,070
Everyone on the outside is filthy!

129
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,370
- You could have warned me.
- OK. It's gonna burn like hell in 30 seconds.

130
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,660
I like my tea at four, my dinner at six.

131
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,580
I take my bath at seven
so I can listen to Paul Harvey.

132
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,760
You'll warm up my bath with quick bursts
from the faucet during commercials.

133
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,640
Paul Harvey moves seamlessly into
commercials. It's been 30 seconds.

134
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,030
- Stop scratching that thing.
- I can't. It's itching like crazy.

135
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:07,160
- Can I scratch your beard?
- You finished your homework?

136
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,660
- Yes.
- OK then.

137
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,880
Brian, you're quiet.
Is community service not going well?

138
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,090
Lois, it's horrible.
I was cleaning her house all day.

139
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,220
It's the worst job I've ever had.
Except for one.

140
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,190
Excuse me. Would you like
to taste my smoked-meat log?

141
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,820
- Here you go. Enjoy your food.
- Yes, enjoy your studio apartment.

142
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,360
- You got something right here.
- Where?

143
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,700
- Other side.
- Here?

144
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,160
- The left side.
- Here?

145
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,950
- Your other left.
- Where?

146
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,620
- Up a little.
- Is it gone?

147
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,080
- Go down.
- Is it gone?

148
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,630
Is it gone? Agh!
Get it off! Get it off! Get it off!

149
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,430
Peter, hold still!

150
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:55,140
- Don't touch that bird!
- What's it to you?

151
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,140
I'm Dr Goodman of the
Quahog Ornithological Society,

152
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:01,480
ironically dining in a restaurant
that serves poultry.

153
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:04,820
- Doctor, what is this?
- It's a very rare species.

154
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,030
The endangered White-rumped Swallow.

155
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,370
- Rump.
- This isn't funny, Chris!

156
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:14,420
Swallow. Look,
just get rid of this bird, all right?

157
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:20,050
I can't do that. Once the swallow has chosen
its nesting place, it's illegal to disturb it.

158
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:22,340
He can't have a bird in his beard.

159
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,770
You have to wait until the bird departs
of its own accord or you'll be prosecuted.

160
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,060
Wow! You sure know a lot of stuff.

161
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,900
- It's great to learn.
- Cos knowledge is power!

162
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:39,660
- What is this? Spit soup?
- Tomato bisque.

163
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,210
- What is this? Snot soup?
- Tomato bisque.

164
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,340
- What is this? Diarrhoea soup?
- I'm not making you anything else. Eat it.

165
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,970
Then I'll have to call the judge,
and that means you'll go to jail!

166
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:56,970
You're one phone call away from getting
a human booster shot from a guy named Mali.

167
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,120
- Dammit!
- Shh!

168
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,830
Sorry! Sorry!

169
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:17,960
- Shut up.
- There's nothing I can do.

170
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,260
- Take it outside.
- Ever heard of a sitter?

171
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:24,640
- It's an endangered species.
- I'll make you an endangered species!

172
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,560
- Good comeback, Potsie!
- I'll kick your ass!

173
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,730
- Yeah!
- Everybody shut up!

174
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,770
He has stopped squawking.
He's receded into my beard.

175
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,610
We can all watch the movie. Shut up.

176
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,870
Eric, we're all going
to Marty's after the movie.

177
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:45,790
- I love you so much.
- I love you too, honey.

178
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,380
- Aah!
- Aah!

179
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,630
- What's wrong?
- Aah!

180
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,300
- Aah!
- Aah!

181
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:54,680
That's it. You're history, pal. No bird
Frenches my wife and gets away with it.

182
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,940
- Help! Help! I've broken my hip!
- Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

183
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,190
Brian!

184
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:07,400
- 5.3 seconds. I could have been dead by now!
- You're not really...?

185
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:11,030
I heard you drop that light bulb, too.
That'll be 67 cents!

186
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,540
- Go warm me up some diarrhoea soup!
- That's it! I've had it with you, you old hag!

187
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:20,960
You're a miserable, dried-up shut-in, trying
to make everyone feel as bad as you do!

188
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:24,930
Why don't you do the world
a big favour and drop dead?!

189
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:31,190
- This last one won't open.
- You gotta jiggle it.

190
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,060
- Like this?
- Let me get it.

191
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:37,450
Oh, thanks. And... you know, drop dead.

192
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:44,540
Get out of my beard,
you squawking bastard!

193
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,290
Nothing. I was hoping
it wouldn't come to this.

194
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,380
Oh, my God! Peter, no!

195
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,130
Lois, the bird must die!

196
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,850
It's gone! It's gone! Oh, thank God!

197
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,940
Peter, what's that sound?

198
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:08,110
Oh, my God. They're babies.

199
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,530
Hey, look, Lois. There are
three of 'em, just like ours.

200
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,630
And, uh... um...

201
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,880
Sweet.

202
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,890
We now return to
E's mysteries and scandals.

203
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,680
- Pearl Burton, the Jingle Queen.
- Pearl?

204
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:34,190
I'm AJ Benza. You won't find Pearl's name
on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

205
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:38,450
Yet from 1945 to 1960, you couldn't
turn on a radio or television

206
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,490
without hearing one
of her trademark jingles.

207
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,290
"You're only healthy when you're tan

208
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:47,620
"So soak up all the sun you can

209
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,500
"With Copper... Coppertone

210
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:54,630
At her peak, Pearl Burton
earned 26 grand a year,

211
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:58,600
which, by today's standards,
would be just under 49 billion dollars.

212
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,480
- Brian, she's beautiful.
- Yeah, and that voice. I had no idea.

213
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,780
In 1961, Pearl used an appearance
at Carnegie Hall to make the leap

214
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,740
from jingle-singer to artist.

215
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,290
That's "Habanera" from Carmen.
Oh, I've never heard it sung so beautifully.

216
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,130
- Sing Coppertone!
- Yeah, Coppertone!

217
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:24,340
- Do Doan's Pills!
- Sing Gold Bond Medicated Powder!

218
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,550
- Pepsodent!
- Chiclets!

219
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:30,930
No one has seen Pearl Burton since
that fateful night over 30 years ago.

220
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:35,730
- She's presumed dead.
- My God. I said those awful things to her!

221
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,780
Pearl!

222
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,870
Pearl, don't do this!

223
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,420
You should be happy.
I'm doing the world a big favour!

224
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,800
Move! Your fur is making my feet sweat!

225
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,510
Pearl, listen to me. I heard you sing.

226
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,350
It was the most beautiful sound
I've ever heard.

227
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,900
Oh, sure. Warbling for
Vick's VapoRub and Dippety-Do!

228
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,020
No, I mean...

229
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:08,480
Stop trying to talk me out of it!
I'm a pathetic sellout!

230
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,200
No one who sings Carmen
like you is pathetic!

231
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,120
- What?
- I heard you sing "Habanera".

232
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,080
- You were sublime.
- You... you liked my aria?

233
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,420
I was overwhelmed.

234
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:24,210
You're the first person who ever
complimented my "Habanera". Thank you.

235
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:29,430
Well... I'd better get going.
I'll see you tomorrow.

236
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,190
- But you're not scheduled tomorrow.
- I know.

237
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:01,970
And then the cow came out of the barn.
See? Look, there's the cow.

238
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,850
And what does a cow say?

239
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,230
Yes! Yes, that's right.
A cow says "Peep-peep-peep-peep. "

240
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,280
- Peter, they're getting awfully big.
- So?

241
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,910
A mother knows when it's time
for her babies to leave the nest.

242
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:19,290
Hey, they're free to go
any time they want! Aah!

243
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,170
Fine. I'll let 'em go.

244
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,100
- Pearl, do you rent or own?
- Own what?

245
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:39,860
Those wings, you angel.
That was fantastic. That was so incredible.

246
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,530
What do you want for dinner? I was thinking
of making that lamb and rice you love.

247
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,080
Pearl, what I'd really like
for dinner is to go out.

248
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:53,210
Brian, you know I can't do that.
I haven't left this house in such a long time.

249
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:56,130
- I'm afraid.
- I know. But I'll be with you.

250
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,220
I don't know.

251
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,560
There's so much you've missed
in the last 30 years.

252

"You've got a lot to see

293
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:48,870
Brian, I've missed so much! I wouldn't be
standing here right now if it wasn't for you!

294
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:56,040
She's in here. Tell the disorderly
when you're ready to leave.

295
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:59,170
- Don't you mean the orderly?
- No, I mean the disorderly.

296
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,640
That's a doctor joke we like to make.
We also like Kevin Pollak.

297
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:08,270
- Oh, my God, Pearl.
- Brian, I don't have much time.

298
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:11,610
I never should have made you leave.
This is all my fault!

299
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:14,400
Shh, shh, shh. Don't be so hard on yourself.

300
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:18,780
Aside from the truck part,
this was the best day of my life.

301
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:22,330
I only wish we could have
a little more time together.

302
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,330
We can.

303
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,530
Goodbye, kids.

304
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,760
Goodbye, Pearl.

305
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,260
Hey, who wants to see a dead body?

306
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,690
- Rough week, huh?
- I've seen better.

307
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:44,730
Brian, looks like somebody's
checking you out.

308
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,700
Nah, I'm not ready yet.
Hey, you're getting some looks yourself.

309
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,330
I'm not ready either.
