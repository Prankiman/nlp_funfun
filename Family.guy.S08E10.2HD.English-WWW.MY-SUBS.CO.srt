00:00:34,115 --> 00:00:36,123
<i>And now
our feature presentation,</i>

12
00:00:36,191 --> 00:00:38,705
<i>Lawrence of Arabia,
presented in its original</i>

13
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:41,117
<i>Ultra-Cinemascope
letterbox format.</i>

14
00:00:43,598 --> 00:00:45,168
Well,
I can't see anything.

15
00:00:45,235 --> 00:00:47,478
Who's the
rather attractive girl on the camel?

16
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:48,715
That's
Peter O'Toole.

17
00:00:48,783 --> 00:00:50,322
You film buffs
might enjoy this.

18
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,765
Both his first and last names
are slang for "penis."

19
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:56,475
We interrupt this program
to bring you exciting news.

20
00:00:56,542 --> 00:00:58,884
<i>Family Feud</i>
will be coming to Quahog.

21
00:00:58,951 --> 00:01:01,596
Auditions are being held
tomorrow at the Civic Center.

22
00:01:01,664 --> 00:01:03,671
<i>Family Feud</i>'s
coming to Quahog?

23
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:05,042
Peter, we
should try out.

24
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,820
A family can win
$5,000 on that show.

25
00:01:07,887 --> 00:01:09,693
$5,000?

26
00:01:09,761 --> 00:01:12,068
I could get that cave for the
front yard I've always wanted,

27
00:01:12,135 --> 00:01:13,841
and then tell people
not to go in there.

28
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:17,620
Hey, you kids stay
out of that cave!

29
00:01:17,688 --> 00:01:19,860
You don't know
what's in there!

30
00:01:19,927 --> 00:01:22,634
Money well spent.

31
00:01:26,944 --> 00:01:29,211
We're looking for fun,
interesting families

32
00:01:29,279 --> 00:01:30,746
that viewers will
want to watch.

33
00:01:30,814 --> 00:01:32,446
You folks have any
interesting stories?

34
00:01:32,514 --> 00:01:34,046
Lois, tell him about
the whole stitches thing

35
00:01:34,114 --> 00:01:35,811
when Chris was born.
Never mind, I'll tell it.

36
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:38,248
Lois was so wrecked,
they had to sew her up

37
00:01:38,316 --> 00:01:40,553
and open up a new vagina
right next to the first one.

38
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:42,289
You know, kinda like
when they build a new bridge

39
00:01:42,358 --> 00:01:43,493
next to the old bridge,
and you're like,

40
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,596
"Wow, I can't believe
I used to use the old one.

41
00:01:45,664 --> 00:01:46,865
Looks so unsafe."

42
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:48,067
All right, enough
clowning around.

43
00:01:48,135 --> 00:01:49,169
Let's talk turkey.
We want to play the <i>Feud</i>.

44
00:01:49,237 --> 00:01:50,540
Well, you're in luck.

45
00:01:50,607 --> 00:01:52,744
The other family we've chosen
has three daughters,

46
00:01:52,811 --> 00:01:55,882
so we're picking you
because you have three sons.

47
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,286
- But I'm not...
- Shut up, <i>Greg</i>.

48
00:02:01,026 --> 00:02:05,198
<i>It's time for the Family Feud.</i>

49
00:02:05,266 --> 00:02:07,770
<i>Introducing
the Callaghan Family.</i>

50
00:02:07,838 --> 00:02:10,473
<i>Ready for action.</i>

51
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,977
<i>And the Griffin Family.</i>

52
00:02:13,044 --> 00:02:16,484
<i>On your marks, let's start...</i>

53
00:02:16,552 --> 00:02:19,556
<i>the Family Feud!</i>

54
00:02:19,624 --> 00:02:21,559
<i>With the star of Family Feud...</i>

55
00:02:21,627 --> 00:02:23,562
<i>Richard Dawson!</i>

56
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,565
Thank you. Thank you very much.

57
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:26,900
Ah, you're lovely.

58
00:02:26,968 --> 00:02:28,302
I haven't heard
that much applause

59
00:02:28,369 --> 00:02:30,972
since Bob Crane premiered
his home movies in my closet.

60
00:02:32,075 --> 00:02:33,444
All right, let's play the <i>Feud</i>.

61
00:02:36,149 --> 00:02:38,654
100 people surveyed,
top four answers on the board.

62
00:02:38,721 --> 00:02:39,889
Here's the question:

63
00:02:39,957 --> 00:02:42,227
Name something you find
in your bathroom.

64
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,264
A sink.

65
00:02:44,332 --> 00:02:45,567
Show us "sink!"

66
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:50,705
Peter, three answers
on the board that can beat that.

67
00:02:50,773 --> 00:02:53,641
Name something you find
in your bathroom.

68
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:56,645
Find in your bathroom.
Find in your bathroom.

69
00:02:56,713 --> 00:02:59,282
Richard, I'm going to go
with "fetus in the toilet bowl."

70
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:01,318
Show us "fetus
in the toilet bowl!"

71
00:03:03,488 --> 00:03:05,455
- Play or pass?
- We're going to play.

72
00:03:05,523 --> 00:03:08,893
Oh, this must be
your lovely wife.

73
00:03:09,929 --> 00:03:11,864
Oh, uh-uh.

74
00:03:11,932 --> 00:03:14,534
I've been waiting
for this for years.

75
00:03:18,622 --> 00:03:21,499
I wanna be your
pinky ring.

76
00:03:23,915 --> 00:03:27,352
Okay, Lois, name something
you find in your bathroom.

77
00:03:27,421 --> 00:03:29,523
Okay, how about
"bathtub?"

78
00:03:33,496 --> 00:03:36,430
Okay, name something you find
in your bathroom.

79
00:03:36,498 --> 00:03:38,065
Um...

80
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:40,101
a razor blade
and a note?

81
00:03:49,211 --> 00:03:51,336
All right, you've got
two strikes, Callaghans.

82
00:03:51,351 --> 00:03:54,421
Name something you'd like
to receive as a gift.

83
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:55,757
Candy?

84
00:03:55,824 --> 00:03:56,958
Show me "candy!"

85
00:03:59,763 --> 00:04:01,097
Wait. We're out?

86
00:04:01,165 --> 00:04:03,100
- But you said if I slept with you...
- All right, Griffins,

87
00:04:03,168 --> 00:04:04,769
here's your chance
to win the game!

88
00:04:04,837 --> 00:04:07,773
Name something you'd like
to receive as a gift.

89
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:09,341
- Groceries!
- Assorted lotions!

90
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:11,276
- An Uzi!
- A dead squirrel!
- Money!

91
00:04:11,344 --> 00:04:12,777
- All right, good answer, good answer!
- Yeah, money!

92
00:04:12,844 --> 00:04:14,345
- Oh, very good! Good answer!
- There you go! There you go!

93
00:04:14,412 --> 00:04:16,512
Well, Richard, my family seems
to think money's the way to go.

94
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,013
So I'm gonna go
with the flute

95
00:04:18,081 --> 00:04:20,848
that Captain Picard played,
first in his imagination

96
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,183
and then in real life, in the
episode "The Inner Light"

97
00:04:23,251 --> 00:04:24,851
from <i>Star Trek:
The Next Generation</i>.

98
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:27,452
What?! No, you idiot!
We said "money!"

99
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,053
Show me "Picard's flute!"

100
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:35,523
- Peter, how did you...?
- I was in the survey.

101
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,724
Can you believe it?
We're going to the bonus round!

102
00:04:40,794 --> 00:04:42,728
Okay, Lois.
15 seconds on the clock.

103
00:04:42,796 --> 00:04:44,396
Name something
you sit in.

104
00:04:44,464 --> 00:04:45,831
- A chair.
- My own feces.

105
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:47,165
Name a popular fruit.

106
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:48,433
- Orange.
- Clay Aiken.

107
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:49,767
Something in your closet.

108
00:04:49,835 --> 00:04:51,102
- Shoes.
- Scary monsters.

109
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:52,303
Your favorite holiday.

110
00:04:52,371 --> 00:04:53,571
- Christmas.
- 9/11.

111
00:04:53,638 --> 00:04:55,405
Something you do
on the weekends.

112
00:04:55,473 --> 00:04:57,273
- Go to church.
- Black guys.

113
00:04:58,741 --> 00:05:00,842
All right,
"Something you sit in."

114
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,176
You said "chair."

115
00:05:02,244 --> 00:05:03,377
Survey said...

116
00:05:04,744 --> 00:05:06,178
Wait a sec. I said "feces."

117
00:05:06,246 --> 00:05:07,545
Where's my answer?

118
00:05:07,613 --> 00:05:09,380
Oh, you're just going to pretend
I'm not here, huh?

119
00:05:09,447 --> 00:05:12,382
Just like Robin Williams' agent
pretends he's still funny.

120
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:14,216
Hello?

121
00:05:14,284 --> 00:05:15,884
Hey, Phil,
it's Robin Williams.

122
00:05:15,952 --> 00:05:18,219
That's hilarious!

123
00:05:18,287 --> 00:05:20,888
I just wanted to make sure the
meeting is still on for 2:30 tomorrow.

124
00:05:20,956 --> 00:05:22,723
Otherwise I gotta go
to that Chinese dentist.

125
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:23,958
Get it? 2:30?

126
00:05:25,528 --> 00:05:28,264
You son of a bitch,
I had a mouth full of coffee.

127
00:05:28,332 --> 00:05:30,735
God, you are funny,
and that is real!

128
00:05:30,803 --> 00:05:32,739
Okay, Peter,
Lois did great.

129
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:35,277
You only need one point
to win the $5,000.

130
00:05:35,345 --> 00:05:36,478
20 seconds.

131
00:05:36,546 --> 00:05:38,147
Name something
you sit in.

132
00:05:38,215 --> 00:05:39,481
Chair.

133
00:05:39,549 --> 00:05:41,250
- Try again.
- Big chair.

134
00:05:41,317 --> 00:05:42,850
No, that's
the same thing.

135
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:44,418
- Try again.
- High chair.

136
00:05:44,485 --> 00:05:46,418
That's still a chair.

137
00:05:46,486 --> 00:05:48,353
- Chair.
- Say something other than "chair."

138
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,586
What if I can't think
anything?

139
00:05:49,654 --> 00:05:51,254
- You can pass.
- How do I pass?

140
00:05:51,321 --> 00:05:52,420
- Just say it.
- Say what?

141
00:05:52,488 --> 00:05:54,055
Say "pass."

142
00:05:54,123 --> 00:05:55,256
Chair.

143
00:05:55,324 --> 00:05:56,925
Oh, I'm sorry.
Your time is up,

144
00:05:56,993 --> 00:05:58,526
and you didn't score
enough points.

145
00:05:58,594 --> 00:05:59,727
But thank you
for playing.

146
00:05:59,795 --> 00:06:01,562
Whoa, what, that's it?
We lose?

147
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,898
I'm afraid so, but we enjoyed
having you here.

148
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:06,900
You son of a bitch,
what about my cave in the yard?

149
00:06:06,968 --> 00:06:08,569
What about my cave
in the yard?!

150
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:10,004
Get your hands off me.

151
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:12,073
I served
in the fictitious military.

152
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:16,742
Peter! Oh, my God,
are you all right?

153
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:18,877
What happened?

154
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,578
Where am I?

155
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,613
- Who are you?
- I'm Lois.

156
00:06:22,681 --> 00:06:24,615
Lois who?

157
00:06:24,683 --> 00:06:26,117
Who the hell am I?

158
00:06:26,184 --> 00:06:27,652
Uh-oh.

159
00:06:50,017 --> 00:06:52,152
Mrs. Griffin, I'm afraid
your husband has amnesia.

160
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,788
Oh, my God,
is it permanent?

161
00:06:54,855 --> 00:06:56,289
Well, there's no telling
for sure.

162
00:06:56,357 --> 00:06:58,291
His memory could return
in days, weeks,

163
00:06:58,359 --> 00:07:00,126
years, or never.

164
00:07:00,194 --> 00:07:01,494
Or weeks.

165
00:07:04,031 --> 00:07:06,966
Peter, I want you
to meet your family.

166
00:07:07,034 --> 00:07:09,268
You're... my family?

167
00:07:09,336 --> 00:07:10,469
That's right.

168
00:07:10,537 --> 00:07:11,969
These are
your children.

169
00:07:12,037 --> 00:07:13,470
Dad, I'm Chris.

170
00:07:13,537 --> 00:07:14,869
I... I'm your son.

171
00:07:14,937 --> 00:07:16,469
Never seen you before
in my life.

172
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:19,536
Wow, then I must
be invisible!

173
00:07:20,805 --> 00:07:23,740
Hey, everybody, I'm invisible!

174
00:07:23,807 --> 00:07:25,741
Oh, no, you're not!

175
00:07:25,808 --> 00:07:27,142
Hot diggity!

176
00:07:28,177 --> 00:07:29,510
This is Meg,
your daughter.

177
00:07:29,578 --> 00:07:30,711
D'oh!

178
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:32,513
No, Peter, that's not
your catchphrase.

179
00:07:32,581 --> 00:07:33,548
Oh.

180
00:07:33,615 --> 00:07:36,018
Sorry, I just don't
remember anything.

181
00:07:36,085 --> 00:07:38,721
Dad, this is your baby
and your dog.

182
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:40,055
Ooh, he doesn't
remember us.

183
00:07:40,123 --> 00:07:42,122
It's an opportunity to come up
with our own names.

184
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,790
I'm Tomax
and this is Xamot.

185
00:07:43,858 --> 00:07:46,292
We're twins who can feel
each other's pain.

186
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,626
- Ow!
- No, Brian,

187
00:07:47,694 --> 00:07:48,961
I'm supposed
to say "ow!"

188
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:50,862
You ruin everything!

189
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:51,930
Ow.

190
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:56,734
All right, Peter, we're going
to try to jog your memory

191
00:07:56,801 --> 00:07:58,669
with some old videotapes
of the family.

192
00:07:58,736 --> 00:08:00,270
Boy, you got
a lot of tapes here.

193
00:08:00,337 --> 00:08:02,605
I kinda want to watch
some of these instead.

194
00:08:02,672 --> 00:08:04,206
<i>Pretty Woman</i>?
What's that?

195
00:08:04,273 --> 00:08:05,673
It's just a movie
from the '80s.

196
00:08:05,741 --> 00:08:07,508
Oh, my God, we gotta watch this.

197
00:08:07,576 --> 00:08:08,842
Look what they're
saying about it.

198
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:11,477
"As funny as it is touching!
Gene Shalit."

199
00:08:11,545 --> 00:08:14,312
"I stood up and cheered,
'Go, Julia, go!'

200
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,813
Joel Siegel."

201
00:08:15,881 --> 00:08:18,815
"This movie made me laugh
so hard I had mild headaches.

202
00:08:18,883 --> 00:08:21,651
"So I went to the doctor
and got myself checked out.

203
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:24,319
I'm currently awaiting results.
Gene Siskel."

204
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:26,687
Everyone seems to love this.
We gotta watch it!

205
00:08:26,755 --> 00:08:28,388
We'll watch it
later, Peter.

206
00:08:28,456 --> 00:08:30,890
I want to show you one
of the most special times

207
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:34,695
of your life and mine:
our honeymoon.

208
00:08:42,738 --> 00:08:44,672
I think you've
had enough, Peter.

209
00:08:44,739 --> 00:08:46,106
Oh, you don't know...

210
00:08:46,174 --> 00:08:49,175
Get away. I... I know my
body better than you!

211
00:08:50,877 --> 00:08:52,644
Is that... us?

212
00:08:52,712 --> 00:08:53,911
Yes, Peter.

213
00:08:53,979 --> 00:08:55,246
You were so handsome

214
00:08:55,313 --> 00:08:57,981
and it was such
a wonderful week.

215
00:08:58,049 --> 00:09:00,983
Hey, buddy, I think
that girl likes me.

216
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:02,752
Of course she does.
She's your wife.

217
00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:04,019
Do you like her?

218
00:09:04,087 --> 00:09:06,021
I don't know.

219
00:09:09,991 --> 00:09:11,992
You know, this isn't going
to be easy, you guys.

220
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:13,693
We're going to have
to re-teach your father

221
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,262
everything
he's forgotten.

222
00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:17,066
Hey, have you heard
this awesome new song?

223
00:09:17,134 --> 00:09:18,067
No!

224
00:09:18,135 --> 00:09:19,435
♪ A well, a bird,
bird, bird, ♪

225
00:09:19,503 --> 00:09:20,536
♪ b... bird's the word. ♪

226
00:09:20,604 --> 00:09:21,870
♪ A well, a bird,
bird, bird, ♪

227
00:09:21,938 --> 00:09:23,338
♪ b... bird's the word,
a well, a... ♪

228
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,808
This is called
a telephone, Peter.

229
00:09:27,876 --> 00:09:30,545
You use it to talk to people
who aren't in the house.

230
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:31,747
There are others?

231
00:09:31,816 --> 00:09:34,653
Yes, there are over six billion
people in the world.

232
00:09:34,721 --> 00:09:35,855
Here, I'll show you.

233
00:09:35,923 --> 00:09:37,724
We'll call my parents.

234
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:39,125
<i>Hello?</i>

235
00:09:39,193 --> 00:09:40,393
Hello.

236
00:09:40,461 --> 00:09:41,827
<i>- Who's this?</i>
- Who's this?

237
00:09:41,895 --> 00:09:43,128
<i>Carter. Who's this?</i>

238
00:09:43,195 --> 00:09:44,962
I don't know.

239
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,963
<i>- Do you have my OxyContin?</i>
- What?

240
00:09:47,031 --> 00:09:48,965
<i>- Are you the guy?</i>
- I'm a guy.

241
00:09:49,032 --> 00:09:50,466
<i>I want my drugs.</i>

242
00:09:50,534 --> 00:09:51,800
What are drugs?

243
00:09:51,868 --> 00:09:54,402
<i>I don't think this is the call
I was expecting.</i>

244
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,406
Now, Peter,
this is your silverware.

245
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,007
You see,
this is your fork.

246
00:10:02,075 --> 00:10:03,242
And this is a knife.

247
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:05,010
That's not a knife.

248
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:06,712
That's a knife.

249
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,380
This is also a knife.

250
00:10:08,448 --> 00:10:09,681
Oh.

251
00:10:09,749 --> 00:10:11,717
Well, I'll be
on my way.

252
00:10:11,784 --> 00:10:14,720
I want to see more of him,
and then suddenly none of him.

253
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:16,288
Forever.

254
00:10:21,093 --> 00:10:22,660
All right, you know what?

255
00:10:22,728 --> 00:10:23,861
This is not working.

256
00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:25,095
If you're going
to learn to drive,

257
00:10:25,162 --> 00:10:26,728
you're going to have
to practice first.

258
00:10:26,796 --> 00:10:29,397
Here, play "Grand Theft
Auto" for eight hours,

259
00:10:29,465 --> 00:10:32,266
and then we'll give
it another try.

260
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,313
So, you guys are
my best friends,

261
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:49,014
and this is where
we hang out?

262
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,181
That's right.

263
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:51,649
I'm Quagmire,
and this is Joe.

264
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,050
So, what do we do here?

265
00:10:53,117 --> 00:10:55,151
Well, we usually come here,
you buy us drinks

266
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:57,019
and tell us what Lois'
nipples look like,

267
00:10:57,087 --> 00:10:58,186
like you always do.

268
00:10:58,254 --> 00:10:59,354
Giggity-giggity.

269
00:10:59,421 --> 00:11:01,455
Yeah, but first,
you usually go over there

270
00:11:01,523 --> 00:11:03,790
and pull down
that blonde waitress's top.

271
00:11:07,526 --> 00:11:09,627
She screamed,
so I had to slap her.

272
00:11:14,402 --> 00:11:15,938
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

273
00:11:16,006 --> 00:11:17,941
Get nude. Get nude.
Please get nude.

274
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:19,342
Please get nude.

275
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,378
Peter, you don't
have to spy on me.

276
00:11:21,445 --> 00:11:22,679
You're my husband.

277
00:11:22,747 --> 00:11:24,214
Come on in.

278
00:11:24,282 --> 00:11:25,615
Oh, boy, no fooling?

279
00:11:25,683 --> 00:11:26,783
Oh, boy!

280
00:11:26,851 --> 00:11:27,951
Wait a minute.

281
00:11:28,018 --> 00:11:29,285
Something's happening
in my pants.

282
00:11:29,353 --> 00:11:30,586
In the front this time.

283
00:11:30,654 --> 00:11:32,053
That's all
right, Peter.

284
00:11:32,121 --> 00:11:34,121
It just means
you're excited.

285
00:11:34,189 --> 00:11:35,956
That's the way
it's supposed to be

286
00:11:36,023 --> 00:11:37,724
between a husband
and wife.

287
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,726
It means you want
to make love.

288
00:11:39,795 --> 00:11:42,530
But I forget how
to make love.

289
00:11:42,598 --> 00:11:43,832
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

290
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:45,266
That's okay.

291
00:11:45,334 --> 00:11:46,599
I'll show you.

292
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:48,232
Just follow my lead.

293
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,537
♪ It feels like the first time. ♪

294
00:11:54,605 --> 00:11:57,973
♪ It feels like
the very first time... ♪

295
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:19,392
Wow! That was what
they call sex?

296
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:21,193
Yes, it was, Peter.

297
00:12:21,261 --> 00:12:22,528
Can we do it again?

298
00:12:22,596 --> 00:12:24,096
Huh? Huh? Can we?

299
00:12:24,164 --> 00:12:25,365
Wow!

300
00:12:25,432 --> 00:12:28,134
You're as excited as a porcupine
meeting a pineapple.

301
00:12:29,636 --> 00:12:32,172
Hey, good-looking,
where have you been all my life?

302
00:12:39,281 --> 00:12:41,782
Morning, nice people who
I still don't know your names

303
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,351
and who mean nothing to me.

304
00:12:43,418 --> 00:12:45,753
Well, I certainly hope
that doesn't apply to me,

305
00:12:45,821 --> 00:12:47,922
especially after
last night.

306
00:12:47,989 --> 00:12:49,790
You got a point
there, hot stuff.

307
00:12:49,858 --> 00:12:51,425
And if sex with the rest of you

308
00:12:51,493 --> 00:12:53,293
is half as good
as it was with her,

309
00:12:53,361 --> 00:12:55,862
then I think we're all gonna
get along just fine.

310
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,197
Yay!

311
00:12:57,264 --> 00:12:59,965
Well, no, no, Peter, you can't
have sex with the kids.

312
00:13:00,033 --> 00:13:02,934
Well, I wish you'd told him that
before he lost his memory.

313
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,303
It was a joke!

314
00:13:05,371 --> 00:13:06,969
I was just making a joke.

315
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:08,336
That's your sense of humor?

316
00:13:08,404 --> 00:13:10,369
I was just kidding. God!

317
00:13:10,436 --> 00:13:11,635
Meg, that's awful.

318
00:13:11,703 --> 00:13:13,903
Geez, you open your mouth
for a joke once,

319
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,638
and that's what
you come up with?

320
00:13:15,705 --> 00:13:16,805
That's messed up, Meg.

321
00:13:16,872 --> 00:13:18,239
I was just trying to be funny.

322
00:13:18,307 --> 00:13:20,307
That wasn't funny.
That was just dark.

323
00:13:20,374 --> 00:13:21,807
Yeah, that's your father.

324
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:22,975
Oh, get out, Meg!

325
00:13:23,043 --> 00:13:24,142
Get out of the kitchen!

326
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,278
Go on! Get out!
Out! Out! Out!

327
00:13:26,345 --> 00:13:27,979
Out of the kitchen! Go on!

328
00:13:28,046 --> 00:13:29,280
Get out of here!

329
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,917
Oh, Peter,
there you are.

330
00:13:35,985 --> 00:13:37,485
I've been waiting.

331
00:13:37,553 --> 00:13:39,220
You ready
to have sex?

332
00:13:39,288 --> 00:13:40,388
You bet.

333
00:13:40,455 --> 00:13:42,256
Move over
so Tiffany and I have room.

334
00:13:42,324 --> 00:13:43,658
What?! Who the
hell is she?

335
00:13:43,725 --> 00:13:45,727
She's the woman
I'm gonna have sex with tonight.

336
00:13:45,794 --> 00:13:47,595
Oh, and don't worry
about getting me pregnant.

337
00:13:47,663 --> 00:13:48,763
I'm already pregnant.

338
00:13:48,831 --> 00:13:50,465
Peter, what's the
matter with you?

339
00:13:50,532 --> 00:13:52,667
You can't just have sex
with some random woman.

340
00:13:52,735 --> 00:13:54,235
Why the hell not?

341
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,403
Because we're married.

342
00:13:55,471 --> 00:13:56,571
Well, I'm sorry,

343
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,039
but I don't remember
marrying anybody.

344
00:13:58,107 --> 00:14:00,942
Why the hell would I commit
to having sex with one person

345
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,377
for the rest of my life?

346
00:14:02,444 --> 00:14:04,011
Because we love
each other.

347
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,213
That's part of
being a family.

348
00:14:06,281 --> 00:14:08,615
It means being
responsible and faithful.

349
00:14:08,683 --> 00:14:10,283
Well, that doesn't sound
very fun.

350
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:12,184
Well, if that's how you feel,

351
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:14,719
then... then we no longer
have a family.

352
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,187
Boy, I'm glad you said it.

353
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,656
But this is my house,
and I'm not going anywhere.

354
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:19,890
You don't have to.

355
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,559
I'm leaving, and I'm
taking the kids with me.

356
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,564
That's a beautiful necklace
you're wearing, Tiffany.

357
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,062
Thank you.

358
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,028
Is that what you do with your
<i>Saved By the Bell</i> money?

359
00:14:37,248 --> 00:14:40,087
Mom, I don't want to live
in a tiny, gross apartment.

360
00:14:40,155 --> 00:14:42,691
Well, I'm sorry, honey,
but we don't have a choice.

361
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:44,193
Your father doesn't
remember his life,

362
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,928
and he doesn't want us
to be a part of it,

363
00:14:46,996 --> 00:14:48,629
so we've just got
to move on.

364
00:14:48,697 --> 00:14:49,797
Oh, this is disgusting.

365
00:14:49,865 --> 00:14:51,132
I shouldn't be here.

366
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,033
A baby doesn't belong
in the inner city

367
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,135
any more than a baby
belongs on a plane.

368
00:14:56,404 --> 00:14:57,938
Shh. It's gonna be okay.

369
00:14:58,005 --> 00:14:59,539
Gonna be okay.

370
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,341
<i>Our in-flight
movie this evening is Hancock.</i>

371
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:04,376
- Waa!
- Waa!

372
00:15:04,443 --> 00:15:08,079
- Waa!
- Waa!

373
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,952
Peter, what the hell
is all this?

374
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,120
Well, I'm a bachelor,

375
00:15:19,187 --> 00:15:20,988
so I invited a bunch
of people over,

376
00:15:21,056 --> 00:15:22,857
and now I'm waiting
for them to leave.

377
00:15:22,925 --> 00:15:24,025
That's what bachelors do.

378
00:15:24,093 --> 00:15:25,426
Peter, I'm interested
in the redhead

379
00:15:25,494 --> 00:15:27,294
with the wooden arms
and legs over there.

380
00:15:27,362 --> 00:15:28,694
You think you
could introduce me?

381
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,561
- That's a table, Seamus.
- Don't point at her.

382
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:31,728
Don't point.
She's looking.

383
00:15:31,796 --> 00:15:33,463
Oh, great.
Now I got to go in.

384
00:15:33,531 --> 00:15:34,631
Hey, I'm Seamus.

385
00:15:34,698 --> 00:15:36,366
Peter, you left your family
for this?

386
00:15:36,433 --> 00:15:38,468
Look, I don't know
what I was doing before,

387
00:15:38,535 --> 00:15:40,803
but this is the way
man was meant to live.

388
00:15:40,871 --> 00:15:42,038
I just know it.

389
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:43,206
Check it out.

390
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,706
Don't you miss your family?

391
00:15:46,774 --> 00:15:48,140
What, that lady
and those kids?

392
00:15:48,207 --> 00:15:50,308
I don't even remember 'em.
How could I miss them?

393
00:15:50,376 --> 00:15:51,910
I almost don't want
to ask you out

394
00:15:51,977 --> 00:15:53,312
because I know
you're gonna say no.

395
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:54,480
You want to go out?

396
00:15:54,548 --> 00:15:55,715
No? Okay.

00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:18,700
Oh, hi, Quagmire.

406
00:16:18,768 --> 00:16:19,868
What a surprise.

407
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:21,102
I know, right?

408
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,437
Gosh, you know, I was just
picking up a couple hams

409
00:16:23,504 --> 00:16:25,939
to take down to the shelter,
and here I run into you,

410
00:16:26,007 --> 00:16:27,574
buying food to make
dinner for your husband.

411
00:16:27,642 --> 00:16:29,910
No, actually, Glenn,
maybe you haven't heard,

412
00:16:29,977 --> 00:16:32,679
but, uh, Peter and I
aren't together anymore.

413
00:16:32,746 --> 00:16:34,713
What?! Why?!

414
00:16:34,781 --> 00:16:35,981
Oh, it's a long story.

415
00:16:36,049 --> 00:16:37,816
You don't want to hear about it.

416
00:16:37,883 --> 00:16:38,983
Oh, shut your face.

417
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:40,251
I want to hear
all about it.

418
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:42,520
But listen, you know,
I got all this shopping to do,

419
00:16:42,587 --> 00:16:44,154
so you want to stop by
tomorrow night?

420
00:16:44,222 --> 00:16:45,422
I'll just whip
something up.

421
00:16:45,489 --> 00:16:46,623
Well, sure.

422
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,691
You know,
that sounds nice, Glenn.

423
00:16:49,893 --> 00:16:52,327
Holy smokes,
this is a sure thing.

424
00:16:52,395 --> 00:16:54,329
Like the end
of a Mexican wedding.

425
00:17:03,906 --> 00:17:05,240
Aw, crap, we're out of milk.

426
00:17:05,308 --> 00:17:07,843
I'm gonna run next door
to the airport and get some.

427
00:17:07,911 --> 00:17:10,312
Hey, when you're over there,
can you get some rodent traps?

428
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,514
We got a giant mutant rat
living under the sink.

429
00:17:12,582 --> 00:17:14,516
I'm just gonna hide
under the sink

430
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:16,017
till y'all go to sleep.

431
00:17:16,085 --> 00:17:18,519
Then I'm gonna come out
and make my poops in your Kix.

432
00:17:18,586 --> 00:17:19,920
Hey, Stewie,
is Lois back yet?

433
00:17:19,987 --> 00:17:22,055
I've been trying
to get a hold of her.

434
00:17:22,122 --> 00:17:23,457
She went to Quagmire's
for dinner.

435
00:17:23,524 --> 00:17:24,558
What?!

436
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:30,296
Oh, that was a
delicious dinner, Glenn.

437
00:17:30,364 --> 00:17:31,931
I didn't know
you could cook.

438
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:34,699
Well, when a fella's been alone
as long as I have,

439
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:36,434
he learns
to take care of himself.

440
00:17:36,501 --> 00:17:38,302
Well, you're a
very sweet friend,

441
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,570
and you're so good to
listen to my troubles.

442
00:17:40,637 --> 00:17:42,438
Oh, I could listen
for hours, Lois.

443
00:17:42,505 --> 00:17:44,073
Phew! Boy, you know,

444
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,542
I don't know how a half a glass
of wine got me so lightheaded.

445
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:48,910
I better lie down.

446
00:17:48,977 --> 00:17:50,746
You want me to
help you upstairs?

447
00:17:50,814 --> 00:17:52,816
Oh, my God,
you are a saint!

448
00:17:55,787 --> 00:17:58,321
No, I... I think I can
make it from here. I... I...

449
00:17:58,389 --> 00:18:00,056
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

450
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:03,891
Whoops!

451
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,860
Professor Klutz,
the doctor is in.

452
00:18:07,229 --> 00:18:08,830
Oh, where is
this heading?

453
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,634
Oh, hiya, Brian.

454
00:18:12,702 --> 00:18:13,835
All right, Peter,
now I know

455
00:18:13,903 --> 00:18:15,169
your head is still
a blank slate,

456
00:18:15,237 --> 00:18:17,138
but you got to listen
to me when I say...

457
00:18:17,205 --> 00:18:18,805
Wait. Did you just
call me Brian?

458
00:18:18,873 --> 00:18:19,973
Oh, yeah.

459
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,474
- You've got your memory back?
- Uh-huh.

460
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,942
Happened yesterday on my way
back from the grocery store.

461
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,711
Hi, Peter.

462
00:18:28,181 --> 00:18:30,720
Hey, you just snubbed me
in front of my own house.

463
00:18:30,788 --> 00:18:32,355
I thought we'd come
to an understanding.

464
00:18:32,422 --> 00:18:35,324
Look, fella, I don't know
who you are and I don't want to,

465
00:18:35,392 --> 00:18:37,559
so why don't you just go back
to your crabgrass?

466
00:18:37,627 --> 00:18:39,994
This happens to be
fresh Marathon Sod!

467
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:43,764
Oh, man, I just got
my memory back.

468
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,566
And as I recall,
I don't really care for you!

469
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,202
Wait a minute.
Who are you?

470
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:50,569
Hey, I know you!

471
00:18:50,637 --> 00:18:52,003
What's your beef, stranger?

472
00:18:52,071 --> 00:18:54,438
Well, if it isn't
my old nemesis!

473
00:18:54,506 --> 00:18:56,940
I was just lucky he had
an odd number of objects.

474
00:18:57,008 --> 00:18:58,507
Why the hell
didn't you tell anybody?

475
00:18:58,575 --> 00:19:00,542
Well, I figured I could
enjoy the bachelor life

476
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,610
for a few more days
before getting Lois back.

477
00:19:02,678 --> 00:19:04,478
Well, you may have waited
too long already.

478
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:06,012
Lois is on a date
with Quagmire,

479
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,947
and you've got to stop her
before something happens.

480
00:19:08,015 --> 00:19:09,782
What?! Oh, my God! Where is she?

481
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,250
She's next door at his house.

482
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:12,751
And you better get there quick,

483
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,420
because with Quagmire,
sex is inevitable.

484
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,189
Like a fat guy ordering dessert

485
00:19:16,257 --> 00:19:17,858
when everyone else wants
to leave.

486
00:19:17,926 --> 00:19:20,226
So, does anyone
want dessert?

487
00:19:20,294 --> 00:19:21,761
Ah, I couldn't
eat another bite.

488
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:24,029
No. I got to get home
for the sitter.

489
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,196
I'll have
the soufflé.

490
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:26,364
That takes
45 minutes.

491
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:27,600
That's okay.

492
00:19:31,372 --> 00:19:33,040
Oh, I can't believe
we're doing this,

493
00:19:33,108 --> 00:19:35,575
but I got to say,
it feels kind of right.

494
00:19:35,643 --> 00:19:37,343
I know, it's so
weird, right?

495
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:39,478
I mean, it's... I mean,
it's, like, fast.

496
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:42,579
I mean, it's fast, but it feels,
like, okay, you know?

497
00:19:42,647 --> 00:19:44,215
I mean, like,
isn't that crazy?

498
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,586
It's like this adventure
that we're having together.

499
00:19:46,654 --> 00:19:49,122
I know. That's exactly
how I feel.

500
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,291
I mean, it's a little strange,

501
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,459
but if Peter's never
coming back to me,

502
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,027
it's at least nice to know

503
00:19:55,095 --> 00:19:57,162
I'm in the arms
of a trusted friend.

504
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:00,331
You... You trust me?

505
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,033
Uh-oh.

506
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:04,435
Wha...? Is something wrong?

507
00:20:04,502 --> 00:20:05,803
I... I... I don't know.

508
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,239
I'll be right back.

509
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,174
Damn it!

510
00:20:11,242 --> 00:20:12,842
Lois!

511
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,010
Peter?!

512
00:20:14,077 --> 00:20:15,410
What... What are you doing here?

513
00:20:15,478 --> 00:20:17,679
I got my memory back,
and I love you, Lois.

514
00:20:17,747 --> 00:20:19,280
I want you and the kids back.

515
00:20:19,348 --> 00:20:20,648
I want our old life back.

516
00:20:21,884 --> 00:20:23,117
I don't believe it!

517
00:20:23,185 --> 00:20:24,583
Sweetheart, it's you!

518
00:20:24,651 --> 00:20:25,817
You're back!

519
00:20:25,885 --> 00:20:27,218
Oh! Damn it!

520
00:20:27,285 --> 00:20:29,552
I'm back, Lois,
and I'm sorry.

521
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,221
I treated you so badly,
but I hope you know

522
00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:34,456
it... it was only because
I wasn't myself.

523
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,291
I didn't just
lose my memory.

524
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:37,458
I lost my mind.

525
00:20:37,526 --> 00:20:38,626
Clear!

526
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:41,061
Damn it!

527
00:20:41,128 --> 00:20:42,763
Oh, my God, Peter,
I don't care!

528
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,930
I don't care.

529
00:20:43,998 --> 00:20:45,632
I'm just overjoyed
to have you back!

530
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,834
Let's go home!

531
00:20:48,937 --> 00:20:50,270
Damn it!

532
00:20:50,338 --> 00:20:51,571
Damn it.

533
00:20:51,572 --> 00:20:54,572
