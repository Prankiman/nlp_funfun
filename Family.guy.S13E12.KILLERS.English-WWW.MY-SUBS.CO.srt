TV ANNOUNCER: <i>We now return to</i> Top Chef:
Looney Tunes Edition.

13
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:40,396
Okay, Chef Fudd, I was a little
disappointed in you this week.

14
00:00:40,431 --> 00:00:42,098
Your dish was
just a live rabbit

15
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:43,799
who thought
he was taking a bath.

16
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,635
But I used
carrots and celery.

17
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,838
Yes. I saw he was scrubbing his
back with a long celery stalk.

18
00:00:48,873 --> 00:00:50,406
Chef Sylvester,
on the other hand,

19
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:52,642
I'm happy to say
your sufferin' succotash

20
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:54,310
was absolutely delicious.

21
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:55,678
(lisps):
Thanks.

22
00:00:55,713 --> 00:00:57,680
(phone rings)
Hello?

23
00:00:57,715 --> 00:00:58,948
Oh, hi, Bonnie.

24
00:00:58,983 --> 00:01:00,349
No, I'm not doing anything.

25
00:01:00,385 --> 00:01:02,018
Just sitting here
with the baby.

26
00:01:02,053 --> 00:01:03,352
Yeah, screw you, too.

27
00:01:03,388 --> 00:01:05,187
Oh, hey, Bri.
Hey, you want to go out

28
00:01:05,223 --> 00:01:06,522
and get some
gluten-free pizza?

29
00:01:06,558 --> 00:01:07,990
I'm gluten-free now.
But, you know,

30
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,692
I'm not gonna be
annoying about it.

31
00:01:09,727 --> 00:01:10,393
Too late.

32
00:01:10,395 --> 00:01:11,873
Oh, we should be
gluten-free together!

33
00:01:11,896 --> 00:01:14,530
Let's go to Whole Foods
and buy a bunch of stuff

34
00:01:14,566 --> 00:01:16,499
from that weird aisle
nobody else goes down.

35
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,701
I can't. I got plans.
I'll see you later.

36
00:01:18,736 --> 00:01:20,903
Oh, sure.
Maybe another time.

37
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,372
Ugh. I didn't seem
too desperate, right?

38
00:01:23,408 --> 00:01:26,676
Don't answer. It's just that
Brian's been so distant lately,

39
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:30,012
and we used to be inseparable--
like Jack and Jill.

40
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,181
Oh, so then Jack takes
these two pails of water

41
00:01:32,216 --> 00:01:34,550
and trips and totally
falls down the hill.

42
00:01:34,586 --> 00:01:35,751
(laughter)
Ha, ha, ha.

43
00:01:35,787 --> 00:01:37,687
Yeah. Hey,
I got a funny story.

44
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,855
Jill had a tooth fall out,
and she swallowed it,

45
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,458
and then we had to root
through her feces to find it.

46
00:01:42,493 --> 00:01:44,827
And we did. And then
we took it to the dentist,

47
00:01:44,862 --> 00:01:46,562
and he put it back
in her mouth.

48
00:01:46,598 --> 00:01:48,097
So I guess
we're both klutzes, huh?

49
00:01:48,132 --> 00:01:50,166
Why don't you spin
another tale, crap-tooth?

50
00:01:50,201 --> 00:01:51,701
No? My turn again?

51
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:54,370
Okay. Jill's barren.

52
00:02:00,044 --> 00:02:01,811
Good afternoon.
I'm Tom Tucker.

53
00:02:01,846 --> 00:02:05,047
Some sad news this morning
as 38 schoolchildren drowned

54
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,383
when their--
(yawning loudly)

55
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:10,353
excuse me-- when their
school bus hit a patch of ice

56
00:02:10,388 --> 00:02:13,623
and drove off a loc--
(yawning)

57
00:02:13,658 --> 00:02:15,524
(chuckles):
what is wrong with me today?--

58
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,093
and drove off a local bridge.

59
00:02:17,128 --> 00:02:18,961
And now the viral video
of the week,

60
00:02:18,997 --> 00:02:20,396
with over seven million views.

61
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,498
For those of you
who loved "Screaming Sheep,"

62
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:24,700
we've got "Opera Penguin."

63
00:02:24,736 --> 00:02:27,603
(off-key tenor voice):
♪ La, ah, ah, ah. ♪

64
00:02:29,307 --> 00:02:30,740
TUCKER:
<i>Is... is that it?</i>

65
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:33,209
<i>Is he gonna do it again? No?</i>

66
00:02:33,244 --> 00:02:36,212
<i>Okay, so just</i>

67
00:02:36,247 --> 00:02:38,047
<i>Okay, cut back to me.</i>

00:02:38,082 --> 00:02:40,316
<i>Uh, y-you can't?</i>
<i>The button broke off?</i>

72
00:02:46,858 --> 00:02:48,724
PENGUIN (loudly):
♪ La... ♪

73
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,793
TUCKER:
<i>Oh, he</i> does<i> do it again.</i>

74
00:02:50,828 --> 00:02:53,329
That could be my favorite
thing I ever seen.

75
00:02:53,364 --> 00:02:55,931
What<i> is</i> a penguin?
Is it some kind of bug?

76
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,401
What? You serious?
So it<i> is</i> a bug?

77
00:02:58,436 --> 00:03:00,403
Hey, you know, that's
what we ought to do.

78
00:03:00,438 --> 00:03:01,837
We ought to make
a viral video.

79
00:03:01,873 --> 00:03:03,305
All right! Awesome!
Let's do it!

80
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:05,708
Oh, wait, I don't know if
you're gonna be in it, Joe.

81
00:03:05,743 --> 00:03:06,976
I thought, while we filmed,

82
00:03:07,011 --> 00:03:09,345
we'd just keep all of
our stuff on your lap.

83
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,783
What the hell
are you doing?

84
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,819
I saw a scary boy doing this,
and I thought I'd try it.

85
00:03:16,854 --> 00:03:17,854
All right, have fun.

86
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:18,889
I'm late.
Late?

87
00:03:18,923 --> 00:03:20,956
But I thought you and I
could hang out

88
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,525
and maybe watch Lois
shush Peter

89
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,993
while they watch<i> Nashville.</i>

90
00:03:24,028 --> 00:03:26,429
Maybe another
time, Stewie.

91
00:03:26,464 --> 00:03:27,630
There he goes<i> again.</i>

92
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,065
He's being so standoffish.

93
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,533
I don't understand.

94
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,140
Oh, we used to be that happy.

95
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,809
Wait a minute--
Joe and Bonnie

96
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,577
never used
to spend time together

97
00:03:41,612 --> 00:03:43,045
until they had Susie.

98
00:03:43,081 --> 00:03:46,048
Having a baby seems
to have made them closer.

99
00:03:46,084 --> 00:03:48,851
Babies save relationships!

100
00:03:50,121 --> 00:03:52,321
Oh, look at you--
you're flyin'!

101
00:03:52,356 --> 00:03:53,823
Okay, thanks, Bonnie.

102
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,858
Next I want
to ride a bike.

103
00:03:55,893 --> 00:03:57,860
That's it, Rupert!
That's how Brian and I

104
00:03:57,895 --> 00:03:59,595
are going to improve
our relationship.

105
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,163
We're going to have a baby!

106
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,965
I say, this is my best idea

107
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,167
since I robbed
a Joseph A. Bank.

108
00:04:06,304 --> 00:04:08,704
Three suits for 99 bucks?!

109
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,107
Take me to jail!

110
00:04:14,278 --> 00:04:16,645
All right,
I want tonight to be perfect.

111
00:04:16,681 --> 00:04:18,647
I'm gonna lay it all out
for Brian

112
00:04:18,683 --> 00:04:20,483
why we should have
a baby together.

113
00:04:20,518 --> 00:04:22,852
I don't know, I haven't
even thought about that.

114
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,587
Why are you so obsessed
with circumcision?

115
00:04:24,622 --> 00:04:26,922
Oh, hey, look, you made
a little dinner party.

116
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,924
Hi, Rupert.
He won't be joining us.

117
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,192
Get up!

118
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,794
Please, sit.

119
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:33,362
You, uh... you okay?

120
00:04:33,397 --> 00:04:36,065
I'm terrific. And that is
so sweet of you to ask.

121
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,535
You really are a natural
caregiver, aren't you?

122
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,970
Mm. Mm.

123
00:04:41,005 --> 00:04:42,972
Do you mind not texting?

124
00:04:43,007 --> 00:04:45,007
Sorry, sorry.
Just finishing right now.

125
00:04:45,042 --> 00:04:46,108
Almost done.

126
00:04:46,144 --> 00:04:47,810
There, all finished

127
00:04:47,845 --> 00:04:50,212
riiiight...

128
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,081
now.

129
00:04:52,116 --> 00:04:53,482
Thhhhere.

130
00:04:53,518 --> 00:04:55,936
Thanks. So, I wanted
to talk to you about...

131
00:04:55,936 --> 00:04:58,121
A-Are you just gonna
leave it on the table?

132
00:04:58,145 --> 00:04:58,755
I-I won't look at it.

133
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:01,223
(phone buzzes) Great. So, I wanted to...
You're looking at it.

134
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,625
Sorry. Work.
It's not work.

135
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,627
It'll just take a second.
I-I normally wouldn't do this,

136
00:05:04,662 --> 00:05:06,829
but I was already kind of
in the middle of something,

137
00:05:06,864 --> 00:05:08,330
and I just need
to quickly respond,

138
00:05:08,366 --> 00:05:10,166
and there I am

139
00:05:10,201 --> 00:05:12,201
finiiished.

140
00:05:13,638 --> 00:05:15,137
(chuckles)
Ah, yeah.

141
00:05:15,173 --> 00:05:17,640
Okay, just
a few more worrrds...

142
00:05:17,675 --> 00:05:19,642
annnd...

143
00:05:19,677 --> 00:05:20,810
d-done.

144
00:05:20,845 --> 00:05:22,244
Sorry.
Okay, so...

145
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,446
(phone buzzes) Nah, nah, I'm
not gonna get it.

146
00:05:24,482 --> 00:05:26,615
Then maybe we can
take it off the table.

147
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:27,850
No, no, just keep going.

148
00:05:27,885 --> 00:05:28,951
(sighs)

149
00:05:28,986 --> 00:05:30,753
I was thinking,
we should talk

150
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,621
(phone buzzes)
about having a...

151
00:05:32,657 --> 00:05:35,457
This isn't fun for me,
watching you text.

152
00:05:35,493 --> 00:05:37,726
No, no, this is great.
Mm, mm, mm. Yum.

153
00:05:37,762 --> 00:05:40,496
But I-I got to go.
I have a date.

154
00:05:40,531 --> 00:05:42,431
This is serious, Rupert.
I'm losing him.

155
00:05:42,466 --> 00:05:44,333
If we're going to fix
this relationship,

156
00:05:44,368 --> 00:05:47,369
we need a baby
and we need it now.

157
00:05:50,675 --> 00:05:53,108
I'm just going to take
a little bit of his DNA,

158
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:57,279
and soon we'll be proud parents,
like Ron Livingston's parents.

159
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,914
You know,
our son's a famous actor.

160
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,182
Really?
What's his name?

161
00:06:00,218 --> 00:06:02,151
(sighs):
Oh, um...

162
00:06:02,186 --> 00:06:03,485
he's, uh...

163
00:06:03,521 --> 00:06:06,021
he was, like, the main guy
in<i> Office Space.</i>

164
00:06:06,057 --> 00:06:07,623
Yeah. What else?

165
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,458
Uh... he has dark hair...

166
00:06:09,493 --> 00:06:11,760
I don't know,
was he in<i> Black Hawk Down?</i>

167
00:06:11,796 --> 00:06:14,763
Uh, he was in, like, at least
five<i> Sex "in" the Citys.</i>

168
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:17,399
(groans) What is his name?
What<i> is</i> his name?

169
00:06:17,435 --> 00:06:19,635
Is your son
Ron Livingston?

170
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,637
Yes!
Oh, God! Thank God!

171
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,839
Ron Livingston!
Thank you!

172
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,208
That has been bugging me
all day.

173
00:06:29,547 --> 00:06:31,914
Okay, let's see.
Now, what are the ingredients

174
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:34,516
to a viral Internet video?

175
00:06:34,552 --> 00:06:36,819
Cats.
Yes, cats. Good.

176
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,321
Uh, uh, people reacting
to watching gross stuff.

177
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,724
Oh, yeah, 'cause they're like,
"Rah! That's gross!

178
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,026
Can I get a soda?
What? No.

179
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:46,629
Th-This is, like, the worst time
to ask for a soda.

180
00:06:46,664 --> 00:06:47,528
Unbelievable.

181
00:06:47,552 --> 00:06:49,532
You know what, we should
just go out and start filming.

182
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:51,667
'Cause I think we're
really gonna surprise everyone.

183
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:54,536
Like Buster Keaton did
in his first talking picture.

184
00:06:54,572 --> 00:06:56,138
♪
♪
Here we go.

185
00:06:56,173 --> 00:06:59,608
I'm moving through the scene
and I slam the door.

186
00:06:59,644 --> 00:07:02,011
Oh, no!
I slammed it too hard,

187
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:05,514
and the house
is gonna squash me!

188
00:07:05,549 --> 00:07:07,983
Oh, it turned out
that window was there.

189
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:10,586
Pause for laugh and amazement.

190
00:07:15,092 --> 00:07:16,792
All right, Rupert,

191
00:07:16,827 --> 00:07:18,794
the fertilization device
is complete.

192
00:07:18,829 --> 00:07:20,930
This will impregnate me
with the child

193
00:07:20,965 --> 00:07:24,066
that will bring Brian and me
back together!

194
00:07:24,101 --> 00:07:26,268
First, I add
Brian's hair and saliva,

195
00:07:26,304 --> 00:07:27,970
and some preschool applications,

196
00:07:28,005 --> 00:07:30,406
because we are
already way behind.

197
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:32,875
There. Now I just have
to get into the machine,

198
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,945
and then the machine does
whatever it has to do to me

199
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,746
in order to successfully
impregnate me.

200
00:07:37,782 --> 00:07:41,283
We do not judge the machine.
We do not judge Stewie.

201
00:07:43,321 --> 00:07:45,654
(groans)
Good-bye, body.

202
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,957
You're gonna watch me
get pregnant.

203
00:07:47,992 --> 00:07:50,993
I want to look at you
when it happens.

204
00:07:51,996 --> 00:07:54,096
Yeah, you watch me,
bitch.

205
00:07:54,131 --> 00:07:56,932
(rumbling)

206
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:03,706
(clanking)

207
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:05,908
(whirring)

208
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,943
(burbling)

209
00:08:08,846 --> 00:08:11,547
(whooshing)

210
00:08:11,582 --> 00:08:13,248
(burbling)

211
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,917
(electrical buzzing)

212
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:19,254
(rumbling, clanking, buzzing)

213
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,422
(zapping)

214
00:08:24,662 --> 00:08:26,128
Good morning, Brian.

215
00:08:26,163 --> 00:08:27,763
(sniffing)
What is that?

216
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,699
I smell pee.
Yes, you do, Brian.

217
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:35,471
Oh, my God, that
thing's positive!

218
00:08:35,506 --> 00:08:38,107
Is Lois pregnant again?
No...

219
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,775
<i>Meg</i> is pregnant?

220
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,410
You're getting warmer.

221
00:08:41,445 --> 00:08:43,612
(clearing throat)

222
00:08:43,647 --> 00:08:46,148
Wha... What have you done?

223
00:08:46,183 --> 00:08:48,283
I think you mean,
what have<i> we</i> done?

224
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,518
What?!

225
00:08:49,553 --> 00:08:51,620
Brian... we're pregnant!

226
00:08:51,655 --> 00:08:53,922
Oh, my God!
(crying): And in 18 years,

227
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,991
he's going
to move away!

228
00:09:00,554 --> 00:09:02,454
You're pregnant
with<i> our</i> baby?!

229
00:09:02,489 --> 00:09:04,056
How could this
even happen?!

230
00:09:04,091 --> 00:09:06,725
Simple. I took your DNA
and inserted it

231
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,861
into my temporary uterus
through my fertilization device.

232
00:09:09,897 --> 00:09:11,163
Oh, my God,
you're serious!

233
00:09:11,198 --> 00:09:13,865
People are gonna think I
had sex with a male baby

234
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:15,200
and then got him pregnant!

235
00:09:15,235 --> 00:09:17,669
Oh, thank you for finding a way
to make it sound horrible.

236
00:09:17,705 --> 00:09:19,104
We can't have
a baby, Stewie!

237
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:21,573
Is this about money?
Because I have a bit saved.

238
00:09:21,608 --> 00:09:23,275
We could even use
my old crib.

239
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,976
<i>You</i> use your old crib!
Oh, right.

240
00:09:25,012 --> 00:09:26,812
Stewie, you have
to get rid of it.

241
00:09:26,847 --> 00:09:29,481
"Get rid of it"? You know,
why don't you just say it?

242
00:09:29,516 --> 00:09:30,782
Say the word, Brian.

243
00:09:30,818 --> 00:09:33,351
I want to hear you say it.
Abortion! Abortion!

244
00:09:33,387 --> 00:09:36,054
You need to get a big fat
abortion right this second!

245
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,522
You can't even say it.

246
00:09:37,558 --> 00:09:38,990
I think I'm
gonna throw up.

247
00:09:39,026 --> 00:09:40,358
Oh, save the cheap theatrics.

248
00:09:40,394 --> 00:09:42,327
This isn't one of your
crappy short stories.

249
00:09:42,362 --> 00:09:44,529
This is real life,
mister, so man up!

250
00:09:44,565 --> 00:09:46,431
You are getting an
abortion, Stewie.

251
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:49,000
I will not! Our child
is growing inside me!

252
00:09:49,036 --> 00:09:50,569
Stop talking like that!

253
00:09:50,604 --> 00:09:52,704
A-And how do you
even know it's mine?

254
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,372
How dare you!

255
00:09:54,408 --> 00:09:55,941
So I'm just some slut?!

256
00:09:55,976 --> 00:09:57,943
Well, this slut
is having your baby!

257
00:09:57,978 --> 00:09:59,511
Why would you
even do this?

258
00:09:59,546 --> 00:10:00,746
I thought
you'd be happy.

259
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:02,714
I mean, you have
all these amazing qualities,

260
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,349
and I'm kind of
good-looking.

261
00:10:04,384 --> 00:10:06,017
I mean,
I'm no model, but...

262
00:10:06,053 --> 00:10:07,719
Well, certainly
not a runway model.

263
00:10:07,755 --> 00:10:09,721
I'd-I'd be more
catalogue, probably.

264
00:10:09,757 --> 00:10:11,823
You know what?
Why<i> not</i> a runway model?

265
00:10:11,859 --> 00:10:13,658
Why not? Why am I
always apologizing

266
00:10:13,694 --> 00:10:15,827
for how good-looking I am?
I'm sick of it.

267
00:10:15,863 --> 00:10:18,563
I can model in Paris.
We could take the baby with us.

268
00:10:18,599 --> 00:10:20,999
We could be that kind of family.
What do you think?

269
00:10:21,034 --> 00:10:22,834
(thump)
(grunts) Is it dead?

270
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,202
You hit me!

271
00:10:24,238 --> 00:10:27,172
What kind of monster
hits a pregnant toddler!

272
00:10:27,207 --> 00:10:31,243
If you ever lay a finger on me again,
I'll burn you in your bed.

273
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:33,879
Could... could you
do that now, please?

274
00:10:37,785 --> 00:10:39,618
All right, Peter,
get the camera ready.

275
00:10:39,653 --> 00:10:41,153
I got a viral
Internet video

276
00:10:41,188 --> 00:10:44,389
that's gonna go straight
to the top of the charts.

277
00:10:44,424 --> 00:10:45,857
Hi, I'm Joe Swanson,

278
00:10:45,893 --> 00:10:48,727
and this is 30 impressions
in 30 seconds.

279
00:10:48,762 --> 00:10:50,328
(with same voice):
"Show me the money."

280
00:10:50,364 --> 00:10:51,364
"Oh, behave."

281
00:10:51,365 --> 00:10:53,198
"Good morning, Vietnam."

282
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:55,934
"Wait until they get a load
of me," said the Joker.

283
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:58,670
Some of these I'm paraphrasing.

284
00:11:02,376 --> 00:11:04,409
Hey, I need you to
take me to the doctor

285
00:11:04,444 --> 00:11:06,178
for my prenatal
vitamins.

286
00:11:06,213 --> 00:11:07,445
I'm not taking you anywhere.

287
00:11:07,481 --> 00:11:09,047
Geez, how far along are you?

288
00:11:09,082 --> 00:11:11,483
I'm not really sure.
Two days, six months...

289
00:11:11,518 --> 00:11:13,552
there's a certain amount of
guesswork involved in this.

290
00:11:13,587 --> 00:11:15,620
Oh, and while I'm pregnant,
I'm going to need you

291
00:11:15,656 --> 00:11:17,622
to change the cat litter.
We don't have a cat.

292
00:11:17,658 --> 00:11:19,958
Ugh. Please don't
fight me on this.

293
00:11:19,993 --> 00:11:22,027
Oh, my back is killing me.

294
00:11:22,062 --> 00:11:24,296
And I've also been
experiencing a little...

295
00:11:24,331 --> 00:11:26,298
morning sickness.

296
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:29,434
It's for the baby,
it's for the baby.

297
00:11:32,906 --> 00:11:34,739
You look ridiculous
like that.

298
00:11:34,775 --> 00:11:37,008
Not too ridiculous for you
to put a baby in me.

299
00:11:37,044 --> 00:11:39,344
Okay, Raylene,
I'm Dr. Hartman.

300
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:41,012
Now, before we begin,
I want you to know

301
00:11:41,048 --> 00:11:42,681
the record is just
past my watch.

302
00:11:42,716 --> 00:11:45,350
(high-pitched): Well, it takes two people
to break a record.

303
00:11:45,385 --> 00:11:47,352
You look a little young.
How old are you?

304
00:11:47,387 --> 00:11:50,088
Uh, 13? 14?

305
00:11:50,123 --> 00:11:53,258
15. B-But he didn't force
himself on me.

306
00:11:53,293 --> 00:11:54,793
I wanted it, too.

307
00:11:54,828 --> 00:11:56,728
Well, that's
the important thing.

308
00:11:56,763 --> 00:11:58,063
That's odd.

309
00:11:58,098 --> 00:12:00,866
Your vagina seems to have
a penis and two testicles.

310
00:12:00,901 --> 00:12:02,534
Oh, right. I, uh...

311
00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:04,936
sneezed real hard
and all that came out.

312
00:12:04,972 --> 00:12:06,271
Ah, that explains it.

313
00:12:06,306 --> 00:12:08,139
Could you do that thing
where you take some fluid

314
00:12:08,175 --> 00:12:10,942
and tell me if it's going
to be an imbecile or a cretin?

315
00:12:10,978 --> 00:12:12,410
Oh, not to worry,
there are places

316
00:12:12,446 --> 00:12:14,012
where those people
can be warehoused.

317
00:12:14,047 --> 00:12:15,680
But from strictly
eyeballing you,

318
00:12:15,716 --> 00:12:16,948
I'd say everything
looks fine.

319
00:12:16,984 --> 00:12:18,683
Oh, that's wonderful.

320
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:21,353
Now, Brian, did you have
any questions for the doctor?

321
00:12:21,388 --> 00:12:24,222
Yeah. Are there a lot of
stairs in this building?

322
00:12:26,593 --> 00:12:28,727
God, we need<i> so</i> much stuff.

323
00:12:28,762 --> 00:12:31,396
Look at how tiny all these
clothes are. It's so adorable.

324
00:12:31,431 --> 00:12:33,665
I mean, what kind of feet
can fit into these shoes?

325
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,700
Your feet!

326
00:12:34,701 --> 00:12:36,001
That's getting old, you know.

327
00:12:36,036 --> 00:12:38,003
You better get on
board with this.

328
00:12:38,038 --> 00:12:40,071
Aw, how far along are you?

329
00:12:40,107 --> 00:12:42,340
Eight months.
You look amazing.

330
00:12:42,376 --> 00:12:45,076
Let me ask you, are you leaking?
Because I've been leaking.

331
00:12:45,112 --> 00:12:46,411
How old are you?

332
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:48,613
How old are<i> you?</i>
You look like you're 40,

333
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:51,216
which means whatever you've got
in there is 100% brain-damaged.

334
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:52,884
All right,
you have a good day.

335
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,853
I hated that lady.

336
00:12:59,326 --> 00:13:01,960
I like these.
These are good. Very classy.

337
00:13:01,995 --> 00:13:03,628
This feels
incredibly wrong.

338
00:13:03,664 --> 00:13:06,164
Oh, we're going to want these,
Brian, believe me.

339
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:07,966
You can't see
my nipples, can you?

340
00:13:08,001 --> 00:13:09,301
They're getting really large,

341
00:13:09,336 --> 00:13:11,303
and I'm not sure
if I'm completely covering them.

342
00:13:11,338 --> 00:13:13,738
Eh, you know what?
We'll see what we see.

343
00:13:13,774 --> 00:13:14,906
Let's get a few candids.

344
00:13:14,942 --> 00:13:17,642
Dad, can I get one of your head
on the belly?

345
00:13:17,678 --> 00:13:21,446
Oh, "Dad."
I just got emotional.

of a monkey forcin' that sex act
on a frog at the zoo.

357
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:55,213
So maybe we can find another
frog for somethin' like that.

I'm concerned that frog's in
more trouble than she realizes.

369
00:14:26,046 --> 00:14:28,179
I'm having such a craving
for burgers.

370
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:30,181
It's like my body is
just craving red meat.

371
00:14:30,217 --> 00:14:32,851
And mint chip ice cream.
But only mint chip.

372
00:14:32,886 --> 00:14:34,686
Any other ice cream
makes me want to puke.

373
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:36,621
Isn't that weird?
Yes, Stewie,

374
00:14:36,656 --> 00:14:38,757
that's the one weird thing
in all this.

375
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:41,092
What are you looking at?
Go push your buttons.

376
00:14:41,128 --> 00:14:42,427
My husband'll kick your ass.

377
00:14:42,462 --> 00:14:44,362
Stop saying
I'm your husband.

378
00:14:44,398 --> 00:14:47,298
(moans) Brian, I need you to
take me to the hospital.

379
00:14:47,334 --> 00:14:48,633
Why?

380
00:14:48,668 --> 00:14:50,635
My water just broke.
Oh, my God!

381
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,771
It's okay. Don't panic.
Call the doula.

382
00:14:52,806 --> 00:14:54,372
Brian, you've got
to call the doula!

383
00:14:54,408 --> 00:14:56,374
Doula? I-I don't
even know what that is!

384
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,443
It's a divorced woman who
knows about lady parts

385
00:14:58,478 --> 00:15:00,645
and cheers you on.
Let's go!

386
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,313
(tires screeching)

387
00:15:02,349 --> 00:15:05,083
(horns honking)

388
00:15:05,118 --> 00:15:07,485
(moaning) You're gonna have
to drive a little faster!

389
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:09,154
I'm already going
over the speed limit.

390
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:11,356
Too late! Pull over!
It's starting to come out!

391
00:15:11,391 --> 00:15:14,025
Of where?
I'm not sure exactly.

392
00:15:14,061 --> 00:15:15,527
(tires screech)

393
00:15:15,562 --> 00:15:18,129
Brian, I'm going to need you
to deliver the baby.

394
00:15:18,165 --> 00:15:20,999
Uh, uh, o-okay, c-can you wait a
second while I put a towel down?

395
00:15:21,034 --> 00:15:22,803
I don't want anything
to get on the seats.

396
00:15:22,803 --> 00:15:23,436
Oh, no, of course.

397
00:15:23,437 --> 00:15:25,737
Our first priority should be
to keep the vinyl clean.

398
00:15:25,772 --> 00:15:28,239
Oh, God. Oh, God,
it's coming! Oh...

399
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:29,574
Can you see the head?

400
00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:30,742
I don't know
where to look!

401
00:15:30,777 --> 00:15:32,443
Well, maybe you should look
at the part of me

402
00:15:32,476 --> 00:15:33,675
where there's
a baby coming out!

403
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,343
(moaning)

404
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:38,013
How did Murphy Brown
make this look so easy?!

405
00:15:38,048 --> 00:15:39,488
Careful, don't get
anything on the...

406
00:15:39,816 --> 00:15:41,115
...seats.

407
00:15:41,172 --> 00:15:43,186
STEWIE: Oh, God,
I think another one's coming!

408
00:15:43,187 --> 00:15:43,915
BRIAN: I don't see it!

409
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:45,655
STEWIE: I think
it's coming out of my mouth!

410
00:15:45,656 --> 00:15:47,889
(moaning)
There's more!

411
00:15:47,925 --> 00:15:49,491
And they're coming out
of everywhere!

412
00:15:49,526 --> 00:15:52,093
Ah! Kill me!
This hurts too much!

413
00:15:52,129 --> 00:15:54,095
BRIAN: Holy (bleep)!
What is happening?!

414
00:15:54,131 --> 00:15:56,164
STEWIE: I don't know!
Brian, save the placenta.

415
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,699
BRIAN:
Do you even have a placenta?

416
00:15:57,734 --> 00:15:59,835
STEWIE: Well, whatever comes
out, save it. I want to eat it.

417
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,570
BRIAN: Oh, God,
they're crawling all over me!

418
00:16:01,605 --> 00:16:02,737
STEWIE:
How many are there now?

419
00:16:02,773 --> 00:16:05,073
BRIAN:
Four, five, six, seven.

420
00:16:05,108 --> 00:16:07,242
Mazel tov!

421
00:16:11,811 --> 00:16:14,745
(barking, squeaking, cooing)

422
00:16:22,922 --> 00:16:25,422
I just put Jack and
Rose down for their nap.

423
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,925
And I'm trying to keep the more
attractive ones in this area.

424
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,193
This is a nightmare.

425
00:16:29,228 --> 00:16:31,261
Oh, I caught two of them
trying to eat each other,

426
00:16:31,297 --> 00:16:33,597
so that's something we
need to watch out for.

427
00:16:33,632 --> 00:16:36,233
Look, Bri, that one
looks just like you.

428
00:16:37,636 --> 00:16:40,070
Huh. Well, you know what?
I guess he does.

429
00:16:40,106 --> 00:16:41,939
You know, I was
actually thinking,

430
00:16:41,974 --> 00:16:44,808
this could be a chance for you
to finally make things right.

431
00:16:44,844 --> 00:16:46,310
What? What do you mean?

432
00:16:46,345 --> 00:16:48,645
Well, you do have a son
that you were never there for.

433
00:16:48,681 --> 00:16:51,148
This is your opportunity
to do things differently.

434
00:16:51,183 --> 00:16:53,417
Wow. Maybe you're right.

435
00:16:53,452 --> 00:16:57,254
I suppose I could give it a try.

436
00:16:57,289 --> 00:16:58,289
There you go.

437
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,057
Aw, Dick really
likes you.

438
00:17:00,092 --> 00:17:01,092
I like Dick.

439
00:17:01,093 --> 00:17:02,393
(chuckles)
You like Dick!

440
00:17:02,428 --> 00:17:05,696
His name's not Dick,
you idiot. It's Finn.

441
00:17:09,335 --> 00:17:10,975
All right, let's check
our YouTube channel

442
00:17:11,003 --> 00:17:12,569
and see how we're doing.

443
00:17:12,605 --> 00:17:15,239
Boy, they just went right
after Cleveland, didn't they?

444
00:17:15,274 --> 00:17:17,908
Geez, that word looks even
harsher when it's in all caps.

445
00:17:17,943 --> 00:17:20,911
Wow, people really seem to hate
everything we put on here.

446
00:17:20,946 --> 00:17:23,247
That sucks.
And I worked really hard

447
00:17:23,282 --> 00:17:25,649
on taking a picture of myself
every day for a year

448
00:17:25,684 --> 00:17:27,985
and then setting the photos
to an emotional song.

449
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,620

to get him little sunglasses.

doesn't react to
anything I say.

464
00:18:13,032 --> 00:18:15,265
Hey! Hey, you!

465
00:18:15,301 --> 00:18:16,934
Okay, this one is deaf.

466
00:18:16,969 --> 00:18:19,403
We are going to be spending
a fortune on schools.

467
00:18:19,438 --> 00:18:21,605
How are we gonna pay for that?
Well, you tell me.

468
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,941
You're the one who insisted
I be a stay-at-home mom.

469
00:18:23,976 --> 00:18:25,142
I don't even have a job.

470
00:18:25,177 --> 00:18:26,410
Well, you better
get one.

471
00:18:26,445 --> 00:18:28,745
And not "writing."
A real job.

472
00:18:28,781 --> 00:18:30,481
Why are you being
such a jerk?

473
00:18:30,516 --> 00:18:32,349
I don't know.
I'm sorry. I just...

474
00:18:32,384 --> 00:18:34,818
I just feel like
once I get them on a schedule,

475
00:18:34,854 --> 00:18:36,854
everything will be fine.

476
00:18:42,361 --> 00:18:45,128
I can't believe we couldn't
come up with a viral video.

477
00:18:45,164 --> 00:18:47,731
We should've just gotten Jimmy
Fallon to do any lame thing.

478
00:18:47,766 --> 00:18:49,433
(news theme plays)

479
00:18:49,468 --> 00:18:52,436
Coming up, a white waiter
at a Chinese restaurant?

480
00:18:52,471 --> 00:18:54,471
We'll get you the facts
on this bizarre story.

481
00:18:54,507 --> 00:18:56,406
But first,
this week's viral video,

482
00:18:56,442 --> 00:18:59,109
"Fat Kid Hustles
Through Crosswalk."

483
00:18:59,144 --> 00:19:02,479
<i>Here it is. Here's little</i>
<i>Chubbo pulling up the rear.</i>

484
00:19:03,682 --> 00:19:05,883
<i>Oh, he's got to get moving now.</i>

485
00:19:11,724 --> 00:19:14,892
<i>That's right. Don't let your</i>
<i>chocolate levels get too low.</i>

486
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,533
I can't believe
Chris gets four million hits

487
00:19:22,568 --> 00:19:23,867
just crossing the street.

488
00:19:23,903 --> 00:19:25,869
I guess we were
trying too hard.

489
00:19:25,905 --> 00:19:28,205
Hey, I went by your house
the other day.

490
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,740
Is your baby pregnant?

491
00:19:29,775 --> 00:19:32,442
I don't know. Lois is
in charge of the kids.

492
00:19:35,981 --> 00:19:37,981
(thumping)

493
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:41,818
Stewie, this is awful.

494
00:19:41,854 --> 00:19:43,687
I don't know why anyone
would want to be a parent,

495
00:19:43,722 --> 00:19:45,355
especially
to four children.

496
00:19:45,391 --> 00:19:47,357
Four? I thought
we were down to five.

497
00:19:47,393 --> 00:19:49,526
Yeah, the deaf one
didn't hear Joe's lawnmower.

498
00:19:49,562 --> 00:19:51,261
Oh. That's really upsetting.

499
00:19:51,297 --> 00:19:52,729
I-I can't take this
anymore, Stewie.

500
00:19:52,765 --> 00:19:54,264
I-I'm sorry. I got
to get out of here.

501
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,599
What? Where are you going?

502
00:19:55,634 --> 00:19:56,934
Stop doing that!

503
00:19:56,969 --> 00:19:58,268
I need a break,
all right?

504
00:19:58,304 --> 00:20:00,304
I-I j... I just got
to get away for a couple weeks.

505
00:20:00,306 --> 00:20:01,538
A couple weeks?

506
00:20:01,574 --> 00:20:03,540
Y-You're not leaving me
alone with these things.

507
00:20:03,576 --> 00:20:06,209
The whole point of this was for
us to spend more time together.

508
00:20:06,245 --> 00:20:08,579
Wait, what are you talking
about? The whole point of what?

509
00:20:08,614 --> 00:20:10,581
Well, you've been so distant
lately.

510
00:20:10,616 --> 00:20:13,584
I thought if we had a baby it
would bring us closer together.

511
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:15,252
What? I was only distant

512
00:20:15,287 --> 00:20:16,987
because you've been so moody
lately.

513
00:20:17,022 --> 00:20:18,522
I thought you needed more space.

514
00:20:18,557 --> 00:20:20,157
I always want
to hang out with you.

515
00:20:20,192 --> 00:20:22,192
Well, I was only moody
because you were so distant!

516
00:20:22,194 --> 00:20:24,161
I always want
to hang out with you, too!

517
00:20:24,196 --> 00:20:25,929
Oh, my God.

518
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,800
So we didn't have
to do any of this.

519
00:20:29,835 --> 00:20:32,302
I-I guess not.

520
00:20:32,338 --> 00:20:33,904
How attached to them are you?

521
00:20:33,939 --> 00:20:35,806
Not at all.
Yeah, me either.

522
00:20:38,744 --> 00:20:40,177
This is for the best.

523
00:20:40,212 --> 00:20:41,912
Yeah, I mean, I'm sure
they'll be adopted.

524
00:20:41,947 --> 00:20:43,580
Oh, God, yeah.

525
00:20:43,616 --> 00:20:46,049
I'm still keeping all the gifts
from the baby shower.

526
00:20:46,085 --> 00:20:47,985
You had a baby shower?

527
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,204
Oh!
(chuckles)

528
00:20:50,205 --> 00:20:52,307
Now this makes it real!
(chuckles)

529
00:20:52,308 --> 00:20:54,468
Oh, my goodness. That's enough
cake for you, Mary Beth.
