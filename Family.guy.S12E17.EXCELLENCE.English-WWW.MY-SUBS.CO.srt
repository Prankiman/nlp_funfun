MAN: <i>You shower</i>
<i>with your dog every day.</i>

13
00:00:37,683 --> 00:00:39,851
<i>Do you and your dog use</i>
<i>the same soap?</i>

14
00:00:39,886 --> 00:00:42,788
<i>If so, one of you</i>
<i>is damaging your hair.</i>

15
00:00:42,822 --> 00:00:44,856
Really?
(concerned grunt)

16
00:00:44,891 --> 00:00:47,526
<i>Dial Cross Species</i>
<i>is specially formulated</i>

17
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,528
<i>for both humans and dogs.</i>

18
00:00:49,562 --> 00:00:51,329
<i>You'll like</i>
<i>that it gets you clean.</i>

19
00:00:51,364 --> 00:00:52,898
<i>He'll like</i>
<i>that it smells like beef.</i>

20
00:00:52,932 --> 00:00:54,633
That sounds great!
(knocking)

21
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:57,335
WOMAN: Jim, are you showering
with the dog again?

22
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:58,703
What the hell?!

23
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:00,038
All right, Peter,
I'm leaving.

24
00:01:00,073 --> 00:01:01,873
Bonnie invited me to
the shooting range.

25
00:01:01,908 --> 00:01:03,375
What?

26
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:05,444
Yeah, Bonnie says
she goes every week.

27
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:07,979
(yelling)

28
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,017
(panting)

29
00:01:12,051 --> 00:01:14,920
I think next time
you should bring someone else.

30
00:01:14,954 --> 00:01:17,322
Now, you'll be watching Stewie,
and I don't want you just

31
00:01:17,356 --> 00:01:19,091
to prop him up next
to the TV all day.

32
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:20,625
Take him to
the park.

33
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,860
I want him to get
some fresh air.

34
00:01:21,894 --> 00:01:23,895
Fresh air is bad
for a kid, Lois.

35
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,397
Look at Michael J. Fox.

36
00:01:25,431 --> 00:01:26,765
What?
I don't know.

37
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,533
Peter, you are taking
Stewie to the park.

38
00:01:28,568 --> 00:01:30,669
It'll do you good to spend
some time with your son.

39
00:01:30,703 --> 00:01:32,604
I spend lots of time
with him, Lois.

40
00:01:32,638 --> 00:01:34,773
Just last week,
I took him to the doctor.

41
00:01:34,807 --> 00:01:37,509
Mr. Griffin, you're here
to get your prostate examined?

42
00:01:37,543 --> 00:01:39,411
Yeah, this is me.

43
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:45,917
Is that your
little one there?

44
00:01:45,952 --> 00:01:48,787
Oh, no, it's-it's just
the way I'm sitting.

45
00:01:48,821 --> 00:01:50,789
Ah, nothing like a day
at the park,

46
00:01:50,823 --> 00:01:53,792
surrounded by overcompensating
divorced dads.

47
00:01:53,826 --> 00:01:55,660
Wow! Look how high
you're going!

48
00:01:55,695 --> 00:01:57,429
What an amazing day this is!

49
00:01:57,463 --> 00:01:58,830
(laughs)

50
00:01:58,865 --> 00:02:01,366
Is Mommy spending
$2,500 a month on you?

51
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,702
Because that's what
I'm sending Mommy!

52
00:02:03,736 --> 00:02:05,604
Oh, my God,
it's only been five minutes,

53
00:02:05,638 --> 00:02:08,473
and I'm already bored
out of my mind.

54
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,944
Damn, I wish I could go
to the Clam.

55
00:02:15,481 --> 00:02:18,917
Aah! Well, I guess
I see those guys all the time.

56
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:25,023
A clown?!
Eh, well, I guess

57
00:02:25,057 --> 00:02:27,025
what's the big deal, huh?
It's just one.

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,435
Oh, I was quite sure it was just
one from the size of the car!

59
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,770
(phone ringing)
Hello?

60
00:02:38,804 --> 00:02:40,038
QUAGMIRE:
Peter, where the hell are you?

61
00:02:40,072 --> 00:02:41,606
You got to get down
to the Clam, man.

62
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:42,941
There's, like,
60 clowns in here.

63
00:02:42,975 --> 00:02:44,943
Ugh, I can't.
I got to watch Stewie.

64
00:02:44,977 --> 00:02:48,146
JOE: Peter, they threw what I thought
was a bucket of water on me,

65
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:50,916
but it turns out,
it was just a bunch of confetti!

66
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,984
Oh, man, I got
to get over there!

67
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:54,553
(phone beeps off)

68
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,560
Okay, okay. It's okay
as long as I can still see him.

69
00:03:01,594 --> 00:03:03,495
Okay, Stewie, there you are.

70
00:03:03,529 --> 00:03:04,663
There you are, safe and sound.

71
00:03:04,697 --> 00:03:06,865
Daddy can still see you.

72
00:03:08,467 --> 00:03:10,435
Okay, Daddy
can still see you.

73
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:12,804
Daddy can still see you.

74
00:03:19,178 --> 00:03:21,680
Daddy can still see you.

75
00:03:32,258 --> 00:03:36,161
That was a wink, but you don't
know it 'cause it's just a eye.

76
00:03:39,765 --> 00:03:42,234
MAN (over TV):
We now return to <i>Superman.</i>

77
00:03:42,268 --> 00:03:44,002
(all crying)

78
00:03:44,036 --> 00:03:45,704
Lois, what's wrong?

79
00:03:45,738 --> 00:03:47,806
Clark, we all have
breast cancer!

80
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,609
The doctor says it's as if
our breasts have been X-rayed

81
00:03:50,643 --> 00:03:53,712
five hours a day, every day,
for the last three years!

82
00:03:53,746 --> 00:03:55,647
Oh, my God,
that's terrible.

83
00:03:55,681 --> 00:03:58,550
First, every woman I've ever
known, and now you guys.

84
00:03:58,584 --> 00:04:00,552
(sighs):
Ah!

85
00:04:00,586 --> 00:04:02,821
Boy, it was smart
to wait out that thunderstorm.

86
00:04:02,855 --> 00:04:05,056
(phone ringing)
Aah, it's Lois!

87
00:04:05,091 --> 00:04:06,825
Oh, my God! Stewie!

88
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:08,260
Oh, uh, hey, Lois.

89
00:04:08,294 --> 00:04:09,761
H-Hey, it's hard to hear you

90
00:04:09,795 --> 00:04:11,963
over the sound
of joyful children in the park.

91
00:04:11,998 --> 00:04:14,299
LOIS: Are you and Stewie
having a good time?

92
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,634
Uh, uh, yeah.

93
00:04:15,668 --> 00:04:17,369
Okay, well, let me talk to him.

94
00:04:17,403 --> 00:04:19,371
I want to tell him
Mommy's on her way home.

95
00:04:19,405 --> 00:04:21,306
She wants to talk to Stewie.
What do I do?!

96
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,575
Here, give me the phone.
I do a great Stewie.

97
00:04:23,609 --> 00:04:25,844
Hey, Lois,
it's me, the baby.

98
00:04:25,878 --> 00:04:28,513
Hi, Stewie. I'm on my way home.

99
00:04:28,547 --> 00:04:29,848
Mommy misses you.

100
00:04:29,882 --> 00:04:31,383
All right, cool.

101
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:33,585
Bring some beef
jerky maybe.

102
00:04:33,619 --> 00:04:36,721
I just bought
you ten minutes.

103
00:04:36,756 --> 00:04:38,790
Stewie?

104
00:04:44,096 --> 00:04:46,131
Oh, there's my boy.

105
00:04:48,801 --> 00:04:50,568
Hey, what happened
to my new friend,

106
00:04:50,603 --> 00:04:52,971
that kid who sort of
looks like me from behind?

107
00:04:53,005 --> 00:04:54,773
Wait. Where's the fat man?

108
00:04:54,807 --> 00:04:57,042
(siren wailing in distance)

109
00:04:57,076 --> 00:04:58,643
Well, I guess this is it.

110
00:04:58,678 --> 00:05:00,312
I'm gonna die here.

111
00:05:00,346 --> 00:05:01,880
I'll never get to grow old

112
00:05:01,914 --> 00:05:04,082
and become an across-the-country
grandparent.

113
00:05:04,116 --> 00:05:05,617
What is this?

114
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:06,985
WOMAN:
It's a Skype.

115
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:08,987
A Snyke?
No, a Skype.

116
00:05:09,021 --> 00:05:10,322
Snype?

117
00:05:10,356 --> 00:05:13,258
No, it's a Skype...
from your grandson.

118
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:14,826
Stephen?

119
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,595
Yes! He's right there
trying to say hi to you.

120
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,130
What movie is this?

121
00:05:19,165 --> 00:05:20,865
It's not a movie.

122
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,567
It's your grandson!

123
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:24,636
My grandson is in the pictures?

124
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,604
You did this yesterday!

125
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,139
Don't holler at me!

126
00:05:28,174 --> 00:05:29,607
I don't understand anything!

127
00:05:29,642 --> 00:05:31,343
I'm very frightened!

128
00:05:31,377 --> 00:05:33,812
(tires screech)

129
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,914
Wait a minute.

130
00:05:35,948 --> 00:05:39,084
Stewie, what happened
to your head?

131
00:05:39,118 --> 00:05:40,585
Oh, you're not Stewie.

132
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:42,754
I got to get you back
to the park and find...

133
00:05:45,658 --> 00:05:47,125
(gasps)

134
00:05:50,996 --> 00:05:53,098
All right, kid,
your name is Stewie, all right?

135
00:05:53,132 --> 00:05:54,666
I'm your new dad.

136
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,935
My name is Peter,
and I work at the brewer...

137
00:05:56,969 --> 00:05:59,637
NASA. I work at NASA.

138
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:03,934
Uh, hey, Lois.
You look fat.

139
00:06:03,935 --> 00:06:05,777
You should go for a run.
Peter!

140
00:06:05,778 --> 00:06:08,079
I'm gonna go give my
baby a kiss good night.

141
00:06:08,114 --> 00:06:11,249
Uh, Lois, I had an affair, and
I think we should talk about it!

142
00:06:11,283 --> 00:06:14,419
Peter, jamming yourself into
a grapefruit is not an affair.

143
00:06:18,924 --> 00:06:21,659
See? There's a human baby
in there.

144
00:06:21,694 --> 00:06:23,795
Asleep in Stewie's overalls.

145
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:25,730
Peter, please get
out of my way!

146
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:27,065
Aah!

147
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:28,066
BABY: Aah!
Aah!

148
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,134
(doorbell rings)

149
00:06:29,168 --> 00:06:31,102
Great. We woke up the doorbell.

150
00:06:31,937 --> 00:06:33,872
I think there was
a mix-up at the park.

151
00:06:33,906 --> 00:06:35,774
(gasps)
My little Stewie!

152
00:06:35,808 --> 00:06:37,308
Oh, Jacob!

153
00:06:37,343 --> 00:06:39,477
Wh-Where's your little hat?

154
00:06:39,512 --> 00:06:40,979
He didn't have a hat.

155
00:06:41,013 --> 00:06:42,647
Oh, I am so sorry.

156
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:43,982
I just got
home myself.

157
00:06:44,016 --> 00:06:45,650
I left my husband in charge,

158
00:06:45,684 --> 00:06:47,986
which was obviously
a terrible mistake.

159
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,122
Thank you so much.

160
00:06:51,157 --> 00:06:53,124
I took a bath
with the dad.

161
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,293
Mmm. Oh, my baby's
back home.

162
00:06:55,327 --> 00:06:56,661
Mommy missed you.

163
00:06:56,695 --> 00:06:58,196
Congratulations, Lois.

164
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,697
You passed the test.

165
00:06:59,732 --> 00:07:00,965
You really do
love Stewie.

166
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,001
Now, what do you
say we all sit down

167
00:07:03,035 --> 00:07:05,136
and watch this Weird Al
Yankovic documentary?

168
00:07:05,171 --> 00:07:07,806
It's called
<i>An Inconvenient Tooth.</i>

169
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,008
(laughing) What's wrong
with you, Peter?!

170
00:07:10,042 --> 00:07:11,376
Lois, I'm sorry.

171
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,044
How the hell
can you possibly

172
00:07:13,078 --> 00:07:14,379
mistake another baby
for Stewie?!

173
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:16,014
Now, calm down, Lois.

174
00:07:16,048 --> 00:07:17,449
You're gonna say
something you don't mean.

175
00:07:17,483 --> 00:07:19,984
Oh, no, I'm not!
You're an idiot!

176
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:22,220
You don't mean that.

177
00:07:22,254 --> 00:07:24,422
I already got a Facebook
friend request from the dad.

178
00:07:24,457 --> 00:07:26,024
Is that weird?

179
00:07:26,058 --> 00:07:28,393
Peter, I have put up
with your nonsense for 20 years,

180
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:29,994
but today
you crossed a line.

181
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:32,263
You left a helpless baby
in a public park.

182
00:07:32,298 --> 00:07:34,899
And that's something
only an idiot would do!

183
00:07:36,168 --> 00:07:38,036
I'm <i>not</i> an idiot.

184
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,038
(knocking)

185
00:07:40,072 --> 00:07:42,974
Hey, I think
there was a mix-up at the park.

186
00:07:48,257 --> 00:07:50,459
MAN (over TV): We now return
to <i>The Karate Kid,</i>

187
00:07:50,493 --> 00:07:52,427
with realistic human feelings.

188
00:07:52,462 --> 00:07:54,229
You're all right, LaRusso!
(crowd cheering)

189
00:07:54,263 --> 00:07:56,832
(bleep) You just tried
to cripple me!

190
00:07:56,866 --> 00:07:58,366
(sighs)

191
00:07:58,401 --> 00:08:01,169
I hate to sound like every
woman ever, but I'm depressed.

192
00:08:01,204 --> 00:08:02,504
Don't engage.
Don't engage.

193
00:08:02,538 --> 00:08:03,905
Why?
Damn it!

194
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,841
Lois called me an idiot.
So?

195
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,376
So, I don't tell her all the
bad things about herself.

196
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:10,078
Like how the mole on her back

197
00:08:10,113 --> 00:08:12,280
is changing shape and
size really quickly.

198
00:08:12,315 --> 00:08:13,915
Being dumb isn't
the worst thing, Peter.

199
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,851
At least you're not
two foreign guys

200
00:08:15,885 --> 00:08:18,120
talking too loud
in the next booth.

201
00:08:18,154 --> 00:08:20,122
Much sorry, friend!

202
00:08:20,156 --> 00:08:22,791
Man, there are
no womens here.

203
00:08:22,825 --> 00:08:25,627
We've got to make like '70s
rock man Garrett and leave.

204
00:08:25,661 --> 00:08:27,095
You said it, Belgard.

205
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,397
Looks like you and me
will have to make hands

206
00:08:29,432 --> 00:08:30,465
on each other tonight.

207
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,967
Aah, gross!

208
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:34,336
(laughs) I was just
playing joke at you!

209
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,271
Ah, good one! You
should be comedy writer.

210
00:08:36,305 --> 00:08:37,806
Too late, friend.

211
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,808
I already have
comedy development at CBS.

212
00:08:39,842 --> 00:08:41,176
Oh, nice!

213
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,944
CBS knows real situations

214
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:44,913
I want to see
for 100 episodes!

215
00:08:44,947 --> 00:08:47,949
Thanks. My hysterical
multi-camera show is called

216
00:08:47,984 --> 00:08:50,485
<i>Wizard Robot and His</i>
<i>Less Successful Friend.</i>

217
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,054
Oh, man, you know
what America wants.

218
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:55,056
All right, fine, so
I'm a dumb, hot guy.

219
00:08:55,091 --> 00:08:56,992
All right? There's
worse things to be.

220
00:08:57,026 --> 00:08:58,894
Okay, we're only gonna
tackle one thing today.

221
00:08:58,928 --> 00:09:01,169
Peter, maybe you need to
broaden your horizons, you know?

222
00:09:01,197 --> 00:09:02,531
Read a book, travel.

223
00:09:02,565 --> 00:09:04,032
Oh, yeah, I love traveling.

224
00:09:04,066 --> 00:09:05,367
You see new things,

225
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:06,902
inconvenience thousands
of people.

226
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:08,937
You know what?
You guys are right.

227
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:11,940
It's time to travel, to learn,
to experience new things.

228
00:09:11,974 --> 00:09:13,942
I've been letting opportunities
pass me by

229
00:09:13,976 --> 00:09:15,410
ever since I was a kid.

230
00:09:17,213 --> 00:09:20,282
Hey, kid, get in my van, and
I'll give you some candy.

231
00:09:20,316 --> 00:09:23,151
No, my mom says I shouldn't.

232
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:29,825
(crying)

233
00:09:29,859 --> 00:09:34,296
Hey, kid, get in my van, and
I'll give you some candy.

234
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,097
Okay!

235
00:09:44,173 --> 00:09:47,409
Stella, I need you to go
to Chicago on Thursday.

236
00:09:47,443 --> 00:09:51,112
I can't. This week
is the Deaf Games.

237
00:09:51,147 --> 00:09:53,148
(bell clanging)

238
00:09:55,151 --> 00:09:57,085
(bell continues clanging)

239
00:09:57,119 --> 00:09:59,421
Oh, my God, this has been
a 12-minute round.

240
00:09:59,455 --> 00:10:01,957
Why does every fight
have to go to the death?

241
00:10:01,991 --> 00:10:03,558
Angela, if you got
business traveling

242
00:10:03,593 --> 00:10:05,894
that needs to be done,
I'm your guy.

243
00:10:05,928 --> 00:10:07,495
Griffin, I'm not
gonna look over there

244
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,664
until you first assure
me you've got pants on.

245
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:12,334
It's not a rule unless
there's a sign on the wall.

246
00:10:12,368 --> 00:10:14,369
I won that court case.
Fine.

247
00:10:14,403 --> 00:10:16,104
So you'd be willing
to take that trip

248
00:10:16,138 --> 00:10:17,439
to Chicago for
the company?

249
00:10:17,473 --> 00:10:18,807
Yeah, you know,
I was just saying

250
00:10:18,841 --> 00:10:20,375
I need to broaden my horizons.

251
00:10:20,409 --> 00:10:22,077
You see, my wife thinks
I'm an idiot.

252
00:10:22,111 --> 00:10:24,246
She's always making me feel
small and insignificant.

253
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,348
Like John Goodman's
heartbeat.

254
00:10:26,382 --> 00:10:28,917
(heart thumps)

255
00:10:28,951 --> 00:10:32,454
Honey? My inside left boob
stomach did that thing again.

256
00:10:32,488 --> 00:10:34,022
You mean
your heart?

257
00:10:34,056 --> 00:10:36,524
Um, I don't know
about any of that,

258
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:38,660
but I think
I should eat something.

259
00:10:42,465 --> 00:10:44,266
Well, gentlemen,
thank you for coming.

260
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,534
Mr. Griffin, I believe you
have something for me.

261
00:10:46,569 --> 00:10:48,536
Yes, I do, Mr. Franks.
Terrific.

262
00:10:48,571 --> 00:10:50,538
We were completely
out of these tubes.

263
00:10:50,573 --> 00:10:52,540
Well, thank you all
for coming. Good day.

264
00:10:52,575 --> 00:10:54,476
Nicely done, Mr. Franks.
Thanks, Chief.

265
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,578
Wait, so that's it?
Hey, you nailed it!

266
00:10:56,612 --> 00:10:57,892
But I'm here till
tomorrow night.

267
00:10:57,914 --> 00:10:59,414
What am I
supposed to do?

268
00:10:59,448 --> 00:11:01,116
Get out there
and explore Chicago, Peter.

269
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,351
It's one of the great cities
of the world.

270
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:06,187
There's museums,
a symphony, a Lyric Opera.

271
00:11:06,222 --> 00:11:07,522
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

272
00:11:07,556 --> 00:11:09,391
Did you say "chicken
fashion show"?

273
00:11:09,425 --> 00:11:11,026
No.
Oh.

274
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,194
But that-that other stuff,
they all sound like

275
00:11:13,229 --> 00:11:16,197
the kind of things I could
do to expand my horizons.

276
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Wow.

277
00:11:19,035 --> 00:11:22,103
Chicago:
"The San Francisco Treat."

278
00:11:22,138 --> 00:11:24,172
I haven't felt this sense
of limitless adventure

279
00:11:24,206 --> 00:11:26,174
since I went cave jumping.

280
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,994
Here we go!

281
00:11:28,028 --> 00:11:31,798
(echoing): I told no one
what I was doing today!

282
00:11:36,036 --> 00:11:39,806
Man, I'm, like, the fifth most
attractive woman in Chicago.

283
00:11:46,647 --> 00:11:48,281
Hi. Welcome
to the museum.

284
00:11:48,315 --> 00:11:49,949
Thanks.
Just to be clear,

285
00:11:49,983 --> 00:11:51,451
I should touch
everything, right?

286
00:11:51,485 --> 00:11:53,152
No, please don't
touch anything.

287
00:11:53,187 --> 00:11:55,455
Sorry, it's my first time
at an adult museum.

288
00:11:55,489 --> 00:11:57,256
I'm used to petting
the starfishes.

289
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,325
Well, maybe you'd find
our audio tour helpful.

290
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,626
You have your choice
of narrators:

291
00:12:00,661 --> 00:12:02,328
our senior curator

292
00:12:02,362 --> 00:12:04,397
or Chicago's own
Dennis Farina.

293
00:12:04,431 --> 00:12:07,099
Hmm.

294
00:12:07,134 --> 00:12:09,268
FARINA: Hey there, chief.
Dennis Farina here.

295
00:12:09,303 --> 00:12:11,204
And welcome to our museum.

296
00:12:11,238 --> 00:12:14,540
Just so you know, I'll be
eating through most of this.

297
00:12:14,575 --> 00:12:16,209
Yeah. This one.

298
00:12:17,578 --> 00:12:19,412
FARINA:
(chewing) Ah, man,

299
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:21,280
that's good sausage.
(burps)

300
00:12:21,315 --> 00:12:22,548
Oops. Excuse me.

301
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,684
Anyways, this is
<i>At the Moulin Rouge</i>

302
00:12:24,718 --> 00:12:26,152
by Toulouse-Lautrec.

303
00:12:26,186 --> 00:12:28,154
Uh, it's from the 1890s.

304
00:12:28,188 --> 00:12:31,858
Now, he was a midge,
but he painted like a normal.

305
00:12:34,161 --> 00:12:37,530
Now, here is a naked chick
made completely out of marble.

306
00:12:37,564 --> 00:12:39,699
I got to wonder--
I'm sure you do, too--

307
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:42,502
how this thing didn't crack
when they were carving out

308
00:12:42,536 --> 00:12:44,670
her downstairs business.

309
00:12:44,705 --> 00:12:47,607
(loudly): He did a great job
with the vagina.

310
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:50,676
Here's a picture
by this guy Salvador Dalí.

311
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:54,146
This guy, I'm telling you,
was a freakin' whack-a-doodle.

312
00:12:54,181 --> 00:12:57,350
Wow, who knew you could learn
so much at a museum?

313
00:12:57,384 --> 00:12:59,185
And this is only Chicago.

314
00:12:59,219 --> 00:13:01,687
From now on, I'm gonna volunteer
for every business trip,

315
00:13:01,722 --> 00:13:04,423
and see all the great stuff
that's out there.

MAN (over TV): We now return
to Janeane Garofalo

342
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,555
and Mark Ruffalo
in <i>Garofaruffalo.</i>

343
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,823
Turn it off, Chris.

344
00:14:10,857 --> 00:14:12,758
I don't even want to know
what that is.

345
00:14:12,793 --> 00:14:15,161
Your father
has returned.

346
00:14:15,195 --> 00:14:16,729
Dad!
Oh, Peter!

347
00:14:16,763 --> 00:14:18,464
How were all your
business trips?

348
00:14:18,498 --> 00:14:20,232
Oh, exemplary, Chris.

349
00:14:20,267 --> 00:14:22,768
I don't understand what
either of those words mean.

350
00:14:22,803 --> 00:14:24,670
One of them
was "Chris."

351
00:14:24,705 --> 00:14:26,405
Peter, you seem...
different.

352
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,442
That's right, Lois;
I live the life of the mind now.

353
00:14:29,476 --> 00:14:32,411
My brain is awash
with theorems and profundity

354
00:14:32,446 --> 00:14:35,348
and abstractions that I can
pontificate upon at length.

355
00:14:35,382 --> 00:14:37,416
Brian's a woof-cat!

356
00:14:37,451 --> 00:14:40,186
Peter, you sound
so refined.

357
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,254
Are you...
intelligent now?

358
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:44,357
Affirmative.
That means "yes."

359
00:14:44,391 --> 00:14:46,592
Does that please you?
It does, Peter.

360
00:14:46,627 --> 00:14:48,227
Well, it should.

361
00:14:48,261 --> 00:14:50,863
After all, knowledge is
the ultimate aphrodisiac.

362
00:14:50,897 --> 00:14:52,865
Shall we away
for relations?

363
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:56,168
I'm not sure what you're
saying, but let's hump!

364
00:14:56,203 --> 00:14:58,070
PETER (panting):
Affirmative, affirmative,

365
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:01,240
affirmative...
Oh, my God, affirmative!

366
00:15:01,274 --> 00:15:03,576
LOIS:
Wow, Peter, that was great!

367
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,945
PETER:
It was. Sorry I "arrived" early.

368
00:15:05,979 --> 00:15:07,546
LOIS:
That's okay.

369
00:15:07,581 --> 00:15:08,981
PETER:
And sorry about the bedspread.

370
00:15:09,016 --> 00:15:11,584
That was about
a week's worth of arrive.

371
00:15:16,894 --> 00:15:20,029
Mom, Dad, the TV's broken!

372
00:15:20,234 --> 00:15:22,568
Actually, Chris,
I got rid of our television.

373
00:15:22,603 --> 00:15:25,138
This is our new bookshelf,
and I think you'll find

374
00:15:25,172 --> 00:15:28,207
it has more channels than
any TV we've ever owned.

375
00:15:28,242 --> 00:15:30,243
I want to watch
<i>The Walking Dead!</i>

376
00:15:30,277 --> 00:15:33,746
Then I shall read to you from
Mary Shelley's <i>Frankenstein.</i>

377
00:15:33,781 --> 00:15:35,181
I want to watch
<i>New Girl.</i>

378
00:15:35,215 --> 00:15:37,083
Perhaps you'd like to hear
about Jane Eyre,

379
00:15:37,117 --> 00:15:40,987
who felt quite the new girl
at Rochester's Thornfield Hall.

380
00:15:41,021 --> 00:15:42,789
How about
<i>Game of Thrones?</i>

381
00:15:42,823 --> 00:15:45,024
Instead, I shall read
to you from...

382
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:46,692
<i>Game of Thrones.</i>

383
00:15:46,727 --> 00:15:48,961
Oh, finally, another reader
in the family.

384
00:15:48,996 --> 00:15:51,397
You know, these are some of
my favorite books and authors.

385
00:15:51,432 --> 00:15:53,132
Oh? What are you
reading right now?

386
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:54,734
Oh, boy.
Well, I'm...

387
00:15:54,768 --> 00:15:56,302
I'm sort of between
books right now.

388
00:15:56,336 --> 00:15:58,204
Yeah? What was
the last thing you read?

389
00:15:58,238 --> 00:15:59,906
He's got you on
the ropes now.

390
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,008
I-I'm actually <i>rereading</i>
<i>a lot of stuff.</i>

391
00:16:02,042 --> 00:16:03,876
Yeah? Like what?
Just tap out.

392
00:16:03,911 --> 00:16:05,945
Uh... the classics,
you know?

393
00:16:05,979 --> 00:16:08,681
Going back to the,
uh... basics, really.

394
00:16:08,715 --> 00:16:10,917
(chuckles)
Words on the printed page.

395
00:16:10,951 --> 00:16:12,919
Thank you,
Steve Guttenberg, right?

396
00:16:12,953 --> 00:16:14,253
What is this, oak?

397
00:16:14,288 --> 00:16:16,189
Oh, I don't even
think it's oak!

398
00:16:16,223 --> 00:16:18,958
Peter, I can't get over the way
you've transformed yourself.

399
00:16:18,992 --> 00:16:20,293
How'd you do it?

400
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:22,328
Well, Lois, some of it
came from books,

401
00:16:22,362 --> 00:16:23,863
some came from museums,

402
00:16:23,897 --> 00:16:26,299
and, honestly, a lot of it
just came from travel.

403
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,734
Hey, excuse me,
I need to rent a car.

404
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:31,671
Preferably one where
the radio is stuck on NPR.

405
00:16:31,705 --> 00:16:33,172
Here you go.

406
00:16:35,309 --> 00:16:37,877
(softly): Hello.
It's me. I am returning.

407
00:16:37,911 --> 00:16:39,412
How was the car?

408
00:16:39,446 --> 00:16:41,114
Coastal and superior.

409
00:16:41,148 --> 00:16:43,249
I never knew whisper-talking
was so smart.

410
00:16:43,283 --> 00:16:45,985
And how will you be paying
for your rental, sir?

411
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:48,688
I will pay you with stories
of my abusive father

412
00:16:48,722 --> 00:16:50,289
set to dissonant flute.

413
00:16:50,324 --> 00:16:51,791
(playing gentle music)

414
00:16:51,825 --> 00:16:54,293
I was seven when
he first came home drunk.

415
00:16:54,328 --> 00:16:58,231
A child should sleep
on his bed, not under it.

416
00:17:00,901 --> 00:17:02,368
Hey, what are you
listening to?

417
00:17:02,402 --> 00:17:04,237
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm learning Sanskrit.

418
00:17:04,271 --> 00:17:05,805
You know,
an ancient tongue

419
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,874
can be as titillating
as a young one.

420
00:17:07,908 --> 00:17:09,675
Peter, what gives?
Ever since you had

421
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,644
all those business trips,
you've been acting weird.

422
00:17:11,678 --> 00:17:15,248
Pity a man in familiar places
who yet feels like a stranger.

423
00:17:15,282 --> 00:17:18,151
You... you're the dick
who wrote that in the bathroom!

424
00:17:18,185 --> 00:17:21,387
Indeed. Being smart
and cultured is so lonely.

425
00:17:21,421 --> 00:17:24,023
Now I know why Oscar Wilde
turned to alcoholism

426
00:17:24,057 --> 00:17:26,025
and bone inhalation.

427
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:28,127
Gentlemen, as they
say in Sanskrit,

428
00:17:28,162 --> 00:17:31,264
<i>shubha prabhatam.</i>

429
00:17:31,298 --> 00:17:33,933
(laughs) You know
what's weird?

430
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:35,368
Shubha Prabhatam
is my porn name.

431
00:17:35,402 --> 00:17:36,936
What?

432
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,804
Yeah, first pet and
street you grew up on.

433
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:40,907
You had a pet named Shubha?
Oh, yeah.

434
00:17:40,941 --> 00:17:42,441
Old Shubha was
a tough pooch.

435
00:17:42,476 --> 00:17:45,978
He was feared by everyone up
and down Prabhatam Drive.

436
00:17:46,013 --> 00:17:48,381
You have
a very weird past.

437
00:17:51,385 --> 00:17:53,819
All right, if this is
to be a smart family,

438
00:17:53,854 --> 00:17:55,454
we will have to learn
not to giggle

439
00:17:55,489 --> 00:17:58,057
at smart things that
sound dirty but are not.

440
00:17:58,091 --> 00:17:59,225
Balzac.

441
00:17:59,259 --> 00:18:00,760
(all giggling)

442
00:18:00,794 --> 00:18:02,161
Homo erectus.

443
00:18:02,196 --> 00:18:03,829
(all giggling)

444
00:18:03,864 --> 00:18:05,164
Spotted dick.

445
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:06,532
(all giggling)

446
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:09,168
The results have
been disappointing.

447
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:12,091
I always thought
spotted dick

448
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,593
had something
to do with Morgan Freeman.

449
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,230
MAN (over TV):
<i>We now return to</i>

450
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:20,799
Wizard Robot
and His Less Successful Friend.

451
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:24,203
Aah! We're in a real jar
of jam this time, Wizard Robot.

452
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:25,404
Gip-gop.

453
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,239
I have put too much suds
in this machine

454
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:28,841
for washing clothes.

455
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,343
And tonight is the night
I meet with other members

456
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:33,279
of my form twelve
learning mates

457
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:36,448
to celebrate the exactly
two groupings of ten years ago.

458
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:37,816
Gip-gop.

459
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:39,485
(beeping)

460
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:41,120
Oh, excellent!

461
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:42,988
The situation
has abated itself.

462
00:18:43,023 --> 00:18:44,490
Let us leave the room

463
00:18:44,524 --> 00:18:47,326
where no comedic situation
will soon take place.

464
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:52,865
(enthusiastic audience laughter)

465
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:56,802
ROBOT VOICE: <i>Wizard Robot and</i>
<i>His Less Successful Friend.</i>

466
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,771
(audience cheering)

467
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,874
Hi, Lois.
No, I wasn't!

468
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:03,876
Oh, Brian, thank God
it's just you.

469
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,078
You know how Peter
thinks TV rots the mind.

470
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:08,881
Oh, as long as you're here, can
you run some vocabulary with me?

471
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:11,116
I need to know how to use
these words in sentences

472
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:12,418
by the time
Peter gets home.

473
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:14,386
Oh, that should be easy.
Just give me the word,

474
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:16,322
and I'll put it in
a sentence for you.

475
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:17,990
"Anodyne."

476
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:21,927
Uh... a friend asked me
what "anodyne" means.

477
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:23,362
Oh, who am I kidding?

478
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:25,364
I'm never gonna learn
any of these words.

479
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:27,199
(groans) I can't take
this anymore, Brian,

480
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:28,600
and the kids
can't either.

481
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:30,135
Peter's become
a nightmare.

482
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,204
Wait, I thought this was
what you always wanted--

483
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:33,906
for Peter not to be
an idiot.

484
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,607
Oh, at least that Peter was fun

485
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:37,476
and didn't make me
feel so stupid.

486
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,578
I miss the old Peter.

487
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:41,146
Well, we got
to do something,

488
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,282
'cause this new Peter
just sounds all wrong.

489
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:45,551
Like a pilot
without a calming voice.

490
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:47,219
(electronic bell dings)
PILOT (screaming): We've now

491
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:49,221
reached our cruising altitude!

492
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:51,690
If you look out the window,
you'll see the Rocky Mountains!

493
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:53,025
(all screaming)

494
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:55,361
We have to get
out of here!

495
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:56,995
(all screaming)

496
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,797
Wait a minute.

497
00:19:58,832 --> 00:20:01,500
If visiting San Francisco and
New York made Peter smart,

498
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,136
maybe if we send him
to the dumbest city

499
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,672
in the whole country, it'll
bring back the old Peter.

500
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,974
Huh. It's worth a try.

501
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:14,580
Aloha!

502
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:15,981
(laughing)

503
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:18,016
(grunting, laughter)

504
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:26,091
Is Peter home?
He's pulling in now.

505
00:20:26,126 --> 00:20:28,093
I sure hope Tucson helped.

506
00:20:28,128 --> 00:20:30,195
Heads up, guys.
I farted on the doorstep,

507
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,730
but it's hot
on my trail.

508
00:20:31,765 --> 00:20:34,166
Oh, Brian,
that's a good sign.

509
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,301
How was your trip?
Oh, amazing.

510
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:39,104
I saw a wet T-shirt contest
using chocolate milk.

511
00:20:39,139 --> 00:20:41,039
It was at
the Tucson Philharmonic.

512
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,241
What else did you do?

513
00:20:42,672 --> 00:20:44,762
Eh, mostly just picked
my desert boogers.

514
00:20:44,764 --> 00:20:47,273
Oh, Peter, you're back!
Thank God!

515
00:20:48,003 --> 00:20:50,003
We all owe that trash city
a debt of gratitude.

516
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,407
Did you know <i>Battleship</i>
is still in theaters there?

517
00:20:53,441 --> 00:20:58,441
