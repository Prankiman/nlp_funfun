00:00:33,465 --> 00:00:35,933
Hey Lois, can I please
have another pancake?

13
00:00:35,968 --> 00:00:37,901
(laughs)
What? What's so funny?

14
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:39,603
I don't know.
Dog eating pancakes.

15
00:00:39,638 --> 00:00:40,838
It's funny.

16
00:00:40,873 --> 00:00:43,307
Mom, I need a check
for the school field trip.

17
00:00:43,342 --> 00:00:45,676
Geez, Meg, didn't I just
take you on a field trip?

18
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,779
Okay, here's the field!
Good-bye forever!

19
00:00:48,814 --> 00:00:51,381
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

20
00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:53,517
Aah! Meg, I'm injured!

21
00:00:53,552 --> 00:00:55,085
Please help me!

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,020
I smell gas!

23
00:00:58,757 --> 00:01:02,226
Meg, I'm still alive,
but I'm badly burned!

24
00:01:02,261 --> 00:01:05,529
Come save my life and
nurse me back to health!

25
00:01:05,564 --> 00:01:10,200
Oh, God, why do bad things
happen to good people?!

26
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,835
Here, sweetie, I'll
write you a check.

27
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:13,237
No, no, I got it, Lois.

28
00:01:13,272 --> 00:01:14,671
Let me just lick my thumb

29
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:18,108
'cause that's what people do
before they write a check.

30
00:01:18,143 --> 00:01:21,979
Okay, now let me tilt my glasses
down and ask the date.

31
00:01:22,014 --> 00:01:24,348
What's the date today?

32
00:01:24,383 --> 00:01:26,750
Dad, why don't your checks
have any writing on them?

33
00:01:26,785 --> 00:01:28,886
Why don't your shelves
have any trophies on 'em?

34
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:33,156
I've obviously
caught you at a bad time.

35
00:01:33,192 --> 00:01:35,225
Lois, why<i> don't</i> my checks
have any writing on them?

36
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,294
Well, Peter...
What?

37
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:40,898
That's just a wide pad
of Post-its I gave you.

38
00:01:42,568 --> 00:01:44,868
What?!
So that million dollar check

39
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:46,637
you gave me yesterday
is no good?

40
00:01:46,672 --> 00:01:48,705
I quit my job, man!

41
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:52,276
I will<i> not</i> see you Monday!

42
00:01:52,311 --> 00:01:53,443
What the hell, Lois?

43
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,878
Why don't I have
a real checkbook?

44
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:56,546
Peter, where do
checks come from?

45
00:01:56,582 --> 00:01:59,783
Uh... when a mommy and daddy
love each other?

46
00:01:59,818 --> 00:02:00,984
That's why.

47
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,654
Lois, I want my own checkbook,
and I want it now!

48
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:05,656
Ooh, I like
when Dad talks tough.

49
00:02:05,691 --> 00:02:07,457
He sounds like
Dirty Harry.

50
00:02:07,493 --> 00:02:09,359
You got to ask yourself
one question.

51
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:11,328
"Do I feel lucky?"

52
00:02:11,363 --> 00:02:13,397
Well, do ya, punk?

53
00:02:13,432 --> 00:02:15,432
Oh, Mr. Harry,

54
00:02:15,467 --> 00:02:18,335
you're really not gonna like
what I have to say.

55
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:24,441
Hi. What can I
do for you?

56
00:02:24,476 --> 00:02:26,209
Yes, I was wondering,
where is the room

57
00:02:26,245 --> 00:02:28,178
where I can roll around nude
with my money?

58
00:02:28,213 --> 00:02:29,346
I'm sorry?

59
00:02:29,381 --> 00:02:31,481
No, I'm sorry.
I thought this was a bank.

60
00:02:31,517 --> 00:02:32,849
I'll handle this.

61
00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:35,118
My husband wants to
open a checking account.

62
00:02:35,154 --> 00:02:37,487
Okay, well, first,
I'll need to see a photo I.D.

63
00:02:37,523 --> 00:02:38,722
and a birth certificate.

64
00:02:38,757 --> 00:02:39,923
Of course.

65
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,426
I keep all my important
papers in my bosom.

66
00:02:43,996 --> 00:02:47,030
Okay, "Justin...
Peter... Griffin."

67
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,966
It's actually
just Peter Griffin.

68
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:52,703
So, this is not your
birth certificate?

69
00:02:54,907 --> 00:02:56,073
Oh, my God!

70
00:02:56,108 --> 00:02:57,708
Your first name
is Justin?!

71
00:02:57,743 --> 00:02:58,976
It is?!

72
00:02:59,011 --> 00:03:00,644
Wow, I never noticed that!

73
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:02,279
"Justin Griffin."

74
00:03:02,314 --> 00:03:04,281
Huh, I like
the sound of that.

75
00:03:04,316 --> 00:03:05,615
I'm a Justin!

76
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:07,751
This is awesome!
This changes everything!

77
00:03:07,786 --> 00:03:09,252
Peter, it doesn't
change a thing.

78
00:03:09,288 --> 00:03:11,088
You're still
the exact same person.

79
00:03:11,123 --> 00:03:13,557
I beg to differ.

00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,612
I need 'em later
for park soccer.

87
00:03:35,647 --> 00:03:37,781
Peter, why the hell
do you look like that?

88
00:03:37,816 --> 00:03:39,016
Uh, my name
isn't Peter.

89
00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:40,317
My name is Justin.

90
00:03:40,352 --> 00:03:44,287
I'm living a Justin lifestyle,
and so is my family.

91
00:03:44,323 --> 00:03:46,289
You want to go to
a concert? Huh?

92
00:03:46,325 --> 00:03:48,225
Want to go to a
loud concert?

93
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,526
No.

94
00:03:49,561 --> 00:03:51,395
Since I'm your cool
father Justin,

95
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,730
we should bond with
skin-to-skin contact.

96
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:55,432
How about Justin
takes his shirt off,

97
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:58,301
and we can get some photos
of you on Justin's belly?

98
00:04:00,572 --> 00:04:02,205
Your heartbeat is weird.

99
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:04,207
It is not
consistent at all.

100
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:06,543
Okay, let's go for a
ride in my open Jeep.

101
00:04:06,578 --> 00:04:09,613
I took the doors off,
so it's extra terrifying.

102
00:04:09,648 --> 00:04:12,616
Geez, this "Justin" phase
of Dad's is kind of weird.

103
00:04:12,651 --> 00:04:15,585
Eh, not as weird as
his karaoke phase.

104
00:04:16,622 --> 00:04:18,588

Oh, hey, Chris.

116
00:05:37,903 --> 00:05:39,369
I just figured now
that I'm Justin,

117
00:05:39,404 --> 00:05:41,371
I should start
a "Sweet News" wall

118
00:05:41,406 --> 00:05:43,173
for stuff I think
is totally sweet.

119
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:46,009
Big puffy clouds
are very sweet.

120
00:05:46,044 --> 00:05:47,044
Big hamburgers.

121
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:48,345
Small hamburgers, too.

122
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,013
Sliders, I think
they're called.

123
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:51,181
Ranch.

124
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:52,682
Here's just a
picture of a vest.

125
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:54,017
Pretty sweet.

126
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:57,187
Palm trees are very sweet,
'cause, like, the beach.

127
00:05:57,222 --> 00:05:58,855
This is<i> my</i> room, Dad.

128
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:01,625
The band Guster is the
sweetest band of all time.

129
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,628
It was tough, 'cause I had
to move all my O.A.R. stuff

130
00:06:04,663 --> 00:06:06,296
to fit the Guster stuff.

131
00:06:06,331 --> 00:06:08,031
Peter, get out
of Chris's room.

132
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:09,199
Oh, hey Mama.

133
00:06:09,234 --> 00:06:10,934
Hey, you seen my copy
of<i> Into the Wild?</i>

134
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:13,203
I like to have it on
my person at all times,

135
00:06:13,238 --> 00:06:15,038
in case I need a
quick "inspo sesh."

136
00:06:15,073 --> 00:06:17,707
Oh, did I tell you I'm gonna
be doing a lot of abbreve's?

137
00:06:17,743 --> 00:06:19,042
Peter, you sound
like an idiot.

138
00:06:19,077 --> 00:06:21,545
And did you put a skateboard
in the washing machine?

139
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,713
It's gonna cost several
hundred dollars to repair.

140
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:24,881
How we do, Lois.

141
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,049
All we do.

142
00:06:26,084 --> 00:06:28,051
You ever get in the
pocket of a wave?

143
00:06:28,086 --> 00:06:29,386
Peter, you know
I haven't.

144
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:31,221
And I know for a fact
that you haven't, either.

145
00:06:31,256 --> 00:06:32,256
In the pocket.

146
00:06:32,257 --> 00:06:33,723
Some gnarlies out there.

147
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,058
Some "gnar-gnars."

148
00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:36,393
Was in one today.

149
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:38,228
It's like the rest of
the world just shuts off,

150
00:06:38,263 --> 00:06:40,730
and all that matters
is you and Lady Blue.

151
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:42,732
And you know what
she said to me?

152
00:06:42,768 --> 00:06:45,068
"You're great."

153
00:06:45,103 --> 00:06:46,403
Keep it cool, Lois.

154
00:06:46,438 --> 00:06:48,939
K-E-W-L.

155
00:06:50,342 --> 00:06:53,310
(dance music pulses)

156
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,583
So, you want to
go upstairs?

157
00:06:59,618 --> 00:07:00,684
Sure.

158
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:01,719
Great.

159
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,720
Go.

160
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:06,056
Hey, Justin, I wanted
to introduce you to Keira.

161
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:08,391
She's the one who brought
four loose Sierra Nevadas.

162
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:09,559
Keira!

163
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,429
You totally rock
for bringing those.

164
00:07:12,464 --> 00:07:14,831
Peter, what the hell
is going on?!

165
00:07:14,866 --> 00:07:16,833
Oh, dude, is that your mom?

166
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:18,835
No, I'm not his mom,
you little bastard.

167
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:22,405
That "little bastard" knows how
to smoke pot out of an apple.

168
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:24,441
All right,
everyone out of here.

169
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:29,312
I've had enough of
this "Justin" nonsense.

170
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:30,814
Tomorrow we're
going to city hall

171
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:32,816
to legally change your
name back to "Peter."

172
00:07:32,851 --> 00:07:34,484
All right, fine.

173
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:37,487
But I got to say, being Justin
was quite an adventure.

174
00:07:37,522 --> 00:07:39,956
Like when I found
where the Wild Things were.

175
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,294
(gun fires)

176
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:45,629
I owe you, Max.

177
00:07:45,664 --> 00:07:46,963
You led me right to 'em.

178
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:50,133
All right, now help me grind
their horns into boner pills.

179
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:56,306
Keira, that was
an amazing night.

180
00:07:56,341 --> 00:07:57,707
Sorry I can't
drive you to work.

181
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,676
I gotta go sit in my
den until you leave.

182
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:00,810
Oh, that's okay.

183
00:08:00,846 --> 00:08:02,145
I'll just take
the school bus.

184
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,813
Wait... what?!

185
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:05,815
You-you drive
a school bus?

186
00:08:05,851 --> 00:08:08,151
(giggling): No, silly,
I take the bus.

187
00:08:08,186 --> 00:08:09,486
I'm in high school.

188
00:08:09,521 --> 00:08:10,521
What the hell?!

189
00:08:10,522 --> 00:08:11,655
You said you were 23!

190
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,490
Yeah, and you said
you loved me.

191
00:08:13,525 --> 00:08:14,991
Well, I guess you
got me there.

192
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:16,526
(knocking on door)

193
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:19,863
Hey, Quagmire,
sorry to bother you,

194
00:08:19,898 --> 00:08:21,865
but we're following up
on a tip.

195
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,867
Did you have sex
with this underage girl?

196
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:26,870
I don't want to go to jail, but
I really want to take credit.

197
00:08:26,905 --> 00:08:29,739
Quagmire, I'm afraid you're
under arrest for statutory rape.

198
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:30,940
(sighs)

199
00:08:30,976 --> 00:08:32,809
All right, but let me
just send the pictures

200
00:08:32,844 --> 00:08:34,878
I took of her last night
to all my friends.

201
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:37,280
(cell phone buzzes)

202
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:38,316
Oh, yeah!

203
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:39,317
Boom!

204
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:40,318
You're disgusting.

205
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:41,484
Take him away.

206
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,520
We've got all the awesome
evidence we need.

207
00:08:48,184 --> 00:08:50,017
(doorbell rings)

208
00:08:52,055 --> 00:08:54,356
"Hello, my name is
Glenn Quagmire.

209
00:08:54,391 --> 00:08:56,691
"I am a neighbor of yours
on Spooner Street.

210
00:08:56,727 --> 00:08:59,461
I am here to inform you
that I am a sex offender."

211
00:08:59,496 --> 00:09:01,963
It seems as though you could
have had some of that memorized.

212
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,965
Glenn, what the
hell's going on?

213
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,634
It turns out
that girl I took home

214
00:09:05,669 --> 00:09:07,502
from Peter's party last night
is in high school.

215
00:09:07,538 --> 00:09:08,970
Oh, my God!

216
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,473
Does this mean you're gonna move
to Europe to make movies?

217
00:09:11,508 --> 00:09:14,309
How in the world did you
not know she was underage?

218
00:09:14,344 --> 00:09:16,812
Well, in retrospect,
she did ask a lot of questions

219
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,113
about<i> To Kill a Mockingbird.</i>

220
00:09:18,148 --> 00:09:19,347
Should have sent
her my way.

221
00:09:19,383 --> 00:09:20,482
I love that book.

222
00:09:20,517 --> 00:09:22,951
Oh, Gregory Peck-- whew!

223
00:09:22,986 --> 00:09:25,287
Anyway, now I gotta
go in front of a judge.

224
00:09:25,322 --> 00:09:26,322
Really?

225
00:09:26,323 --> 00:09:27,455
Number one or number two?

226
00:09:27,491 --> 00:09:29,958
Our judicial system
is so broken.

227
00:09:29,993 --> 00:09:32,294
No, Peter-- Glenn
has to go to court.

228
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:33,461
That's right.

229
00:09:33,497 --> 00:09:35,463
And there's not even a defense
for statutory rape.

230
00:09:35,499 --> 00:09:37,966
Once the girl proves her age,
that's it-- you're guilty.

231
00:09:38,001 --> 00:09:39,634
You know what
I tried today?

232
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,670
A fig.

233
00:09:40,671 --> 00:09:41,991
I have a hearing
tomorrow morning.

234
00:09:42,005 --> 00:09:43,471
I may have
to go to jail.

235
00:09:43,507 --> 00:09:46,141
My only hope for leniency is
to bring in character witnesses

236
00:09:46,176 --> 00:09:48,810
and show the court I'm not
the monster they say I am.

237
00:09:48,846 --> 00:09:51,146
Well, Peter would be
happy to support you.

238
00:09:51,181 --> 00:09:52,314
Yeah, you betcha,
Quagmire.

239
00:09:52,349 --> 00:09:53,349
I'm very persuasive.

240
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,649
That's why I was so good

241
00:09:54,685 --> 00:09:56,651
at selling low-cost
car insurance.

242
00:09:58,355 --> 00:10:00,322
(chanting): White-trash rates
from an army guy.

243
00:10:00,357 --> 00:10:02,157
Here is a penguin,
don't know why.

244
00:10:02,192 --> 00:10:03,658
ANNOUNCER:
<i>The General Car Insurance.</i>

245
00:10:03,694 --> 00:10:06,094
<i>It'll worry whoever you hit.</i>

246
00:10:11,335 --> 00:10:14,302
I can't believe Quagmire
and that girl had sex.

247
00:10:14,338 --> 00:10:16,471
Which is hugging someone
really hard with your legs.

248
00:10:16,506 --> 00:10:17,806
Nope.

249
00:10:17,841 --> 00:10:19,641
Well, you'll tell me
if I get it, though, right?

250
00:10:19,676 --> 00:10:21,142
Yeah, I'll tell
you if you get it.

251
00:10:21,178 --> 00:10:22,310
Okay, I'm gonna
get it.

252
00:10:22,346 --> 00:10:23,986
Now, Mr. Griffin,
I understand you're here

253
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:25,814
to speak
on Mr. Quagmire's behalf.

254
00:10:25,849 --> 00:10:27,148
That's right,
Your Honor.

255
00:10:27,184 --> 00:10:29,150
And as we know, according
to<i> Game of Thrones,</i>

256
00:10:29,186 --> 00:10:31,653
if the girl has had her
blood, she is good to go.

257
00:10:31,688 --> 00:10:33,021
Has the girl had her blood?

258
00:10:33,056 --> 00:10:34,189
Answer the question.

259
00:10:34,224 --> 00:10:36,324
Mr. Griffin, she was underage.

260
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,928
Yes, however, Mr. Quagmire
was born on February 29th.

261
00:10:39,963 --> 00:10:42,030
Ergo, he's only 12.

262
00:10:42,065 --> 00:10:44,032
Ergo, the girl raped him.

263
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:45,767
<i>Argo,</i> Ben Affleck.

264
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,606
Mr. Griffin,
do you have any evidence

265
00:10:51,642 --> 00:10:54,409
that is not based
on film or television?

266
00:10:54,444 --> 00:10:56,211
I don't know.
Why don't you ask

267
00:10:56,246 --> 00:10:58,880
all these letters
to Santa Claus?

268
00:11:00,484 --> 00:11:02,684
Something's going on.

269
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:04,252
We haven't gotten
mail in a week.

270
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,054
I-- I haven't gotten
mail in a week.

271
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:08,123
Nobody writes you.

272
00:11:10,327 --> 00:11:13,228
Officer Swanson, I'll remind you
that you are under oath.

273
00:11:13,263 --> 00:11:14,429
Now, please tell us

274
00:11:14,464 --> 00:11:16,898
what Mr. Quagmire said
he did with the girl.

275
00:11:16,934 --> 00:11:18,466
(sighs)
He, uh,

276
00:11:18,502 --> 00:11:21,870
said he gave her a Frosty Jim.

277
00:11:21,905 --> 00:11:23,638
And can you please
explain to the courtroom

278
00:11:23,674 --> 00:11:26,408
what a Frosty Jim is.

279
00:11:26,443 --> 00:11:27,876
Uh...

280
00:11:27,911 --> 00:11:29,444
Sir, you're under oath.

281
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:31,546
Well, it's when you
urinate in a condom,

282
00:11:31,581 --> 00:11:34,382
and tie it off, freeze it,

283
00:11:34,418 --> 00:11:36,384
and then the woman, um,

284
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,819
pretends it's a man.

285
00:11:37,854 --> 00:11:40,055
Thank you.
He's a good guy!

286
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,761
Mr. Brown, can you please state
your occupation for the court?

287
00:11:46,797 --> 00:11:49,497
Aw, come on, man, you didn't
ask anyone else to do that!

288
00:11:49,533 --> 00:11:50,999
Why am I on trial?!

289
00:11:51,034 --> 00:11:53,568
He's the one that mushed
hisself on a child!

290
00:11:53,603 --> 00:11:55,337
When are we gonna see
this chick?

291
00:11:55,372 --> 00:11:57,138
Okay, enough! No more help!

292
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:00,075
I'm taking this Bible.

293
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,110
You want to know what kind
of person Glenn Quagmire is?

294
00:12:02,145 --> 00:12:03,645
You want to know
what made me the person I am?

295
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,480
Then put me on the stand.

296
00:12:05,515 --> 00:12:07,916
Lois, can I play
Angry Birds on your phone?

297
00:12:07,951 --> 00:12:10,085
Okay, but only
with the sound off.

298
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,920
Fine. I'll just do it
with my mouth.

299
00:12:11,955 --> 00:12:12,988
Pa-shooo!

300
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,023
(imitates explosion)

301
00:12:14,057 --> 00:12:15,590
(oinking)

302
00:12:18,628 --> 00:12:20,595
Please, go ahead,
Mr. Quagmire.

303
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,231
Look, I know everyone's sitting
out there judging me today.

304
00:12:23,266 --> 00:12:25,233
But before you do, please know

305
00:12:25,268 --> 00:12:27,469
I had it pretty
rough growing up.

306
00:12:27,504 --> 00:12:30,605
My dad was a military man,
so he wasn't around much.

307
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,407
And my mom, well,
let's just say,

308
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:34,142
she was a little promiscuous.

309
00:12:34,177 --> 00:12:37,479
In fact, I think my problems
started the day I was born.

310
00:12:37,514 --> 00:12:39,347
Wah! Wah! Wah!

311
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:42,050
It's a boy,
Mrs. Quagmire.

312
00:12:42,085 --> 00:12:43,318
Oh, that's wonderful!

313
00:12:43,353 --> 00:12:44,386
How do you feel?

314
00:12:44,421 --> 00:12:46,421
Horny. Really horny.

315
00:12:46,456 --> 00:12:49,424
Could you put him back
so I can push him out again?

316
00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:52,027
I was born nine times that day.

317
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,695
And things never got easier.

318
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,797
The only way I learned
my ABC's was by learning

319
00:12:55,832 --> 00:12:58,700
the names of all the guys
my mom slept with.

320

326
00:13:19,156 --> 00:13:20,321
It was awful.

327
00:13:20,357 --> 00:13:22,157
I didn't even get to go
to my high school prom.

328
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:23,792
But my mom did.

329
00:13:23,827 --> 00:13:24,827
(doorbell rings)

330
00:13:24,828 --> 00:13:27,228
Hey, is Crystal ready?

331
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,630
Oh, hi, Ronnie.

332
00:13:28,665 --> 00:13:30,698
Hey, listen, have my mom
home by midnight, okay?

333
00:13:30,734 --> 00:13:33,401
How about I plow her in the limo
and have her home in 20 minutes?

334
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:36,671
Ah, come on, Ronnie,
she bought the dress.

335
00:13:36,706 --> 00:13:38,840
So, you see, Your Honor,
thanks to my mom,

336
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,576
I never had a chance to
be like everyone else.

337
00:13:41,611 --> 00:13:43,745
My misguided carnal instincts
are the result

338
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,014
of being raised
by a sexual deviant.

339
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:47,782
All I'm asking is
that you give me

340
00:13:47,818 --> 00:13:50,585
the break that
my childhood never did.

341
00:13:53,657 --> 00:13:56,391
Dairy Queen closes
in ten minutes.

342
00:13:58,628 --> 00:14:01,029
Mr. Quagmire,
your story is a sad one,

343
00:14:01,064 --> 00:14:03,431
but that doesn't
excuse your actions.

344
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:06,901
I have no choice but to sentence
you to 20 years in prison.

345
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,871
(gallery gasps)

346
00:14:08,905 --> 00:14:10,905
WOMAN:
Oh, no you don't!

347
00:14:12,642 --> 00:14:13,642
Mom?!

348
00:14:13,677 --> 00:14:14,943
MEN:
Crystal?

349
00:14:14,978 --> 00:14:18,279
Ha! She's enjoyed many men.

350
00:14:24,309 --> 00:14:26,042
Mom, what are you doing here?

351
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:27,978
Do you know I'm carrying
three handguns,

352
00:14:28,013 --> 00:14:30,514
and the metal detectors
picked up nothing?

353
00:14:30,549 --> 00:14:32,382
Your Honor,
as the defendant's mother,

354
00:14:32,418 --> 00:14:35,118
I ask that you show
mercy on him.

355
00:14:35,154 --> 00:14:37,854
Well, as the victim's mother,
I ask that you go to hell!

356
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:38,989
CHRIS: Where is
your daughter?

357
00:14:39,024 --> 00:14:40,557
Show her to us!

358
00:14:40,592 --> 00:14:42,993
Your Honor,
I have renounced my sinful past,

359
00:14:43,028 --> 00:14:44,861
and have been washed
in the blood

360
00:14:44,897 --> 00:14:47,164
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

361
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,199
You what?!

362
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:49,399
I have seen
the righteous path

363
00:14:49,435 --> 00:14:50,834
of our Savior,
and ask that you

364
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:52,469
not sentence my son to jail,

365
00:14:52,504 --> 00:14:55,238
but instead release him
to my custody so that I,

366
00:14:55,274 --> 00:14:58,708
with God's guidance,
can rehabilitate him.

367
00:14:58,744 --> 00:15:01,144
Wow, Quagmire's mom is
a Jesus freak.

368
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,813
I haven't been
this surprised since we went

369
00:15:02,848 --> 00:15:04,815
to that restaurant
on my birthday.

370
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,451
All right, guys, let's pay
the check and get out of here.

371
00:15:07,486 --> 00:15:09,920
♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪

372
00:15:09,955 --> 00:15:11,321

373
00:15:11,356 --> 00:15:13,957
♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪

374
00:15:13,992 --> 00:15:17,327

♪ Happy Birthday to you. ♪

376
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:24,434
Aren't you gonna blow out
your candles, Peter?

377
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,770
Mom, I think something's
wrong with Dad.

378
00:15:26,805 --> 00:15:29,473
Peter? Peter?!

379
00:15:29,508 --> 00:15:31,308
Oh, my God! Help!

380
00:15:31,343 --> 00:15:33,076
Someone call 911!

381
00:15:33,111 --> 00:15:34,244
It's okay, ma'am.

382
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:36,680
This happens here at
Bennigan's all the time.

383
00:15:40,118 --> 00:15:41,718
How long does this last?

384
00:15:41,753 --> 00:15:42,919
Hard to say.

385
00:15:42,955 --> 00:15:44,955
It's best to just move on.

386
00:15:52,731 --> 00:15:55,265
I'm sorry, Mrs. Quagmire,
but my sentence stands.

387
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,867
20 years.

388
00:15:56,902 --> 00:15:58,768
Mr. Quagmire,
I'll give you 24 hours

389
00:15:58,804 --> 00:16:00,136
to get your affairs in order.

390
00:16:00,172 --> 00:16:02,072
Oh, my God.

391
00:16:02,107 --> 00:16:03,507
Ah, don't think
of it as 20 years.

392
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:04,941
Think of it
as two ten-year-olds,

393
00:16:04,977 --> 00:16:06,743
you sick freak.

394
00:16:10,115 --> 00:16:12,916
God, 20 years.

395
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:14,784
I know this is
a hard time for you,

396
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,586
but you need
to seek forgiveness.

397
00:16:16,622 --> 00:16:18,622
You need to kneel before Jesus.

398
00:16:18,657 --> 00:16:20,457
Oh, he's gonna be kneeling
in front of a lot of guys,

399
00:16:20,492 --> 00:16:22,092
but I doubt
he'll catch their names.

400
00:16:22,127 --> 00:16:24,528
It's usually somebody pushing
your skull in the dark.

401
00:16:24,563 --> 00:16:26,229
There are really
no introductions.

402
00:16:26,265 --> 00:16:29,900
Remember, He is
inside you all the time.

403
00:16:29,935 --> 00:16:31,735
Oh, n-now she's
just setting me up.

404
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:32,936
Right?

405
00:16:32,971 --> 00:16:34,404
How dare you come in here

406
00:16:34,439 --> 00:16:35,739
and tell me to seek forgiveness!

407
00:16:35,774 --> 00:16:37,107
Where do you get off?!

408
00:16:37,142 --> 00:16:38,408
Pretty much
everywhere, I hear.

409
00:16:38,443 --> 00:16:40,610
Fat man's right--
they're making this easy.

410
00:16:40,646 --> 00:16:43,213
You've never apologized once
for the way you raised me!

411
00:16:43,248 --> 00:16:45,248
You're the one who
made me what I am!

412
00:16:45,284 --> 00:16:47,017
Oh, come on, Quagmire,
you're a grown man,

413
00:16:47,052 --> 00:16:48,752
responsible for his own choices.

414
00:16:48,787 --> 00:16:51,488
Seems kind of cowardly to blame
someone else for your problems.

415
00:16:51,523 --> 00:16:53,823
Brian abandoned
his own son, by the way.

416
00:16:53,859 --> 00:16:55,926
Why are you, of all people,
defending a religious nut?

417
00:16:55,961 --> 00:16:57,460
Aren't you an atheist?

418
00:16:57,496 --> 00:16:58,695
Yeah, it's crazy.

419
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,697
You can think about that
while you're in jail.

420
00:17:00,732 --> 00:17:02,098
Glenn, we're not
going to get anywhere

421
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,767
questioning God's wisdom.

422
00:17:03,802 --> 00:17:06,102
He has a plan for everything.

423
00:17:06,138 --> 00:17:07,671
Oh, now I get it.

424
00:17:07,706 --> 00:17:09,205
That's why you found God.

425
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:11,575
So you can absolve yourself
of any responsibility

426
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,443
and answer everything
with empty platitudes.

427
00:17:13,478 --> 00:17:14,911
Face it, you're a worse parent

428
00:17:14,947 --> 00:17:17,247
than Brad Pitt
and Angelina Jolie.

429
00:17:17,282 --> 00:17:19,449
I'm concerned about Pax,
Maddox, and Shiloh.

430
00:17:19,484 --> 00:17:21,585
They're having
trouble adapting.

431
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,587
They've been raised
with 11 languages,

432
00:17:23,622 --> 00:17:25,422
and really don't speak any.

433
00:17:25,457 --> 00:17:26,923
I hear you, Doctor.

434
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,859
So... you're saying we should
give them all faux-hawks?

435
00:17:29,895 --> 00:17:32,228
No. I think they need
intensive therapy.

436
00:17:32,264 --> 00:17:34,164
Let me see if I understand you.

437
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:36,533
Even shorter on the sides?

438
00:17:36,568 --> 00:17:37,767
Don't you see?

439
00:17:37,803 --> 00:17:40,337
This is your chance to open
your heart and let God in.

440
00:17:40,372 --> 00:17:42,472
I know this jail sentence
seems long.

441
00:17:42,507 --> 00:17:45,542
But salvation can
last all eternity.

442
00:17:45,577 --> 00:17:47,143
You know what else
lasts an eternity?

443
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:49,212
This conversation.

444
00:17:49,247 --> 00:17:51,615
And maybe through our shared
relationship with the Lord,

445
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,485
we can begin to build
a bond as mother and son.

446
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,720
"Mother and son"?!

447
00:17:56,755 --> 00:17:58,555
Mothers love their children!

448
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,223
They nurture them
and protect them!

449
00:18:00,258 --> 00:18:01,858
You've never done
a thing for me!

450
00:18:01,893 --> 00:18:03,360
I'd rather rot in
jail than sit here

451
00:18:03,395 --> 00:18:05,061
and listen to all your crap!

452
00:18:05,097 --> 00:18:06,496
(door opens, closes)

453
00:18:06,531 --> 00:18:08,131
(sighs)
Glenn's right.

454
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,599
I was never there for him.

455
00:18:09,635 --> 00:18:11,868
I've got to find
some way to fix this.

456
00:18:11,903 --> 00:18:13,803
Did you hear about
your ex-husband yet?

457
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:16,940
He had a... uh, procedure.

458
00:18:23,982 --> 00:18:26,549
You know, some families take
their baby to the zoo.

459
00:18:26,585 --> 00:18:29,119
That's also a fun activity.

460
00:18:29,154 --> 00:18:30,954
I'm really gonna
miss all you guys.

461
00:18:30,989 --> 00:18:33,690
And I'll think of you whenever
I choke on a link sausage.

462
00:18:33,725 --> 00:18:34,791
Take care, buddy.

463
00:18:35,894 --> 00:18:37,994
(engine revs, tires screech)
Oh, yeah!

464
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,296
Fresh air! Freedom!

465
00:18:40,332 --> 00:18:41,998
Peter, while I'm away,

466
00:18:42,034 --> 00:18:45,035
I want you to hold onto my
antique, gold Rolex watch.

467
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,970
Oh cool, a throwing watch!

468
00:18:47,005 --> 00:18:48,005
No, no, Peter, it--

469
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,439
and I cannot stress
this enough--

470
00:18:49,474 --> 00:18:51,374
it is not a throwing watch.

471
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,410
Oh, I hear you, Quagmire.

472
00:18:55,013 --> 00:18:57,313
It didn't come back,
like you said it would.

473
00:18:57,349 --> 00:18:58,381
(sighs)

474
00:18:58,417 --> 00:18:59,916
And-and Joe, you
sure you don't mind

475
00:18:59,951 --> 00:19:01,217
taking care of my cat?

476
00:19:01,253 --> 00:19:02,819
Oh, no, all taken care of.

477
00:19:02,854 --> 00:19:04,287
Brought her
to the pound this morning.

478
00:19:04,322 --> 00:19:05,355
She went peacefully.

479
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,690
What?! No!

480
00:19:06,725 --> 00:19:09,125
I-I-I meant, take care of
her, like, look after her!

481
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:11,561
Well, that seems like
a note for this morning.

482
00:19:11,596 --> 00:19:14,097
You know, maybe I won't miss
you people as much as I thought.

483
00:19:14,132 --> 00:19:15,965
Do you have anything
for me, Glenn?

484
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:17,767
What? No! Wha-what?!

485
00:19:17,803 --> 00:19:19,502
I just found out my cat died!

486
00:19:19,538 --> 00:19:22,072
Hmm. I can't help but think
this selfish attitude

487
00:19:22,107 --> 00:19:24,574
is part of what got you here.

488
00:19:24,609 --> 00:19:26,342
Good-bye, Glenn. Be strong.

489
00:19:26,378 --> 00:19:29,512
We'll keep you in our thoughts.

490
00:19:29,548 --> 00:19:31,481
Oh, y-you better get rid of that

491
00:19:31,516 --> 00:19:33,116
before you get in there.

492
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:34,384
All right.

493
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:35,452
Good-bye, everybody.

494
00:19:35,487 --> 00:19:37,287
And-and don't worry about me.

495
00:19:37,322 --> 00:19:38,588
I-I'll see you real soon.

496
00:19:41,893 --> 00:19:43,626
Hey, you guys take good care

497
00:19:43,662 --> 00:19:45,762
of my child rapist friend!

498
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,100
(tires screech)

499
00:19:49,134 --> 00:19:50,834
Mr. Quagmire, wait!

500
00:19:50,869 --> 00:19:52,168
Judge?!

501
00:19:52,204 --> 00:19:53,470
What are you doing here?

502
00:19:53,505 --> 00:19:55,265
I wanted to tell you
the good news in person.

503
00:19:55,273 --> 00:19:57,107
Your sentence
has been commuted.

504
00:19:57,142 --> 00:19:59,876
You will not be serving
prison time after all.

505
00:19:59,911 --> 00:20:01,344
You got a good body, man.

506
00:20:01,379 --> 00:20:02,979
Why do you hide it
under that robe?

507
00:20:03,014 --> 00:20:04,380
"Commuted"?

508
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:05,648
I don't understand.

509
00:20:05,684 --> 00:20:07,784
Hello, Glenn.

510
00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:08,952
Mom?!

511
00:20:08,987 --> 00:20:10,386
What's going on here?

512
00:20:10,422 --> 00:20:12,355
By the way, Your Honor,
your fly is down.

513
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:16,126
Well, let's just say some
new DNA evidence was produced.

514
00:20:16,161 --> 00:20:17,827
And an impressive amount,
I'd say.

515
00:20:17,863 --> 00:20:20,096
PETER:
Guy takes care of himself.

516
00:20:20,132 --> 00:20:21,531
Anyway, you're free to go.

517
00:20:21,566 --> 00:20:23,700
You... you're kidding!

518
00:20:23,735 --> 00:20:25,535
Mom... Di-did you...?

519
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:26,903
Yep. Twice.

520
00:20:26,938 --> 00:20:28,671
But I-I thought you
were Christian now.

521
00:20:28,707 --> 00:20:32,509
Helping my son is the most
Christian thing I could do.

522
00:20:32,544 --> 00:20:34,911
You were right, Glenn.
I was a terrible mother.

523
00:20:34,946 --> 00:20:36,944
I wasn't there for you
when I should've been.

524
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:40,204
But I'd love a second chance.

525
00:20:41,212 --> 00:20:42,574
I'd like that.

526
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:43,991
I'd like that very much.

527
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:48,692

528
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:52,414
Aw, Quagmire got away with it,
and learned nothing.

529
00:20:52,415 --> 00:20:54,549
That's great.
