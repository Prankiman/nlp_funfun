<i>Family Guy
Bill and Peter's Bogus Journey</i>

2
00:00:35,233 --> 00:00:38,029
This was such a great idea
for a weekend activity.

3
00:00:38,044 --> 00:00:40,010
Well, I thought it'd be good
to get out of the house.

4
00:00:40,021 --> 00:00:42,445
I don't like the kids being
around that racist sunflower

5
00:00:42,454 --> 00:00:43,689
that's growing in our yard.

6
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:45,418
Hey, boy,

7
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:48,793
- don't you come walking by this house.
- You're ignorant.

8
00:00:52,226 --> 00:00:53,700
Hey, Mr. Eel.

9
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,126
You're slippery.

10
00:00:55,184 --> 00:00:56,953
Oops, got away.

11
00:00:57,838 --> 00:00:59,843
Left my hand smelling funny.

12
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:02,321
Come here, Jesse. Smell my finger.

13
00:01:09,728 --> 00:01:12,203
Today was a good day.

14
00:01:13,248 --> 00:01:17,460
Hey, look, kids, it's a recreation
of the lost city of New Orleans.

15
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:26,843
Dad, was there ever a
real city of New Orleans?

16
00:01:26,868 --> 00:01:29,533
No one knows, Chris. No one knows.

17
00:01:32,857 --> 00:01:34,920
Hey, Brian, look, I'm a stripper.

18
00:01:34,955 --> 00:01:36,793
I'm working my way through college.

19
00:01:36,816 --> 00:01:39,163
I should be more reluctant
to take my clothes off,

20
00:01:39,186 --> 00:01:42,153
but I'm not because my stepfather
had boundary issues.

21
00:01:44,025 --> 00:01:45,813
Hey, there, Mr. Octopus.

22
00:01:45,838 --> 00:01:48,652
I see you got two eyes but not much else.

23
00:01:48,717 --> 00:01:50,181
We can fix that.

24
00:01:50,407 --> 00:01:53,831
Let's give you a nice tweedlie
little mustache here.

25
00:01:53,917 --> 00:01:57,341
And maybe a big ol' dumb
guy smiley mouth.

26
00:01:57,377 --> 00:01:59,610
And a couple of eyebrows
with one raised up

27
00:01:59,636 --> 00:02:01,391
like you're saying, "Say what?"

28
00:02:01,436 --> 00:02:03,781
Oh. Look who's got pimples.

29
00:02:03,815 --> 00:02:06,020
And right before the big dance.

30
00:02:09,048 --> 00:02:11,452
It's so sucky and squeezy!

31
00:02:11,485 --> 00:02:12,522
I'll handle this.

32
00:02:12,557 --> 00:02:15,111
I've tangled with the
likes of these before.

33
00:02:20,126 --> 00:02:22,743
Wow, that was awesome, Mr. Seamus.

34
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:25,760
Ah, it was nothing. That's how
I caught old Woody over there.

35
00:02:33,176 --> 00:02:36,391
In other news, former president
Bill Clinton was in town today

36
00:02:36,418 --> 00:02:39,782
to judge Quahog's annual
Miss Cankle USA contest.

37
00:02:43,027 --> 00:02:44,621
Now that's a cankle.

38
00:02:44,656 --> 00:02:47,681
Where does the calf fat end
and the ankle fat begin?

39
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,930
Who knows? That's the fun.

40
00:02:50,047 --> 00:02:52,371
Brian, what is this on my shoe?

41
00:02:52,396 --> 00:02:55,341
- My poop.
- That's right, and it's disgusting.

42
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:57,970
I am sick of you using the
front yard as your bathroom.

43
00:02:58,007 --> 00:03:00,771
It's time you learned to use
the toilet like everyone else.

44
00:03:00,837 --> 00:03:02,621
I'm going to sneeze,
I'm going to sneeze...

45
00:03:09,817 --> 00:03:11,461
Bye, Lois. I'm going to the gym.

46
00:03:11,498 --> 00:03:13,610
Okay, see ya la...
Wait. What?

47
00:03:13,648 --> 00:03:15,382
Since when do you go to the gym?

48
00:03:15,405 --> 00:03:17,852
Well, it's just that whole thing
at the aquarium made me realize

49
00:03:17,877 --> 00:03:19,263
I'm completely out of shape.

50
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:21,322
I mean, what if I run into
that octopus again?

51
00:03:21,355 --> 00:03:24,323
<i>- Peter, that's ridiculous.
- Ready for round two, man?</i>

52
00:03:24,508 --> 00:03:26,860
I got all day.
Hey, is that your wife?

53
00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:33,913
Hey, I didn't know you
guys work out here?

54
00:03:33,925 --> 00:03:35,171
Yeah, it's a weekly regiment.

55
00:03:35,196 --> 00:03:36,292
Come on, come on, Cleveland, push it.

56
00:03:36,306 --> 00:03:37,813
Come on, come on, push it, push it.

57
00:03:37,838 --> 00:03:39,432
Come on, it's all you,
it's all you, it's all...

58
00:03:39,448 --> 00:03:40,063
Hey.

59
00:03:40,248 --> 00:03:41,832
Glenn, Glenn, Glenn, Glenn...

60
00:03:42,946 --> 00:03:46,752
Will you guys quiet down?
I'm trying to concentrate on my cardio.

61
00:03:50,785 --> 00:03:52,670
Hey, you guys the trainers here?

62
00:03:52,685 --> 00:03:55,281
Why, look, Barnaby,
a new recreation enthusiast.

63
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:58,163
We'll start off your workout
with vigorous calisthenics

64
00:03:58,187 --> 00:04:00,731
executed in rhythmic time
with acetate pressings

65
00:04:00,735 --> 00:04:03,590
of the new musical craze called jazz.

66
00:04:04,068 --> 00:04:07,183
<i>Steak and eggs and eggs and steak</i>

67
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:10,052
<i>That's what you should have for breakfast</i>

68
00:04:10,066 --> 00:04:11,040
<i>Delicious</i>

69
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:14,153
<i>Steak and eggs and eggs and steak</i>

70
00:04:14,286 --> 00:04:16,980
<i>Just making sure you heard</i>

71
00:04:17,015 --> 00:04:18,260
<i>I got it.</i>

72
00:04:21,076 --> 00:04:23,780
- How do you think it works?
- I have no idea.

73
00:04:23,807 --> 00:04:26,101
Look, Lois told me I had
to start using the toilet

74
00:04:26,117 --> 00:04:27,710
and you're the one
who's had potty training, so

75
00:04:27,736 --> 00:04:29,651
- I'm counting on you to help me.
- All right.

76
00:04:29,675 --> 00:04:32,233
We're two intelligent guys,
we can figure this out.

77
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:35,542
What's that big back part?

78
00:04:35,555 --> 00:04:38,441
Maybe that's where the wizard
lives who operates this thing.

79
00:04:38,516 --> 00:04:40,600
It would be wise not to anger him.

80
00:04:40,627 --> 00:04:41,940
I wonder what this thing is for.

81
00:04:41,956 --> 00:04:43,972
Brian, be careful with that.
We don't know what it does.

82
00:04:44,315 --> 00:04:45,630
All right, here goes.

83
00:04:45,737 --> 00:04:48,442
Oh, God, oh, God, careful,
careful. Careful. Careful.

84
00:04:55,836 --> 00:04:57,152
Don't mind me, you guys.

85
00:04:57,176 --> 00:05:00,133
I'm just writing a letter
to my boyfriend.

86
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,030
"Dear, my boyfriend,"

87
00:05:02,056 --> 00:05:06,251
"Thank you for making out with me
recently on purpose. That was cool."

88
00:05:06,277 --> 00:05:09,981
"Those flowers that you totally
sent me were really pretty,"

89
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:12,250
"just like you said I am."

90
00:05:12,285 --> 00:05:13,531
"Love, Meg."

91
00:05:13,557 --> 00:05:17,451
Meg, you are so full of crap. You're
like those people who sit in Starbucks

92
00:05:17,465 --> 00:05:19,600
and publicly write on their laptops.

93
00:05:19,676 --> 00:05:21,723
Hey, getting some writing
done there, buddy?

94
00:05:21,737 --> 00:05:25,682
Yeah, setting up in public so everybody
can watch me type my big screenplay.

95
00:05:25,698 --> 00:05:28,362
Me, too. All real writers
need to be seen writing,

96
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:31,161
- otherwise, what's the point, right?
- You should totally write that down.

97
00:05:31,175 --> 00:05:32,593
Okay. Will you watch me?

98
00:05:32,746 --> 00:05:37,021
Hello, flabby, out-of-shape family.
Check out my bulging rippliness.

99
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:39,102
Peter, you've been to the gym once...

100
00:05:39,218 --> 00:05:40,682
for 15 minutes.

101
00:05:40,686 --> 00:05:42,940
And I'm 15 minutes stronger, Brian.

102
00:05:42,955 --> 00:05:45,140
I'd rip a phone book in half,
but for the life of me,

103
00:05:45,158 --> 00:05:47,300
I don't know anyone who uses
a phone book anymore.

104
00:05:47,318 --> 00:05:49,010
So I'll use Meg's laptop.

105
00:05:50,816 --> 00:05:52,592
Dad! What the hell?!

106
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:00,722
Look at him in that tank top.

107
00:06:00,746 --> 00:06:04,271
He looks more pathetic than John
Merrick when he went on Match.com.

108
00:06:04,988 --> 00:06:07,943
There's no way you're a size six.

109
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:12,162
I haven't felt this good in years.

110
00:06:12,176 --> 00:06:13,682
I feel like Arnold Schwarzenegger

111
00:06:13,687 --> 00:06:16,571
without the fruity accent and
the Pirates of the Caribbean wife.

112
00:06:19,097 --> 00:06:22,671
Excuse me, sir. Secret Service. I wonder
if we might ask for your assistance.

113
00:06:22,698 --> 00:06:25,560
- Yeah, what's the problem?
- We're with President Clinton's motorcade.

114
00:06:25,587 --> 00:06:28,063
It seems he blew a tire
in front of your house.

115
00:06:28,068 --> 00:06:29,860
Would you happen to have
a jack we could borrow?

116
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,021
You don't need a jack. I am a jack.

117
00:06:32,036 --> 00:06:33,672
Come on, I'll lift that thing for you.

118
00:06:35,115 --> 00:06:36,913
Hey, I appreciate your help, man.

119
00:06:36,935 --> 00:06:40,031
We're a little overloaded 'cause
I'm having a fat chick party back here.

120
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:43,863
All right, girls. I've turned off the AC.

121
00:06:43,887 --> 00:06:47,691
First one to have a bead of neck
sweat reach their butt crack wins.

122
00:06:47,736 --> 00:06:49,680
All right, boys,
now watch how this is done.

123
00:06:49,717 --> 00:06:52,283
The key is to put it all
in your groin and your back.

124
00:06:52,318 --> 00:06:54,551
Take your legs totally out
of the equation.

125
00:06:54,566 --> 00:06:57,582
Lift with your lower back
in a jerking, twisting motion.

126
00:06:58,646 --> 00:06:59,782
- Peter!
- My God!

127
00:06:59,807 --> 00:07:01,142
Call an ambulance!

128
00:07:01,165 --> 00:07:04,280
<i>All right, so which one of y'all
ain't got my herpes yet?</i>

129
00:07:07,325 --> 00:07:08,952
How's the hernia, Peter?

130
00:07:08,975 --> 00:07:10,980
You know what the
worst part of it is, Lois?

131
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:13,931
I thought I was just out of shape,
but that ain't it at all.

132
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,873
I got to face the fact that
I'm just getting old.

133
00:07:16,927 --> 00:07:18,052
Knock, knock.

134
00:07:18,077 --> 00:07:19,953
Mr. President, what are you doing here?

135
00:07:19,977 --> 00:07:22,933
Well, I felt so bad that Peter
hurt himself fixing my car,

136
00:07:22,957 --> 00:07:25,191
I wanted to stop by
and extend my good wishes.

137
00:07:25,307 --> 00:07:26,782
Whoa! Bill Clinton!

138
00:07:26,815 --> 00:07:29,430
Hey, can I get a picture
of you on my cell phone?

139
00:07:29,445 --> 00:07:30,243
Sure.

140
00:07:31,226 --> 00:07:33,012
You know where I got that nipple ring?

141
00:07:33,047 --> 00:07:35,770
Ol' Straddlin' Madeleine Albright
gave it to me.

142
00:07:35,943 --> 00:07:38,316
Say, you look like
you're pretty down, Peter.

143
00:07:38,484 --> 00:07:42,053
It's just that I'm starting to realize
I'm not as young as I used to be.

144
00:07:42,068 --> 00:07:42,993
I hear you.

145
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:46,611
After my bypass, I remember wondering
if it was all downhill from there.

146
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,801
But then I realized
it doesn't have to be.

147
00:07:48,816 --> 00:07:50,621
You're only as young as you feel.

148
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,900
I don't know, Reagan,
I wish I could believe that.

149
00:07:52,935 --> 00:07:54,581
I'm going to make you believe it.

150
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,360
When you get out of here,
I'm going to take you out

151
00:07:56,378 --> 00:07:58,133
and show you the time of your life.

152
00:07:58,148 --> 00:07:59,310
And by the time we're done,

153
00:07:59,325 --> 00:08:01,950
I promise you're going to feel
like a young man again.

154
00:08:01,965 --> 00:08:03,633
Well, if you really think it'll help.

155
00:08:03,677 --> 00:08:05,631
I sure do. Know what else will help?

156
00:08:05,645 --> 00:08:07,520
A little saxophone therapy.

157
00:08:33,755 --> 00:08:34,843
You can have me.

158
00:08:42,045 --> 00:08:42,892
What's that?

159
00:08:42,906 --> 00:08:46,330
Since I couldn't help you learn to use
the toilet, I found something that can.

160
00:08:46,367 --> 00:08:48,872
It's an instructional video
on toilet training.

161
00:08:48,997 --> 00:08:50,691
Hi, I'm Roy Scheider.

162
00:08:50,727 --> 00:08:53,212
And today we're going
to learn to use the potty.

163
00:08:53,258 --> 00:08:55,711
Folks, say hi to my pal Hungry Hank.

164
00:08:55,746 --> 00:08:58,590
- How's it going, Hank?
- I'm hungry for your poo.

165
00:08:58,626 --> 00:09:00,161
Don't make me starve.

166
00:09:03,646 --> 00:09:06,161
Remember, it's all about relaxing

167
00:09:06,196 --> 00:09:09,013
and letting your body do
what it does naturally.

168
00:09:11,427 --> 00:09:14,593
<i>Now, here's Susan St. James
to powder my ass.</i>

169
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,272
All right, Peter, we've got
a big day ahead of us.

170
00:09:17,296 --> 00:09:20,062
I'm going to show you that
age is just a state of mind.

171
00:09:20,076 --> 00:09:22,710
- Come on, hop in my limo.
- Wow, a limo!

172
00:09:22,748 --> 00:09:23,800
Shotgun!

173
00:09:28,388 --> 00:09:31,351
- Watch the screen, not your feet.
- Bill, shut up, I got it.

174
00:09:31,387 --> 00:09:32,741
<i>Number 32.</i>

175
00:09:32,778 --> 00:09:35,741
- Oh, no, our pizza's ready.
- Tag out, man, tag out.

176
00:09:35,888 --> 00:09:39,880
<i>I'm a Barbie girl in a Barbie world</i>

177
00:09:39,936 --> 00:09:43,232
<i>Wrapped in plastic, it's fantastic</i>

178
00:09:43,258 --> 00:09:45,253
<i>Come on, Barbie, let's go party...</i>

179
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,142
Oh, boy, this is going to be fun.

180
00:09:50,155 --> 00:09:52,053
I haven't made a crank call in years.

181
00:09:54,005 --> 00:09:55,521
Shh! Quiet, quiet. It's ringing.

182
00:09:55,607 --> 00:09:56,462
<i>Hello?</i>

183
00:09:56,485 --> 00:09:58,320
Hello, is this Linda Tripp?

184
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:59,180
<i>Yes.</i>

185
00:09:59,217 --> 00:10:01,942
You shouldn't have talked,
you stupid bitch! I hope you die!

186
00:10:03,358 --> 00:10:04,541
Boy, that, uh...

187
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:06,852
that wasn't really a crank call,
that was...

188
00:10:07,048 --> 00:10:09,352
- that was just unpleasant.
- Sorry about that.

189
00:10:09,396 --> 00:10:12,093
It's okay. You know what, Bill?
You were right.

190
00:10:12,138 --> 00:10:15,350
Ever since you and I have been
hanging out, I feel 20 years younger.

191
00:10:15,388 --> 00:10:17,403
You've completely changed my life.

192
00:10:17,435 --> 00:10:20,843
See, I told you, Peter,
age is just a state of mind.

193
00:10:20,858 --> 00:10:22,160
So what do you want to do next?

194
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,632
Go to Mars, dude.

195
00:10:28,238 --> 00:10:30,933
- Boy, I'm getting kind of hungry.
- Me, too.

196
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:32,851
Hey! Hey, pull over, man! Pull over!

197
00:10:35,837 --> 00:10:37,553
Dude, check it out!

198
00:10:37,885 --> 00:10:40,200
There's a pig behind that fence.

199
00:10:41,547 --> 00:10:43,233
Oh, yeah, I see it!

200
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:45,510
Dude, we could eat that pig!

201
00:10:45,548 --> 00:10:47,250
- What?
- Dude, come on!

202
00:10:47,288 --> 00:10:49,461
We could totally eat that pig.

203
00:10:49,577 --> 00:10:51,802
We could... we could do it,
man! We could!

204
00:10:51,828 --> 00:10:54,163
It would be so easy, man!
It would take, like a minute.

205
00:10:54,185 --> 00:10:56,521
Could it really be that fast?

206
00:10:56,558 --> 00:10:58,082
Peter, that pig...

207
00:10:58,106 --> 00:11:01,290
could be in our stomachs in,
like one minute, and then we could...

208
00:11:01,306 --> 00:11:03,560
and then... and then
we could do other stuff.

209
00:11:07,628 --> 00:11:09,390
All right. I'm starved. Let's do it.

210
00:11:14,248 --> 00:11:15,172
Who's there?!

211
00:11:15,218 --> 00:11:17,072
Aw, crap! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

212
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:20,512
Dog gone it!

213
00:11:20,538 --> 00:11:23,750
If he wanted a pig,
why didn't he just take my wife?

214
00:11:25,555 --> 00:11:28,741
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Conway Twitty.

215
00:11:37,227 --> 00:11:40,632
<i>There's no needin going over</i>

216
00:11:40,918 --> 00:11:43,940
<i>All the things that took me under...</i>

217
00:11:49,267 --> 00:11:50,710
Hello, old friend.

218
00:11:52,717 --> 00:11:55,181
- What the hell?!
- No! No!

219
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:58,810
You do not go on this lawn!
Brian, I've had enough of this.

220
00:11:58,845 --> 00:12:01,853
It's more disgusting than when
you gave me that Christmas gift.

221
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:04,750
Oh, what is it? A little birdie?

222
00:12:05,765 --> 00:12:07,793
Oh, my God! It's dead!

223
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:08,862
Brian!

224
00:12:10,158 --> 00:12:14,180
Oh, Brian, this is disgusting!
Oh, my God! Get it out of here!

225
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,802
I'm... I'm sorry. I thought...
I thought you'd like it.

226
00:12:16,825 --> 00:12:18,620
Brian, I love it!

227
00:12:18,726 --> 00:12:21,032
I'm going to call you Stickyhead.

228
00:12:21,268 --> 00:12:23,192
I love you, Stickyhead.

229
00:12:23,267 --> 00:12:26,722
Brian, if you're not going to use
the toilet, there's only one solution.

230
00:12:27,055 --> 00:12:30,510
Brian, did you know that Brad Pitt
is John Lithgow's nephew?

231
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:31,443
- He is?
- No.

232
00:12:31,455 --> 00:12:33,312
But doesn't that sound like
something that could be true?

233
00:12:33,328 --> 00:12:35,551
My God! You're wearing a diaper!

234
00:12:35,657 --> 00:12:38,031
- You look silly.
- Why? You wear a diaper.

235
00:12:38,056 --> 00:12:39,290
Yes, but I'm a baby.

236
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:40,692
People see my diaper, and they say :

237
00:12:40,707 --> 00:12:43,291
"Oh, how cute! I bet he
smells like baby powder."

238
00:12:43,307 --> 00:12:46,692
They see your diaper and think :
"Ew! That dog is sick. He must be dying."

239
00:12:46,698 --> 00:12:49,403
"I hope he doesn't leak on our carpet.
Why don't they just put him to sleep?"

240
00:12:49,426 --> 00:12:51,483
You know, at this point,
I'd probably welcome that.

241
00:12:51,508 --> 00:12:54,332
Oh, hey, come on, man.
You just got to get used to it.

242
00:12:54,355 --> 00:12:55,730
Hey, have you gone yet?

243
00:12:55,835 --> 00:12:57,300
Have you popped your butt cherry?

244
00:12:57,326 --> 00:12:59,782
You know, you should be more
sensitive to my humiliation.

245
00:12:59,807 --> 00:13:02,850
Remember how bad you felt when you
drew that picture for Peter and Lois?

246
00:13:03,036 --> 00:13:05,611
Oh, Stewie, it's wonderful!

247
00:13:05,647 --> 00:13:07,842
This is going right up on the fridge.

248
00:13:07,858 --> 00:13:09,323
Really?! The fridge?!

249
00:13:09,366 --> 00:13:12,321
It's like we have a little
Michelangelo in the house.

250
00:13:12,347 --> 00:13:14,391
Okay! See you guys later.

251
00:13:18,448 --> 00:13:21,160
I almost lost it when you said
to put it on the fridge.

252
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:24,500
I know! What the hell is this supposed
to be, a pelican or a school bus?

253
00:13:24,578 --> 00:13:26,661
Looks like Muhammad Ali drew this.

254
00:13:26,698 --> 00:13:29,073
What a dumbass! Hey, let's spit on it.

255
00:13:34,575 --> 00:13:35,582
Peter!

256
00:13:35,656 --> 00:13:36,881
Oh! Oh, Lois!

257
00:13:38,037 --> 00:13:39,561
Let me make you some coffee.

258
00:13:43,855 --> 00:13:46,992
<i>Oh, boy, a pig! Can we keep it?
Ow! It bit me!</i>

259
00:13:47,047 --> 00:13:49,413
What the hell did you
and Bill do last night?!

260
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:52,120
We lived, Lois. We lived our lives.

261
00:13:52,148 --> 00:13:55,672
Peter, that former President Clinton
is nothing but a bad influence!

262
00:13:55,686 --> 00:13:58,073
I forbid you to hang out
with him anymore.

263
00:13:58,097 --> 00:14:00,562
No way. Bill Clinton makes me feel young.

264
00:14:00,588 --> 00:14:02,701
Not like you, with your
Judd Hirsch sweater

265
00:14:02,715 --> 00:14:04,761
and your bag of Werther's Originals.

266
00:14:06,196 --> 00:14:10,050
If he won't listen, I'm just going to
have to go talk to Bill Clinton myself.

267
00:14:13,276 --> 00:14:15,973
Mr. President, I need to
have a word with you!

268
00:14:16,476 --> 00:14:20,131
Wow! You certainly are very persuasive.

269
00:14:20,155 --> 00:14:21,573
So I've been told.

270
00:14:21,597 --> 00:14:24,452
Hey, you want to give me that cigar.
I'm ready to smoke it now.

271
00:14:27,885 --> 00:14:31,841
What the hell was I thinking?
I-I don't know what came over me.

272
00:14:32,027 --> 00:14:34,023
Oh, God! What am I going to do?

273
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:35,853
Hey, Bill, you up for a little bowling?

274
00:14:35,866 --> 00:14:38,513
I swiped some money out of
Lois's purse. I don't think she'll notice

275
00:14:38,538 --> 00:14:41,032
because she's here humping you?!

276
00:14:41,488 --> 00:14:42,343
Peter!

277
00:14:42,376 --> 00:14:45,852
Look, I know this looks bad,
and I feel horrible, and

278
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:48,882
I know nothing I could say to
you could possibly justify

279
00:14:48,905 --> 00:14:50,831
why I slept with Bill except...

280
00:14:51,126 --> 00:14:57,051
I mean, Peter, the man presided over the
longest economic expansion in US history,

281
00:14:57,087 --> 00:15:00,740
and he reduced the percentage
of Americans on welfare

282
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:04,151
to its lowest level in 33 years.

283
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:07,021
- 35 years.
- 35 years, Peter.

284
00:15:07,058 --> 00:15:10,032
Well, well. I learned something today.

285
00:15:10,056 --> 00:15:13,192
Apparently, there's the side
of Bill Clinton the world knows,

286
00:15:13,218 --> 00:15:16,503
and then there's the dark,
sex-crazed side only I know.

287
00:15:16,537 --> 00:15:18,412
I'm so sorry, Peter.

288
00:15:18,446 --> 00:15:22,371
Lois, I think maybe it's better
if I stay at Quagmire's for a while.

289
00:15:22,408 --> 00:15:23,881
I understand.

290
00:15:23,915 --> 00:15:26,452
Hey, Lois, you up for
a little exit polling?

291
00:15:26,476 --> 00:15:27,542
Oh, God!

292
00:15:27,567 --> 00:15:29,743
I've been a worse wife
than Lorena Bobbitt

293
00:15:29,767 --> 00:15:31,502
when she was married to The Thing.

294
00:15:31,538 --> 00:15:33,471
Oh, my God! Where is it?!
Where did she throw it?!

295
00:15:33,497 --> 00:15:34,703
Oh, God! Oh, God!

296
00:15:34,745 --> 00:15:36,593
Is this what you're looking for?

297
00:15:38,858 --> 00:15:41,291
I can't believe Lois would cheat on me.

298
00:15:41,317 --> 00:15:44,021
Look, Peter, I know this is
a very difficult time for you,

299
00:15:44,045 --> 00:15:47,340
but I want you to know I'm here
for you if you need anything.

300
00:15:47,558 --> 00:15:50,230
Quagmire, I know your heart's
in the right place, but

301
00:15:50,235 --> 00:15:52,363
I need to sort this out for myself.

302
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:55,582
I haven't misjudged someone
this bad since my last physical.

303
00:15:55,685 --> 00:15:56,923
All right.

304
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:59,430
The doctor will be in in a few minutes.

305
00:16:00,848 --> 00:16:03,562
<i>Peter? Peter, are you in there? It's me.</i>

306
00:16:04,605 --> 00:16:06,072
What do you want?

307
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:09,551
Honey, I just feel awful
about this whole situation.

308
00:16:09,575 --> 00:16:13,392
But I think I've got a solution that
will make things right for both of us.

309
00:16:13,436 --> 00:16:15,043
- I'm listening.
- Well...

310
00:16:15,055 --> 00:16:18,062
the way I figure it, the only way
to even things out between us

311
00:16:18,076 --> 00:16:20,420
is if you have sex
with someone else, too.

312
00:16:20,468 --> 00:16:21,383
You...

313
00:16:21,578 --> 00:16:24,680
- want to get me laid?
- Yes, Peter.

314
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:28,050
- Because I don't want to lose you.
- Well, it would make us even.

315
00:16:28,097 --> 00:16:30,101
All right, Lois, if you
really think it'll work.

316
00:16:30,116 --> 00:16:32,921
Trust me. It'll work better
than the first telephone.

317
00:16:32,968 --> 00:16:35,870
Well, we did it, Watson.
What an afternoon.

318
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:38,192
We've finally perfected
the first telephone.

319
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,271
Yeah. Uh...

320
00:16:39,338 --> 00:16:42,111
Hey, listen, somebody
called me today. Uh...

321
00:16:42,138 --> 00:16:43,772
Whoever it was said some

322
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:47,432
very sexual things.
Some very angry, sexual things.

323
00:16:47,485 --> 00:16:48,713
Oh, really?

324
00:16:48,755 --> 00:16:51,543
Probably just some teenagers
somewhere. Damn them.

325
00:16:51,748 --> 00:16:54,831
Well, that's the thing. I mean,
there's only two phones in the...

326
00:16:54,887 --> 00:16:56,763
well, in the world, and

327
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:59,633
one of them is in my office,
and the other's in your office, and

328
00:16:59,668 --> 00:17:02,500
those two didn't even exist
until about a few hours ago.

329
00:17:03,068 --> 00:17:05,912
Yikes! I could use a
distraction right now.

330
00:17:05,966 --> 00:17:08,630
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Conway Twitty.

331
00:17:15,485 --> 00:17:19,580
<i>I can almost hear the stillness</i>

332
00:17:19,737 --> 00:17:25,012
<i>As it yields to the sound
of your heart beating</i>

333
00:17:31,036 --> 00:17:34,630
All right, Peter, who's it going to be?
Who do you want to sleep with?

334
00:17:34,658 --> 00:17:37,143
Who we kidding, Lois?
This is never going to work.

335
00:17:37,165 --> 00:17:40,533
- Let's just forget the whole thing.
- No, honey, it's got to work.

336
00:17:40,555 --> 00:17:43,062
Just pick somebody,
and I'll make it happen.

337
00:17:43,085 --> 00:17:45,013
Deep down, in your heart of hearts,

338
00:17:45,035 --> 00:17:47,363
if it could be anyone in the
world, who would it be?

339
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,442
Halle Berry? Ann-Margret?

340
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,471
- Anybody I want?
- Anybody.

341
00:17:51,495 --> 00:17:53,051
Don't be afraid to tell me.

342
00:17:53,087 --> 00:17:54,041
Babs.

343
00:17:54,475 --> 00:17:56,283
- My mother?
- Yeah.

344
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:58,492
Why?

345
00:17:58,515 --> 00:18:01,563
It was my understanding that
there would be no questions asked.

346
00:18:01,588 --> 00:18:03,700
I'm just curious. It's a little weird.

347
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:05,102
Look, you know what? She's hot.

348
00:18:05,146 --> 00:18:06,271
Guilty, all right?

349
00:18:06,636 --> 00:18:08,781
I haven't been so struck
by a woman's beauty

350
00:18:08,807 --> 00:18:12,312
since I was Uma Thurman's
eye-wrangler on the set of Pulp Fiction.

351
00:18:13,378 --> 00:18:15,753
No. You can't promise
something like that.

352
00:18:15,826 --> 00:18:17,921
I have no idea what
you're going to say to me.

353
00:18:17,947 --> 00:18:20,150
So you can go ahead and
say what you're going to say,

354
00:18:20,175 --> 00:18:22,512
and my natural response
could be to get offended.

355
00:18:22,538 --> 00:18:25,251
Then, through no fault of my own,
I wouldn't have kept my promise.

356
00:18:25,265 --> 00:18:26,111
<i>Hang on!</i>

357
00:18:28,836 --> 00:18:29,600
<i>Okay!</i>

358
00:18:32,185 --> 00:18:35,411
Well, Lois, this is an
unexpected surprise.

359
00:18:35,428 --> 00:18:37,683
You and Peter should drop by more often.

360
00:18:37,706 --> 00:18:41,441
Well, we were in the neighborhood,
and Peter said, "Let's stop in."

361
00:18:41,478 --> 00:18:43,993
- Wasn't that thoughtful?
- Will you people quiet down?

362
00:18:44,008 --> 00:18:45,482
I'm trying to watch Medium.

363
00:18:45,528 --> 00:18:49,312
You know what? Daddy's right. Let's
go upstairs where we won't bother him.

364
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:50,301
Good.

365
00:18:50,635 --> 00:18:52,742
All right. Go, Medium!

366
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:55,951
Wish I could talk to ghosts.
That would be sweet!

367
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:58,640
Mom, could we sit down for a second?

368
00:18:58,678 --> 00:19:01,560
- I have to ask you something.
- What is it, Lois?

369
00:19:01,605 --> 00:19:06,133
Well, Peter and I have hit a snag in our
marriage. I won't go with the details.

370
00:19:06,256 --> 00:19:10,441
But it turns out that the only way
to make things right seems to be...

371
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,333
It... it's, uh... Oh, boy.

372
00:19:13,468 --> 00:19:15,321
What's the best way to say this?

373
00:19:15,886 --> 00:19:17,382
Um... Mom...

374
00:19:18,027 --> 00:19:19,853
Would you have sex with Peter?

375
00:19:20,027 --> 00:19:21,973
- Of course, dear.
- Really?

376
00:19:22,048 --> 00:19:24,542
Carter's been most insufferable lately,

377
00:19:24,557 --> 00:19:26,550
and this would just stick in his craw.

378
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:29,510
I like your freaky spirit,
but it's your craw I'm after.

379
00:19:29,757 --> 00:19:33,333
- I didn't think you'd be so receptive.
- Are you kidding, Lois?

380
00:19:33,377 --> 00:19:35,371
I'm physically starved.

381
00:19:35,406 --> 00:19:37,731
Your father's utterly lost interest.

382
00:19:37,768 --> 00:19:40,370
He won't even look me in
the back of the head anymore.

383
00:19:40,396 --> 00:19:41,433
I see.

384
00:19:41,467 --> 00:19:43,732
Well, I guess we're good to go then.

385
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,851
Peter, are you sure
this is what you want?

386
00:19:45,906 --> 00:19:47,111
Yeah. I'll see you at home.

387
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,602
<i>Lois, wait!</i>

388
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,812
I can't do it!
I can't go through with it!

389
00:19:58,828 --> 00:20:01,573
You have to, Peter,
for the sake of our marriage!

390
00:20:01,597 --> 00:20:03,643
Screw our marriage! I love you!

391
00:20:03,665 --> 00:20:05,280
- Really?
- Absolutely.

392
00:20:05,308 --> 00:20:08,643
And I don't care that you slept with
Clinton. We'll get past it somehow.

393
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,002
All I know is,

394
00:20:10,038 --> 00:20:12,312
I don't want to do anything to hurt you.

395
00:20:12,358 --> 00:20:13,841
Oh, Peter!

396
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:18,360
- Why are you naked in my house?
- Uh...

397
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:20,913
Why aren't you?

398
00:20:22,017 --> 00:20:23,641
You're all right, Griffin.

399
00:20:26,548 --> 00:20:29,962
Well, Peter, our marriage has
suffered a serious trial, but

400
00:20:29,987 --> 00:20:32,642
- I think we can get through it.
- Me, too, Lois.

401
00:20:32,668 --> 00:20:34,330
It's just going to take a little work.

402
00:20:34,346 --> 00:20:36,911
In the meantime, I guess I better
clear the air with Clinton.

403
00:20:38,415 --> 00:20:41,331
Hey, listen, Bill, uh...
you and I need to have a talk.

404
00:20:41,686 --> 00:20:44,541
Boy, you are good. You are really good.

405
00:20:52,597 --> 00:20:56,653
Well, look at you, using the toilet.
I am so proud of you.

406
00:20:56,868 --> 00:20:59,692
Well, you deserve all the praise
for encouraging me to do it.

407
00:20:59,706 --> 00:21:01,852
Well, still, good for you.

408
00:21:02,415 --> 00:21:04,380
So where are you really
doing your business?

409
00:21:04,405 --> 00:21:05,781
Oh, I found a place.

410
00:21:07,805 --> 00:21:09,300
Well, I'll be damned.

411
00:21:09,326 --> 00:21:10,882
And they called me crazy.

412
00:21:10,907 --> 00:21:13,530
You can't plant sausage seeds, they said.

413
00:21:13,555 --> 00:21:15,211
Well, look at this!
