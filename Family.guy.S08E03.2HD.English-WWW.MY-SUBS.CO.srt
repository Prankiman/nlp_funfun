11
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:38,833
- Morning, Peter.
- Morning, Lois.

12
00:00:38,901 --> 00:00:39,868
You using the bathroom?

13
00:00:39,935 --> 00:00:40,835
Yeah. Why?

14
00:00:40,903 --> 00:00:42,170
I was just curious.

15
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:44,072
Before you go,
I wanna ask you a question.

16
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,340
Is there something
on my elbow?

17
00:00:45,408 --> 00:00:46,808
Me first,
me first, me first!

18
00:00:52,181 --> 00:00:53,381
Peter, I'm going first.

19
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:54,549
Oh, no, you don't!

20
00:00:54,617 --> 00:00:57,052
- Move your ass, Peter!
- You move yours!

21
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:58,653
I made reservations
with the maitre d'.

22
00:00:58,721 --> 00:01:00,021
Isn't that right, Cornelius?

23
00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:01,589
Lois Griffin,
poop for one.

24
00:01:01,657 --> 00:01:02,991
I also need a poop.

25
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,426
Do you have a reservation, sir?

26
00:01:04,493 --> 00:01:05,994
Yeah, I called a couple days ago.

27
00:01:06,062 --> 00:01:07,195
Who did you speak to?

28
00:01:07,263 --> 00:01:10,131
Dave... ald... Jeff

29
00:01:10,199 --> 00:01:13,668
illiam... tonio?

30
00:01:13,736 --> 00:01:15,904
Davaldjeffilliamtonio
hasn't worked here for four years.

31
00:01:15,971 --> 00:01:19,240
Ah, the hell with you.
I'll use the other bathroom.

32
00:01:19,308 --> 00:01:21,509
Somebody's in here.

33
00:01:21,577 --> 00:01:24,379
Oh, excuse me.

34
00:01:24,447 --> 00:01:26,181
Good morning.

35
00:01:26,248 --> 00:01:28,983
Lois, since when does
an elephant live here?

36
00:01:29,051 --> 00:01:31,653
He's an exchange student.
Don't you remember?

37
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:33,021
Oh, that's right.

38
00:01:33,089 --> 00:01:34,522
Don't you feel foolish?

39
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,224
Well, how long
does it usually take you?

40
00:01:36,292 --> 00:01:37,392
I don't remember.

41
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,493
Oh, my God,

42
00:01:38,561 --> 00:01:39,894
that is such
a bunch of crap.

43
00:01:39,962 --> 00:01:42,330
I hope my son is having
a better time with your family.

44
00:01:42,398 --> 00:01:44,466
Poachers!

45
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:52,440
Joe, I need
to use your bathroom.

46
00:01:52,508 --> 00:01:53,575
Sure, Peter.

47
00:01:56,412 --> 00:01:57,946
What the hell?

48
00:01:58,013 --> 00:01:59,881
How do you even?

49
00:01:59,949 --> 00:02:01,716
Wha...? It...

50
00:02:01,784 --> 00:02:03,418
I... I don't...

51
00:02:03,486 --> 00:02:04,986
Wait. How do I...?

52
00:02:05,054 --> 00:02:06,254
Uh, yeah,
that's gonna be

53
00:02:06,322 --> 00:02:07,756
way too complicated for ya.

54
00:02:07,823 --> 00:02:09,190
How come there are two toilets?

55
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:11,493
The other one's for blood.

56
00:02:16,198 --> 00:02:18,633
Cleveland's old house.
Perfect!

57
00:02:20,503 --> 00:02:22,404
Damn, no toilet paper.

58
00:02:23,472 --> 00:02:24,906
Hey, Joe, can I borrow this?

59
00:02:24,974 --> 00:02:26,274
Sure.

60
00:02:32,748 --> 00:02:34,215
Peter, where have you been?

61
00:02:34,283 --> 00:02:36,684
Oh, let's just say I've been

62
00:02:36,752 --> 00:02:38,286
at Cleveland's empty house
taking a dump.

63
00:02:38,354 --> 00:02:39,954
Ugh! That's disgusting!

64
00:02:40,022 --> 00:02:42,857
I will be taking all of
my movements there from now on.

65
00:02:42,925 --> 00:02:45,493
All of 'em!
Brrreeee-ha-ha!

Peter,
your breakfast is ready.

73
00:03:08,484 --> 00:03:09,984
Hang on.
I'll be right back, Lois.

74
00:03:10,052 --> 00:03:11,820
I'm just going across the street.

75
00:03:11,887 --> 00:03:13,588
Peter, you can't keep
using Cleveland's bathroom.

76
00:03:13,656 --> 00:03:15,256
Oh, my God!
Yes, I can!

77
00:03:15,324 --> 00:03:17,292
Cleveland's bathroom
is the greatest discovery

78
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:19,360
since fat women
discovered Diet Coke.

79
00:03:21,197 --> 00:03:22,931
Now I can eat anything!

80
00:03:27,336 --> 00:03:29,237
Hey, hey, hey, no, no, no!
What are you doing?!

81
00:03:29,305 --> 00:03:30,338
That's my bathroom!

82
00:03:30,406 --> 00:03:31,372
What are you talking about?

83
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,941
We just rented this place.

84
00:03:33,008 --> 00:03:36,478
Holy crap!
Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase!

85
00:03:36,545 --> 00:03:38,413
What the hell are you guys
doing in Quahog?

86
00:03:38,481 --> 00:03:40,782
Oh, we're just doing
research for a movie.

87
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,350
Oh, my God,
that's amazing!

88
00:03:42,418 --> 00:03:43,818
Listen, I gotta tell you guys,

89
00:03:43,886 --> 00:03:45,987
I've watched all your movies,
like, a thousand times.

90
00:03:46,055 --> 00:03:47,255
You saw <i>Cops and Robbersons</i>?

91
00:03:47,323 --> 00:03:48,957
And <i>My Stepmother is an Alien</i>?

92
00:03:49,024 --> 00:03:51,826
Almost all of 'em. Boy, I sure would
love it if you guys would come

93
00:03:51,894 --> 00:03:52,994
to our house
for dinner tonight.

94
00:03:53,062 --> 00:03:53,962
My wife's cooking sucks,

95
00:03:54,029 --> 00:03:55,763
but I just want to look at ya.

96
00:03:55,831 --> 00:03:57,298
- You like meatloaf?
- Uh, yeah, sure.

97
00:03:57,366 --> 00:03:58,900
All right,
see you at 8:00.

98
00:03:58,968 --> 00:04:00,835
Oh, man I can't believe
I'm gonna have dinner

99
00:04:00,903 --> 00:04:02,237
with two of the three amigos.

100
00:04:02,304 --> 00:04:04,038
This is gonna be way better

101
00:04:04,106 --> 00:04:06,474
than when we had that Victorian
girl ghost over for dinner.

102
00:04:07,643 --> 00:04:10,044
My governess
drowned me in a well.

103
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,947
You are a horrible dinner guest.

104
00:04:17,953 --> 00:04:19,354
Can you believe it?

105
00:04:19,421 --> 00:04:21,389
We're eating with two
of the three Ghostbusters.

106
00:04:21,457 --> 00:04:23,024
Actually,
I wasn't in that.

107
00:04:23,092 --> 00:04:25,193
Look at these guys,
they can't take a compliment.

108
00:04:25,261 --> 00:04:26,895
You know, you guys are funny,

109
00:04:26,962 --> 00:04:28,897
but, uh,
I got a confession to make.

110
00:04:28,964 --> 00:04:30,632
I'm a pretty funny guy myself.

111
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:33,401
Maybe I say a few things here,
maybe I get a few laughs.

112
00:04:33,469 --> 00:04:35,537
Maybe you guys put me
in one of your pictures.

113
00:04:35,604 --> 00:04:38,072
Uh, well, uh, yeah,
I suppose it's possible.

114
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,008
Yeah, we got all kinds
of roles available.

115
00:04:40,075 --> 00:04:41,042
Speaking roles,
background roles.

116
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,510
Background would be
good for you.

117
00:04:42,578 --> 00:04:43,878
Ooh, yeah.
Speaking role or background role.

118
00:04:43,946 --> 00:04:45,079
Either one would be good.

119
00:04:45,147 --> 00:04:46,681
You know,
I'm really good at sight gags.

120
00:04:46,749 --> 00:04:49,250
Oh, I didn't mean to do that.

121
00:04:49,318 --> 00:04:51,319
Now it's everywhere!

122
00:04:51,387 --> 00:04:52,887
That's comedy.

123
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,391
Peter, what the hell is wrong with you?
That's not funny.

124
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,026
Oh, well,
interesting opinion, Lois.

125
00:04:58,093 --> 00:05:00,194
Gee, I wonder if there's
anyone else at this table

126
00:05:00,262 --> 00:05:01,296
who's maybe more qualified

127
00:05:01,363 --> 00:05:02,797
to say what's funny
than you are?

128
00:05:02,865 --> 00:05:04,933
Well, we'd need to see
a little bit more,

129
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,135
but, uh...
is that the time?

130
00:05:07,202 --> 00:05:09,270
I can't believe that's the time.
It's late.

131
00:05:09,338 --> 00:05:11,406
I don't understand.
You're not wearing a watch.

132
00:05:11,473 --> 00:05:13,908
You see,
that's sort of a joke, Peter.

133
00:05:13,976 --> 00:05:16,077
Oh. Well,
that's not that funny.

134
00:05:16,145 --> 00:05:17,645
It's kind of funny,
you know.

135
00:05:17,713 --> 00:05:18,846
No, it's not funny.

136
00:05:18,914 --> 00:05:20,214
See, if you had said
something like,

137
00:05:20,282 --> 00:05:21,482
"Oh, it's half past
a freckle."

138
00:05:22,952 --> 00:05:25,853
Oh, you know,
I'm thinking of the three of you.

139
00:05:25,921 --> 00:05:27,689
I'm... I'm thinking this guy...

140
00:05:27,756 --> 00:05:29,390
Let me show you
something that's funny.

141
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,892
Okay, here's an impression
of John Wayne

142
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,427
on the first Thanksgiving.

143
00:05:32,494 --> 00:05:33,761
I'm John Wayne

144
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:36,364
at the first
Thanksgiving, pilgrims.

145
00:05:36,432 --> 00:05:38,833
Happy Thanksgiving,
pilgrims.

146
00:05:40,369 --> 00:05:41,869
Where's this guy been?

147
00:05:41,937 --> 00:05:43,838
Well, Mr. Griffin,
this has been a lot of fun.

148
00:05:43,906 --> 00:05:46,474
- A lot of fun.
- But we gotta get back over to our place

149
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:49,010
and, uh, kinda do, uh...
What do we have to do?

150
00:05:49,078 --> 00:05:50,445
Roll some joints and get high.

151
00:05:50,512 --> 00:05:51,879
Yeah, we gotta do those things.

152
00:05:51,947 --> 00:05:53,014
That's not funny.

153
00:05:53,082 --> 00:05:54,949
Drugs aren't funny.
They ruin lives.

154
00:05:55,017 --> 00:05:55,950
Amen.

155
00:05:56,018 --> 00:05:56,985
No, Peter,

156
00:05:57,052 --> 00:05:58,086
you're not funny.

157
00:05:58,153 --> 00:05:58,820
I'm afraid Dan's right.

158
00:05:58,887 --> 00:05:59,754
You're not funny at all.

159
00:05:59,822 --> 00:06:01,089
I don't get it.

160
00:06:01,156 --> 00:06:02,624
You're painfully unfunny.

161
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:05,593
Get the (bleep)
out of my house!

162
00:06:09,098 --> 00:06:11,032
Hey, Stewie,
can I talk to you for a sec?

163
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,133
Look, Brian, I've colored

164
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:13,668
Sebastian the Crab blue.

165
00:06:13,736 --> 00:06:15,837
If that isn't a middle
finger to society,

166
00:06:15,904 --> 00:06:17,505
I don't know what is.

167
00:06:17,573 --> 00:06:19,207
Ew, I don't like it anymore.

168
00:06:19,274 --> 00:06:21,242
I wish I had colored him red.

169
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,844
Do you think it's a little odd

170
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:24,779
that Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd
have moved

171
00:06:24,847 --> 00:06:25,713
into Quahog together?

172
00:06:25,781 --> 00:06:27,248
I mean...
Why here, why now?

173
00:06:27,316 --> 00:06:28,383
I don't know.

174
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,018
Maybe we go over
there and find out.

175
00:06:30,085 --> 00:06:31,219
Maybe we do.

176
00:06:31,286 --> 00:06:32,587
Hey. Hi, there.

177
00:06:32,655 --> 00:06:36,224
Uh, can you guys tell Meg
I'm seeing someone?

178
00:06:38,761 --> 00:06:39,827
You see anything?

179
00:06:39,895 --> 00:06:41,329
Doesn't look like
anybody's home.

180
00:06:44,533 --> 00:06:47,535
Won't you gentleman
have a Pepsi?

181
00:06:56,478 --> 00:06:58,079
What do we do?

182
00:06:58,147 --> 00:07:01,616
"Won't you gentleman
have a Pepsi?"

183
00:07:10,893 --> 00:07:13,494
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!

184
00:07:13,562 --> 00:07:15,229
Yell, yell, yell,
yell, yell, yell.

185
00:07:23,172 --> 00:07:24,772
What the...?

186
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,507
What the hell is this place?

187
00:07:26,575 --> 00:07:28,142
Welcome to D.U.M.P.

188
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,411
Deep Underground
Military Protection Facility.

189
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,913
Wouldn't that be
D.U.M.P.F.?

190
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,648
The "f" is silent,
like in "knife."

191
00:07:33,716 --> 00:07:35,817
We're actually working
for the federal government

192
00:07:35,884 --> 00:07:37,151
and we need your help.

193
00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:39,020
Do you want to be spies like us?

194
00:07:39,088 --> 00:07:40,354
Can we be spies like them?

195
00:07:40,422 --> 00:07:43,057
We've actually resolved
our differences.

196
00:07:48,236 --> 00:07:49,603
Wait a minute,
I don't understand.

197
00:07:49,671 --> 00:07:51,605
What do you mean you guys
work for the government?

198
00:07:51,673 --> 00:07:53,174
Well, Brian,
it turns out <i>Spies Like Us</i>

199
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:55,242
was Ronald Reagan's
favorite movie.

200
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,111
So he actually appointed us
honorary spies

201
00:07:57,179 --> 00:07:58,712
back in the '80s.

202
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,614
That still doesn't explain
what you're doing here.

203
00:08:00,682 --> 00:08:02,416
You see, Brian,
during the Cold War

204
00:08:02,484 --> 00:08:04,952
the Soviet Union brainwashed
dozens of American civilians,

205
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,387
effectively making them
sleeper agents

206
00:08:06,454 --> 00:08:08,088
who could be activated
at any time

207
00:08:08,156 --> 00:08:09,590
to do the work of the KGB.

208
00:08:09,658 --> 00:08:10,624
Activated how?

209
00:08:10,692 --> 00:08:12,326
The agents could be activated

210
00:08:12,394 --> 00:08:14,028
by uttering
a predetermined phrase.

211
00:08:14,095 --> 00:08:15,996
At which point,
they would snap into a trance

212
00:08:16,064 --> 00:08:18,132
and mindlessly carry out
whatever orders they were given

213
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,833
by their KGB handlers.

214
00:08:19,901 --> 00:08:21,936
Well, I mean,
what if they encountered somebody

215
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:22,937
who said the phrase accidentally?

216
00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:24,004
Not possible.

217
00:08:24,072 --> 00:08:25,506
The activation phrase
was something

218
00:08:25,574 --> 00:08:27,641
- that no one would ever think to utter.
- What is it?

219
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:30,811
The phrase is, "Gosh,
that Italian family at the next table

220
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,446
sure is quiet."

221
00:08:32,514 --> 00:08:33,714
You see,
the U.S. government

222
00:08:33,782 --> 00:08:35,115
believes that one of these
sleeper agents

223
00:08:35,183 --> 00:08:36,417
is right here in Quahog.

224
00:08:36,484 --> 00:08:38,786
Now you two...
individuals live here.

225
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:40,221
Are there any local residents

226
00:08:40,288 --> 00:08:41,488
whom you've seen
acting strangely?

227
00:08:41,556 --> 00:08:42,890
Well, there's a pedophile
up the street

228
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,725
that nobody seems to be
doing anything about,

229
00:08:44,793 --> 00:08:46,227
but it's mainly because
he's so funny.

230
00:08:46,294 --> 00:08:48,896
Well, look, we'd be happy
to help in any way we can.

231
00:08:48,964 --> 00:08:50,598
Hey, is Ron Howard's
weird-looking brother

232
00:08:50,665 --> 00:08:52,099
one of these lab technicians?

233
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:54,001
Of course he is.
It's an '80s movie.

234
00:08:54,069 --> 00:08:56,303
Hey, there's something
on the screen.

235
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,675
And those two bums
turned to me

236
00:09:01,743 --> 00:09:03,043
and said,
"You're not funny, Peter."

237
00:09:03,111 --> 00:09:03,877
In my own house.

238
00:09:03,945 --> 00:09:04,979
Well, what was the bit?

239
00:09:05,046 --> 00:09:06,747
Okay, ready?

240
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:10,384
I'm John Wayne at the first
Thanksgiving, pilgrims.

241
00:09:10,452 --> 00:09:12,786
Happy Thanksgiving,
pilgrims.

242
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:16,457
Oh, my.
Oh, my.

243
00:09:16,524 --> 00:09:18,025
Oh, my God,
Peter, I'll tell ya...

244
00:09:18,093 --> 00:09:20,294
and I'm your friend
and I'll be honest with you...

245
00:09:20,362 --> 00:09:21,662
that's funny.
That is funny.

246
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,265
You know what I appreciate
about your joke, Peter?

247
00:09:24,332 --> 00:09:26,233
It's clean... it's clean funny.

248
00:09:26,301 --> 00:09:27,701
I just wish there was some way

249
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:29,236
I could show them
how wrong they are.

250
00:09:29,304 --> 00:09:30,904
Show 'em that we know comedy
better than they do.

251
00:09:30,972 --> 00:09:32,406
Hey, I got an idea.

252
00:09:32,474 --> 00:09:34,708
What's the most consistently
funny form of comedy

253
00:09:34,776 --> 00:09:36,810
in existence?

254
00:09:36,878 --> 00:09:38,545
- Improv?
- Improv!

255
00:09:38,613 --> 00:09:39,913
- Improv.
- Improv.

256
00:09:39,981 --> 00:09:40,948
Improv.

257
00:09:41,016 --> 00:09:42,316
Improv!

258
00:09:42,384 --> 00:09:44,285
We'll start our
own improv group

259
00:09:44,352 --> 00:09:46,120
- and put on a show.
- All right!

260
00:09:49,324 --> 00:09:51,759
Thank you for seeing us on
such short notice, Mayor West.

261
00:09:51,826 --> 00:09:53,594
No problem, gentlemen.

262
00:09:53,662 --> 00:09:55,963
- May I call you gentlemen?
- Yeah.

263
00:09:56,031 --> 00:09:59,433
Now you say this spy is
located somewhere in Quahog?

264
00:09:59,501 --> 00:10:01,502
That's right. We need you
to set up some roadblocks

265
00:10:01,569 --> 00:10:02,670
to help us contain him.

266
00:10:02,737 --> 00:10:04,071
Do you have any clues

267
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:05,973
regarding the identity of the spy?

268
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,441
It's a little tricky, sir.

269
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:08,876
See, the operative is
completely unaware

270
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:10,210
that he's been programmed.

271
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:11,645
And the only way
to activate him

272
00:10:11,713 --> 00:10:13,981
and discover his identity
is by saying the phrase,

273
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:17,318
"Gosh, that Italian family at
the next table sure is quiet."

274
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:22,990
It's him!

275
00:10:43,545 --> 00:10:45,846
I haven't been this...

276
00:10:45,914 --> 00:10:47,681
Since I...

277
00:10:50,952 --> 00:10:52,519
I... I don't...

278
00:10:52,587 --> 00:10:54,855
I don't really know
what I'm supposed to be doing.

279
00:10:54,923 --> 00:10:57,057
Uh, but...

280
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,493
Oh, there's track star
Wilma Rudolph.

281
00:10:59,561 --> 00:11:01,562
Obviously she had something
to do with the gag,

282
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:04,064
but I didn't hear the setup,

283
00:11:04,132 --> 00:11:06,433
so I don't really know
the context.

284
00:11:06,501 --> 00:11:08,302
Hey, I wonder what
Peter's up to?

285
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:14,074
Okay, so we gotta come up with
a name for our improv group.

286
00:11:14,142 --> 00:11:15,175
Anybody got anything?

287
00:11:15,243 --> 00:11:16,243
- Um...
- Um...

288
00:11:16,311 --> 00:11:18,112
How about
"The Joke Ridge Boys"?

289
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:19,346
Eh. Not bad.

290
00:11:19,414 --> 00:11:21,115
Wait, how about
"Funny Side Up"?

291
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:23,250
No, no, no, guys, guys,
we've got the name.

292
00:11:23,318 --> 00:11:26,720
It's "Impravda:
The Truth is Ad-Libbed."

293
00:11:26,788 --> 00:11:29,289
What about
"Deliveries in Rear"?

294
00:11:29,357 --> 00:11:31,024
Oh, yes!

295
00:11:31,092 --> 00:11:33,894
No, no, you can't just jam
jokes in for no reason.

296
00:11:33,962 --> 00:11:35,763
It has to be organic
to the situation.

297
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,165
What the hell you being
so friggin' comedy Hitler about?

298
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:40,534
I was in three improv groups
in college, Peter.

299
00:11:40,602 --> 00:11:43,203
I was in "Improvidence,"
I was in the "Wackadamia Nuts,"

300
00:11:43,271 --> 00:11:44,538
and I know I'm dating
myself here,

301
00:11:44,606 --> 00:11:45,672
but "Three Smile Island."

302
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,141
My point being

303
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,343
that I am the only experienced
member of this group.

304
00:11:49,411 --> 00:11:51,712
I can already tell
this is not going to be fun.

305
00:12:03,391 --> 00:12:05,058
How do we know
where to start looking?

306
00:12:05,126 --> 00:12:06,927
The tracking beacon I shot
into Mayor West's ankle

307
00:12:06,995 --> 00:12:08,162
will allow us to locate him.

308
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,135
Wow, those are
the Russian people?

309
00:12:17,372 --> 00:12:19,540
I mean, granted, you do
think of bears on unicycles

310
00:12:19,607 --> 00:12:21,275
when you think of
the Russian people,

311
00:12:21,342 --> 00:12:23,377
but they're <i>all</i>
bears on unicycles?

312
00:12:23,445 --> 00:12:24,545
Bears on unicycles,
every one.

313
00:12:24,612 --> 00:12:26,079
So what do we do now?

314
00:12:26,147 --> 00:12:28,182
We're undercover U.S. agents
in a hostile foreign territory.

315
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:30,150
We've just gotta make sure
we don't do anything

316
00:12:30,218 --> 00:12:31,385
that makes us stick out.

317
00:12:31,453 --> 00:12:33,987
Hey! They're not
bears on unicycles!

318
00:12:35,557 --> 00:12:37,291
You are under arrest.

319
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:38,725
Oop.
Time to lose this costume.

320
00:12:40,962 --> 00:12:42,529
'Cause we're in Russia!

321
00:12:50,648 --> 00:12:54,250
Here are the American spies
we captured, Mr. Prime Minister.

322
00:13:12,203 --> 00:13:14,138
Well, he was "Putin" us on, huh?

323
00:13:14,205 --> 00:13:15,439
Right?

324
00:13:15,507 --> 00:13:16,807
What do you think of that?

325
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,041
Chevy, right?

326
00:13:18,109 --> 00:13:19,376
That would have passed for funny

327
00:13:19,444 --> 00:13:20,744
in one of your movies, right?

328
00:13:20,812 --> 00:13:22,212
Okay, movin' on.

329
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,515
Gentlemen,
let me put your minds at ease.

330
00:13:24,582 --> 00:13:27,684
I know why you are here,
and I mean to help you.

331
00:13:27,752 --> 00:13:29,386
Oh...

332
00:13:29,454 --> 00:13:30,954
Well, terrific.

333
00:13:31,022 --> 00:13:34,625
The truth is, the reactivation
of a Cold War sleeper spy

334
00:13:34,692 --> 00:13:36,693
would be an embarrassment
to my government.

335
00:13:36,761 --> 00:13:38,495
On the scale of our 1981

336
00:13:38,563 --> 00:13:40,998
failed Czechoslovakian
Occupation Outpost

337
00:13:41,065 --> 00:13:43,367
which was penetrated
by Bill Murray, Harold Ramis

338
00:13:43,434 --> 00:13:45,536
and their ragtag band
of misfit soldiers

339
00:13:45,603 --> 00:13:47,104
who didn't even graduate.

340
00:13:47,172 --> 00:13:49,106
They slept through
the graduation ceremony

341
00:13:49,174 --> 00:13:51,375
and somehow managed
to come out of the manhole

342
00:13:51,442 --> 00:13:53,310
wearing clean pressed suit,
as you say.

343
00:13:53,378 --> 00:13:55,279
So the long and the veiny of it is

344
00:13:55,346 --> 00:13:56,580
you're gonna help us out, right?

345
00:13:56,648 --> 00:13:58,482
I will provide you
with transportation,

346
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,651
passports, food, supplies,

347
00:14:00,718 --> 00:14:02,886
everything from
a to backwards r.

348
00:14:02,954 --> 00:14:05,522
Wow, thank you so much
for your help, Mr. Putin.

349
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,691
Would you like to see
Russian cutaway gag?

350
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:10,160
Yeah, sure.
Here is Russian cutaway gag.

351
00:14:23,808 --> 00:14:25,742
Where the hell is Quagmire?

352
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:26,877
I don't know.

353
00:14:26,945 --> 00:14:28,278
He said improv rehearsal
at 7:00, right?

354
00:14:28,346 --> 00:14:29,513
Yeah, where is Quagmire?

355
00:14:29,581 --> 00:14:30,581
I haven't
seen him all day.

356
00:14:30,648 --> 00:14:31,648
Oh, you know what?

357
00:14:31,716 --> 00:14:33,317
I think he went
down to the bank.

358
00:14:33,384 --> 00:14:34,985
What was that?
What'd you hit me for?

359
00:14:35,053 --> 00:14:36,320
I'm passing
the story on to you.

360
00:14:36,387 --> 00:14:37,855
Keep it going,
keep the story going.

361
00:14:37,922 --> 00:14:39,122
- Huh?
- What's Quagmire doing at the bank?

362
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,257
It's improv, Peter.
You don't think,

363
00:14:40,325 --> 00:14:41,358
you don't think,
you don't think.

364
00:14:41,426 --> 00:14:42,593
You just keep talking.
You don't think.

365
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,994
Don't think, don't think.
What comes to mind?

366
00:14:44,062 --> 00:14:45,262
- Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk!
- Oh, I get it!

367
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,964
Tap me,
Quagmire, tap me!

368
00:14:47,031 --> 00:14:48,966
Quagmire went to the
bank to donate sperm,

369
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:50,000
because it's
a sperm bank.

370
00:14:50,068 --> 00:14:51,335
Yes! There you go.

371
00:14:51,402 --> 00:14:52,836
He's moving it forward,
he's moving it forward.

372
00:14:52,904 --> 00:14:54,771
See, Peter?
Now tap Peter.

373
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:56,440
Hey, pilgrims.

374
00:14:56,507 --> 00:14:58,909
Happy Thanksgiving, pilgrims.

375
00:14:58,977 --> 00:15:00,410
It's me, John Wayne.

376
00:15:00,478 --> 00:15:01,678
Oh, no.
All right, you know what?

377
00:15:01,746 --> 00:15:02,913
You're not loosened up yet.

378
00:15:02,981 --> 00:15:04,848
All right, l... let's do
some warm-up exercises.

379
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,783
Okay, this is one we call
"Going Bananas."

380
00:15:06,851 --> 00:15:08,018
Okay.

381
00:15:08,086 --> 00:15:10,988
♪ I'm a banana,
I'm a banana. ♪

382
00:15:11,055 --> 00:15:13,924
♪ Peel the banana,
peel the banana. ♪

383
00:15:13,992 --> 00:15:17,227
♪ Now go bananas,
go, go bananas. ♪

384
00:15:17,295 --> 00:15:19,363
Gah...!

385
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,365
Whoa! Come on, you guys,
do it with me!

386
00:15:21,432 --> 00:15:22,766
Go bananas! Yeah!

387
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:25,435
Wah...!

388
00:15:25,503 --> 00:15:26,904
Whole body, Joe,
whole body!

389
00:15:27,939 --> 00:15:29,973
Come on, go bananas!

390
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,909
Am I doing it?!
Am I doing it?!

391
00:15:31,976 --> 00:15:33,343
(bleep) the matter
with you guys?

392
00:15:33,411 --> 00:15:34,745
All right,
let's try something else.

393
00:15:34,812 --> 00:15:37,614
Okay, this is a warm-up exercise
called "One Word Story."

394
00:15:37,682 --> 00:15:39,816
Now, I start a story
with one word

395
00:15:39,884 --> 00:15:42,419
and then you each continue
with one word at a time.

396
00:15:42,487 --> 00:15:43,620
- Okay, ready?
- Yeah, yeah.

397
00:15:43,688 --> 00:15:45,055
I'm into this now.
Okay.

398
00:15:45,123 --> 00:15:46,056
The.

399
00:15:46,124 --> 00:15:47,057
Dog.

400
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,058
And.

401
00:15:48,126 --> 00:15:49,059
My.

402
00:15:49,127 --> 00:15:50,060
Mom.

403
00:15:50,128 --> 00:15:51,061
And.

404
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:52,062
This.

405
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,130
Handkerchief.

406
00:15:53,197 --> 00:15:54,264
And.

407
00:15:54,332 --> 00:15:55,832
Twenty.
Birds.

408
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,167
- And.
- Peter!

409
00:15:57,235 --> 00:15:58,235
- Geez!
- And.

410
00:15:58,303 --> 00:15:59,469
Peter, hang on a sec.

411
00:15:59,537 --> 00:16:00,437
You're not contributing.

412
00:16:00,505 --> 00:16:01,471
I'm doing it.

413
00:16:01,539 --> 00:16:02,839
You're not
adding information.

414
00:16:02,907 --> 00:16:04,174
Well, one of you guys says
"Thanksgiving,"

415
00:16:04,242 --> 00:16:05,976
I got a good idea
where to go with it.

416
00:16:06,044 --> 00:16:08,078
Okay, Peter,
let's try something different.

417
00:16:08,146 --> 00:16:10,180
Okay, close your eyes.

418
00:16:10,248 --> 00:16:12,382
- What's the first thing you see?
- Uh...

419
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,418
- Don't think, just say it. First thing.
- Pelican.

420
00:16:14,485 --> 00:16:15,419
Okay, what's he doing?

421
00:16:15,486 --> 00:16:16,820
He's complaining about

422
00:16:16,888 --> 00:16:18,088
some undercooked food.

423
00:16:18,156 --> 00:16:19,089
Who's he complaining to?

424
00:16:19,157 --> 00:16:21,091
A snooty French waiter.

425
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:23,260
Who's really mean
to his customers.

426
00:16:23,328 --> 00:16:25,462
But then when he goes home,
his own life's sad,

427
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,197
'cause his girlfriend's
mean to him

428
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:29,166
and his apartment
isn't so very nice.

429
00:16:29,233 --> 00:16:31,034
And he's always
running out of paper towels.

430
00:16:34,572 --> 00:16:35,572
I saw it.

431
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,773
I seen it, Quagmire.

432
00:16:36,841 --> 00:16:38,642
I was there, in the apartment.

433
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,277
We're ready.

434
00:16:43,548 --> 00:16:45,382
If these signatures
are correct,

435
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,818
Mayor West is located one-third
of a kilometer that way.

436
00:16:47,885 --> 00:16:49,152
Just over this rise.

437
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,420
Yeah, that's what
you told us

438
00:16:50,488 --> 00:16:52,389
a third of a kilometer ago,
you douche.

439
00:16:52,457 --> 00:16:53,790
Perhaps you'd like
to do something

440
00:16:53,858 --> 00:16:56,193
besides criticizing me
and quoting my movies.

441
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,829
You just
watch your mouth, mister.

442
00:16:58,896 --> 00:17:00,697
Look!

443
00:17:17,248 --> 00:17:19,216
Anyway,
I'd be happy to help you

444
00:17:19,283 --> 00:17:21,218
conduct a search
of Quahog and find...

445
00:17:21,285 --> 00:17:22,252
What the hell?

446
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,653
Where am I?

447
00:17:23,721 --> 00:17:26,456
I didn't just bite into a
York Peppermint Patty, did I?

448
00:17:26,524 --> 00:17:27,891
Mayor West,
you're in Russia.

449
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,359
You've just launched
a nuclear missile

450
00:17:29,427 --> 00:17:30,594
against the United States.

451
00:17:30,661 --> 00:17:32,896
Well, this day
has taken a bad turn.

452
00:17:32,964 --> 00:17:34,898
Like Mike Brady's
first marriage.

453
00:17:34,966 --> 00:17:36,666
Here's your beer, honey.

454
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:42,272
Huh. I don't remember
asking for a warm beer.

455
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,673
Well, I didn't want
to quit working!

456
00:17:43,741 --> 00:17:44,741
You made me!

457
00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:46,943
You don't talk to me
that way!

458
00:17:49,647 --> 00:17:52,182
Alice, what did you see?

459
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,917
Enough to know I'm
getting a raise.

460
00:18:03,194 --> 00:18:04,561
What the...?

461
00:18:04,629 --> 00:18:06,763
Oh, man, we're supposed
to do a show tonight.

462
00:18:06,831 --> 00:18:07,931
Where's the audience?

463
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,332
I don't see them anywhere.

464
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,767
If only they could
make some noise

465
00:18:10,835 --> 00:18:12,102
to let me know they're here.

466
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,036
We're here!

467
00:18:13,104 --> 00:18:14,337
Oh, there you are!

468
00:18:14,405 --> 00:18:15,472
Oh, thank God.

469
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,940
Well, we're
"Room for Improv-ment."

470
00:18:17,008 --> 00:18:18,975
So, without further ado,
I need a place.

471
00:18:19,043 --> 00:18:20,277
Your ass!

472
00:18:20,344 --> 00:18:21,411
Okay, come on now.

473
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:22,479
Something serious.

474
00:18:22,547 --> 00:18:23,713
Your mom's ass!

475
00:18:23,781 --> 00:18:25,315
Hey, let's get that guy
out of here, huh?

476
00:18:25,383 --> 00:18:26,550
Okay, a real place.

477
00:18:26,617 --> 00:18:28,819
Goldman's Pharmacy
on Third and Maple.

478
00:18:28,886 --> 00:18:29,886
Give him the hours.

479
00:18:29,954 --> 00:18:31,288
8:00 A.M. to...

480
00:18:31,355 --> 00:18:32,823
Okay, I heard "pharmacy."
Who's in the pharmacy?

481
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,357
John Wayne.

482
00:18:34,425 --> 00:18:36,159
What the... Peter, you're not
supposed to be in the audience!

483
00:18:36,227 --> 00:18:38,762
Get the hell up on stage!

484
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,896
All right.

485
00:18:39,964 --> 00:18:41,198
Hey, there, sir,
welcome to my pharmacy.

486
00:18:41,265 --> 00:18:42,532
Can I help you?

487
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,835
Here's John Wayne at
the first Thanksgiving.

488
00:18:44,902 --> 00:18:47,437
Happy Thanksgiving, pilgrims.

489
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,841
Ah, you like that?

490
00:18:50,908 --> 00:18:53,543
Okay, here's John Wayne Bobbitt
at the first Thanksgiving:

491
00:18:53,611 --> 00:18:56,246
Where's my penis,
pilgrims?

492
00:18:58,282 --> 00:19:01,218
And here's John Wayne Gacy
at the first Thanksgiving.

493
00:19:01,285 --> 00:19:05,222
I want to dress up like a clown
and have sex with children

494
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:06,957
and kill them, pilgrims.

495
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,361
Guys, I got to split.

496
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:13,763
I took a wet duke.

497
00:19:13,831 --> 00:19:15,298
And.

498
00:19:15,366 --> 00:19:17,367
Okay, this is not something that
should ever have been attempted.

499
00:19:17,435 --> 00:19:18,902
Thank you very much.
Good night, everybody.

500
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,437
Improv!

501
00:19:34,952 --> 00:19:37,754
I wish there was some way
I could have prevented this.

502
00:19:37,822 --> 00:19:39,122
It wasn't your fault, Mayor West.

503
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,390
There's nothing
you could've done.

504
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,459
To be honest,
I don't remember a thing.

505
00:19:42,527 --> 00:19:43,827
Except how much I love

506
00:19:43,895 --> 00:19:45,795
The Michael Jackson
"Thriller" video.

507
00:19:45,863 --> 00:19:48,064
Boy, could that guy dance!

508
00:19:48,132 --> 00:19:49,432
"Guy dance?"

509
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,567
Guidance.

510
00:19:50,635 --> 00:19:52,335
Source programmable guidance.

511
00:19:52,403 --> 00:19:54,504
We can reprogram and disarm
the missile from here!

512
00:19:54,572 --> 00:19:55,672
From here?!
Well, our arms

513
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,140
would have to be
40 feet long, Dan.

514
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,341
No, yutz,
not from right here.

515
00:19:58,409 --> 00:19:59,676
We go over there and do it.

516
00:19:59,744 --> 00:20:00,644
Oh, right.

517
00:20:00,711 --> 00:20:02,212
Oh, come on, Chevy.

518
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,347
You should've known
what he was talking about.

519
00:20:04,415 --> 00:20:06,149
All I have to do is bypass

520
00:20:06,217 --> 00:20:07,951
the primary navigational
guidance circuits,

521
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:10,220
deprogram the hardwired
safety overrides

522
00:20:10,288 --> 00:20:12,155
and reconfigure the motherboard
so that the missile's

523
00:20:12,223 --> 00:20:14,391
primary central processing unit
tells itself

524
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,593
to eject its own warhead
while still

525
00:20:16,661 --> 00:20:18,295
safely above
the earth's atmosphere.

526
00:20:18,362 --> 00:20:20,130
Hey, Dan,
when this is all over,

527
00:20:20,198 --> 00:20:22,999
you may get a call asking you
to evaluate my performance.

528
00:20:23,067 --> 00:20:25,235
Can I count on you
to give me a ten?

529
00:20:25,303 --> 00:20:26,803
And that should do it.

530
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,350
You did it, Dan!

531
00:20:40,418 --> 00:20:41,651
My God, you did it!

532
00:20:45,823 --> 00:20:47,257
Mission accomplished,
gentlemen.

533
00:20:47,325 --> 00:20:49,859
Warhead has been destroyed,
we've saved millions of lives.

534
00:20:49,927 --> 00:20:51,561
Let's just hope the
fuselage doesn't fall

535
00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:53,029
where it can cause
too much damage.

536
00:20:58,035 --> 00:21:00,904
No, no, no, no, no, no!

537
00:21:03,074 --> 00:21:04,674
I... I don't get it.

538
00:21:04,675 --> 00:21:09,675

539
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:13,838
So what's the deal with Chris?
Is he actually, like, still in Africa?

540
00:21:13,863 --> 00:21:15,906
- No, no, he's not.
- So that was all...

541
00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:17,902
- That was just a bit.
- Yeah, he'll be back next week.

542
00:21:17,926 --> 00:21:18,630
Great.

543
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,905
Boy, who would have thought
all this trouble could be caused

544
00:21:20,917 --> 00:21:22,385
simply by uttering the phrase

545
00:21:22,408 --> 00:21:25,778
"Gosh that Italian family
at the next table sure is quiet."

546
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:41,105
Shut up, 2476.
