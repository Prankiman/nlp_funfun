00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,372
We now return to
Germany's favorite talk show,

13
00:00:37,406 --> 00:00:38,523
<i>Das Ist Gut.</i>

14
00:00:38,557 --> 00:00:39,891
Dad, what is this show?

15
00:00:39,925 --> 00:00:42,460
I don't know. It's just
a German guy listing items

16
00:00:42,494 --> 00:00:44,228
and then declaring them good.

17
00:00:44,263 --> 00:00:46,914
<i>Wilkommen!</i> Where are we?

18
00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:49,367
<i>Das! Ist! Gut!</i>

19
00:00:49,418 --> 00:00:52,186
Okay, sunsets.
<i>Das ist gut.</i>

20
00:00:52,221 --> 00:00:53,955
<i>Ja.</i>

21
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:55,623
Sauerkraut.
<i>Das ist gut.</i>

22
00:00:57,726 --> 00:01:00,194
The autobahn. Vroom vroom!
<i>Das ist gut.</i>

23
00:01:01,563 --> 00:01:03,765
Oompa music.
<i>Das ist gut.</i>

24
00:01:05,067 --> 00:01:07,034
Euthanasia for
the mentally feeble.

25
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:08,503
<i>Das ist gut.</i>

26
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:12,590
Das Ist Gut
<i>is filmed before an audience</i>

27
00:01:12,624 --> 00:01:13,925
<i>of the mentally feeble.</i>

28
00:01:15,894 --> 00:01:18,362
God, I wish I could get tickets
to that show.

29
00:01:18,397 --> 00:01:19,730
We interrupt this program

30
00:01:19,782 --> 00:01:22,016
to bring you a Channel Five News
special report.

31
00:01:22,034 --> 00:01:24,786
Good evening. I'm Joyce Kinney
with this special report.

32
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,754
The latest police
statistics have revealed

33
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:28,706
a significant rise in
crime throughout Quahog.

34
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,007
That's right, Joyce.

35
00:01:30,042 --> 00:01:33,761
And just to put it out there,
Tom Tucker is packin'.

36
00:01:33,796 --> 00:01:36,831
I drive a 2006 Infiniti,
and I don't intend to lose it.

37
00:01:36,865 --> 00:01:38,533
So come and get some, punks.

38
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:40,067
An increase
in crime?

39
00:01:40,102 --> 00:01:41,369
That can't
be right.

40
00:01:41,403 --> 00:01:43,204
I haven't noticed
anything like that.

41
00:01:43,238 --> 00:01:46,140
You're in the house 14 hours
a day. What would you notice?

42
00:01:46,175 --> 00:01:47,325
Well, I hate to
admit it, Lois,

43
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,776
but over the last
couple of years,

44
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:51,279
this town has changed a lot, a
not necessarily for the better.

45
00:01:51,313 --> 00:01:53,231
Yeah, I mean, the other day,
I left a doodie

46
00:01:53,265 --> 00:01:54,999
right in the middle
of a Crate and Barrel.

47
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,051
Came back 45 minutes later,
it was gone.

48
00:01:57,085 --> 00:01:58,970
Yeah, even school's
getting more dangerous.

49
00:01:59,004 --> 00:02:00,788
The bullies
have been so busy,

50
00:02:00,823 --> 00:02:03,357
they're outsourcing
their bullying to India.

51
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,692
Okay, do you see

52
00:02:04,726 --> 00:02:06,127
the back of your underwear
in the mirror?

53
00:02:06,161 --> 00:02:07,428
Yes.

54
00:02:07,463 --> 00:02:09,464
Okay, I want you to pull it up
as high as you can.

55
00:02:09,498 --> 00:02:10,948
Well, I disagree
with you guys.

56
00:02:10,983 --> 00:02:12,733
I think Quahog
is still pretty great.

57
00:02:12,768 --> 00:02:14,135
You know, it's hard for me

58
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:15,736
to take the things
you say seriously

59
00:02:15,771 --> 00:02:17,905
when I know what's been
in that mouth of yours.

60
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,725
Look, I realize Quahog isn't
the small town it used to be,

61
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,226
but it's still
very special to me.

62
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:23,828
It's my home.

63
00:02:23,862 --> 00:02:26,664
Yeah, come on, guys, she's got
dyed roots in this community.

64
00:02:26,698 --> 00:02:28,199
Lois, I know you
love this town,

65
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:30,251
but nothing is ever as
innocent as it seems.

66
00:02:30,285 --> 00:02:32,286
♪

67
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:37,925
Attaboy, Ope.

68
00:02:43,031 --> 00:02:45,132
Give me all
your money!

69
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:46,751
Okay, okay!

70
00:02:46,785 --> 00:02:48,202
You have a white wallet?

71
00:02:48,237 --> 00:02:49,604
Yeah, just like
Truman Capote.

72
00:02:49,638 --> 00:02:50,972
Who's Truman Capote?

73
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:52,406
What a surprise!

74
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:55,376
The mugger's never
heard of Truman Capote.

75
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,179
There's a library card in there!
Use it!

76
00:03:00,816 --> 00:03:03,183
And now, let's meet our star!

77
00:03:03,202 --> 00:03:07,321
Give a warm Quahog Oceanland
welcome to Bojangles!

78
00:03:07,356 --> 00:03:09,323
All the fish
in the bucket now!

79
00:03:09,358 --> 00:03:12,460
Not one fish at a time
as a reward! All of them!

80
00:03:12,494 --> 00:03:13,644
Okay, okay,
take it easy.

81
00:03:13,679 --> 00:03:14,845
Okay, the one thing

82
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,715
you don't want to do
is tell me to take it easy.

83
00:03:17,749 --> 00:03:19,834
Now do that thing
where you rub my belly!

84
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:21,385
I really like that!

85
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,555
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

86
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:28,426
Yeah, now I'm gonna balance
a ball on <i>your</i> face.

87
00:03:30,395 --> 00:03:31,529
One more push.

88
00:03:32,731 --> 00:03:34,165
There we go!
It's a boy!

89
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,550
And he's got a gun!

90
00:03:45,627 --> 00:03:47,078
Well, you guys,
we did it.

91
00:03:47,112 --> 00:03:49,714
We finally went to a restaurant
without somebody yelling at us,

92
00:03:49,748 --> 00:03:51,933
and then the rest of the place
applauding them.

93
00:03:55,304 --> 00:03:57,271
Oh, my God!

94
00:03:57,306 --> 00:03:58,639
We've been
burglarized!

95
00:03:58,674 --> 00:03:59,840
Well, we'll just have

96
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,643
to get that $17 insurance check
and start over.

97
00:04:02,678 --> 00:04:04,745
Oh, my God,
it's so creepy to think

98
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,213
there were strangers
in our house.

99
00:04:06,248 --> 00:04:07,715
I've never
felt so scared.

100
00:04:07,749 --> 00:04:09,050
I have.

101
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,588
And now we wait.

102
00:04:14,756 --> 00:04:16,624
Oh, no, they took my gym shoes.

103
00:04:16,658 --> 00:04:19,327
Sorry, glutes,
no blasting today.

104
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:22,029
They took my dirty rope
that was tied in a knot!

105
00:04:22,064 --> 00:04:24,298
They stole the chair
I use in the shower!

106
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,450
They stole
all my pens!

107
00:04:26,485 --> 00:04:29,587
I... I don't have
a lot of stuff.

108
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:30,655
Son of a bitch!

109
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:33,024
They also stole
my sense of wonder.

110
00:04:34,326 --> 00:04:35,426
Nope.

111
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,495
Oh, this is horrible!

112
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:38,796
Maybe you guys were right.

113
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,198
Maybe our town has changed.

114
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:42,433
I know, it's awful.

115
00:04:42,467 --> 00:04:44,168
Pretty soon, guys are
just gonna be showing

116
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:46,637
their boners to babies
and stuff, I bet.

117
00:04:46,672 --> 00:04:50,041
It's sad to think that Quahog
isn't safe for families anymore.

118
00:04:50,075 --> 00:04:52,576
I mean, all I ever wanted was
to raise our children

119
00:04:52,611 --> 00:04:55,713
in a wholesome place,
far away from all the crime

120
00:04:55,747 --> 00:04:57,748
and problems of the big city.

121
00:04:57,783 --> 00:04:59,183
I'm reading you, Lois.

122
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:01,652
I'm reading you loud and clear.

123
00:05:06,258 --> 00:05:07,625
Hi, I'm Peter Griffin.

124
00:05:07,659 --> 00:05:09,260
Um, I'm looking for
a wholesome place

125
00:05:09,294 --> 00:05:12,163
for my family to live, so
I'd like to buy your farm.

126
00:05:12,197 --> 00:05:13,597
All right, well,
the going rate

127
00:05:13,632 --> 00:05:16,667
for my farm is $875,000.

128
00:05:16,735 --> 00:05:18,669
Uh... nobody
called ahead?

129
00:05:18,704 --> 00:05:20,204
What?

130
00:05:20,238 --> 00:05:22,790
Well, somebody... somebody from
Fox was supposed to call ahead.

131
00:05:22,824 --> 00:05:24,091
They usually
take care of it,

132
00:05:24,126 --> 00:05:26,027
and then I just go
ahead and do stuff.

133
00:05:26,061 --> 00:05:27,495
I didn't get
no phone call.

134
00:05:30,332 --> 00:05:31,365
Hello?

135
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,600
Oh, yes.

136
00:05:32,634 --> 00:05:34,035
Yes, that'll be fine.

137
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:35,202
Ah.

138
00:05:41,378 --> 00:05:43,079
Hey, Lois, you know
how I'm always

139
00:05:43,113 --> 00:05:44,547
buying things
impulsively?

140
00:05:44,581 --> 00:05:46,516
Well, that's gonna
be very hard to do

141
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,117
now that we're
living on a farm.

142
00:05:48,152 --> 00:05:49,852
What? What are you
talking about?

143
00:05:49,887 --> 00:05:51,621
Um, a farm, Lois.

144
00:05:51,655 --> 00:05:53,089
It's where
vegetables live.

145
00:05:53,123 --> 00:05:54,657
Peter, you went out
and bought a farm

146
00:05:54,692 --> 00:05:56,426
without even talking
to me about it?

147
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,728
Well, Lois, in my
defense, I have nothing

148
00:05:58,762 --> 00:06:00,513
to back up the beginning
of this sentence.

149
00:06:00,547 --> 00:06:01,781
I can't believe this.

150
00:06:01,815 --> 00:06:03,783
And it's not like
it's the first time you made

151
00:06:03,817 --> 00:06:06,336
a big family decision
without consulting me.

152
00:06:14,294 --> 00:06:17,363
Yes, I'd like to
see your quietest doctor.

153
00:06:17,398 --> 00:06:19,065
Peter, where'd you
even get the money

154
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:20,633
to make that kind
of purchase?

155
00:06:20,668 --> 00:06:21,634
I sold the house.

156
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:23,036
And I did it
on Craigslist,

157
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,771
so I also made a
dangerous friend.

158
00:06:24,805 --> 00:06:26,806
What? How could
you sell the house?

159
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,408
Spooner Street is our home!

160
00:06:28,442 --> 00:06:30,743
I mean, I have three aprons
that say "Quahog."

161
00:06:30,778 --> 00:06:33,046
What do you want me to do,
start all over?

162
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,760
Lois, you were saying
yourself how you want

163
00:06:34,782 --> 00:06:36,716
our kids to grow up
in a wholesome place

164
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,917
away from the big city.

165
00:06:37,951 --> 00:06:40,153
I... I did say that.

166
00:06:40,187 --> 00:06:41,754
And, Chris, you been
telling me how you wanted

167
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:42,989
to watch animals
humping other animals

168
00:06:43,023 --> 00:06:44,424
what might not
be okay with it.

169
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,658
That's true.

170
00:06:45,693 --> 00:06:48,027
And, Meg, you yourself
said lip gloss unicorns

171
00:06:48,062 --> 00:06:50,163
Channing Tatum something
something bullcrap.

172
00:06:50,197 --> 00:06:51,564
You were listening
the whole time?

173
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:52,865
Don't you see,
you guys?

174
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,200
I did this for
the family.

175
00:06:54,234 --> 00:06:56,602
Just think of this farm as
our next great adventure.

176
00:06:56,637 --> 00:06:59,272
Like when we tried to
invade the city of Troy.

177
00:07:03,494 --> 00:07:05,828
Peter, I don't think
this is the right horse.

178
00:07:05,863 --> 00:07:08,965
I am 100% positive
this is the right horse.

179
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:10,433
Come on, guys,
what do you say?

180
00:07:10,467 --> 00:07:12,001
Will you join me
in eating eggs

181
00:07:12,036 --> 00:07:13,403
fresh out of a
chicken's butt?

182
00:07:13,437 --> 00:07:16,105
Yay! Now I can be one
of those filthy teens

183
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,741
with sad eyes
at a farmer's market!

184
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:20,643
Well, with what's
become of Quahog,

185
00:07:20,677 --> 00:07:22,478
maybe it is time
to make a change.

186
00:07:22,513 --> 00:07:23,479
I'm in, Dad!

187
00:07:23,514 --> 00:07:24,480
Me, too!

188
00:07:24,515 --> 00:07:26,149
All right, let's do it.

189
00:07:26,183 --> 00:07:27,467
Hey, what's going on?

190
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:30,103
Well, we've made a decision
as a family, Brian.

191
00:07:30,137 --> 00:07:34,040
We've decided to take you to a
nice, big farm upstate.

192
00:07:34,074 --> 00:07:35,742
Wh-What?

193
00:07:35,776 --> 00:07:37,877
A farm with big
open fields, Brian,

194
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:40,213
where you can just run
and run and be free

195
00:07:40,247 --> 00:07:41,964
and no one will
ever hurt you.

196
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:43,833
Doesn't that sound
wonderful, Brian?

197
00:07:43,867 --> 00:07:46,219
Are you ready to go
to the nice farm?

198
00:07:46,253 --> 00:07:47,286
No! No!

199
00:07:47,321 --> 00:07:48,688
You'll never take me alive!

200
00:07:51,592 --> 00:07:55,194
Okay, I am at full
candy corn right now.

201
00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:07,673
Here we are, everyone.

202
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,675
The Griffin family farm.

203
00:08:09,726 --> 00:08:12,278
Wow, look at us, Brian,
frontier people.

204
00:08:12,312 --> 00:08:14,380
I feel like those miners
who first struck gold

205
00:08:14,414 --> 00:08:15,782
in San Francisco.

206
00:08:16,817 --> 00:08:18,167
Oh, my God,
we did it!

207
00:08:18,202 --> 00:08:19,302
We struck gold!

208
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:21,254
This is amazing!
We're gonna be rich!

209
00:08:21,288 --> 00:08:22,538
Rich and gay.

210
00:08:22,573 --> 00:08:23,689
Come here.

211
00:08:27,444 --> 00:08:29,245
Peter, what are you doing?

212
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,030
Well, Lois, a big part
of owning a farm

213
00:08:31,064 --> 00:08:33,299
is crossing a road
very slowly with cows.

214
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,835
Okay, okay, Bessie, now.

215
00:08:35,869 --> 00:08:37,737
Get yourself out there.
Easy does it.

216
00:08:38,939 --> 00:08:42,108
Hey, come on, man!
I got to get to work!

217
00:08:42,142 --> 00:08:43,776
And so do they, sir.

218
00:08:43,811 --> 00:08:45,945
Hurry it up!

219
00:08:45,979 --> 00:08:47,763
Wait a second.

220
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,666
Now get in line, you!

221
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:55,438
Hey, I thought I told you kids
to go plow in the field.

222
00:08:55,472 --> 00:08:57,940
But, Dad, we've been
plowing all morning.

223
00:08:57,975 --> 00:08:59,709
Yeah, I can't take
any more plowing.

224
00:08:59,743 --> 00:09:00,877
I can barely walk.

225
00:09:00,911 --> 00:09:03,146
Look, I know it seems
like dirty work, but, Chris,

226
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,281
you got to spread that seed
until your sack is empty.

227
00:09:05,315 --> 00:09:07,216
And, Meg, you got to clear
away all that brush

228
00:09:07,251 --> 00:09:09,585
so he can plant it deep
where it needs to be.

229
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,637
Okay, we'll keep
at it, but I think

230
00:09:11,672 --> 00:09:13,339
that hoe is pretty
much worn out.

231
00:09:13,373 --> 00:09:15,591
Well, flip it over;
you can use both sides.

232
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,415
Peter, there's a guy
standing out in the yard.

233
00:09:22,449 --> 00:09:23,716
Oh, yeah, that's Larry.

234
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,152
Part of being a farmer is having
a best friend named Larry

235
00:09:26,186 --> 00:09:27,753
who I spend huge
amounts of time with,

236
00:09:27,788 --> 00:09:29,322
but never actually talk to.

237
00:09:29,356 --> 00:09:33,826
♪ Ooh, you make me
live now, honey ♪

238
00:09:33,861 --> 00:09:37,797
♪ Ooh, you make me live

239
00:09:37,831 --> 00:09:39,165
♪ Oh

240
00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:41,534
♪ You're the best friend

241
00:09:41,568 --> 00:09:44,170
♪ That I ever had

242
00:09:44,204 --> 00:09:47,106
♪ Been with you
such a long time ♪

243
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,108
♪ You're my sunshine

244
00:09:49,142 --> 00:09:51,777
♪ And I want you to know

245
00:09:51,812 --> 00:09:53,779
♪ That my feelings are true

246
00:09:53,814 --> 00:09:56,832
♪ I really love you.

247
00:09:56,867 --> 00:09:59,285
Peter, I'm dying.

248
00:09:59,319 --> 00:10:01,654
This is the last time
I'll ever see you.

249
00:10:01,688 --> 00:10:02,822
Bye.

250
00:10:07,544 --> 00:10:09,662
Peter, I've been running
the numbers on this farm,

251
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:11,330
and we're in deep trouble.

252
00:10:11,365 --> 00:10:13,666
We haven't grown
a single crop to sell.

253
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,068
And meanwhile,
you're spending half our money

254
00:10:16,103 --> 00:10:17,803
down at the General Store,
and the other half

255
00:10:17,838 --> 00:10:19,405
at the Specific Store.

256
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:21,407
Do you have almonds?
What kind of almonds?

257
00:10:21,441 --> 00:10:23,009
Marcona almonds.
From what region?

258
00:10:23,043 --> 00:10:24,010
The Basque Region.

259
00:10:24,044 --> 00:10:25,344
The Basque Region's
pretty big.

260
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:26,579
North? South?

261
00:10:26,613 --> 00:10:27,580
Southern Basque.

262
00:10:27,614 --> 00:10:28,731
How much should
each almond weigh?

263
00:10:28,765 --> 00:10:29,765
Point eight ounces?

264
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,334
Sorry, we only
have point sixes.

265
00:10:31,368 --> 00:10:32,368
Aw.

266
00:10:34,271 --> 00:10:35,922
Yeah, hi. Do you have stuff?

267
00:10:35,956 --> 00:10:37,423
Yeah, we have stuff!

268
00:10:37,457 --> 00:10:39,959
And is it true that you've been
spending the farm's money

269
00:10:39,993 --> 00:10:43,262
on gingham shirts you tie into
a knot to expose your belly?

270
00:10:43,297 --> 00:10:44,764
I bought a couple.

271
00:10:44,798 --> 00:10:47,450
Well, with all this debt
and no income, there's no way

272
00:10:47,484 --> 00:10:49,785
we're gonna be able
to keep up our bank payments.

273
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,587
Peter, if something
doesn't change,

274
00:10:51,622 --> 00:10:54,023
I'm afraid we're
gonna lose this farm.

275
00:10:54,057 --> 00:10:55,858
Great, just what I need
on my conscience:

276
00:10:55,892 --> 00:10:57,293
another failed business.

277
00:10:59,663 --> 00:11:01,998
Hi, I'd like to rent
<i>The Proposal.</i>

278
00:11:02,032 --> 00:11:04,166
Hang on, let me check
the return slot.

279
00:11:04,201 --> 00:11:05,768
I'm sorry, it hasn't
been returned yet.

280
00:11:05,802 --> 00:11:08,204
I have a poster from <i>The</i>
<i>Proposal</i> you can look at.

281
00:11:08,238 --> 00:11:09,488
You'll get
most of the story.

282
00:11:09,523 --> 00:11:11,490
Huh. They seem
pretty mismatched.

283
00:11:11,525 --> 00:11:12,758
There you go.

284
00:11:12,793 --> 00:11:13,943
Look, it's like
I've been saying,

285
00:11:13,977 --> 00:11:15,478
farming is
very difficult.

286
00:11:15,512 --> 00:11:17,246
When? W-When did
you say that?

287
00:11:17,281 --> 00:11:19,081
Farming takes incredible
skill and knowledge

288
00:11:19,116 --> 00:11:20,883
and the sort
of specialized experience

289
00:11:20,917 --> 00:11:22,635
that takes generations
to acquire.

290
00:11:22,669 --> 00:11:26,205
Dad, my favorite hen laid
this crazy-looking egg!

291
00:11:27,257 --> 00:11:28,724
Cheep-cheep.

292
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:29,792
What's your point, Brian?

293
00:11:29,826 --> 00:11:31,911
My point is that
maybe I should go

294
00:11:31,945 --> 00:11:34,547
to the local state college and
take some agriculture courses.

295
00:11:34,581 --> 00:11:36,615
With the proper training,
maybe I can actually

296
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,384
learn something that
will save this farm.

297
00:11:38,418 --> 00:11:39,852
Wow, Brian,
that's a great idea.

298
00:11:39,886 --> 00:11:42,388
And, hey, maybe I could give
the speech at your graduation.

299
00:11:42,422 --> 00:11:43,823
I'm really good at that.

300
00:11:43,857 --> 00:11:47,893
And so, as I look out at your
smiling faces filled with hope,

301
00:11:47,928 --> 00:11:50,830
all I can think is,
you are completely screwed.

302
00:11:50,864 --> 00:11:54,400
As Martin Luther King once said,
"Ouch, I've been shot."

303
00:11:54,434 --> 00:11:56,002
Thank you.

304
00:11:57,971 --> 00:11:59,605
Okay, that's
all my stuff.

305
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:02,508
I'm off to State Tech Ag
Central College Tech.

306
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:04,310
There's really two
"techs" in there?

307
00:12:04,344 --> 00:12:06,579
The proudest day
of a man's life

308
00:12:06,613 --> 00:12:08,748
is when his dog
goes off to college.

309
00:12:08,782 --> 00:12:10,082
I'll learn all I can.

310
00:12:10,117 --> 00:12:12,201
And I'll see you guys soon.

311
00:12:15,055 --> 00:12:18,024
Aw, he packed a guitar?
What a douche.

312
00:12:19,793 --> 00:12:22,094
Guys, what's that over there?

313
00:12:29,353 --> 00:12:31,620
Oh, my God, it's a tornado!

314
00:12:31,655 --> 00:12:34,256
And it's coming this way!
We got to run!

315
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:37,993
Hang on, guys, it might just be
the Tasmanian Devil.

316
00:12:38,028 --> 00:12:40,529
Come on!
Into the storm cellar!

317
00:12:44,368 --> 00:12:46,736
What is this place?
It's really dark down here.

318
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,571
- Shh.
- What? Did you hear something?

319
00:12:48,572 --> 00:12:50,606
No, I just want you
to stop talking.

320
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,808
Wait, I think
I found the lights.

321
00:12:54,578 --> 00:12:56,512
Wh-What is that?

322
00:12:56,546 --> 00:12:57,963
Aw, sweet!
It's some kind of lab.

323
00:12:57,998 --> 00:13:00,332
Hey, maybe it has
one of those things that goes...

324
00:13:02,803 --> 00:13:04,403
'Cause that's
important for science.

325
00:13:04,438 --> 00:13:06,005
Look at all this stuff.

326
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:08,007
Burners, plastic tubing.

327
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:10,009
12 cases of
cold medicine?

328
00:13:10,043 --> 00:13:11,343
You guys...

329
00:13:11,378 --> 00:13:13,546
I think this is
a meth lab.

330
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,547
Oh, my God.

331
00:13:14,581 --> 00:13:16,182
You mean like
as in...

332
00:13:16,216 --> 00:13:18,050
D-R-U-G-S?

333
00:13:18,085 --> 00:13:20,886
Aren't those
I-L-L-E-G-A-L?

334
00:13:20,921 --> 00:13:21,887
What's going on?

335
00:13:21,922 --> 00:13:23,255
What are you guys
talking about?

336
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,458
Uh-oh, someone's
getting cranky.

337
00:13:25,492 --> 00:13:27,476
I think he
needs an N-A-P.

338
00:13:27,511 --> 00:13:29,245
What's happening?
Where are you taking me?

339
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,996
Man, I got to crack this code.

340
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:37,742
Oh, my God!

341
00:13:37,777 --> 00:13:39,577
You guys, there's
a fully functional meth lab

342
00:13:39,612 --> 00:13:40,912
in our basement.

343
00:13:40,947 --> 00:13:42,514
Boy, we should
clean this place up.

344
00:13:42,548 --> 00:13:43,982
It's a meth.

345
00:13:44,016 --> 00:13:45,283
Brian?

346
00:13:45,318 --> 00:13:46,618
Oh, right, you're at college.

347
00:13:46,652 --> 00:13:47,886
We have to call
the police.

348
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,020
Whoa, whoa,
hang on, Lois.

349
00:13:49,055 --> 00:13:50,288
Now, I know you're
freaked out,

350
00:13:50,323 --> 00:13:52,223
but when you really stop
and think about it,

351
00:13:52,258 --> 00:13:54,192
this meth lab is our
family's best chance

352
00:13:54,226 --> 00:13:55,694
to make meth in a lab.

353
00:13:55,728 --> 00:13:57,662
What... what are you
talking about, Peter?

354
00:13:57,697 --> 00:13:59,164
I'm talking about
saving the farm.

355
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:00,532
Don't you see?

356
00:14:00,566 --> 00:14:02,968
This lab is just what we need
to get back on our feet.

357
00:14:03,002 --> 00:14:04,202
No way, Peter.

358
00:14:04,236 --> 00:14:05,537
Dealing drugs
is morally wrong,

359
00:14:05,571 --> 00:14:07,839
not to mention
incredibly dangerous.

360
00:14:07,873 --> 00:14:09,441
Come on, we've always
been risk takers.

361
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:10,742
You remember
when we did it

362
00:14:10,776 --> 00:14:12,410
in the bathroom at
that restaurant?

363
00:14:12,445 --> 00:14:14,512
I can't believe
we're actually gonna do this.

364
00:14:14,547 --> 00:14:18,650
Yeah. You go in first,
and I'll go in a minute.

365
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:24,522
Oh, wow!

366
00:14:24,557 --> 00:14:26,091
Oh, my God!

367
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,476
Oh, this is amazing!

368
00:14:31,514 --> 00:14:33,782
You dirty girl.

369
00:14:33,816 --> 00:14:36,251
Peter, I haven't
left yet.

370
00:14:36,285 --> 00:14:39,087
You sick whore.

371
00:14:39,121 --> 00:14:40,482
Look, it'd just be
temporary, Lois.

372
00:14:40,489 --> 00:14:43,358
Just for a bit, just till we
get the farm back on its feet.

373
00:14:43,392 --> 00:14:45,493
Till we get our family
back on its feet.

374
00:14:45,528 --> 00:14:46,961
I don't know...
Lois, we've always

375
00:14:46,996 --> 00:14:49,097
given our family
whatever it needs.

376
00:14:49,131 --> 00:14:51,199
Well, right now,
our family needs us

377
00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:53,752
to sell illegal drugs to
the tank top community.

378
00:14:53,786 --> 00:14:55,020
What do you say?

379
00:14:57,823 --> 00:15:00,959
All right, Peter, we can make
one meth, and that's it.

380
00:15:00,993 --> 00:15:03,962
And it's only because I don't
see any other way out of this.

381
00:15:03,996 --> 00:15:05,030
Thanks, Lois.

382
00:15:05,064 --> 00:15:06,664
Oh, this is gonna
work out great.

383
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:08,867
Hey, are you guys
gonna feed us anytime soon?

384
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:10,969
No, sorry, we're
doing meth stuff now.

385
00:15:11,003 --> 00:15:12,270
I'll eat that.

386
00:15:12,304 --> 00:15:14,506
You just got clean.

387
00:15:17,977 --> 00:15:19,878
Everyone, now that
I'm a meth dealer,

388
00:15:19,912 --> 00:15:22,464
I'm going to respond
violently to outside noises

389
00:15:22,498 --> 00:15:23,998
that the rest of
you don't hear.

390
00:15:24,033 --> 00:15:25,316
Uh, okay, Peter,
but I...

391
00:15:25,351 --> 00:15:27,268
What was that?!

392
00:15:27,303 --> 00:15:29,287
Dad, I think that
was just a cricket.

393
00:15:29,321 --> 00:15:30,288
Then what the hell was that?!

394
00:15:30,322 --> 00:15:31,656
That was just
me saying,

395
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:32,991
"That was just
a cricket."

396
00:15:33,025 --> 00:15:33,992
Dad, settle down.

397
00:15:34,026 --> 00:15:35,894
There's no one
out there, Peter.

398
00:15:35,928 --> 00:15:37,345
You sure?

399
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:39,013
Yeah, yeah, you're right,
it's probably just a--

400
00:15:39,047 --> 00:15:40,382

Dad, we don't
even have a...

What the hell is
going on out there?!

403
00:15:43,702 --> 00:15:44,836
Come on out,
whoever you are!

404
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,037
I want to show my kids

405
00:15:46,072 --> 00:15:47,672
what it looks like
when a bitch dies!

406
00:15:47,706 --> 00:15:48,840
Peter, there's
no one there.

407
00:15:48,874 --> 00:15:50,241
Well, maybe I
should just fire

408
00:15:50,276 --> 00:15:52,310
a couple of rounds
into the darkness.

409
00:15:54,313 --> 00:15:56,247
Don't hear those
crickets no more.

410
00:15:56,282 --> 00:15:58,083
I'm not...
gonna make it.

411
00:15:58,117 --> 00:15:59,751
You hang in there,
you hear me?

412
00:15:59,785 --> 00:16:00,952
Listen to me.

413
00:16:00,986 --> 00:16:02,987
I want you to take
care of my kids.

414
00:16:03,022 --> 00:16:04,389
I will.

415
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:08,526
And I want you to be there
whenever there's a bad joke.

416

Let them know.
Let them know.

Gee, I hope I didn't
scare the cows.

418

It's my new meth

Oh, yeah,
we're meth dealers now.

Yeah, you missed it.

00:18:22,228 --> 00:18:24,829
Hey, look, our meth
is on the news!

476
00:18:24,863 --> 00:18:26,197
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.

477
00:18:26,232 --> 00:18:29,133
Our top story: Methamphetamine
is flooding into Quahog

478
00:18:29,168 --> 00:18:31,803
in epidemic amounts, and is
believed to be originating

479
00:18:31,837 --> 00:18:34,205
from the nearby
rural community of Farmton.

480
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,907
Farmton-- that's the name
of the place we live.

481
00:18:35,941 --> 00:18:37,041
I forgot to mention
that earlier.

482
00:18:37,076 --> 00:18:38,876
For more on the story,
we now go live

483
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:41,212
to Asian correspondent
Tricia Takanawa.

484
00:18:41,247 --> 00:18:42,547
Tom, meth is fine!
Everything's fine!

485
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:43,898
Go back to your own business!

486
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:45,099
Thanks, Tricia.

487
00:18:45,134 --> 00:18:47,268
She's doing fun things
for me, for money.

488
00:18:47,303 --> 00:18:48,620
Oh, my God.

489
00:18:48,654 --> 00:18:50,588
We're hurting
our own hometown.

490
00:18:50,623 --> 00:18:51,956
All those drugs that are

491
00:18:51,991 --> 00:18:54,108
flooding into Quahog
are from us.

492
00:18:54,143 --> 00:18:55,376
Oh, yeah?

493
00:18:55,411 --> 00:18:57,478
Well, if we're dealing
so many drugs to Quahog,

494
00:18:57,513 --> 00:18:59,697
why is the Quahog envelope
so light this week?

495
00:18:59,732 --> 00:19:01,416
Yeah, I say
we go down there

496
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,401
and talk to
those people in Quahog.

497
00:19:03,452 --> 00:19:05,720
No! This is
what I'm talking about.

498
00:19:05,754 --> 00:19:07,855
Meth has turned
us into monsters.

499
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,857
Lois, take it easy.
No. You know what?

500
00:19:09,892 --> 00:19:11,859
This is my own fault
for listening to you.

501
00:19:11,894 --> 00:19:13,928
I forgot you don't even
know your ass

502
00:19:13,963 --> 00:19:15,630
from a hole
in the ground.

503
00:19:16,649 --> 00:19:19,801
Is that... is that my ass?

504
00:19:19,835 --> 00:19:21,669
Lois, where
the hell you going?

505
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:24,355
I'm going back home to
Quahog, where I belong.

506
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:27,225
If any of you want to come
with me, you're welcome to.

507
00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:28,760
First of all,
you sat in something green

508
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:30,895
and it's on your butt,
so no one's gonna follow you.

509
00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:32,797
And second,
no one's gonna leave a place

510
00:19:32,831 --> 00:19:34,032
where there are
tons of beakers

511
00:19:34,066 --> 00:19:35,967
for a place where
there are zero beakers.

512
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:37,468
Peter, don't you see?

513
00:19:37,503 --> 00:19:39,937
We left Quahog because
of the crime problem.

514
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:42,807
But now we've become
part of that problem.

515
00:19:42,841 --> 00:19:44,709
Yo, what is this bitch
trippin' about?!

516
00:19:44,743 --> 00:19:45,977
Look at our
lives, Peter.

517
00:19:46,011 --> 00:19:47,345
Look at our family.

518
00:19:47,379 --> 00:19:49,514
I don't recognize
us anymore.

519
00:19:49,548 --> 00:19:51,449
It's time to go back
to Spooner Street

520
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:53,484
and be the
Griffins again.

521
00:19:55,554 --> 00:19:56,954
Let's go, Peter.

522
00:19:56,989 --> 00:19:58,990
Let's go back
to Quahog.

523
00:19:58,992 --> 00:20:01,025
But... but what about
this farm?

524
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,327
And this house?

525
00:20:02,361 --> 00:20:05,029
And the lab inside the house,
which is currently producing

526
00:20:05,064 --> 00:20:06,864
an incredibly volatile
and explosive batch

527
00:20:06,899 --> 00:20:08,416
of thermo-reactive chemic...

528
00:20:15,657 --> 00:20:18,843
There were a lot of
Rottweilers in that house.

529
00:20:22,214 --> 00:20:24,582
Well, it's good to be
back in our old house.

530
00:20:24,616 --> 00:20:26,684
How did we get this place
back, by the way?

531
00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:28,720
Well, luckily the value
of this place plummeted

532
00:20:28,754 --> 00:20:30,188
because this is
a meth town now.

533
00:20:30,222 --> 00:20:32,256
You know, I think the
lesson here is that

534
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:35,693
if your community has problems,
you don't abandon it.

535
00:20:35,728 --> 00:20:38,513
It's better to stay put and
help fix those problems.

536
00:20:38,547 --> 00:20:40,348
That's right, Lois, 'cause
wherever you run to,

537
00:20:40,382 --> 00:20:42,450
your problems have a
funny way of finding you.

538
00:20:43,485 --> 00:20:45,253
Hey, are you guys in there?

539
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:47,121
Peter, I need a taste!

540
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,430
Oh, my God, it's Jodie Sweetin.

541
00:20:49,441 --> 00:20:50,775
Quick, everyone
lie on the floor.

542
00:20:51,673 --> 00:20:54,865
Peter, come on! I've got
Maureen McCormick with me.

543
00:20:54,866 --> 00:20:56,266
She'll let you
finish anywhere.

544
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,415
Okay, everyone hide upstairs.
Daddy's gonna take care of this.

545
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:04,416
