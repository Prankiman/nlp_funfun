"Is violence in movies and sex on TV

Merry Christmas, dude.

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,750
Don't put it in your nose. It burns like hell.

12
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,450
Merry Christmas, everybody.

13
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,910
As president of the Quahog
Chamber of Commerce,

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,700
I'd like to thank the Senior Centre
for decorating our tree.

15
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,750
Ooh, broke my hip!

16
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,160
Look, there's the manger
for the Christmas pageant.

17
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,080
You're gonna make
the cutest Baby Jesus ever.

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,370
So, you want to dress me up and trot me
about like a circus poodle, hm?

19
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,330
Let me consult my agent,
Mr Irving R Pointy Stick!

20
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,250
Oh, Stewie, no sweets before dinner.

21
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,750
Mom, I'm freezing. Can we go home?

22
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:22,370
In a minute. Would you just
look at this beautiful tree?

23
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,580
Every year, I look up at that star

24
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,200
and I think of all of the joy and wonder
that Christmas promises

25
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:32,370
and that miracle that occurred
on that silent winter's night.

26
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,790
Hey, I'm on vacation! Happy birthday, Jesus!

27
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:42,290
"Seven maids a-milking,
six maids a-milking, five maids a-milk...

28
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,790
You're not wearing the sweater I made you.

29
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:52,370
- Uh... Well, it's a little warm in here.
- "Don we now our gay apparel. "

30
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,120
Doesn't get much gayer than this.

31
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,000
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve,
and you still haven't gotten a tree.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,870
I told you, I'm on dipsaluscious vacation.
What part of that don't you understand?

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,950
Come on, honey. It's the only thing
I've asked you to do. Please?

34
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,910
Brian, tape this for me.

35
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,580
The VCR hasn't worked since
you tried to tape Monday Night Football.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,330
Do you have the express written consent
of ABC and the NFL?

37
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,910
Just ABC.

38
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:31,250
If you get us a tree, I'll make sure
Santa brings you a new VCR. Please?

39
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,750
Crap. How come I have...? Commercial!

40
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,040
I got something to add to my Christmas list.

41
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,250
Those jewelled bug barrettes. Not costume -
real. Maybe you should write that down.

42
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:51,330
Honey, Santa got all his shopping done
before the rush. I think you'll be very happy.

43
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,750
I just want peace on Earth.

44
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:58,410
That's better than being selfish like Meg,
right? So I should get more than her.

45
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,540
Merry Christmas to all
and to all shut the hell up.

46
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,870
Before you sit, we're due at
Joe and Bonnie's for eggnog.

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,660
- Can't we tell them your mother died?
- I won't lie about something like that.

48
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,580
All right, I'll kill your mother. God, when
did Christmas become so complicated?

49
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,750
- You guys know that Rudolph is on, right?
- Peter!

50
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,370
Thank you for the lovely gingerbread house.

51
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,950
Yeah! It's perfect for
all the happy active gingerbread men.

52
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,450
Except for the one with no legs! Look at
the parents telling their kids not to stare.

53
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:40,080
"How does his pee-pee work, Mommy?"
I've got news for you, Becky. Not so well!

54
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,540
Joe, you promised. It's Christmas.

55
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,540
Joe had his accident at Christmastime.

56
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,540
Heh.

57
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,540
"Check the balls on Uncle Charlie,
fa-la-la-la-la...

58
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,250
Yes! Time to go a-wassailing!

59
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,790
- Hi, Peter.
- Hi, I'm Prancer.

60
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,080
Why don't you take Joe along?

61
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,370
That'll be about as much fun as
a lecture on ontological empiricism.

62
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,410
- What?
- What?

63
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,120
Honey, he could use some Christmas spirit.

64
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,870
- For me? Please?
- All right, all right.

65
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:16,540
But you owe me. Later, under the mistletoe.
Open mouth, no matter how drunk I am.

66
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:24,040
The gifts are in the trunk. Don't forget
to drop off the one for Toys for Toddlers.

67
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,410
All right.

68
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,370
- Somebody give me a beer.
- Heads up.

69
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,660
Yeah, Peter, one of us has
to be the designated driver,

70
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,080
and I've already had four eggnogs,
so I guess you're it.

71
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,540
Ha! That's a good one, Joe.
Way to get into the spirit.

72
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,830
- Oh!
- I'm a cop first, a buddy second,

73
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:44,790
so don't think I wouldn't throw
your drunk-driving ass in the slammer!

74
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,540
All right, let's a-wassail!

75
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,830
Stewie, honey, time for bed.
You have a big day tomorrow, Baby Jesus.

76
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,040
Trust me, if I could walk on water,

77
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,870
I'd stroll you to a lake and hold you under
until the bubbles stopped!

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Oh, someone's being naughty, not nice.

79
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,960
- You know, Santa's watching you.
- What the devil do you mean?

80
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,410
Honey, Santa's making a list
and checking it twice.

81
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,830
- He sees you when you're sleeping.
- He knows when you're awake.

82
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,500
I almost caught him last year. But he's magic!

83
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,460
Constant surveillance
of every child on Earth? Impossible!

84
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,790
Unless... Hidden cameras!

85
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:28,540
Very clever. Watching to see
if I'm naughty are you?

86
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,710
Well, check this twice!

87
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,000
Hey, guys. Check me out.

88
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,160
Whoa! Whoa!

89
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,080
Whoa... Agh!

90
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,120
Whoa. Whoa! Aagh!

91
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,830
Oh, no! Oh, no! I've broken my legs!

92
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,910
That's about as funny as Sinbad.
Not the comedian. He's hilarious.

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,040
The sailor. But then he was
never meant to be funny.

94
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,540
I gotta go to freakin' Toys for Toddlers.

95
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,370
Sounds like somebody's
got a humbug up his butt.

96
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,750
Maybe we should set him up
with another lemon snow cone.

97
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:26,660
No, thanks. The last one you gave me
didn't taste like lemon. It tasted like...

98
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,540
Oh, you guys are asses!

99
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,960
I knew you were awake.

100
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,830
You!

101
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,910
Now, Stewie, you are in my power.

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,160
Agh! No, damn you!
Damn you, let me go! Agh!

103
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,710
Good, Melvin. Nice work, Woodrow.

104
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,910
Excellent, Stewie.

105
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,160
Agh!

106
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:01,120
It was just a dream. I needn't fear this Santa.

107
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,080
If he were omnipotent, he'd have
the fortitude to show himself!

108
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:10,210
See? I'm just barking in the dark.
No one here but me.

109
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,660
All right, where's the wire?
Show yourself, Claus!

110
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,000
- Stewie, go to sleep!
- This doesn't involve you, Lois!

111
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,160
- I don't want to have to come in there.
- I don't want to have to come in there!

112
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,000
Shh. Dad's awake.

113
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,290
- Don't whisper. I don't have a hangover.
- It's a Christmas miracle.

114
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,790
Shouldn't you have your sweater on?

115
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,580
That's for letting Joe
join in your reindeer games.

116
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,660
Now you go relax while I make my little
Christmas angel a big stack of pancakes.

117
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:47,290
If I'm asleep, just stuff 'em in my mouth.

118
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,290
- Just one more thing.
- Lois!

119
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:53,330
I need you to take the presents
out of the trunk.

120
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:58,830
- Aren't you gonna do it?
- I dropped them all off at Toys for Toddlers.

121
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,370
All? One gift was for charity.
The rest were for the family.

122
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,290
No, the rest were from the family.
Were... weren't they?

123
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:11,330
Oh, crap. Since when did they change
the meaning of "for" to "from"?

124
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,250
- They had a meeting about it last night.
- Why wasn't I told?

125
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,750
They sent you a card, but it said "for Peter",

126
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,620
so you must've thought it was from you,
so you didn't, uh...

127
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,210
It's just easier to call you stupid.

128
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,120
You're gonna take back
donated gifts on Christmas Eve?

129
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:36,040
Yep. Now here's the plan: You'll enter
through the air conditioning duct here.

130
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,040
There's a laser grid
three inches above the floor,

131
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,370
so you have to compress your body
to the size of a sponge

132
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,750
and slide underneath like some
kind of weird amphibious dolphin.

133
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,750
Can I buy some pot from you?

134
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,040
- What you want?
- Oh!

135
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,000
So you understand, all these gifts
were supposed to be for my family.

136
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,290
It was just some crazy mix-up.

137
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,750
Kill 'em.

138
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:05,500
No, no, no, it's true.
That remote control car was for my son.

139
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,580
And those barrettes were for my daughter,
and... Where's my VCR?

140
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,710
Dang it, Buck!
It's my turn to use the sexbox!

141
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,870
It's my sexbox! And her name is Sony.

142
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,960
You gave away all the presents?

143
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,370
If you strike me down, I shall become more
powerful than you can possibly imagine.

144
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:28,330
You brought glad tidings to
a family less fortunate than your own.

145
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,460
You're not mad?

146
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:35,500
I am a bit irritated that I have to shop again.
But at least some good came out of it.

147
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,370
So I can drink beer and watch TV?
Because Kiss Saves Santa is on.

148
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,870
But, Mrs Claus, who would kidnap Santa?

149
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,000
Ace, that's what I want you boys to find out.

150
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,000
Someone stole Santa? That does not rock!

151
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,250
Easy, Gene. Guys, let's go save Christmas.

152
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,580
- To the Kisscopter!
- Yay!

153
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:04,370
You can watch all the TV you want...
just as soon as we get back from the mall.

154
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,120
The mall? On Christmas Eve?

155
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,250
I just want this family
to have a perfect Christmas.

156
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,960
And I need a little help, OK?

157
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,830
- Brian, can you turn the oven off at three?
- No problem.

158
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,580
We'll shop, come home, eat,

159
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:21,670
and then it's off to the pageant
to see little Stewie play Baby Jesus.

160
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,710
Yes, yes. By all means
turn me into a child star.

161
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:30,620
Perhaps I can move to Californ-i-a and
wrangle a three-way with the Olsen twins.

162
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,000
There's a spot!

163
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,460
Ah, screw this.

164
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,330
OK, Peter. We'll each take
half the list to save time.

165
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,790
Kids, why don't you
take Stewie to see Santa?

166
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,460
Santa?

167
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,920
No, it's not possible!
Sitting alone in this public setting?

168
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,460
No bulletproof glass?
Claus, you make it too easy.

169
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,790
Change me! I've leaked,
and I won't face him wet!

170
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,920
We return to
"Bob Hope's Christmas With The Troops".

171
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,830
It's good to see you.
I would've been here sooner,

172
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:24,460
but Lincoln gave me
the wrong Gettysburg Address.

173
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,290
How about this having
to sit still for 60 seconds

174
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,870
to have your picture taken?

175
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,080
Ah, sweet! It's Kiss Saves Santa.

176
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,170
Hang on, Santa. We're coming!

177
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,250
Hurry! The eggs are hatching!

178
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,540
- What do we do?
- Wait a second.

179
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,290
Everyone knows pterodactyls
can't stand the screech of a guitar!

180
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,080
- It's working!
- Santa, be careful!

181
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,370
- Careful, Santa!
- Hang on, Santa!

182
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,290
- I was watching that! Hey!
- It'll be on next Christmas.

183
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,580
Who the hell knows when that will be?

184
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,040
Agh!

185
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,500
If I was an oven mitt...

186
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,170
Dammit, Peter!

187
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,170
Ho, ho, ho.
And what can I bring you this year?

188
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,170
A peace offering, is it? Very well.

189
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,710
Trim those gin-soaked whiskers
and bring me plutonium.

190
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:45,290
- Can you be a good boy?
- Hm, your inquiry intrigues me.

191
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,670
Can any of us be good? Are our primal
urges innate or the result of our choices?

192
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,120
OK, wrap it up, kid.

193
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:57,580
All right, Kringle! If the reward is plutonium,
then your wager is accepted. I will be nice.

194
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,710
Good boy! Now, smile for the camera.

195
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:04,880
Yes, yes, smile... like a good boy.

196
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,540
Aha! Meg's barrettes.

197
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,670
You mean Julie's barrettes!

198
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,670
You still want 'em, you bony old blue-hair?

199
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,960
Ow! Ow! Titty-twister! Ow! Hurts!

200
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,460
Hey!

201
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,420
Aha!

202
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,630
All the clown fish and yellow tangs
in the world can't help you now.

203
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,750
That's it? Fish food?
That's your ace in the hole?

204
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,000
Agh! Agh! Oh, God! Agh!

205
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,710
Phew.

206
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,380
Turkey!

207
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:35,080
Lois, it was horrible. The fish were
jumping all over my eyes and in my nose,

208
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:38,210
and one of them muttered
something anti-Semitic.

209
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:43,130
We're almost home, honey. Look.
There's the star on the town Christmas tree.

210
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:46,040
We're following it home,
like the Three Wise Men.

211
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,540
- So, what'd you get him?
- Gold.

212
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:52,080
Gold? I thought we agreed
on a $5 limit here.

213
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:56,960
- I just got him a crappy bottle of myrrh.
- Hello? Frankincense! You always do this!

214
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,040
Look, we'll put everything together
and put all our names on it.

215
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,500
- No!
- That's so chea...

216
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,670
- Yes!
- No! No, no, no, no, no!

217
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,040
You can't...

218
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,040
Oh, my God! Brian, are you OK?

219
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:17,170
I told you we should've left cookies for Santa.

220
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,250
Agh!

221
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:24,790
My couch! My TV! What the hell did you do?

222
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,000
Me? Who the hell buys
a novelty fire extinguisher?

223
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:33,750
Someone who cares enough about physical
comedy to put his family at serious risk.

224
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,540
Boys, please. It's Christmas Eve.

225
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,880
This is a night for magic and wonder and joy.

226
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,080
OK, so a couple of things have gone wrong.
But we can still have a great Christmas.

227
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:51,040
Jeez, kids. I was this close to losing it.
But your mom's right.

228
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,000
Sure I am.
Meg, honey, get me some paper towels.

229
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,040
Let's lose the bad tidings
and find that holiday cheer.

230
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,210
Yeah, all right.

231
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,290
We're out of paper towels.

232
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:08,000
No paper towels? Aaaaagh!

233
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,830
- I was gonna pick at that.
- Shut your fat mouth!

234
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,460
You all think Christmas just happens?

235
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,500
You think all this goodwill falls
from the freakin' sky? It doesn't!

236
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,790
It falls out of my holly-jolly butt!

237
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:27,580
So cook your own damn turkey,
wrap your own damn presents,

238
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:32,500
and while you're at it, you can all
ride a one-horse open sleigh to hell!

239
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,460
Aaagh!

240
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,290
Oh, here's the paper towels.

241
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,330
I-I-I changed my mind.

242
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,670
Clarence, I wanna live again!
I wanna live again!

243
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,330
Whoa!

244
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:58,330
Hey, I guess there's some magic
in that old silk hat.

245
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,880
Merry Christmas!

246
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,250
- Easy, lady.
- You want some of this!

247
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,420
- What the hell is her problem?
- Frosty, let it go!

248
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,000
Just a second.
You got something to say to me?

249
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,500
All he did was wish you a merry Christmas.

250
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,920
Wish? It's easy to wish.

251
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,880
But does anyone take responsibility
and make it happen? No!

252
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,960
You all expect someone else to do it
for you, like Santy Claus or Mommy!

253
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,460
Ah! Ow! What the...?

254
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,840
Take it off! Take it off!

255
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:42,290
Must... kill... star.

256
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,340
Dad, what happened to Mom?
What if she never comes back?

257
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:51,040
If this is the way she's gonna act
at Christmas, do we even want her back?

258
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:56,130
Which is better? Around the waist
or off the shoulder? Waist? Shoulder?

259
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,840
I thought you didn't
wanna be in the pageant.

260
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,250
Megan, Santa would think it terribly naughty
of me not to fulfil my obligation to Mother.

261
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,130
- The pageant means so much to her.
- Where do you think she is?

262
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:11,750
Thank God years ago I planted
a homing device in her skull

263
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,670
for just such an occasion.

264
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,090
I forgot. I also put 'em in some squirrels.

265
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:20,210
This won't do any good.
Let's see if she's at the pageant.

266
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,750
You... you lied to me.

267
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,340
Oh, my God! There's Mom!

268
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,960
Hi, Lois! Do we look like ants down here?

269
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,210
Bite me!

270
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:33,960
Great time last night.
Don't worry. We'll get Lois down.

271
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,880
- Locked and loaded.
- You can't shoot my mom!

272
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,090
Don't worry, kid.
It's just a mild sedative. Go!

273
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:46,250
Hang on. Lois is only up there because we
sucked the Christmas spirit right out of her.

274
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,670
Maybe if she sees the pageant,
it'll bring her around.

275
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:52,920
Trust him. He's seen every
Christmas special ever made.

276
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,130
- Are you wearing a girl's sweater?
- Does that matter now?

277
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,170
You got ten minutes.

278
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,290
Lights, please.

279
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:05,090
As we all know, Christmas
is that mystical time of year

280
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:10,630
when the ghost of Jesus rises from
the grave to feed on the flesh of the living.

281
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:13,630
So we sing Christmas carols
to lull him to sleep.

282
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,960
How dare he say such blasphemy!
I've gotta do something!

283
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:20,290
Bob, there's nothing you can do.

284
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,540
I guess I'll just have to
develop a sense of humour.

285
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:30,290
I am the Virgin Mary.
That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

286
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,840
Oh, our saviour has arrived!

287
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,710
Good evening. I'm playing the role of Jesus,

288
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:41,130
a man once portrayed on the big screen
by Jeffrey Hunter.

289
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:45,630
You may remember him as the actor
replaced by William Shatner on Star Trek.

290
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,210
Mr Hunter was good enough
to die for our sins,

291
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,750
but not quite up to the task
of seducing green women.

292
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:58,340
Anyhoo, the perennial dictum is
to spread goodwill towards all men.

293
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,460
The irony is that this is
contrary to our nature.

294
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:05,710
So why do we do it?
Because we are being watched!

295
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,340
And so we unselfishly think of others,

296
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,960
assured that our good behaviour will
be rewarded with love... and plutonium.

297
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,500
She's not getting it.
OK, take her down.

298
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,380
- Merry Christmas, buddy.
- Wonder what this could be.

299
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,340
Oh.

300
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:41,960
- This Christmas rocks!
- Mom, Stewie's opening his gifts. Mom?

301
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,880
It's OK. Your mom's just
full of Christmas cheer

302
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,130
and enough tranquilliser
to bring down a bull elephant.

303
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:52,170
Honey, you got a little some...
You got a little... Oh, I'll get it.

304
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:57,790
Hungry Hungry Hippos?
Claus, you porcine double-crosser!

305
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,880
- And to think I was nice!
- You got another one, dude.

306
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,210
Plutonium!

307
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:09,380
He is real! He's really, really real!

308
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:13,960
- Did you get everything you wanted?
- You bet. A week's vacation, a new VCR,

309
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,500
and best of all,
my own copy of Kiss Saves Santa.

310
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:24,380
You just practise that guitar, Santa.
Next time we'll let you do a solo.

311
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,340
Don't encourage him!

312
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,170
- From all of us at Family Guy...
- We wish you Christmas joy.

313
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,250
May all your wishes come true...

314
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,250
For every girl and boy.

315
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:44,670
We hope your freakin' holidays
are filled with fun and cheer.

316
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,670
So have a Merry Christmas and...
