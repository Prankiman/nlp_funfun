00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,160
Previously on "Family Guy":

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,880
Oh, my God. Tell your father
not to start the car.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,080
You want my badge number?
Here's my freakin' badge number!

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,880
- I can't lose this case.
- Lois, the case is already over.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,360
Who did this to you?!

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,960
In all my research,
I've never seen a virus reproduce so fast.

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,080
Everyone I told about the file is dead.

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,480
What do you mean, "Cut the blue wire"?
They're all blue.

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,480
Face it. He's never coming out of that coma.

11
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,160
Aaaargh!

12
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,880
Brian's gone to Los Angeles
to find himself.

13
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,560
"It seems today that all you see

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,880
"Is violence in movies and sex on TV

15
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,480
"But where are those
good old-fashioned values

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,280
"On which we used to rely?

17
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,360
"Lucky there's a family guy

18
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,160
"Lucky there's a man who positively can do
all the things that make us

19
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,880
"Laugh and cry

20
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,880
"He's a family guy

21
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,160
Don't throw out Brian's things.

22
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,960
He won't be in LA for ever.
He just needs to find himself.

23
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,360
He's not coming back, Lois.
He just walked out on us.

24
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,880
Oh, boy, did we have some good times.

25
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,680
Here it comes, buddy.

26
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,160
Argh! Oh, God! Oh, God!

27
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,760
Argh! Ow!

28
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,880
What are the odds? Argh!

29
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,160
If he does come back,
I want everything to be how he left it.

30
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,360
Easy! Massage the scalp.

31
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,680
You're washing a baby's hair, not
scrubbing vomit off your Christmas dress.

32
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,880
- We got a letter from Brian.
- Tell him I'm not here.

33
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,560
- Let me see.
- Argh! Argh!

34
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,480
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.
There. All better?

35
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,680
You are some piece of work, lady.
If you... Actually, yes, it is.

36
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,960
"Greetings from California.
I've been very busy. "

37
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,160
"Having a great time trying
to make it as a writer in LA."

38
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,760
"It's as easy as everyone thinks it is. "

39
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,160
"I've been working the room
at a lot of Hollywood parties. " Oh!

40
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,280
Bobby! Loved you in Raging Bull.

41
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,360
Hey, Jodie, how's the baby?

42
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,480
All right.

43
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,480
I need more cheese puffs. Oprah's off the
wagon. No toothpicks. She'll hurt herself.

44
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,760
Did you hear about Jason?
Paramount bought his script.

45
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,960
- They bought Death Spares Not the Tiger?
- 100 grand. Pretty good, huh?

46
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,280
Sheesh. He's been in LA
how long? Unbelievable.

47
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,760
You know he actually called the main
character John Everyman? Come on.

48
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,960
Well, good for him.

49
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,280
Keanu Reeves. Wow.

50
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,280
I don't usually gush, so forgive me, but when
I was writing Coastguard... Oh, I'm a writer.

51
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,680
When I was writing Coastguard,
I couldn't think of anyone other than...

52
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,480
- There's a woodpecker on your head.
- Yeah, he comes and goes.

53
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,560
Now back to "Kids Say the Darndest Things".

54
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,760
It's OK. Take your time. Then what happened?

55
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,880
He... said he would kill me
if I ever said anything.

56
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:40,280
- Do you remember what he looked like?
- Yeah. He had a scar on his arm

57
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,760
and he had a big, stupid, doo-doo head.

58
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,360
A big, stupid, doo-doo head!

59
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,880
Oh, honestly, the things
these children come up with.

60
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:57,160
If you have a child you'd like to exploit to get
a trip to LA, have them try out for our show.

61
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,360
Next auditions in New York
and Quahog, Rhode Island.

62
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,680
- Maybe Stewie could get on that show.
- You must be shrooming.

63
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,680
Yeah! We can get a free trip
to LA and see Brian.

64
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,280
Jeez, I haven't been to California
since I lived with my other family.

65
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,680
Guys, I just got invited to a party
at Sharon Tate's house!

66
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,480
You guys can come, but you gotta
promise not to embarrass me.

67
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,880
Talk! I know you've been plotting
to foil my plans of world domination.

68
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,280
Who are you working for?
The Libyans? The French?

69
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,680
Very well. If torture won't work,
perhaps a little tenderness will.

70
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:39,680
Mm, I like your taste in women. Yes, she and I
are going to have a good time together.

71
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,280
Yes, you like this, don't you?

72
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,280
Oh, God. Look at me having sex
with a pig. I've become my father.

73
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,680
Stewie, let's get your sailor suit.

74
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,480
You gotta look cute
to audition for national TV.

75
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,280
Lois, I told you. There's no way...

76
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,560
National TV, you say? Coast to coast?

77
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,880
That could be the ideal place to unleash my
hypnosis device on the unsuspecting public.

78
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,760
I always loved this little sailor suit.
Or we could do nice corduroys and a sweater.

79
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,080
Or you could make yourself useful
and wipe my button - circular motion.

80
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,960
And don't you look at me!

81
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,360
Oh, my God. That's Michael Eisner.
I'll take it from here, Julio.

82
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,080
Here you go, Mr Eisner. It's been Brian-ised.

83
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,480
You might notice that new-script smell.

84
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,760
Every car I hand-wash
comes with a smile, an air freshener,

85
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,880
and a copy of my coming-of-age
teen comedy set in Wisconsin.

86
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,560
- What's your name?
- Brian.

87
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,560
Let's see. There we go.

88
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,280
Brian.

89
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,280
See you at Disneyland. Bring money.

90
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,480
Look. It's Tom Tucker from the news.
And that must be his son.

91
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,160
- Oh, my.
- I feel bad staring without having got a ticket.

92
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,280
How can I follow that act?
Bite the head off a chicken?

93
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,480
- Dad, they're staring at me.
- They're just jealous.

94
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,960
- You're next.
- Wait. We were next.

95
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,280
Hey! Hey! Don't walk away from me! Hey!

96
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,760
You know what we'll do? We'll get
the video camera and make our own show.

97
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,080
- I don't wanna.
- Yes, you do. You do because it's normal.

98
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,480
Tell us, Stewie. What job does a mommy do?

99
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,160
Interesting question.
More to the point, how does one define "job"

100
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,360
without branding oneself with useless
labels?

101
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,680
I'm sorry. I'm afraid I answered
your question with another question.

102
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,480
Um... How old do you think Daddy is?

103
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,080
42.

104
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,480
Oh. I mean, Daddy's old. I think he's seven.

105
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,960
That's it. That's what you want to hear.
Yes, jump through the hoop.

106
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,160
Daddy's feet smell.

107
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,080
Jackasses.

108
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,960
Mr and Mrs Griffin, he's adorable.

109
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,080
Congratulations.
Stewie's gonna be on the show.

110
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,560
Did you hear that? We're going to Hollywood,
where people are sexy and clever

111
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,480
and always say somethin' funny
before the commercial break.

112
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,480
Great. I always end up
sitting next to a damn baby.

113
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,160
What did you just say?

114
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,760
- Stewie, stop fussing.
- Not now, Lois.

115
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,680
Turn around. If you've got
something to say, say it to my face.

116
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,160
Oh, you can't hear me now? That's it.

117
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,880
I was going to watch the movie,
but forget it. You're now my bitch.

118
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,080
Wah! Wah!

119
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,080
My ears are popping
and there's no way to console me.

120
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:56,160
I'm hungry and possibly teething.
Maybe I'm wet. Who knows? I'm a baby.

121
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,480
Wah! Wah!

122
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,160
This is a message
for Brian. This is Jack Nicholson.

123
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,480
Listen, I read your script
and it just jumped right off the page.

124
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,880
I think it's something I'd be excited
to be a part of, so call my...

125
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:25,080
Listen, I'm just jackin'you. Me and my buddy
Phil just found your script at Starbucks.

126
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,560
- Tell him it sucks.
- Yeah, it sucks.

127
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,680
Give it up, loser, and don't put
your number on the cover, you stupid...

128
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,760
I'm hungry.

129
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,480
Jasper's residence.

130
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,080
- Who the hell is Jasper? Where's Brian?
- Peter? It's me. Jasper's my cousin.

131
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,360
I'm using his place. He's working
at Club Med. Are you on a cell?

132
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,280
- Yeah, we're in LA.
- What? W-What a terrific surprise.

133
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,480
- Brian, can we see you for dinner?
- Yeah, you're not too famous to see us?

134
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,760
Well, I was invited to the premiere
of the new, uh...

135
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,080
the new Val Kilmer picture,
but I'd rather take you out to dinner.

136
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,280
- How about Musso & Frank's at eight?
- OK. See ya later, Mr Big Shot...

137
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,680
Crap. I didn't push "End".
This is gonna cost me a fortune.

138
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,080
Brian! I'm back. Tell me everything.
I'm sitting, I'm hearing.

139
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,080
That's Ricardo. Ricardo, Brian.
He doesn't speak English. Can I? Mm-mm.

140
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,560
Catching up. OK, me first. I'm in love.
Ooh, too much dressing.

141
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,560
He's from the Philippines.
I know - I'm a rice queen.

142
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,880
- How's the writing thingy going?
- Terrible. I can't get my foot in the door.

143
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,280
I have somebody you have to meet.
He's a producer. He's great.

144
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,680
Really? Thanks. That'd be great.

145
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,480
- D'you like sex and the city?
- It's an OK show.

146
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,480
I wasn't talking about the show.
Ooh! I'm nasty.

147
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,560
Someone send me out to sea.

148
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,760
It says here this is the gutter
where the policeman fell over laughing

149
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,560
after Eddie Murphy said he was just
giving the transvestite a ride home.

150
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,560
Oh, I think that's me.

151
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,960
- Hello.
- Hey, Peter. It's Quagmire.

152
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,760
- Hey, Quagmire.
- Last night I had sex with a black chick.

153
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,680
Uh... uh... I gotta go.

154
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,160
- Sorry.
- What? All he said was "black chick".

155
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,480
I know, but your boyfriend looks like
one of your typical angry black guys.

156
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,080
Hey, we cool, G?
Yuh? Yuh? Yuh? All right.

157
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,760
Halle Berry would be perfect as the camp
counsellor all the kids wanna "get with".

158
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,280
Jasper was right. You're very talented.

159
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,760
I'm having a brainstorm.
Ever thought about directing?

160
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,080
- Just every waking hour!
- Well, I got this movie.

161
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,360
It's a low-budget movie,
but the script is solid.

162
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,280
My director quit and I need somebody who's
smart, ambitious and not addicted to meth.

163
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,760
Well, I am smart and ambitious!

164
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,480
- Seriously.
- I'm clean.

165
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,880
Musso & Frank's is famous.
See the bar over there?

166
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:07,080
- Great writers like Hemingway drank there.
- Where'd that guy who wrote Porky's drink?

167
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,360
Oh, man, when that fat broad grabbed
that kid's crank through the hole.

168
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,480
Where do they get their ideas?
You're the writer. You tell me.

169
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,480
Oh, boy. This is great. All that searching,
that emptiness I felt back home, gone.

170
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,760
- I've finally found my life's calling.
- How wonderful.

171
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,560
I've always found your writing
a little hackneyed and stilted,

172
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,560
but I guess that's why I'm not
workin' out here in Hollywood, huh?

173
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:38,160
- Oh, congratulations on all your success.
- Uh, thank you.

174
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,880
- Know what might be a thrill for you guys?
- Ooh! Eating a pebble!

175
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,880
Yes, but I was talking about
stopping by the set to see me in action.

176
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,680
- Brian, could we really?
- You do know somebody in the business.

177
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,680
I'm in the business too, you know.
I'm going to be on television.

178
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,480
- Great.
- And when I make my appearance,

179
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,480
- you'll all be talking about it the next day.
- Good luck with that.

180
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,160
"Good luck with that. " Yutz.

181
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,960
- Hello. Peter Griffin?
- You're in him.

182
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,560
Are you happy with
your long-distance service?

183
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,760
Yes, and I'm tired of you people
always calling during dinner.

184
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,480
- Give me your supervisor.
- Hold, please.

185
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,160
Oh, Peter, I love this song.
Open your mouth.

186
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,960
Brian. Right on time. I like that. Come in.

187
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,480
So, ready to shoot your first scene?

188
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,360
- Sure. Where's the set?
- Second door on your left.

189
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:48,280
- So, this is a shampoo commercial, right?
- Do I have to sleep with the dog in this one?

190
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,680
Can someone fluff Paul?
He's got a windsock thing goin' on.

191
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,160
So, this is a shampoo commercial, right?

192
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,160
Zack, I'm sorry.
There's just no way I can do this.

193
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,680
I've been around.
I've licked my share of peanut butter.

194
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,760
But I think you need
to find yourself a new director.

195
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,080
- Are you sure?
- I just can't do this.

196
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,080
Is this any more degrading than
washing cars? Here you can be creative.

197
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:21,680
I wanna make this perfectly clear. There is
absolutely no way I would consider doing it.

198
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,360
- Unless I saw a script first.
- Of course.

199
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,560
- This isn't bad.
- It's like Bang the Drum Slowly,

200
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,160
except the drum's a chick.

201
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,360
Peter, slow down. Brian said
he was gonna be on the set all day.

202
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,880
"On the set"! Listen to me. Two days in
Hollywood and I sound like a contract player.

203
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,280
Oh, crap. The LAPD.

204
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,760
Argh! Ow! Argh! Ow!

205
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,480
Come on, Peter. I wanna save some tape
for the Hollywood sign.

206
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,160
- OK. Hey, thanks a lot, you guys.
- Our pleasure. Have a nice vacation, sir.

207
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,280
Ooh!

208
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,360
Yes... yes... yes...

209
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,480
Cut. OK, nice take, Jenna, but let's try
giving the lines a little subtext this time.

210
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,960
Your husband's always away on business
and you feel isolated and unloved,

211
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,360
so you begin to think maybe
you should go back to graduate school.

212
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,280
That's when you notice
the cable man has no pants on.

213
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,960
Wow, a real movie set.
Hey, this house looks kinda familiar.

214
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,880
I'll bet Samuel L Jackson is here.
He's in everything. There's Brian!

215
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:46,960
All right, Samuel, when you lay her down,
I want you to enter from... Oh, my God!

216
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,080
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey, Brian. Can I be in the movie?

217
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,160
The Jacuzzi girl didn't show. How long
can you hold your breath under water?

218
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:59,160
- Real long. One time at Hatch Pond...
- No, absolutely not. You gotta leave.

219
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,880
- Get these people out.
- Now you're a director, we embarrass you?

220
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,080
- No, no... I mean, yes.
- Does anyone else smell Astroglide?

221
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,880
You're gonna look so handsome.

222
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:16,560
Look at these crow's-feet. God. You stay up
past 7.30 and you pay for it in the morning.

223
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,880
- Who the hell does Brian think he is?
- Maybe he thought we'd get in the way.

224
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,880
It's not the first time
you've disrupted a performance.

225
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,760
Oh, jeez. Oh, God. I didn't see it.

226
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,560
It jumped right out in front of my car.
Oh, I am so sorry.

227
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:42,960
We just have to face it. Brian's a Hollywood
director, and we're small-town people.

228
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,480
- All right, one more. Uh, Rob Lowe?
- Straight.

229
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,960
- No!
- Yes.

230
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,280
- Stop.
- Ho-hum.

231
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,360
- Pull over.
- Absolutely.

232
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,760
- Oh, well, he hides it well.
- He wishes.

233
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,480
Stewie. That's a funny name. Stewie.

234
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,680
It's like stew, only with an "ie!" at the end.

235
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,880
- Hm.
- I meant it's funny, Stewie.

236
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,080
I had an uncle named Stewie,
and he used to sell bicycles.

237
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,760
Aren't you supposed to be
asking me a question?

238
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,560
What do you think candies are made out of?

239
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,160
Sunshine and farts. What a silly question.

240
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:24,280
I love candy. When I was a little boy
we would play stickball.

241
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,560
No, no, I'll wait. Oh, you finished?

242
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:33,560
Sorry. I thought the name of the show
was Kids Say the Darndest Things,

243
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,760
not Old Black Comedians
Never Shut the Hell Up.

244
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,080
- Ask me what I want to be when I grow up.
- And we also used to play buck-buck.

245
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:46,160
Enough of your blether. Good evening, world.
From this moment on, I will be your...

246
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,760
What you got there?
Oh, you're gonna go skiing now?

247
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,360
Give that back. They're of no use to you.

248
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,960
Oh, I'm going down the mountain.
Coo-coo-cachoo.

249
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,360
No! Don't listen to him.

250
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,160
That's not funny. That's just saying
what happens when you go skiing.

251
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,280
Here I go, down the slope.

252
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,960
Ooh, I'm goin' zip-zop, zooba-de-bop.

253
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:17,280
Stop it. Stop applauding him.
He's not even using real words any more.

254
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,760
We'll be back with a girl from Atlanta
who skips rope with her sister's pigtails.

255
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,480
Coo-coo!

256
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:29,360
- No, my segment's not over!
- Come on, you like to jump rope, don't ya?

257
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:35,680
- I like jump rope.
- So you're gonna sit here and enjoy it.

258
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,080
I'm gonna sit here and enjoy it.
And I like pudding.

259
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,560
And Ghost Dad was the best movie
I've seen since Leonard Part 6.

260
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,160
- Good news.
- What? More people I love think I'm a jerk?

261
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,160
You're more than that, Mr "Nominated
for an Adult Movie Award for Director".

262
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,760
- A Woody? I'm up for a Woody?
- Call your family. They'll be proud of you.

263
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,680
I'd rather they think I'm a jerk
than a smut pedlar.

264
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,480
They'll love you even if you made
a couple of crappy movies.

265
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,560
Blythe Danner still loves Gwyneth Paltrow.
Oops! Score one for me.

266
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:20,360
Welcome back to E's Adult Video Awards
Pre-show. It's a good crowd tonight, Mom.

267
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,680
It sure is, Melissa.
All the studs and sluts are arriving.

268
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,560
- Brian. Brian!
- Oh, hey.

269
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,760
You're nominated for three films
you directed yesterday.

270
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,160
Add Mama to the Train,
The Purple Head of Cairo and, uh...

271
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,480
- What was the third one?
- You've Got Male Genitalia.

272
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:47,080
I was asked to star in a porno, but I couldn't
cos most of my body's less than 18 years old.

273
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:52,560
- I used to guest-host The Tonight Show.
- Oh, yeah. What was that, 30 years ago?

274
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,680
Your mike isn't plugged in.

275
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,960
- You're not even on TV right now, are you?
- In my mind.

276
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:06,880
The next award is for Best Original Score in
an adult film. The nominees are: Ron Jones.

277
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,680
Walter Murphy.

278
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,480
And John Williams.

279
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,360
You've come a long way
from hiding from the vacuum cleaner.

280
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,360
- Lois!
- Hey, buddy. How are ya, Alfred Hitch Cock?

281
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,360
You like that one, Dick Hertz? Huh?
I'm sorry. I'm already drunk.

282
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,960
- How did you guys know I'd...
- Jasper called.

283
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,480
- Why didn't you tell us?
- I thought you'd be ashamed of me.

284
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,560
No! I oughta knock you out
for not bringing me here sooner.

285
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,960
The pair on that one's
bigger than your head.

286
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:54,280
- So you guys aren't offended by this?
- I can't say I approve but... we love you.

287
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,360
If this is what makes you happy,
we support you.

288
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,480
My God. I thought I needed to get away from
you guys to find what was missing in my life,

289
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,360
but the only thing I'm missing is my family.

290
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,160
How could I have become involved
in this degrading business?

291
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,480
And the award goes to...
Brian Griffin.

292
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,160
Whoo!

293
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,360
Whoo! Oh, wow. My God. Oh!

294
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,360
This is unexpected.

295
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,480
I wanna thank my incredible team,

296
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,680
who've been with me from Shaving
Private Ryan to Welcome to my Face.

297
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,680
He lives with us back in Quahog.

298
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:39,760
You got a nice wiggle, baby. You wanna be
in a movie? A little girl-girl action maybe?

299
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,360
- Oh... Peter!
- Good luck, buddy.

300
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,280
I've been barking up that tree for 17 years.

301
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,960
Wow. That was a wonderful trip, and
everyone has something to remember it by.

302
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,560
You're gonna love it at our house,
Jenna Jameson.
