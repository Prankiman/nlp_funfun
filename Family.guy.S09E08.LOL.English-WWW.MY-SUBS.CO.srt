12
00:00:34,328 --> 00:00:35,762
Okay, okay, I got one.

13
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:39,399
Would you rather have dinner and
then sex with Megan Fox's body

14
00:00:39,466 --> 00:00:41,100
with Leonard Nimoy's head on it

15
00:00:41,168 --> 00:00:43,736
or re-roof an entire
condo complex by yourself?

16
00:00:43,804 --> 00:00:44,971
Oh, boy.

17
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,339
Can I close my eyes?

18
00:00:46,407 --> 00:00:48,975
No, eye contact the whole time
and a lot of kissing.

19
00:00:49,043 --> 00:00:51,944
Well, how about Megan Fox's head
on Leonard Nimoy's body?

20
00:00:52,012 --> 00:00:53,613
I know, somehow that's better.

21
00:00:53,681 --> 00:00:56,015
The hybrid organism exists
as I've described it.

22
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,417
How many units
are in the condo?

23
00:00:57,484 --> 00:00:58,418
Thirty-two.

24
00:00:58,485 --> 00:00:59,619
Tile roof or shingles?

25
00:00:59,687 --> 00:01:00,753
Yeah, 'cause it
makes a difference

26
00:01:00,821 --> 00:01:01,888
what you're carrying
up that ladder.

27
00:01:01,955 --> 00:01:03,323
- Wait, whose neck is it?
- Huh?

28
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,624
I mean, where's the cutoff?

29
00:01:04,692 --> 00:01:06,292
You know,
is it Megan Fox's neck

30
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,594
or am I burying my face in
Leonard Nimoy's turkey gizzard?

31
00:01:08,662 --> 00:01:09,829
Nimoy's neck.

32
00:01:09,897 --> 00:01:11,564
You have got yourself a roof.

33
00:01:11,632 --> 00:01:13,299
I'll take the
Spock-Fox intercourse.

34
00:01:13,367 --> 00:01:14,567
All right, Peter, your turn.

35
00:01:14,635 --> 00:01:17,770
Uh...
Boxers or briefs?

36
00:01:17,838 --> 00:01:19,005
What?

37
00:01:19,073 --> 00:01:20,707
That's the worst one
I've ever heard.

38
00:01:20,774 --> 00:01:23,009
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm exhausted, all right?

39
00:01:23,077 --> 00:01:24,444
I didn't get any sleep
'cause Brian

40
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:26,479
and the neighbor's dog
kept me up all night.

41
00:01:26,547 --> 00:01:28,581
BRIAN:
Hello?

42
00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:30,249
BRIAN: Hello?
DOG: Hello.

43
00:01:30,317 --> 00:01:31,951
BRIAN: Are you a dog?
DOG: Yes!

44
00:01:32,019 --> 00:01:33,219
BRIAN: I am also a dog.

45
00:01:33,287 --> 00:01:34,554
DOG: All right!
BRIAN: Yeah!

46
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:35,755
DOG: We're dogs!
BRIAN: Yeah, we're dogs!

47
00:01:35,823 --> 00:01:37,357
DOG: We're dogs that
live near each other!

48
00:01:37,424 --> 00:01:38,791
DOG #2:
Hey, are you guys dogs?

49
00:01:38,859 --> 00:01:40,059
DOG: Yeah!
We're totally dogs!

50
00:01:40,127 --> 00:01:41,227
BRIAN: Yeah, both of us!

51
00:01:41,295 --> 00:01:42,862
Oh, wow.
Well, if you're that tired, Peter,

52
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,197
maybe you should
have some coffee.

53
00:01:44,264 --> 00:01:45,898
Yeah, or you could
have some Red Bull.

54
00:01:45,966 --> 00:01:47,500
Red Bull?
What the hell is Red Bull?

55
00:01:47,568 --> 00:01:48,735
You never heard of Red Bull?

56
00:01:48,802 --> 00:01:49,869
It's an energy drink.

57
00:01:49,937 --> 00:01:52,305
Here you go, Peter.
It's on the house.

58
00:01:56,377 --> 00:01:59,746

70
00:02:35,115 --> 00:02:37,784
Oh, my God,
this is gonna be so amazing!

71
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:40,353
It's all anybody in my class
is talking about.

72
00:02:40,421 --> 00:02:42,655
Darn it, why is this so hard?!

73
00:02:42,723 --> 00:02:44,323
What's wrong, Chris?

74
00:02:44,391 --> 00:02:47,093
Just 'cause Obama's coming,
everybody in my English class

75
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:49,562
has to write a stupid
essay about hope.

76
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,798
But this is all I
can come up with.

77
00:02:51,865 --> 00:02:54,767
Chris, this is just a shaded-in
triangle and the word "muff."

78
00:02:54,835 --> 00:02:56,636
For God's sakes, Meg,
it's a first draft.

79
00:02:56,703 --> 00:02:58,571
Just tell me if you
think the tone is right.

80
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,939
Well, I don't know
what this is,

81
00:03:00,007 --> 00:03:01,874
but it's not what hope
is about, Chris.

82
00:03:01,942 --> 00:03:05,044
Well, if you're such a genius,
you tell me what hope is.

83
00:03:05,112 --> 00:03:08,748
Hope is what gets you
out of bed in the morning

84
00:03:08,816 --> 00:03:11,818
when it's the day of prom
and you haven't been asked.

85
00:03:11,885 --> 00:03:14,253
Hope pushes the caterpillar
through the cocoon

86
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:16,823
and drives the salmon upstream.

87
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:20,326
Your breasts may be small
and your glasses may be thick,

88
00:03:20,394 --> 00:03:21,994
but hope doesn't
hold up a mirror.

89
00:03:22,062 --> 00:03:24,130
Hope is a horizon we head for,

90
00:03:24,198 --> 00:03:26,666
leaving nothing behind us
but fear.

91
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:29,001
And though we may
never reach our goals,

92
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:32,405
it's hope that will save us
from who we once were.

93
00:03:32,473 --> 00:03:33,873
Wow.

94
00:03:33,941 --> 00:03:35,408
Did you learn that at school?

95
00:03:35,476 --> 00:03:38,211
No. You can't just learn
creative writing, Chris.

96
00:03:38,278 --> 00:03:41,914
It's got to be inside you,
like musical talent

97
00:03:41,982 --> 00:03:45,485
or athleticism or the ability
to choose to be gay.

98
00:03:45,552 --> 00:03:47,086
I don't think they choose that.

99
00:03:47,154 --> 00:03:49,922
Oh, please, they choose that.

100
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,492
(doorknob rattling)

101
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:54,627
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey!

102
00:03:54,695 --> 00:03:56,162
What's up, party people?
Ah, what the hell

103
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,030
are these things,
curtains or something? Boring!

104
00:03:58,098 --> 00:03:59,732
- Holy smoke, it's crowded in here.
- Hey!

105
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,801
There, ah, that's terrific.
It opens up the whole room.

106
00:04:01,869 --> 00:04:02,869
Peter, there you are.

107
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,870
Where the hell have you been?

108
00:04:03,937 --> 00:04:05,137
I've been worried sick.

109
00:04:05,205 --> 00:04:06,939
Oh, so I had a few Red Bulls,
drove to New York.

110
00:04:07,007 --> 00:04:08,457
What's the big deal?
Ah, there's my little man!

111
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:10,593
(shuddering)

112
00:04:17,518 --> 00:04:18,584
Done!

113
00:04:18,652 --> 00:04:20,853
Wow, Dad, that was pretty cool.

114
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:21,954
Can I try some Red Bull?

115
00:04:22,022 --> 00:04:23,222
Oh, my God,
can you try some Red Bull?

116
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,657
Chris, I'd take it
as an insult if you didn't.

117
00:04:24,725 --> 00:04:26,292
Here you go, have some cans,
one, two, three, four, five.

118
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,060
Go on, take 'em, take 'em,
take 'em, take 'em, take 'em.

119
00:04:28,111 --> 00:04:29,362
(laughs)
That's what Woody Woodpecker says.

120
00:04:29,429 --> 00:04:30,830
All right, I'm gonna go outside
and milk the cow.

121
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:35,134
Peter, where'd you get that cow?

122
00:04:35,202 --> 00:04:36,536
Oh, that's a silly question, Lois.

123
00:04:36,603 --> 00:04:38,538
I bought it so we can have
fresh milk every day.

124
00:04:41,642 --> 00:04:43,309
(mooing)

125
00:04:43,377 --> 00:04:45,611
Whoa, boy, that Red Bull's
some strong stuff.

126
00:04:45,679 --> 00:04:47,213
(screaming)

127
00:04:54,087 --> 00:04:55,421
Hey, everybody, welcome back
to <i>The Price ls Right.</i>

128
00:04:55,472 --> 00:04:56,489
Time to spin the wheel.

129
00:04:56,557 --> 00:04:57,623
Top winner
for the day is Peter,

130
00:04:57,691 --> 00:04:59,124
so you're gonna be
the first to spin it.

131
00:04:59,176 --> 00:05:00,359
Go ahead, Peter, close as you can

132
00:05:00,427 --> 00:05:02,562
to a dollar without going over.

133
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:04,463
(beeping)

134
00:05:06,783 --> 00:05:08,117
All right, while we're waiting
for the wheel to spin,

135
00:05:08,185 --> 00:05:09,335
you want to say hi to anybody?

136
00:05:09,403 --> 00:05:10,736
Oh, yeah, Drew,
I want to say hi to

137
00:05:10,804 --> 00:05:12,405
Lois, Brian, Chris, Stewie,
Meg, Joe, Bonnie, Quagmire,

138
00:05:12,472 --> 00:05:14,307
Cleveland, Mort, Seamus,
Adam West, Dr. Hartman, Bruce,

139
00:05:14,374 --> 00:05:16,342
Carter, Babs, Tom Tucker,
Angela, Opie, Carl, Herbert,

140
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,477
Jillian, Consuela, Giant Chicken
and Greased-up Deaf Guy!

141
00:05:18,545 --> 00:05:19,679
(chuckles):
Okay.

142
00:05:19,746 --> 00:05:21,847
I'm sure they're
happy to hear that.

143
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,251
(crowd screaming)

144
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:29,388
Whoa, paramedics, come on down!

145
00:05:29,456 --> 00:05:31,290
(laughing frantically)

146
00:05:39,232 --> 00:05:40,633
Mom, oh, my God, guess what!

147
00:05:40,701 --> 00:05:42,802
Oh, God! You scared
the (bleep) out of me.

148
00:05:42,869 --> 00:05:45,271
You know that essay about hope
I had to write?

149
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:47,873
Well, the principal said it was
the best one in the class,

150
00:05:47,941 --> 00:05:50,743
and he wants me to read it aloud
to introduce the President!

151
00:05:50,811 --> 00:05:53,079
Ah, Chris, that's incredible!

152
00:05:53,146 --> 00:05:55,514
Remember when I used to
come to school to wipe you,

153
00:05:55,582 --> 00:05:58,117
and I'd say, "Someday I won't
have to wipe you anymore

154
00:05:58,185 --> 00:05:59,952
and you'll do great things"?

155
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,355
Well, this has been
a big year for us.

156
00:06:02,422 --> 00:06:04,940
Wait a second. Give me that.

157
00:06:05,008 --> 00:06:06,976
"Hope pushes the caterpillar
through the cocoon

158
00:06:07,044 --> 00:06:09,111
and drives the salmon upstream."

159
00:06:09,179 --> 00:06:10,680
I wrote that!

160
00:06:10,747 --> 00:06:12,148
You stole this from me.

161
00:06:12,215 --> 00:06:14,116
Hey, you didn't say I couldn't use it.

162
00:06:14,184 --> 00:06:16,819
But now you get to meet the
President of the United States

163
00:06:16,887 --> 00:06:18,321
because of what I wrote.

164
00:06:18,388 --> 00:06:20,856
Ugh! I bet you don't even
know what his first name is.

165
00:06:20,924 --> 00:06:23,225
I don't know... Mike?

166
00:06:25,212 --> 00:06:26,746
Hey, what are you doing?

167
00:06:26,813 --> 00:06:30,149
Lois, where is my Red Bull?

168
00:06:30,217 --> 00:06:31,617
Peter, I got rid of it.

169
00:06:31,685 --> 00:06:33,185
Why the hell
would you do that?!

170
00:06:33,253 --> 00:06:35,888
It was making you crazy,
and it's not good for you.

171
00:06:35,956 --> 00:06:38,090
That's why I poured it
all out in the garden.

172
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:44,897
(grunting)

173
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:47,650
(tires screech)

174
00:06:47,718 --> 00:06:50,670
Official flower business.

175
00:06:50,737 --> 00:06:52,371
(tires screeching)

176
00:06:55,042 --> 00:06:56,342
What are you doing, Peter?

177
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:57,843
I'm making my own Red Bull.

178
00:06:57,911 --> 00:06:59,845
Lois can't stop me
from experiencing

179
00:06:59,913 --> 00:07:02,448
the manic highs and
lows my body demands.

180
00:07:02,516 --> 00:07:04,383
Whoa, whoa, hang on,
you're adding kerosene?

181
00:07:04,451 --> 00:07:05,651
Peter, that's insane.

182
00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:06,952
That'll destroy your body.

183
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,421
Kerosene is fuel, Brian.

184
00:07:08,488 --> 00:07:09,789
Red Bull is fuel.

185
00:07:09,856 --> 00:07:10,923
Kerosene is Red Bull.

186
00:07:10,991 --> 00:07:12,158
Now, why don't you
leave me alone

187
00:07:12,225 --> 00:07:13,626
while I'm doing
my important work?

188
00:07:13,694 --> 00:07:14,827
(blender whirring)

189
00:07:14,895 --> 00:07:16,562
Peter, that drink will kill you.

190
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,765
Brian, whatever kills
me makes me stronger.

191
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:20,866
(sighs)

192
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:22,968
See, Brian?
I feel great.

193
00:07:23,036 --> 00:07:24,603
Peter?

194
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,539
Peter, are you alive?

195
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,510
(groaning)

196
00:07:31,578 --> 00:07:32,511
Ah, you're alive.

197
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:34,413
Okay, I won't, uh...

198
00:07:34,481 --> 00:07:37,216
I won't, uh, eat you then.

199
00:07:37,284 --> 00:07:38,784
I was gonna eat you.

200
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,557
Dr. Hartman,

201
00:07:44,624 --> 00:07:47,259
please tell me,
is my husband gonna be all right?

202
00:07:47,327 --> 00:07:48,661
Uh, Cancun, actually,
thanks for asking.

203
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:49,929
Just got back.

204
00:07:49,996 --> 00:07:52,098
Mrs. Griffin,
I'm afraid all the toxic chemicals

205
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:54,400
your husband ingested from
his homemade energy drink

206
00:07:54,468 --> 00:07:55,768
have caused total kidney failure.

207
00:07:55,836 --> 00:07:58,571
(all gasping)

208
00:07:58,638 --> 00:08:00,339
How was Cancun?

209
00:08:04,746 --> 00:08:06,814
(gasps)
Oh, my God.

210
00:08:06,876 --> 00:08:08,276
Kidney failure?

211
00:08:08,344 --> 00:08:09,677
Is he gonna be okay?

212
00:08:09,745 --> 00:08:11,045
Well, yes and no.

213
00:08:11,113 --> 00:08:12,780
We'll put him on
a kidney transplant list,

214
00:08:12,848 --> 00:08:14,115
but that could take months.

215
00:08:14,183 --> 00:08:16,284
Until a donor is found,
he's gonna have to undergo

216
00:08:16,352 --> 00:08:17,986
dialysis treatments
three times a week.

217
00:08:18,053 --> 00:08:19,320
Dialysis?

218
00:08:19,388 --> 00:08:20,989
Is there any other way?

219
00:08:21,056 --> 00:08:22,690
Yes, there is.

220
00:08:22,758 --> 00:08:23,925
No, no, no, no, no!

221
00:08:23,993 --> 00:08:25,660
We'll do the dialysis.

222
00:08:30,966 --> 00:08:32,300
Hey, Doc,
I'm here for my dialysis.

223
00:08:32,368 --> 00:08:35,270
Ah, have a seat, Peter.
Let's get you hooked up.

224
00:08:35,337 --> 00:08:37,272
Doc, I don't know how much
more of this I can take.

225
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:38,139
It's been three weeks.

226
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:39,657
I know, I saw the caption.

227
00:08:39,742 --> 00:08:41,809
Yeah, but I just go crazy
just sitting here for so long.

228
00:08:41,877 --> 00:08:43,211
Aw, I know it's tough,

229
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,113
but maybe there's something
I can do to make it easier.

230
00:08:45,181 --> 00:08:47,315
Here, play with this
bucket of afterbirth.

231
00:08:51,187 --> 00:08:52,420
Ha!

232
00:08:52,488 --> 00:08:53,688
<i>The Lockhorns</i>.

233
00:08:53,756 --> 00:08:55,557
Always locking horns.

234
00:08:55,624 --> 00:08:58,092
(gasps)
Oh, my God, that's why they call it that.

235
00:09:02,831 --> 00:09:04,632
Oh, Peter,
you got here just in time!

236
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,733
Chris is almost on.

237
00:09:05,801 --> 00:09:07,602
Shh. Mom, here it is.

238
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,470
<i>As Quahog prepares

245
00:09:23,586 --> 00:09:25,620

00:09:28,691 --> 00:09:29,624
<i>Well, there you go.</i>

249
00:09:29,692 --> 00:09:30,725
<i>I suspected angels.</i>

00:09:30,793 --> 00:09:31,926
<i>- It was angels.
- Very good.</i>

253

<i>A weaver of dreams at

254
00:09:40,469 --> 00:09:41,936

Oh, Chris,
we are so proud of you.

257
00:09:46,242 --> 00:09:48,276
I got to admit, Chris,
this is pretty exciting.

258
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:50,612
When did you become so coherent?

259
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,547
Mom, I wrote that!

260
00:09:52,615 --> 00:09:54,749
He stole it,
and he's taking all the credit!

261
00:09:54,817 --> 00:09:56,284
Chris, is that true?

262
00:09:56,352 --> 00:09:57,652
You didn't write anything!

263
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,120
This is my essay!

264
00:09:59,188 --> 00:10:00,655
Meg, is that true?

265
00:10:00,723 --> 00:10:02,423
No, he's lying!

266
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:04,726
That should be me getting
to meet the President!

267
00:10:04,793 --> 00:10:06,327
Meg, for God's sake, relax.

268
00:10:06,395 --> 00:10:08,696
You're not the first person
to be outshined by a sibling.

269
00:10:08,764 --> 00:10:10,531
What about the third
Bronte sister?

270
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:14,068
Oh, Emily,
<i>Wuthering Heights</i> was truly splendid.

271
00:10:14,136 --> 00:10:17,605
Oh, no, Charlotte,
<i>Jane Eyre</i> was so very brilliant.

272
00:10:17,673 --> 00:10:19,807
I made blood out me lady parts!

273
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:20,875
Good for you.

274
00:10:20,943 --> 00:10:22,176
So we've all done something.

275
00:10:22,244 --> 00:10:24,078
It's happening now.

276
00:10:24,146 --> 00:10:25,747
Ah, it's a period joke.

277
00:10:25,814 --> 00:10:27,248
It's a period period joke.

278
00:10:27,316 --> 00:10:28,249
Ha, ha.

279
00:10:28,317 --> 00:10:29,317

282
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,861
Aw, I want to watch this,
but I got stupid dialysis at 3:00.

283
00:10:39,928 --> 00:10:42,463
I am so sick of this crap
mucking up my life.

284
00:10:42,531 --> 00:10:44,565
Well, Peter, I mean, what,
you can get away with

285
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:45,733
skipping one treatment, right?

286
00:10:45,801 --> 00:10:47,302
I mean, that's not gonna kill you.

287
00:10:47,369 --> 00:10:49,137
Yeah, it's probably just
like missing an antibiotic.

288
00:10:49,204 --> 00:10:50,338
You just take the next one.

Yeah, you're probably right.

Besides,
it's <i>Charles in Charge.</i>

JOE:
You know what I like?

292
00:10:54,476 --> 00:10:55,810
The "Charles" part is formal,

293
00:10:55,878 --> 00:10:59,047
but the "In Charge"
part is kind of casual.

294
00:10:59,114 --> 00:11:00,631
QUAGMIRE:
Oh, wow. Remember this?

295
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:03,184
Remember when nobody had
any muscle tone?

296
00:11:03,252 --> 00:11:05,586
Geez, how many "A's"
does that guy need?

297
00:11:05,654 --> 00:11:07,355
JOE:
Uh, two, apparently.

298
00:11:07,423 --> 00:11:09,324
QUAGMIRE: You know,
it's kinda weird that '80s white clothes

299
00:11:09,391 --> 00:11:11,292
could pass for '90s black clothes.

300
00:11:11,343 --> 00:11:13,828
JOE: Yeah, is that like
a rummage sale thing?

301
00:11:13,896 --> 00:11:15,863

QUAGMIRE:
I don't know.

304
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,569
JOE: Yeah, I feel like she
banged somebody gross.

305
00:11:21,636 --> 00:11:22,937
QUAGMIRE: You know,
I heard the sweater budget

306
00:11:22,988 --> 00:11:25,440
on this show was 200 grand.

307

Oh, my God!

309
00:11:29,611 --> 00:11:30,912
Peter, you don't look so good.

310
00:11:30,979 --> 00:11:33,014
What are you talkin' about?
I feel great.

311
00:11:33,082 --> 00:11:35,083
Like I could go
another twenty years or more.

312
00:11:40,956 --> 00:11:43,691
Dr. Hartman,
this was just too close a call.

Next time, we could be too late.

314
00:11:45,961 --> 00:11:48,792
Suppose he's stuck somewhere,
or he's trapped in an elevator

315
00:11:48,816 --> 00:11:50,498
or God knows what else?!

316
00:11:50,566 --> 00:11:52,834
He could die!
He needs a new kidney now!

317
00:11:52,901 --> 00:11:55,203
Well, as I said,
Mrs. Griffin, he's on a list,

318
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,372
but there are a lot
of people ahead of him.

319
00:11:57,439 --> 00:12:00,208
Well, what are the chances of
getting him moved up the list?

320
00:12:00,275 --> 00:12:02,243
Honestly, not great.
It could be months

321
00:12:02,311 --> 00:12:03,678
before he can get a transplant.

322
00:12:03,746 --> 00:12:05,680
Unless you know someone
who's a compatible organ match

323
00:12:05,748 --> 00:12:07,615
and would be willing
to donate one of theirs.

324
00:12:07,683 --> 00:12:10,151
I'll do it.
He could have one of my kidneys.

325
00:12:10,219 --> 00:12:12,520
Well, we always check spouse
records for compatibility.

326
00:12:12,588 --> 00:12:13,888
I'm afraid you're not a match.

327
00:12:13,956 --> 00:12:16,524
But it turns out you are a match
for a little girl

328
00:12:16,592 --> 00:12:18,459
who's dying in that next room
over there.

329
00:12:18,527 --> 00:12:21,763
Oh, well, how 'bout we
concentrate on this family, Doctor?

330
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,698
Well, the only other
option is your children.

331
00:12:23,766 --> 00:12:25,733
No, I won't put the kids
through that.

332
00:12:25,801 --> 00:12:27,802
Well, then I don't know
what else to do.

333
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,370
You'll just have to roll the dice

334
00:12:29,438 --> 00:12:30,938
and hope a kidney
comes through soon.

335
00:12:31,006 --> 00:12:34,108
Well...
What about me?

336
00:12:34,176 --> 00:12:36,744
Is that possible, Doctor?

337
00:12:36,812 --> 00:12:38,880
Well... I suppose.

338
00:12:38,947 --> 00:12:40,481
Stranger things have
happened in medicine.

339
00:12:40,549 --> 00:12:42,417
I once tried to clone a chicken.

340
00:12:42,484 --> 00:12:44,752
The result wound up
being a man-sized chicken

341
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,355
that was incredibly hostile and
ended up escaping from the lab.

342
00:12:47,423 --> 00:12:49,657
Okay, Doc, we gotta have
a talk at some point,

343
00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:51,993
but Brian, are... Are you...
Are you sure about this?

344
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,862
Well, there's no harm in
seeing if I'm compatible.

345
00:12:59,034 --> 00:13:02,236
Well, according to these results,
Brian is a match.

346
00:13:02,287 --> 00:13:03,504
(all cheering)

347
00:13:03,572 --> 00:13:05,907
Hooray, yay, yeah,
ice cream sounds great.

348
00:13:05,974 --> 00:13:08,009
The only thing is...

349
00:13:08,076 --> 00:13:10,778
Mrs. Griffin, could I speak with
you and Brian alone, please?

350
00:13:10,846 --> 00:13:12,213
Well, of course.

351
00:13:12,264 --> 00:13:14,715
- Kids, why don't you wait in the car?
- Okay, Mom.

352
00:13:14,783 --> 00:13:16,884
Let's go find the big, black sassy nurse.

353
00:13:16,935 --> 00:13:18,486
There's always one.

354
00:13:18,554 --> 00:13:21,322
NURSE: You can cry about it,
or you can decide to live.

355
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,390
It's your choice.

356
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:23,324
STEWIE:
Found her.

357
00:13:23,392 --> 00:13:25,226
Hey, what is it, Doc?

358
00:13:25,294 --> 00:13:28,196
Well, as a dog,
Brian's kidneys are smaller

359
00:13:28,263 --> 00:13:30,598
and don't have the capacity
of a human kidney.

360
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,033
For the procedure to work,

361
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,802
we would need to transplant two.

362
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,505
But... But I only have two.

363
00:13:37,573 --> 00:13:38,773
That's right.

364
00:13:38,841 --> 00:13:40,475
The procedure would kill you.

365
00:13:42,277 --> 00:13:44,645
Ha ha, that car's gettin' towed!

366
00:13:48,971 --> 00:13:52,046
My God, Dr. Hartman,
isn't there any other way?

367
00:13:52,146 --> 00:13:54,514
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Griffin.

368
00:13:54,582 --> 00:13:55,982
BRIAN:
I'll do it.

369
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,717
What?

370
00:13:57,785 --> 00:13:59,820
I'll... I'll do it.

371
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:01,454
I'll give you my kidneys.

372
00:14:01,522 --> 00:14:04,524
But, Brian... You'll die!

373
00:14:04,592 --> 00:14:07,060
Peter, you're my best friend.

374
00:14:07,128 --> 00:14:09,830
You gave me a home
when I didn't have one.

375
00:14:09,897 --> 00:14:12,432
And you've treated me like
a family member ever since.

376
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,201
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you.

377
00:14:14,268 --> 00:14:15,936
I'd probably be dead anyway,

378
00:14:16,003 --> 00:14:18,271
lying under
some freeway overpass.

379
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:21,007
And I wanna...
I wanna return the favor.

380
00:14:21,075 --> 00:14:22,976
After all, I'm... I'm a dog.

381
00:14:23,044 --> 00:14:25,345
I have another eight years,
at best.

382
00:14:25,413 --> 00:14:29,983
I'm willing to give that up
so you can have another forty.

383
00:14:30,051 --> 00:14:31,651
Brian, I...

384
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:33,086
I don't know what to say.

385
00:14:33,154 --> 00:14:35,589
You're savin' my life.

386
00:14:35,656 --> 00:14:37,257
Well, you saved mine.

387
00:14:37,325 --> 00:14:40,660
And, hey, we... We had a lotta
good years together, right?

388
00:14:40,728 --> 00:14:43,763
(voice breaking):
Yeah. We, uh...

389
00:14:43,831 --> 00:14:45,665
We sure did, buddy.

390
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,833
Hello, everyone.

391
00:15:03,918 --> 00:15:05,552
Lois, did you put Stewie to bed?

392
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,520
Yeah, he's asleep.

393
00:15:07,588 --> 00:15:09,856
Good. I'd rather he didn't know
about this till it's over.

394
00:15:09,924 --> 00:15:11,491
He's just a baby.

395
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:15,795
Now, since the operation is tomorrow,
I thought it might be

396
00:15:15,863 --> 00:15:18,698
a good idea to just kinda close
the book, you know?

397
00:15:18,766 --> 00:15:21,701
So I just wanted to share
my final thoughts

398
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:23,737
with each one of you.

399
00:15:23,804 --> 00:15:26,640
Meg, you're so beautiful
on the inside,

400
00:15:26,707 --> 00:15:29,075
but it's very important that
you know your limitations.

401
00:15:29,143 --> 00:15:30,343
What do you mean?

402
00:15:30,411 --> 00:15:32,279
Well, I know they say
"Reach for the stars,"

403
00:15:32,346 --> 00:15:33,613
but if we all did that,

404
00:15:33,681 --> 00:15:35,682
there'd be nobody left
here on Earth, right?

405
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,850
I guess.

406
00:15:36,918 --> 00:15:38,551
Ha ha, there you go.

407
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:41,621
Chris, I have watched
you grow from a little boy

408
00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:43,490
into the young man
you are today.

409
00:15:43,557 --> 00:15:46,092
I know sometimes
life seems tough,

410
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,628
but you just remember
to reach for the stars.

411
00:15:48,696 --> 00:15:50,430
You really think I can?

412
00:15:50,498 --> 00:15:52,349
I know you can, slugger!

413
00:15:52,433 --> 00:15:55,268
And, Lois, I only ask this

414
00:15:55,336 --> 00:15:58,171
because of the dire situation
I'm in, but...

415
00:15:58,239 --> 00:16:02,208
can I, can I hump your leg
for fifteen uninterrupted seconds?

416
00:16:02,276 --> 00:16:04,344
I suppose so, Brian.

417
00:16:07,982 --> 00:16:10,850
I said you could do it
for fifteen seconds.

418
00:16:10,918 --> 00:16:11,985
Didn't need it.

419
00:16:17,191 --> 00:16:19,592
No! It can't be!

420
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,978
Where... Where am I?

421
00:16:38,045 --> 00:16:39,646
We're at the playground, Brian.

422
00:16:39,714 --> 00:16:40,947
I kidnapped you.

423
00:16:41,015 --> 00:16:43,516
You and I are going
to spend the rest of our lives

424
00:16:43,584 --> 00:16:44,884
living right here
under the slide.

425
00:16:44,952 --> 00:16:46,786
Stewie, what the hell?
Are you outta your mind?

426
00:16:46,854 --> 00:16:48,421
I most certainly am not!

427
00:16:48,489 --> 00:16:50,724
I know what you're planning to do,
and I won't allow it!

428
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:53,426
You're not going to kill
yourself for that fat bastard!

429
00:16:53,494 --> 00:16:55,962
Look, I've made up my mind,
all right? Now untie me.

430
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,330
No, I will not!

431
00:16:57,398 --> 00:16:59,532
How dare you make plans
to abandon me!

432
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,968
Come on, you...
You can live without a dog, Stewie,

433
00:17:02,036 --> 00:17:03,870
but you can't live without a father.

434
00:17:03,938 --> 00:17:05,805
And besides, how exactly
do you think we're supposed

435
00:17:05,873 --> 00:17:07,207
to live here on the playground?

436
00:17:07,274 --> 00:17:08,475
We'll do fine, Brian!

437
00:17:08,542 --> 00:17:10,176
Everything is right here
where we need it!

438
00:17:10,244 --> 00:17:12,078
The jungle gym is the grocery store,

439
00:17:12,146 --> 00:17:13,380
the swing set is the mall,

440
00:17:13,447 --> 00:17:15,048
the seesaw is the post office,

441
00:17:15,116 --> 00:17:17,150
and the sandbox is
our summer home.

442
00:17:17,218 --> 00:17:18,485
Can you believe it, Brian?

443
00:17:18,552 --> 00:17:20,020
We... We have a summer home!

444
00:17:20,087 --> 00:17:22,255
I mean, yes, we'll...
We'll have to rent it out

445
00:17:22,323 --> 00:17:23,790
some years to help pay for...

446
00:17:23,858 --> 00:17:25,225
Oh, no, wait, no, we won't,

447
00:17:25,292 --> 00:17:27,427
because I'm a famous race car driver.
I forgot!

448
00:17:27,495 --> 00:17:29,129
Stewie, you're not a race car driver.

449
00:17:29,196 --> 00:17:31,297
And if you don't let me go right now,

450
00:17:31,365 --> 00:17:32,599
you're gonna lose your dad.

451
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:35,935
(sniffles)
But Brian...

452
00:17:36,003 --> 00:17:38,505
I don't wanna lose anybody!

453
00:17:38,572 --> 00:17:43,276
I don't...
I don't wanna lose anybody!

454
00:17:43,344 --> 00:17:45,478
(sobbing)

455
00:17:45,546 --> 00:17:46,446
Oh, my God.

456
00:17:46,514 --> 00:17:47,947
Just stop, stop, just stop it.

457
00:17:48,015 --> 00:17:50,383
But Brian, I love you!

458
00:17:54,989 --> 00:17:56,322
Oh, God,
just wipe your nose, man!

459
00:17:58,993 --> 00:18:00,693
Can I have a hug, Brian?!

460
00:18:00,761 --> 00:18:02,896
Oh, no, no, God,
no, no, not now, no!

461
00:18:02,963 --> 00:18:04,898
I want a hug!
I love...

462
00:18:04,965 --> 00:18:06,733
No, no. Just wipe...
Oh, God, there's no Kleenex.

463
00:18:06,801 --> 00:18:08,802
I love you, Brian!
I love you so much!

464
00:18:08,869 --> 00:18:10,303
Go... Go roll around
in the sandbox...

465
00:18:10,371 --> 00:18:11,638
In... In the summer house!

466
00:18:11,705 --> 00:18:12,906
Go... Go to the summer house
and roll around!

467
00:18:20,168 --> 00:18:22,971
Well, here we go.
You know, buddy,

468
00:18:23,043 --> 00:18:24,978
I'm really gonna miss
havin' a dog.

469
00:18:25,045 --> 00:18:27,881
Hey, whaddaya say you be
my dog one last time, huh?

470
00:18:27,948 --> 00:18:29,382
Sure, Peter.
Whatever you want.

471
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:30,950
Hey, hey, whassat?

472
00:18:31,018 --> 00:18:32,151
Whassat, boy?
Whassat?

473
00:18:32,219 --> 00:18:34,320
Uh, surgical equipment.

474
00:18:34,388 --> 00:18:35,955
Whose is that?
Whose is that?

475
00:18:36,023 --> 00:18:37,257
Probably belongs to the hospital.

476
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,225
Whassat for? Huh?
Whassat for?

477
00:18:39,293 --> 00:18:40,493
Um... Cutting me open,

478
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:42,028
harvesting my organs
and killing me.

479
00:18:42,096 --> 00:18:44,264
You gonna go get it?
You gonna get it, boy?

480
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,366
No, I think...
I think the doctors need it.

481
00:18:46,433 --> 00:18:48,167
Can we...
Can we just lay here?

482
00:18:49,836 --> 00:18:52,105
Dr. Hartman, what're you...?

483
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,873
You're not dressed for surgery.

484
00:18:53,941 --> 00:18:55,074
I sure am.

485
00:18:55,142 --> 00:18:57,410
But I don't understand.

486
00:18:57,478 --> 00:18:58,711
Well, you see, Mrs. Griffin,

487
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:00,580
I found another donor
for your husband.

488
00:19:00,648 --> 00:19:02,649
You did?! Who?

489
00:19:02,716 --> 00:19:04,350
- Me.
- What?!

490
00:19:04,418 --> 00:19:06,219
It turns out I'm a perfect match.

491
00:19:06,287 --> 00:19:08,821
And I'm willing to give up
one of my kidneys.

492
00:19:08,889 --> 00:19:12,392
Oh, my God, Dr. Hartman,
you'd do that for us?!

493
00:19:12,459 --> 00:19:15,495
Well, the truth is you folks are
my only remaining patients.

494
00:19:15,562 --> 00:19:17,263
I couldn't afford
to lose two of you.

495
00:19:17,331 --> 00:19:18,998
What do you mean, two of us?

496
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:21,267
Well, chances are Peter never
would have survived the surgery.

497
00:19:21,335 --> 00:19:22,969
I mean...
I mean, dog kidneys?!

498
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,238
I'm not even sure dogs have kidneys.

499
00:19:25,306 --> 00:19:26,773
Do dogs have kidneys?

500
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,041
Yes.

501
00:19:28,108 --> 00:19:30,576
Ah, this...
This is the guy.

502
00:19:30,644 --> 00:19:32,211
Oh, my God, Brian...

503
00:19:32,262 --> 00:19:33,229
(all clamoring)

504
00:19:33,314 --> 00:19:35,548
You're gonna live!

505
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:37,550
Oh, I love you!
I love you!

506
00:19:43,123 --> 00:19:44,424
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

507
00:19:44,491 --> 00:19:46,960
I'm happy to welcome you all
here to our auditorium

508
00:19:47,027 --> 00:19:49,495
for something that's
not a terrible play.

509
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,497
In fact, tonight we're graced

510
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,300
with the presence
of our Commander in Chief.

511
00:19:54,368 --> 00:19:58,071
But first, to introduce him
is a very talented young man,

512
00:19:58,138 --> 00:20:00,773
James Woods' own Chris Griffin.

513
00:20:00,841 --> 00:20:02,241
(applause)

514
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:03,843
Thank you, Principal Shepherd.

515
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,846
My sister Meg will be helping me
introduce the President,

516
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,248
since we wrote this essay together.

517
00:20:09,316 --> 00:20:13,319
"What is Hope?"
by Chris and Meg Griffin.

518
00:20:13,387 --> 00:20:15,822
Hope is what gets you
out of bed in the morning

519
00:20:15,889 --> 00:20:18,825
when it's the day of prom
and you haven't been asked.

520
00:20:18,892 --> 00:20:20,994
Hope pushes the caterpillar

521
00:20:21,061 --> 00:20:24,263
through the cocoon and drives
the salmon upstream.

522
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:27,567
Your breasts may be small
and your glasses may be thick,

523
00:20:27,634 --> 00:20:29,635
but hope doesn't
hold up a mirror.

524
00:20:29,703 --> 00:20:31,771
CHRIS:
Hope is a horizon we head for,

525
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:34,474
leaving nothing behind us but fear.

526
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,509
And though we may never reach
our goals,

527
00:20:36,577 --> 00:20:40,246
it's hope that will save us
from who we once were.

528
00:20:48,355 --> 00:20:50,056
And now...

529
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:51,924
Ladies and gentlemen...

530
00:20:51,992 --> 00:20:54,660
- President Mike Obama!
- President Barack Obama!

531
00:20:55,863 --> 00:20:57,563
