TV ANNOUNCER:
We now return to Jeremy Piven

13
00:00:37,735 --> 00:00:39,636
as <i>The Incredible Hulk.</i>

14
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,405
You wouldn't like me
when I'm angry.

15
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:43,173
I don't like you now.

16
00:00:43,207 --> 00:00:44,941
Brian, I need the TV.

17
00:00:44,976 --> 00:00:46,443
Why is Rupert
wearing a top hat?

18
00:00:46,477 --> 00:00:48,678
Because, Brian,
tonight we sup on

19
00:00:48,713 --> 00:00:50,380
the finest feast of
the television season.

20
00:00:50,415 --> 00:00:51,948
It is the
season finale

21
00:00:51,983 --> 00:00:53,583
of <i>The Cadwalliders</i>
<i>of Essex.</i>

22
00:00:53,618 --> 00:00:55,685
The what?
<i>The Cadwalliders of Essex.</i>

23
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,953
It's groundbreaking.

24
00:00:56,988 --> 00:00:58,955
It's a British show
about a wealthy family

25
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,257
dealing with
slight change.

26
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,691
Oh, I thought
that got cancelled.

27
00:01:01,726 --> 00:01:03,493
No, that was <i>The Caduggans</i>
<i>of Aubrey Muse.</i>

28
00:01:03,528 --> 00:01:05,729
Is that the one where even
the children have muttonchops?

29
00:01:05,763 --> 00:01:07,664
No, that's <i>The Whittakers</i>
<i>of Edgerton Crescent.</i>

30
00:01:07,698 --> 00:01:09,066
All these shows
sound the same.

31
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,100
Who's in this one?

32
00:01:10,134 --> 00:01:11,294
Penelope
Westworth-Harrington.

33
00:01:11,302 --> 00:01:12,369
Who's that?

34
00:01:12,403 --> 00:01:14,838
Penelope Westworth-Harrington?
Oh, come on!

35
00:01:14,872 --> 00:01:16,640
From <i>The Roysters of</i>
<i>Pumbridge on Thames?</i>

36
00:01:16,674 --> 00:01:18,842
Her uncle was steward
to the Queen's Privy!

37
00:01:18,876 --> 00:01:20,143
(sighs)

38
00:01:20,178 --> 00:01:22,679
She got plowed on a pile
of hay in <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

39
00:01:22,713 --> 00:01:24,147
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

40
00:01:24,182 --> 00:01:25,182
She's hot.

41
00:01:25,216 --> 00:01:26,683
Ugh, you're an idiot.

42
00:01:26,717 --> 00:01:28,385
Like a guy who cheats
on his right hand

43
00:01:28,419 --> 00:01:29,820
with his left hand.

44
00:01:29,854 --> 00:01:31,054
I want to stay,

45
00:01:31,089 --> 00:01:33,356
but I just got called
back into the office.

46
00:01:33,391 --> 00:01:34,858
What do you want from me?

47
00:01:34,892 --> 00:01:35,926
I'm sorry, all right?

48
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,260
Just get off my back!

49
00:01:37,295 --> 00:01:38,895
I'm out of here.

50
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:42,432
God, it took me forever
to get awa...

51
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:43,467
(gunshot)

52
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:44,468
Oh, my God!

53
00:01:44,502 --> 00:01:45,702
No!

54
00:01:45,736 --> 00:01:47,804
What have you done?!

55
00:01:47,839 --> 00:01:48,972
Wait! Stop!

56
00:01:49,006 --> 00:01:50,073
No, please!

57
00:01:50,108 --> 00:01:51,074
I'm begging you!

58
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:52,876
(gunshot)

59
00:01:55,413 --> 00:01:57,414
(sobbing)

60
00:02:02,787 --> 00:02:03,920
(classical music playing
over TV)

61
00:02:03,955 --> 00:02:05,255
Oh, it's starting!

62
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:06,756
I'm gonna live-tweet the show

63
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:09,059
and ruin it for everyone
in other time zones.

64
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:17,367
I would like to learn
to bathe myself.

65
00:02:20,571 --> 00:02:23,507
Everything I've ever
heard is vexing.

66
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:24,808
Oh! Oh!

67
00:02:24,842 --> 00:02:27,077
This is the fastest-moving
episode I've ever seen!

68
00:02:27,111 --> 00:02:28,278
Wouldn't it be marvelous

69
00:02:28,312 --> 00:02:30,347
to be a part of
a family like that?

70
00:02:30,381 --> 00:02:32,215
Ah-ha, I found
that chick in the hay.

71
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,184
PETER and CHRIS (chanting):
Unga bunga, unga bunga,

72
00:02:34,218 --> 00:02:35,352
unga bunga.

73
00:02:35,386 --> 00:02:37,187
What is that?
What's happening?

74
00:02:37,221 --> 00:02:40,390
Unga bunga, unga bunga,
unga bunga.

75
00:02:40,424 --> 00:02:41,424
Peter, what are you doing?

76
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:42,592
Playing Unga Bunga.

77
00:02:42,627 --> 00:02:43,593
It's the championship.

78
00:02:43,628 --> 00:02:44,895
Go away!

79
00:02:44,929 --> 00:02:47,297
This is why Zillow estimates
our house at $4.00.

80
00:02:47,331 --> 00:02:48,665
What the hell is Unga Bunga?

81
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:50,000
Two guys run
at each other

82
00:02:50,034 --> 00:02:52,269
with mattresses,
and, um...

83
00:02:52,303 --> 00:02:53,703
th-that's kind of it.

84
00:02:53,738 --> 00:02:55,906
Stop explaining it to the dog!

85
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,307
Let's do this!

86
00:02:57,341 --> 00:02:59,743
(yelling wildly)

87
00:02:59,777 --> 00:03:01,745
Stop it!
I'm trying to watch my program!

88
00:03:01,779 --> 00:03:03,246
Whoa, Chris, look!
Mom's naked!

89
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:04,314
Where?

90
00:03:04,348 --> 00:03:05,348
You creep.

91
00:03:07,285 --> 00:03:08,885
(gasps)
No!

92
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,887
Peter, what's going on in...

93
00:03:10,922 --> 00:03:12,088
Unga Bunga!
(crashing)

94
00:03:12,123 --> 00:03:14,324
You... you imbeciles!

95
00:03:14,358 --> 00:03:15,358
You ruined my night!

96
00:03:15,393 --> 00:03:17,360
I ask for one thing
in this house!

97
00:03:17,395 --> 00:03:19,362
Stewie, just watch
your show upstairs.

98
00:03:19,397 --> 00:03:21,932
I don't want to watch it
upstairs on the small TV!

99
00:03:21,966 --> 00:03:24,634
I want to watch it
downstairs on the big TV!

100
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:25,635
(sniffling)

101
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,804
I want to watch my show!

102
00:03:27,838 --> 00:03:29,839
(crying, screaming)

103
00:03:32,076 --> 00:03:34,144
Oh, no, Stewie's
having a tantrum.

104
00:03:34,178 --> 00:03:35,712
Come here, sweetie.

105
00:03:37,915 --> 00:03:38,915
Ow!

106
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,450
Screw you, you little turd!

107
00:03:40,484 --> 00:03:41,785
(crying)

108
00:03:42,853 --> 00:03:44,588
What's all that noise?

109
00:03:44,622 --> 00:03:47,624
Aw, do you want a hug
from your big sister?

110
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,227
Ow!

111
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,398
You've earned yourself
a time-out, young man.

112
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:58,335
Now, you stay in here
until you can behave.

113
00:03:58,369 --> 00:04:00,470
I hate you!
You always ruin everything!

114
00:04:00,504 --> 00:04:02,372
God, it's a family of idiots!

115
00:04:02,406 --> 00:04:03,540
I wish...

116
00:04:03,574 --> 00:04:05,575
I wish I was never born!

117
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:08,144
Not tonight, Rupert.

118
00:04:08,179 --> 00:04:09,846
I'm much too upset.

119
00:04:14,118 --> 00:04:15,418
Knock, knock.

120
00:04:15,453 --> 00:04:16,419
Stewie?

121
00:04:16,454 --> 00:04:18,121
Hey, I just
wanted to check

122
00:04:18,155 --> 00:04:19,289
on how you're
doing, buddy.

123
00:04:19,323 --> 00:04:20,924
You put on quite
a show last night.

124
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,525
I am done with this family.

125
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,160
They don't deserve me.
They're all just...

126
00:04:24,195 --> 00:04:25,395
Oh, you dick,
you just came in

127
00:04:25,429 --> 00:04:26,496
to charge your phone.

128
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,598
Sorry, Peter's using
all the outlets.

129
00:04:30,234 --> 00:04:31,768
Toast house.

130
00:04:31,802 --> 00:04:34,471
Whatever. I'm gonna be
out of this place soon anyway.

131
00:04:34,505 --> 00:04:35,872
What, are you
running away from home?

132
00:04:35,906 --> 00:04:36,906
Better.

133
00:04:39,844 --> 00:04:41,111
What the hell?

134
00:04:41,145 --> 00:04:43,280
You rebuilt
your time machine?

135
00:04:43,314 --> 00:04:45,515
I thought you
swore off time travel,

136
00:04:45,549 --> 00:04:47,417
'cause you couldn't stop
yourself from altering the past.

137
00:04:47,451 --> 00:04:48,785
Look, Brian,
I need this machine

138
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:50,387
to alter the past
for the better.

139
00:04:50,421 --> 00:04:51,388
What do you mean?

140
00:04:51,422 --> 00:04:52,989
I loathe this family.

141
00:04:53,024 --> 00:04:56,126
Being born into it was clearly
some sort of cosmic mistake,

142
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,728
so I'm going back in time
to prevent that mistake.

143
00:04:58,763 --> 00:05:01,064
I'm going to break up Lois
and the fat man

144
00:05:01,098 --> 00:05:02,766
before they can conceive me.

145
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,334
Stewie, it one TV show.

146
00:05:04,368 --> 00:05:05,502
You're overreacting.

147
00:05:05,536 --> 00:05:07,437
It's not just the
TV show, Brian.

148
00:05:07,471 --> 00:05:09,105
I'm tired of
living with morons.

149
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,208
Remember when I tried to open
that lemonade stand with Chris?

150
00:05:12,243 --> 00:05:13,810
All right,
that'll be ten cents.

151
00:05:13,844 --> 00:05:15,078
Chris, pour the man
his lemonade.

152
00:05:15,112 --> 00:05:16,346
CHRIS:
I can't!

153
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,149
The lemonade tricked me
and got away!

154
00:05:19,183 --> 00:05:22,152
Lemons are God's children!

155
00:05:22,186 --> 00:05:23,887
And the fat man
won't even let me

156
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:25,622
celebrate a
proper birthday.

157
00:05:25,656 --> 00:05:27,657
Happy birthday, Stewie!

158
00:05:27,692 --> 00:05:30,260
And here's your
equal-attention cake, Peter.

159
00:05:30,294 --> 00:05:31,528
Yay!

160
00:05:32,396 --> 00:05:33,363
Oh, come on!

161
00:05:33,397 --> 00:05:34,898
Yay! Double wishes!

162
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:37,500
One...

163
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,806
...two.

164
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,041
And Meg's the
biggest pig of all.

165
00:05:45,076 --> 00:05:46,042
MEG:
Great.

166
00:05:46,077 --> 00:05:48,211
The string broke again.

167
00:05:48,245 --> 00:05:51,481
Hey, there, tiny hands.

168
00:05:51,515 --> 00:05:53,515
Look, Stewie, I know
you're angry about last night,

169
00:05:53,517 --> 00:05:55,552
but you're talking about
erasing your existence.

170
00:05:55,586 --> 00:05:56,686
That's crazy.

171
00:05:56,721 --> 00:05:59,489
("Barracuda" ringtone plays)

172
00:05:59,523 --> 00:06:02,158
Whose ringtone
is "Barracuda"?

173
00:06:02,193 --> 00:06:04,361
Oh, God,
that's Frumpy Ann.

174
00:06:04,395 --> 00:06:05,729
Frumpy Ann
does everything.

175
00:06:05,763 --> 00:06:07,330
Look, I-I got to
get this call,

176
00:06:07,365 --> 00:06:09,332
but don't do
anything stupid.

177
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:11,301
Yo, girl,
how you livin'?

178
00:06:11,335 --> 00:06:12,669
Ugh.

179
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:17,774
All right, Rupert,
prepare to time travel.

180
00:06:17,808 --> 00:06:19,976
Oh, and by the way,
thanks for asking me

181
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,345
if I wanted something
from Subway, too.

182
00:06:41,665 --> 00:06:42,966
Where am I?

183
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,668
This looks like my room,
but something's off.

184
00:06:45,703 --> 00:06:47,637
Oh, that's right,
this isn't my room yet.

185
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:49,406
Wonder what
they're using it for.

186
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:54,477
Oh, my God, he had
a public access show?

187
00:06:54,512 --> 00:06:56,880
Live from the shores
of Rhode Island,

188
00:06:56,914 --> 00:06:59,015
it's the fatty
who drives you batty!

189
00:06:59,049 --> 00:07:00,817
Peter Griffin!

190
00:07:00,851 --> 00:07:03,052
(applause)

191
00:07:04,488 --> 00:07:06,055
Hey, hey, hey, douche bags!

192
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,824
We got a great show
for you tonight.

193
00:07:07,858 --> 00:07:09,859
Karen Washington from
the Rhode Island Zoo

194
00:07:09,894 --> 00:07:12,328
and some rejected toys
you're not gonna believe.

195
00:07:12,363 --> 00:07:14,264
So stick around, or...

196
00:07:14,298 --> 00:07:17,567
STUDIO AUDIENCE: I'll come to your house
and murder you!

197
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:19,936
I wonder what else is different.

198
00:07:21,472 --> 00:07:23,339
♪ Lucky there's a man who ♪

199
00:07:23,374 --> 00:07:24,874
♪ Positively can do ♪

200
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:26,509
♪ All the things that make us ♪

201
00:07:26,544 --> 00:07:28,711
♪ La la la... ♪

202
00:07:28,746 --> 00:07:32,015
She is camel toe-ing
the hell out of that leotard.

203
00:07:39,922 --> 00:07:42,924
All right, Rupert, time to
break up Lois and the fat man

204
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,693
before they can conceive me
by pressing butts together.

205
00:07:45,727 --> 00:07:47,462
Well, you don't know, either!

206
00:07:49,031 --> 00:07:51,666
Hey, Lois, I drawed
you a picture.

207
00:07:53,602 --> 00:07:55,670
It's me and you
on the space moon,

208
00:07:55,704 --> 00:07:58,139
'cause I would
love you anywhere.

209
00:07:58,173 --> 00:08:01,142
Oh, Peter.
I'd love you anywhere, too.

210
00:08:02,778 --> 00:08:05,379
Wow, Peter and Lois
were really in love

211
00:08:05,414 --> 00:08:06,814
before I was born.

212
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:09,150
And this is me getting
you from behind,

213
00:08:09,184 --> 00:08:11,586
'cause in space no one
can hear you scream.

214
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,721
(laughs):
Oh, Peter!

215
00:08:13,755 --> 00:08:16,824
Breaking them up may prove to be
more difficult than I thought.

216
00:08:16,859 --> 00:08:18,926
Though I've faced
bigger challenges before.

217
00:08:18,961 --> 00:08:21,596
Like when I had to ride
that bike in <i>The Muppet Movie.</i>

218
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,464
(folksy music plays)

219
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:24,465
That's right.

220
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,601
Stewie Long Legs
just blew your mind.

221
00:08:29,705 --> 00:08:32,273
All right, Rupert,
now to break up my parents.

222
00:08:32,307 --> 00:08:34,876
The number one thing
couples fight about is money.

223
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,178
So I've maxed out
Lois's credit card

224
00:08:37,212 --> 00:08:39,213
on vibrating marital aids.

225
00:08:42,151 --> 00:08:44,218
Peter, there's an open box
in the kitchen

226
00:08:44,253 --> 00:08:46,154
addressed to me
with nothing inside.

227
00:08:46,188 --> 00:08:48,623
(vibrating): Uh, yeah, when I
opened it up, it was empty.

228
00:08:48,657 --> 00:08:50,291
Well, that's
very strange,

229
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:52,727
because it looked large
enough to hold many items.

230
00:08:52,761 --> 00:08:53,728
(doorbell rings)

231
00:08:53,762 --> 00:08:55,062
(vibrating):
It's the mailman!

232
00:08:55,097 --> 00:08:56,063
I'll get it!

233
00:08:56,098 --> 00:08:57,732
No! Me!
I'll get it!

234
00:08:57,766 --> 00:08:59,534
(vibrating):
Huh. Maybe I had more in common

235
00:08:59,568 --> 00:09:01,435
with this family than I thought.

236
00:09:13,348 --> 00:09:14,549
Oh, my God, Peter!

237
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:15,917
What happened
to your hair?

238
00:09:15,951 --> 00:09:17,151
I don't know. I...

239
00:09:17,186 --> 00:09:18,519
I'm bald!

240
00:09:18,554 --> 00:09:19,554
You did this!

241
00:09:19,588 --> 00:09:21,222
What the hell's
the matter with you?!

242
00:09:21,256 --> 00:09:23,991
I didn't do it, but...
but you look really cool.

243
00:09:24,026 --> 00:09:25,226
I do?

244
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,296
Yeah, you look like you
could be a celebrity.

245
00:09:29,331 --> 00:09:31,299
Hey, can I get
your autograph?

246
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,334
Oh, of course,
here you go.

247
00:09:34,803 --> 00:09:36,604
They think
I'm Bruce Willis.

248
00:09:36,638 --> 00:09:39,273
That was the monster
from <i>Goonies!</i>

249
00:09:43,645 --> 00:09:45,313
None of my attempts
to break them up

250
00:09:45,347 --> 00:09:48,115
has worked thus far,
so I had to up our game.

251
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,351
Lois, what the hell did you do?!

252
00:09:50,385 --> 00:09:51,886
I just got a note from Goodwill

253
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,788
thanking me for
donating all my porn.

254
00:09:53,822 --> 00:09:54,789
What?!

255
00:09:54,823 --> 00:09:56,490
I'm sick and tired
of you blaming me

256
00:09:56,525 --> 00:09:57,825
for things I didn't do!

257
00:09:57,859 --> 00:09:59,827
And I've got a bone
to pick with you!

258
00:09:59,861 --> 00:10:01,729
I don't appreciate
how you spray-painted

259
00:10:01,763 --> 00:10:03,564
"vile woman"
on the bedroom wall.

260
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:04,565
That wasn't me!

261
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,033
Must've been
one of the kids!

262
00:10:06,068 --> 00:10:07,468
That's ridiculous,
Peter!

263
00:10:07,502 --> 00:10:08,803
Chris can't write,

264
00:10:08,837 --> 00:10:10,771
and we don't allow
Meg upstairs!

265
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,208
Well, you know something,
I'm starting to think

266
00:10:14,243 --> 00:10:15,543
whoever wrote
that is right!

267
00:10:15,577 --> 00:10:17,411
Well, maybe I don't want
to live with someone

268
00:10:17,446 --> 00:10:18,646
who doesn't respect me!

269
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,481
Well, then maybe
I should just leave!

270
00:10:20,515 --> 00:10:21,983
And where are you gonna go?

271
00:10:22,017 --> 00:10:24,252
You got nothing else
and nobody else!

272
00:10:24,286 --> 00:10:25,987
And now for the closer.

273
00:10:27,656 --> 00:10:28,990
(honks)

274
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:32,260
I might go west.

275
00:10:34,896 --> 00:10:37,131
My God, I've done it, Rupert!

276
00:10:37,165 --> 00:10:38,399
They've broken up!

277
00:10:38,433 --> 00:10:40,134
(gasps) Look!

278
00:10:40,168 --> 00:10:41,202
It's working.

279
00:10:41,236 --> 00:10:42,870
I'm fading away!

280
00:10:42,904 --> 00:10:45,573
Well, Rupert, this means
you and I will never have met.

281
00:10:45,607 --> 00:10:47,842
So I've got
to tell you one thing:

282
00:10:47,876 --> 00:10:50,278
you know that song I wrote you
for Valentine's Day?

283
00:10:50,312 --> 00:10:52,213
It's an Eric Carmen song.

284
00:10:52,247 --> 00:10:53,748
I completely ripped it off.

285
00:10:53,782 --> 00:10:55,783
Ah. Ah, now I feel better.

286
00:10:59,154 --> 00:11:00,421
(Stewie groans)

287
00:11:00,455 --> 00:11:01,922
STEWIE:
<i>Wha...</i>

288
00:11:01,957 --> 00:11:03,324
<i>What the devil?</i>

289
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:04,325
<i>What's going on?</i>

290
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:05,826
<i>Where am I?</i>

291
00:11:05,861 --> 00:11:07,194
DOCTOR:
It's a boy!

292
00:11:07,229 --> 00:11:09,463
STEWIE:
<i>I'm in a hospital.</i>

293
00:11:09,498 --> 00:11:11,632
<i>My soul must have</i>
<i>found another carrier.</i>

294
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:13,534
<i>I've been reborn!</i>

295
00:11:13,568 --> 00:11:15,803
(British accent):
Welcome to the world, baby chap.

296
00:11:15,837 --> 00:11:16,804
(gasps)

297
00:11:16,838 --> 00:11:18,005
I'm British?

298
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,106
All right!

299
00:11:19,141 --> 00:11:21,008
Ooh, I wonder if
I'll have one of those

300
00:11:21,043 --> 00:11:23,978
pug-nosed British dogs
that licks its own snot all day.

301
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:27,715
Ew, that's gross.

302
00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:29,684
(Cockney accent):
Piss off, you little wanker.

303
00:11:29,718 --> 00:11:32,286
I'm not gonna be the dog
to some poof baby.

304
00:11:45,777 --> 00:11:48,112
Well, lad,
welcome to your home.

305
00:11:51,182 --> 00:11:53,684
Well, this is more like it.

306
00:11:53,718 --> 00:11:56,086
This is your valet,
your gardener,

307
00:11:56,121 --> 00:11:58,956
your cook, your gamekeeper,
your butler, your housekeeper,

308
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,391
your parlor maid,
your housemaid,

309
00:12:00,425 --> 00:12:02,893
your scullery maid,
your shoe de-graveler

310
00:12:02,927 --> 00:12:04,561
and one superfluous employee

311
00:12:04,596 --> 00:12:06,730
who I am not in a gay
relationship with.

312
00:12:06,765 --> 00:12:08,866
Sir, we have a meeting
in the broom shed.

313
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,000
Quite right.

314
00:12:10,035 --> 00:12:11,769
I will now hand you
over to your mother.

315
00:12:11,803 --> 00:12:13,637
This will be our
last physical contact

316
00:12:13,672 --> 00:12:15,539
until I give you
a firm handshake

317
00:12:15,573 --> 00:12:17,608
on your 18th birthday.

318
00:12:20,378 --> 00:12:23,113
My God, this is everything
I've ever wanted.

319
00:12:23,148 --> 00:12:25,849
And let's be honest, if I had
stayed with the Griffins,

320
00:12:25,884 --> 00:12:28,452
I would have ended up like
Rick Springfield today.

321
00:12:28,486 --> 00:12:32,322
♪ I wish that
I had Jesse's job. ♪

322
00:12:32,357 --> 00:12:33,791
(sighs)

323
00:12:37,896 --> 00:12:39,663
Sir, it's 6:00 p.m.

324
00:12:39,698 --> 00:12:43,133
and you're still in
your 5:45 tuxedo.

325
00:12:43,168 --> 00:12:45,502
Nigel, yesterday
I saw you smile.

326
00:12:45,537 --> 00:12:48,138
Is that something I need
to bring up with my father?

327
00:12:48,173 --> 00:12:51,141
I was just imagining
my own death, sir.

328
00:12:51,176 --> 00:12:52,509
You're a good man, Nigel.

329
00:12:52,544 --> 00:12:54,178
May I pull on
your nose hair?

330
00:12:54,212 --> 00:12:55,879
Of course, sir.

331
00:12:55,914 --> 00:12:57,915
(laughing)

332
00:13:05,223 --> 00:13:07,624
My heavens, my father
is the Commander

333
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:09,693
of the Most Excellent Order
of the British Empire,

334
00:13:09,728 --> 00:13:11,729
Dean of Physics at Oxford,

335
00:13:11,763 --> 00:13:14,698
and he was pre-approved for
a Capital One No-Hassle Card.

336
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:16,900
Oh, okay, so he's just
framing everything.

337
00:13:16,935 --> 00:13:20,337
Stewart, these are
your brothers, Jaden and Aidan.

338
00:13:20,371 --> 00:13:22,673
Jaden was first form
in his sixth levels

339
00:13:22,707 --> 00:13:25,576
and he's chief scrum-flanker
on his varsity boogling team,

340
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,178
which, as far as we know,
makes us terribly proud.

341
00:13:28,213 --> 00:13:30,681
Finally, siblings
who are doing stuff.

342
00:13:30,715 --> 00:13:32,683
I'm really happy
to meet you guys.

343
00:13:32,717 --> 00:13:34,418
You were an accident.

344
00:13:34,452 --> 00:13:36,620
You're only here because
Father is a heavy sleeper

345
00:13:36,654 --> 00:13:38,689
with a frequent
morning stem.

346
00:13:38,723 --> 00:13:41,525
Okay. Aidan's the ball-breaker,
huh, Jaden?

347
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:45,362
Father, is "it" going
to live here for a while?

348
00:13:45,396 --> 00:13:47,231
Oh, Aidan is the nice one.

349
00:13:47,265 --> 00:13:49,867
Well, if it's verbal jousting
skills you're looking for,

350
00:13:49,901 --> 00:13:54,004
I'm not afraid to take a little
walk on the Oscar Wilde side.

351
00:13:54,038 --> 00:13:56,039
You are a poopy head.

352
00:13:56,074 --> 00:13:58,208
And you... shut up.

353
00:13:58,243 --> 00:14:00,344
Stewart, I think
your mouth is better

354
00:14:00,378 --> 00:14:02,846
at taking things in
than spewing them out.

355
00:14:02,881 --> 00:14:05,115
(both laughing)

356
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:08,152
Wow, these guys are a little
sharper than my old family.

357
00:14:08,186 --> 00:14:11,288
I still remember
our Duck Duck Goose disaster.

358
00:14:11,322 --> 00:14:12,456
Duck.

359
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,457
Duck.

360
00:14:13,491 --> 00:14:14,458
Duck.

361
00:14:14,492 --> 00:14:16,460
Duck.

362
00:14:16,494 --> 00:14:19,563
Duck. Duck.

363
00:14:19,597 --> 00:14:20,831
Duck.

364
00:14:20,865 --> 00:14:22,432
Duck. Duck.

365
00:14:22,467 --> 00:14:23,467
Duck.

366
00:14:25,804 --> 00:14:26,970
Duck.

367
00:14:27,005 --> 00:14:28,872
Duck. Duck.

368
00:14:28,907 --> 00:14:30,174
Duck.

369
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,975
Duck.

370
00:14:36,781 --> 00:14:38,549
Duck.

371
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,118
<i>What is that other word?</i>

372
00:14:44,155 --> 00:14:45,622
(Stewie suckling)

373
00:14:45,657 --> 00:14:47,457
(Cockney accent):
There we are.

374
00:14:47,492 --> 00:14:49,893
Sorry I couldn't squeeze
no more juice outta me nippers.

375
00:14:49,928 --> 00:14:51,395
Oh, that's all right.

376
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:54,364
I can't be mad at someone who
lost seven sons in the war.

377
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,234
All right, my little lord,
it's time for bed.

378
00:14:57,268 --> 00:14:58,936
Why isn't Mommy
tucking me in?

379
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,971
Oh, hush, love,
you're born now.

380
00:15:01,005 --> 00:15:03,507
That's the end of all
this "Mommy" nonsense.

381
00:15:06,578 --> 00:15:08,579
(wind howling)

382
00:15:11,282 --> 00:15:12,516
What the hell?

383
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,585
I don't even get
a stuffed animal to hug?

384
00:15:14,619 --> 00:15:16,053
The only thing in this crib

385
00:15:16,087 --> 00:15:17,721
is a 19th-century
dueling pistol.

386
00:15:17,755 --> 00:15:18,722
(screams)

387
00:15:18,756 --> 00:15:20,324
It's loaded?!

388
00:15:20,358 --> 00:15:22,926
BRITISH NOBLEMAN: Who dares to
shoot the bow tie off my cat?

389
00:15:22,961 --> 00:15:24,228
We duel at dawn!

390
00:15:24,262 --> 00:15:25,562
I'm just a baby!

391
00:15:25,597 --> 00:15:26,830
So am I!

392
00:15:26,865 --> 00:15:28,832
Good Lord, what have I done?

393
00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:30,667
I don't like it here at all!

394
00:15:30,702 --> 00:15:31,902
I miss my family!

395
00:15:31,936 --> 00:15:34,104
My dumb family!

396
00:15:34,138 --> 00:15:35,272
Dear God.

397
00:15:35,306 --> 00:15:37,708
I wanted to be free
of the family of morons

398
00:15:37,742 --> 00:15:41,144
I was born into,
but now I'm the moron!

399
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:42,679
Sir, I heard
whimpering.

400
00:15:42,714 --> 00:15:44,781
Shall I fetch
your crying tuxedo?

401
00:15:44,816 --> 00:15:47,084
No! I don't want
any more tuxedos!

402
00:15:47,118 --> 00:15:49,086
And I don't want a cold mother

403
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,754
or an Oxford physics
professor father.

404
00:15:50,788 --> 00:15:51,755
(gasps)

405
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:53,090
Wait a minute! That's it!

406
00:15:53,124 --> 00:15:54,925
The Oxford physics lab will have

407
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,994
everything I need
to build a time machine.

408
00:15:57,028 --> 00:15:59,029
Then I can go
back to my old life!

409
00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:02,766
Ah, ah!
Stone floor, too cold.

410
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,801
I'll go in the morning.

411
00:16:11,442 --> 00:16:14,378
Let's see, I need plutonium
for the time machine.

412
00:16:14,412 --> 00:16:16,380
But how do I get
past those guards?

413
00:16:16,414 --> 00:16:18,649
Oh, wait, that's right.
I'm in England.

414
00:16:18,683 --> 00:16:21,351
I can just walk past them
holding a cup of tea.

415
00:16:21,386 --> 00:16:22,853
Morning.
Morning.

416
00:16:22,887 --> 00:16:24,321
Morning.
Morning.

417
00:16:27,825 --> 00:16:28,926
Morning.
Morning.

418
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,727
Morning.
Morning.

419
00:16:30,762 --> 00:16:34,131
Did you see something
suspicious about that baby?

420
00:16:34,165 --> 00:16:35,666
Well, I did at first,

421
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,368
but then he's got the tea
vouching for him, doesn't he?

422
00:16:41,773 --> 00:16:44,174
(plutonium humming)

423
00:16:51,549 --> 00:16:52,783
Almost there.

424
00:16:52,817 --> 00:16:54,184
Just a few more adjustments.

425
00:16:54,218 --> 00:16:55,519
BRITISH FATHER: Stewart!
(gasps)

426
00:16:55,553 --> 00:16:57,054
What are you doing?

427
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:06,496
All right, Rupert,
I left the fat man's

428
00:17:06,531 --> 00:17:07,931
entire porn collection

429
00:17:07,966 --> 00:17:09,800
on the curb
for Goodwill to pick up.

430
00:17:11,169 --> 00:17:13,737
(screams)

431
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:19,977
(gasps)
Who the devil are you?

432
00:17:20,011 --> 00:17:21,211
I'm British Stewie.

433
00:17:21,245 --> 00:17:22,679
I don't hear
anything different.

434
00:17:22,714 --> 00:17:23,680
I sound the same,

435
00:17:23,715 --> 00:17:25,349
but I spell some words
very differently.

436
00:17:25,383 --> 00:17:26,583
Let me write
the word "color"

437
00:17:26,617 --> 00:17:28,251
on a piece of
paper for you.

438
00:17:28,286 --> 00:17:29,553
(gasps)

439
00:17:29,587 --> 00:17:31,254
Dear God! You <i>are</i> British!

440
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:32,389
Listen to me.

441
00:17:32,423 --> 00:17:34,124
You successfully prevented
your own birth,

442
00:17:34,158 --> 00:17:36,493
and instead you were born
into an alternate family.

443
00:17:36,527 --> 00:17:37,861
But you must believe me,

444
00:17:37,895 --> 00:17:40,030
the Griffins are
your true destiny.

445
00:17:40,064 --> 00:17:41,898
No, they're not. They're morons.

446
00:17:41,933 --> 00:17:44,835
But they're your morons,
and they care about you.

447
00:17:44,869 --> 00:17:46,837
Besides, you shine
among these dullards.

448
00:17:46,871 --> 00:17:48,739
Like Bob Weir in
The Grateful Dead.

449
00:17:48,773 --> 00:17:50,974
That joke's for
one of our crew guys, Matty.

450
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:53,910
He loves The Dead and he's,
uh... he's not doing so well.

451
00:17:53,945 --> 00:17:56,313
We love ya, Captain Trips.
Hang in, bro.

452
00:17:56,347 --> 00:17:59,716
Well, I do like being
better than everyone else.

453
00:17:59,751 --> 00:18:01,618
LOIS: Peter, I had
nothing to do

454
00:18:01,652 --> 00:18:03,186
with donating
your stupid porn!

455
00:18:03,221 --> 00:18:05,122
If what you're
telling me is true,

456
00:18:05,156 --> 00:18:06,623
we can't let
them separate.

457
00:18:06,657 --> 00:18:08,358
If Peter leaves,
I'll be unborn!

458
00:18:08,393 --> 00:18:09,626
Well, she's not
gonna stop him.

459
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,961
She's furious.
(gasps)

460
00:18:10,995 --> 00:18:12,629
You're right!
And if I know her,

461
00:18:12,663 --> 00:18:13,964
she'll be heading
to the fridge

462
00:18:13,998 --> 00:18:15,899
for her angry
afternoon Chardonnay.

463
00:18:15,933 --> 00:18:17,334
I've got an idea!

464
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,974
Okay, there it is.

465
00:18:24,008 --> 00:18:25,475
Noon.

466
00:18:36,954 --> 00:18:38,822
Oh, no! He's leaving!

467
00:18:38,856 --> 00:18:41,324
I'm... I'm fading away!

468
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,459
Peter, wait!

469
00:18:42,493 --> 00:18:44,594
What? You want to yell
at me some more?

470
00:18:44,629 --> 00:18:47,064
No, I want to
tell you I'm sorry.

471
00:18:47,098 --> 00:18:49,032
I... I don't want
you to leave.

472
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:51,268
Why should I stay if
you don't even trust me?

473
00:18:51,302 --> 00:18:53,336
I do trust you, Peter.

474
00:18:53,371 --> 00:18:55,605
I don't know what's
gotten into us lately.

475
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,742
The important thing is,
we're meant to be together.

476
00:18:58,776 --> 00:19:01,078
I love you, Peter.

477
00:19:01,112 --> 00:19:04,247
Aw, I love you, too, Lois.

478
00:19:08,853 --> 00:19:10,253
I'm glad we're
staying together.

479
00:19:10,288 --> 00:19:12,789
Honestly, I-I don't know
what I would do on my own.

480
00:19:12,824 --> 00:19:16,126
Like, I literally have no
idea where food comes from.

481
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,527
I-Is it that guy?

482
00:19:17,562 --> 00:19:19,296
Is he the food man?

483
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,202
No, Peter, it's not him.

484
00:19:25,236 --> 00:19:26,369
They're making up!

485
00:19:26,404 --> 00:19:27,437
It's working!

486
00:19:27,472 --> 00:19:29,539
That means soon
you will not exist.

487
00:19:29,574 --> 00:19:32,876
Then I guess this
is good-bye, Stewie.

488
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,111
I'll miss you.

489
00:19:34,145 --> 00:19:35,479
You've taught
me so much.

490
00:19:35,513 --> 00:19:36,847
And you've been
a good friend.

491
00:19:36,881 --> 00:19:37,981
And you as well.

492
00:19:38,015 --> 00:19:39,116
Ah! Damn it!

493
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,584
Help me, Stewie!
Lift it off!

494
00:19:40,618 --> 00:19:42,385
Eh, that looks
really heavy.

495
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,387
It is! And it's
incredibly painful!

496
00:19:44,422 --> 00:19:45,388
Please, help!

497
00:19:45,423 --> 00:19:46,823
You know,
you'll be fading away

498
00:19:46,858 --> 00:19:48,492
any moment, you know?

499
00:19:48,526 --> 00:19:50,594
It'd be a lot of effort
ultimately for nothing.

500
00:19:50,628 --> 00:19:52,062
I'm choking on
my own blood!

501
00:19:52,096 --> 00:19:53,063
(gurgles)

502
00:19:53,097 --> 00:19:54,965
Call someone! Please!

503
00:19:54,999 --> 00:19:57,801
Well, again,
it was great knowing you.

504
00:19:57,835 --> 00:19:59,402
Ah! You bastard!

505
00:19:59,437 --> 00:20:00,904
You'll burn in hell...

506
00:20:02,373 --> 00:20:03,707
Ugh, finally.

507
00:20:03,741 --> 00:20:05,208
That was an ordeal.

508
00:20:12,683 --> 00:20:14,184
I... I did it!

509
00:20:14,218 --> 00:20:15,585
I'm back.

510
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,720
Aw, damn it.

511
00:20:16,754 --> 00:20:18,655
I left my ChapStick in the past.

512
00:20:20,158 --> 00:20:21,391
ChapStick!

513
00:20:21,425 --> 00:20:23,760
With smooth lips,
I will finally be able

514
00:20:23,794 --> 00:20:26,930
to be a mayor who kisses babies
with confidence!

515
00:20:26,964 --> 00:20:28,899
Hey, cracked lips!

516
00:20:28,933 --> 00:20:29,900
You'll see!

517
00:20:29,934 --> 00:20:31,735
You'll all see!

518
00:20:37,408 --> 00:20:39,876
Ooh, scrambled eggs!
How delightful.

519
00:20:39,911 --> 00:20:41,011
Thank you, Lois.

520
00:20:41,045 --> 00:20:42,646
Well, you're certainly
in a better mood

521
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,014
since last
night's tantrum.

522
00:20:44,048 --> 00:20:47,083
You know, Brian, I've realized
this is where I belong.

523
00:20:47,118 --> 00:20:49,753
For better or worse,
I'm a Griffin.

524
00:20:49,787 --> 00:20:50,887
(door crashes)

525
00:20:50,922 --> 00:20:53,390
Coward!
I have found you!

526
00:20:53,424 --> 00:20:54,624
Ah!

527
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:57,266
Well, it took
three years,

528
00:20:57,267 --> 00:21:00,207
but I am finally
through all that porn.
