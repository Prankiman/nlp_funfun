00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,394
We now return to

12
00:00:35,395 --> 00:00:37,897
<i>How David Lynch Stole Christmas.</i>

13
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:42,067
Hello. I got you a present.

14
00:00:42,068 --> 00:00:43,769
It's a thumb.

15
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:44,937
Don't look away.

16
00:00:44,938 --> 00:00:46,739
Let the fear wash over you.

17
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,073
I don't understand.

18
00:00:48,074 --> 00:00:49,575
That's the whole point.

19
00:00:49,576 --> 00:00:52,144
Now, did you leave a plate
of black coffee out for me?

20
00:00:52,145 --> 00:00:54,313
- No.
- In the future,

21
00:00:54,314 --> 00:00:57,383
please leave a plate of
black coffee out for me.

22
00:00:57,384 --> 00:00:59,518
Also in the past.

23
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:01,987
You guys, what are you
doing watching TV?

24
00:01:01,988 --> 00:01:03,923
- It's snowing.
- Really?

25
00:01:03,924 --> 00:01:06,600
Wow, it's so beautiful!

26
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:07,393
Isn't it?

27
00:01:07,394 --> 00:01:09,128
And you know what's a miracle, kids?

28
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:12,665
Every single snowflake is exactly alike.

29
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:14,133
I don't think that's right.

30
00:01:14,134 --> 00:01:16,402
No, it's true. Just like fingerprints.

31
00:01:16,403 --> 00:01:18,304
All right, you guys ready for church?

32
00:01:18,305 --> 00:01:19,798
Church? What are you, an idiot?

33
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,173
It's the first snow of the season.

34
00:01:21,175 --> 00:01:22,174
We're going sledding.

35
00:01:22,175 --> 00:01:23,776
Please, can we, Mom?

36
00:01:23,777 --> 00:01:25,244
Well, I mean, it's Sunday, and...

37
00:01:25,245 --> 00:01:26,812
Come on, Lois. After all,

38
00:01:26,813 --> 00:01:29,279
sledding was the second
passion of the Christ.

39
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:32,413
Eat this, for this is my dust!

40
00:01:36,923 --> 00:01:38,424
My sled has Dora on it

41
00:01:38,425 --> 00:01:40,693
'cause my parents got it at a yard sale.

42
00:01:40,694 --> 00:01:42,361
It's still for boys though.

43
00:01:42,362 --> 00:01:45,029
She's about language
acquisition, not gender.

44
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:48,033
Sorry, fun-seekers,

45
00:01:48,034 --> 00:01:50,169
this hill is closed to sledding.

46
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,570
What? What are you talking about?

47
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:54,039
Too many pansy-ass parents sue the city

48
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,474
when their kids sprain a finger

49
00:01:55,475 --> 00:01:57,443
or crush their skull on a bumper.

50
00:01:57,444 --> 00:02:00,646
I'm afraid sledding has
been banned in Quahog.

51
00:02:00,647 --> 00:02:02,881
You can't do that! Last time I checked,

52
00:02:02,882 --> 00:02:04,650
this is still the<i> United States of Tara.</i>

53
00:02:04,651 --> 00:02:05,751
Obscure reference.

54
00:02:05,752 --> 00:02:07,319
And I'm not gonna let anybody tell me

55
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,088
where I can and cannot sled!

56
00:02:09,089 --> 00:02:10,689
Yeah, you're right.

57
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,224
Power to the people!

58
00:02:12,225 --> 00:02:16,127
The whole world is watching!
The whole world is watching!

59
00:02:17,697 --> 00:02:19,298
What... what just happened?

60
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:20,799
Who cares? Last one down the hill...

61
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,801
Oh, my God!

62
00:02:22,802 --> 00:02:23,936
Call my mom!

63
00:02:23,937 --> 00:02:26,572
I crushed my skull on a bumper!

64
00:02:29,886 --> 00:02:32,645
You serious? All this white
stuff used to be water?

65
00:02:32,646 --> 00:02:34,613
Mm. My word.

66
00:02:34,614 --> 00:02:35,836
Joe, what are you riding on?

67
00:02:35,837 --> 00:02:38,250
Oh, it's a bedpan.
I got a ton of these at home.

68
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:41,252
You make every activity incredibly sad.

69
00:02:44,524 --> 00:02:46,375
There you are. Where have you been?

70
00:02:46,377 --> 00:02:47,960
I just ran home to get the big sled

71
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:49,094
out of our dining room.

72
00:02:49,095 --> 00:02:50,329
What are you talking about?

73
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,864
We don't have a sled in our dining room.

74
00:02:51,865 --> 00:02:53,332
Everybody on!

75
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,634
Peter, the dining room
table is an antique.

76
00:02:55,635 --> 00:02:57,832
It's been in my family
for six generations.

77
00:02:57,839 --> 00:02:58,839
It's fine.

78
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,308
Okay, now, since we're white guys

79
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:03,376
doing something stupid,
everybody grab a GoPro.

80
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,083
Yeah, this is awesome!

81
00:03:09,084 --> 00:03:10,418
Oh, we're drifting.

82
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:11,752
W-We're turning. We're turning!

83
00:03:11,753 --> 00:03:12,820
Dad, I'm scared.

84
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:13,955
We're backwards!

85
00:03:13,956 --> 00:03:15,623
Am I the only one
who thinks that now

86
00:03:15,624 --> 00:03:17,992
we're at an alarming speed?

87
00:03:24,433 --> 00:03:26,100
Peter, are you insane?!

88
00:03:26,101 --> 00:03:28,069
You could have killed the entire family!

89
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,905
Sorry, Lois. I honestly thought
this was gonna be fun.

90
00:03:30,906 --> 00:03:33,274
Like when I won that sex contest.

91
00:03:33,275 --> 00:03:34,408
First again!

92
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:35,843
Wasn't even close, was it?

93
00:03:35,844 --> 00:03:38,212
No, Peter, it wasn't even close.

94
00:03:38,213 --> 00:03:39,780
Yeah, you are terrible at this.

95
00:03:39,781 --> 00:03:41,082
Now, why don't you clean up

96
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,283
and go get the champ a Gatorade, huh?

97
00:03:48,557 --> 00:03:50,558
You wearing pants always amuses me.

98
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:52,727
Yeah, I know. It's just
I got roped into going

99
00:03:52,728 --> 00:03:54,462
to some stupid office Christmas party

100
00:03:54,463 --> 00:03:55,930
with this girl I'm dating.

101
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:57,331
Really? I thought you just went

102
00:03:57,332 --> 00:03:59,433
to an office Christmas
party with her last week.

103
00:03:59,434 --> 00:04:01,035
What? Oh, no, um...

104
00:04:01,036 --> 00:04:03,237
No, that-that was
this other girl I was dating.

105
00:04:03,238 --> 00:04:06,540
Um, her name was... Kow-ooch.

106
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,976
Did you just say "couch,"
but pronounce it strangely

107
00:04:08,977 --> 00:04:10,511
so it sounded like a name?

108
00:04:10,512 --> 00:04:11,946
What's going on, Brian?

109
00:04:11,947 --> 00:04:13,614
All right, look,
I've been crashing

110
00:04:13,615 --> 00:04:15,583
office Christmas parties
for the free booze

111
00:04:15,584 --> 00:04:18,152
and drunk women who don't want
to spend the holidays alone.

112
00:04:18,153 --> 00:04:20,221
Oh, so you're a Christmas party creep.

113
00:04:20,222 --> 00:04:22,957
Just like the fat man is
a pool party creep.

114
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,558
Now, Chris, you're getting older,

115
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:27,528
so it's time for you to learn
the classic pool party game

116
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:29,630
"Talk to Somebody's Wife in a Bikini

117
00:04:29,631 --> 00:04:31,632
Until They Cover Up Uncomfortably."

118
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:33,200
So, Bonnie, how are things going?

119
00:04:33,201 --> 00:04:34,969
Oh, things are fine.

120
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:38,272
Been kind of busy lately,
what with Susie starting to...

121
00:04:38,273 --> 00:04:40,007
Okay, bye.

122
00:04:40,008 --> 00:04:41,809
Man, that's, like, two seconds.

123
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,412
Hey, Peter. Hey, what have you
been watching on TV lately?

124
00:04:44,413 --> 00:04:45,713
Oh, you know, this and that.

125
00:04:45,714 --> 00:04:47,415
There's a show called <i>Shipping Wars.</i>

126
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,215
Uh, it's actually kinda... Okay, bye.

127
00:04:55,624 --> 00:04:57,958
Oh, boy, the Marshalls
is now a Nordstrom.

128
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:00,127
I feel like our days at
this mall are numbered.

129
00:05:00,128 --> 00:05:01,595
Well, we have $60.

130
00:05:01,596 --> 00:05:04,098
Let's see what kind of
Chinese pressed-board garbage

131
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:05,599
we can get to replace my grandmother's

132
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,401
priceless mahogany table.

133
00:05:07,402 --> 00:05:09,336
Dad, look, Santa's here!

134
00:05:11,173 --> 00:05:12,873
I want to sit on his lap.

135
00:05:12,874 --> 00:05:14,608
Geez, Chris, come on.
You're in high school.

136
00:05:14,609 --> 00:05:16,911
I'm gonna ask him for
a family trampoline.

137
00:05:16,912 --> 00:05:19,046
Holy crap, get your ass up there!

138
00:05:19,047 --> 00:05:20,581
You know what, Peter?

139
00:05:20,582 --> 00:05:21,916
I'll get the table myself.

140
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:23,751
And then I might just sit in that car

141
00:05:23,752 --> 00:05:26,019
in the middle of the mall and cry.

142
00:05:28,056 --> 00:05:29,623
Geez, look at this line.

143
00:05:29,624 --> 00:05:31,859
Yeah, no kidding. And it's not moving.

144
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,762
Me and my adopted son have
been waiting quite a while.

145
00:05:34,763 --> 00:05:37,231
Wait, what... Why did you...

146
00:05:37,232 --> 00:05:38,599
I didn't even ask.

147
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,701
So is your son a biolog?

148
00:05:40,702 --> 00:05:41,969
What... I'm not...

149
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,438
I-I don't watch <i>Modern Family,</i> sorry.

150
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:46,510
Hey, Chris, wait here.
I'm gonna see what's going on.

151
00:05:47,738 --> 00:05:49,410
Hey, Muscles, what's taking so long?

152
00:05:49,411 --> 00:05:51,545
I'm sorry, sir. This may shock you,

153
00:05:51,546 --> 00:05:53,647
but it turns out the
seasonal Santa we hired

154
00:05:53,648 --> 00:05:55,269
has a drinking problem.

155
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,650
And I don't know where
to find a replacement

156
00:05:56,651 --> 00:05:58,219
on such short notice.

157
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,321
Hey, you're a hefty guy.

158
00:06:00,322 --> 00:06:01,655
I called you "Muscles."

159
00:06:01,656 --> 00:06:03,124
Would you mind putting on the suit

160
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,424
and playing Santa,
just until the shift ends?

161
00:06:05,426 --> 00:06:06,827
I'd pay you for your time.

162
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:07,962
All right, fine.

163
00:06:07,963 --> 00:06:10,398
I mean, it's not the first time
I pretended to be someone else.

164
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,599
I once dressed as a farmer

165
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,007
to get a date on FarmersOnly.com.

166
00:06:14,302 --> 00:06:15,870
Are you Peter?

167
00:06:15,871 --> 00:06:17,638
Yeah. A-Are you the gross lady

168
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,840
who lives in the
converted horse trailer?

00:06:39,027 --> 00:06:41,028
'Sup? Slammin' pantsuit.

173
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:42,630
Hey, I'm Scott Fitzgerald.

174
00:06:42,631 --> 00:06:45,065
You probably don't recognize me
'cause I'm in corporate.

175
00:06:45,066 --> 00:06:47,201
So am I. This<i> is</i> corporate.

176
00:06:47,202 --> 00:06:50,137
A little
too much so, if you ask me.

177
00:06:50,138 --> 00:06:52,173
I... I try to have fun, right?

178
00:06:52,174 --> 00:06:54,596
I-I mean, we're not,
we're not landing planes here.

179
00:06:54,597 --> 00:06:57,777
Our company manufactures
aircraft landing gear systems.

180
00:06:57,778 --> 00:06:59,079
Yep, uh-huh.

181
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,683
Well, I am going to fly us over
a few more drinks.

182
00:07:04,586 --> 00:07:06,153
Stewie? What are you doing here?

183
00:07:06,154 --> 00:07:08,155
I followed you. I had to see for myself

184
00:07:08,156 --> 00:07:10,357
just how desperate and
pathetic you really are.

185
00:07:10,358 --> 00:07:11,926
And don't worry, I'm not sticking around

186
00:07:11,927 --> 00:07:12,993
this sad little... Ooh!

187
00:07:12,994 --> 00:07:14,927
Is that rolled-up ham for everyone?

188
00:07:14,929 --> 00:07:16,563
Yeah. Okay.

189
00:07:16,565 --> 00:07:17,998
Well, I'll see you at home...

190
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:20,367
Hey, everyone,
karaoke's starting!

191
00:07:20,368 --> 00:07:22,002
Well, I could watch and make fun

192
00:07:22,003 --> 00:07:23,471
for just a few... Oh, my God!

193
00:07:23,472 --> 00:07:25,272
They have a photo booth
with funny props!

194
00:07:25,273 --> 00:07:27,641
Oh, I call the big funny glasses!

195
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,088
And I want a tricycle and a pony

196
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:42,656
and an American Girl doll

197
00:07:42,657 --> 00:07:45,092
and a drone with a camera
and a gun that fires...

198
00:07:45,093 --> 00:07:47,393
Ho, ho, ho. Yeah, sure, all of it.

199
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,097
All right, now, go pick up your picture.

200
00:07:50,098 --> 00:07:51,599
And before you go crying to your mom,

201
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,500
that's my cell phone you're feeling.

202
00:07:55,537 --> 00:07:57,972
Hey, Santa Claus, you going home soon?

203
00:07:57,973 --> 00:08:00,140
Well, depending on how traffic is

204
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:02,009
at the North Pole.

205
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,444
So what can I get for you today?

206
00:08:03,445 --> 00:08:04,812
Milk and cookies?

207
00:08:04,813 --> 00:08:06,213
Oh, okay.

208
00:08:06,214 --> 00:08:07,314
Sorry I started this.

209
00:08:07,315 --> 00:08:08,682
Chicken burrito, please.

210
00:08:08,683 --> 00:08:10,951
There you go. Merry Christmas.

211
00:08:10,952 --> 00:08:12,152
Uh, how much do I, uh...

212
00:08:12,153 --> 00:08:14,321
Oh, come on, I'm not
charging Santa Claus.

213
00:08:14,322 --> 00:08:15,389
It's on the house.

214
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,532
This is free because

215
00:08:16,534 --> 00:08:18,025
I'm dressed as Santa?

216
00:08:18,026 --> 00:08:20,227
That's right. Anything for Santa.

217
00:08:20,228 --> 00:08:21,262
Anything?

218
00:08:21,263 --> 00:08:23,030
Holy crap, this is awesome!

219
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:24,331
I'm Santa Claus.

220
00:08:24,332 --> 00:08:26,399
In this suit I'm like a god.

221
00:08:31,473 --> 00:08:33,018
I got a free burrito!

222
00:08:39,763 --> 00:08:41,912

Dad, why are you still
wearing that Santa suit?

227
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:51,658
Well, the guy at the mall asked me

228
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:53,493
to stay on till Christmas,
and I said yes,

229
00:08:53,494 --> 00:08:54,827
'cause being Santa's awesome.

230
00:08:54,828 --> 00:08:56,930
You wear this suit,
it's like a free pass.

231
00:08:56,931 --> 00:08:58,431
People let you do anything you want.

232
00:08:58,432 --> 00:08:59,832
What are you talking about?

233
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:01,919
Oh, it's the stuff of dreams, Lois.

234
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:04,972
Free burritos, free orange
chicken, free pretzels.

235
00:09:04,974 --> 00:09:06,539
Did you make it out of the food court?

236
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,707
I made it to the border.

237
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:10,209
I got a free iPhone case
and a tiny license plate.

238
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,511
It says "Corey."

239
00:09:11,512 --> 00:09:13,880
Yep. Cost me zilch.

240
00:09:19,053 --> 00:09:21,220
So, who's this "Mary Christmas"

241
00:09:21,221 --> 00:09:22,655
everybody keeps talking about?

242
00:09:22,656 --> 00:09:24,424
Oh...

243
00:09:24,425 --> 00:09:26,426
that's very clever.

244
00:09:26,427 --> 00:09:27,627
I don't recognize you.

245
00:09:27,628 --> 00:09:29,095
Which department are you in?

246
00:09:29,096 --> 00:09:31,597
Well, right now I'm in Boob Assessment.

247
00:09:31,598 --> 00:09:32,899
Eww.

248
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,238
Hey, you were right about
office Christmas parties.

249
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,908
- They're fantastic!
- Uh-huh, okay.

250
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,344
I'm gonna keep looking around the room

251
00:09:38,346 --> 00:09:39,379
while you talk.

252
00:09:39,381 --> 00:09:41,149
Yes, it's like watching a soap opera,

253
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,784
what with all the drunken misbehavior

254
00:09:42,785 --> 00:09:44,185
and ill-advised hookups.

255
00:09:44,186 --> 00:09:46,139
And down the hall they're
doing a "white elephant."

256
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:47,406
Oh, that gift-exchange thing?

257
00:09:47,407 --> 00:09:50,109
No, there's a fat secretary
taking on all comers.

258
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,478
Where, uh, uh, which office is that in?

259
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:53,879
Oh, you won't miss her.
She's still wearing

260
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,247
the felt antlers.

261
00:09:55,248 --> 00:09:57,315
Absolute freak show in there.

262
00:09:58,518 --> 00:09:59,985
Hey, what the hell's going on?

263
00:09:59,986 --> 00:10:01,654
Oh, Santa. I-I'm sorry.

264
00:10:01,655 --> 00:10:02,988
I didn't realize this was your car.

265
00:10:02,989 --> 00:10:05,090
That's right. Now,
crumple up that ticket.

266
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,731
Now eat it!

267
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:10,629
All right, now we're
gonna go to your home

268
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,864
and wait for you to pass it,

269
00:10:11,865 --> 00:10:13,666
and then you're gonna eat it again.

270
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:15,768
Hey, honey, this is Santa.

271
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:17,403
He's gonna come in
and watch me in the bathroom.

272
00:10:17,404 --> 00:10:18,804
Oh, just like the Easter Bunny did.

273
00:10:18,805 --> 00:10:20,072
Exactly.

274
00:10:20,073 --> 00:10:22,307
I got a lot of guys coming through here.

275
00:10:24,644 --> 00:10:26,212
The next composition is

276
00:10:26,213 --> 00:10:29,048
<i>Opus Dei, Dei Dei Pater,</i>

277
00:10:29,049 --> 00:10:31,483
seventh movement, by Chopin.

278
00:10:34,921 --> 00:10:38,015
Correction. The next composition

279
00:10:38,017 --> 00:10:42,017
is 1-877-Kars-4-Kids.

280

284
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:02,530
I lost my virginity to this song.

285
00:11:08,398 --> 00:11:09,765
Ugh, this party's a dud.

286
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:10,656
Yeah, no kidding.

287
00:11:10,657 --> 00:11:12,525
That lady turned off a Hall & Oates song

288
00:11:12,526 --> 00:11:14,260
because it was "too provocative."

289
00:11:14,261 --> 00:11:15,628
Everyone, let's remember,

290
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:17,163
this is still a workplace.

291
00:11:17,164 --> 00:11:18,297
Sorry, Barb.

292
00:11:18,298 --> 00:11:19,899
You know what? I got an idea.

293
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,469
I'm gonna stir up some drama,
make this party interesting.

294
00:11:24,905 --> 00:11:27,705
Excuse me? Uh, could I have
your attention please? Hi.

295
00:11:27,741 --> 00:11:30,376
Hi, I'm Chadwick Redmayne
from the regional office.

296
00:11:30,377 --> 00:11:32,945
Unfortunately, since people
only use printers now

297
00:11:32,946 --> 00:11:35,414
to print out boarding passes
for their grandparents,

298
00:11:35,415 --> 00:11:38,417
40% of you will
be laid off as of Monday.

299
00:11:38,418 --> 00:11:41,253
Oh, and whoever drinks
the most shots keeps their job.

300
00:11:45,358 --> 00:11:48,127
See? That's how you get a party started.

301
00:11:48,128 --> 00:11:50,162
Mr. Redmayne, I don't know who you are,

302
00:11:50,163 --> 00:11:52,631
but I've been in charge of
this office for 16 years...

303
00:11:52,632 --> 00:11:54,533
- Sad.
- And I want to thank you.

304
00:11:54,534 --> 00:11:56,602
I've been trying to reduce
our staff costs for months,

305
00:11:56,603 --> 00:11:58,470
but just didn't have the guts to do it,

306
00:11:58,471 --> 00:11:59,838
much less before Christmas.

307
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,374
Yeah, well, that's why
they send in Channing Redwick,

308
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,443
or Chadmayne, or whatever,

309
00:12:04,444 --> 00:12:05,878
I don't even remember what I said.

310
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,813
We could use someone
like you around here.

311
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:10,223
Welcome aboard. See you Monday.

312
00:12:11,084 --> 00:12:13,118
Wow, a paying, grown-up job!

313
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:14,787
I haven't been this excited
about anything

314
00:12:14,788 --> 00:12:17,389
since the night<i> Wicked</i>
premiered in Quahog.

315
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,826
All right, Brian,
let's rob these gay guys.

316
00:12:19,828 --> 00:12:20,726
What if they're home?

317
00:12:20,727 --> 00:12:22,178
They're not gonna be home.

318
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:27,800
Bye, Santa!

319
00:12:27,801 --> 00:12:29,301
Bye, strippers!

320
00:12:29,302 --> 00:12:31,570
Uh, you can all take
your clothes off now,

321
00:12:31,571 --> 00:12:33,571
I was just comin' in for the spaghetti.

322
00:12:36,676 --> 00:12:38,143
Aah! Bitch!

323
00:12:38,144 --> 00:12:39,678
Ah, that hurts.

324
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:41,747
Ah, I'm drunk.

325
00:12:41,748 --> 00:12:43,214
Heart's beatin' fast.

326
00:12:47,454 --> 00:12:49,521
Spaghetti angel!

327
00:12:49,522 --> 00:12:52,091
I'm makin' a spaghetti angel.

328
00:12:52,092 --> 00:12:54,260
When Italian guys die, they...

329
00:12:54,261 --> 00:12:55,828
they turn into...

330
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:56,962
into...

331
00:12:56,963 --> 00:13:00,098
into...

332
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:02,468
Peter.

333
00:13:02,469 --> 00:13:04,936
Peter Griffin.

334
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:08,707
Peter? We need to talk.

335
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,509
Who... Who are you?

336
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,711
I'm the real Santa Claus.

337
00:13:12,712 --> 00:13:16,282
Awesome! Okay, my first wish
is for a thousand wishes.

338
00:13:16,283 --> 00:13:18,350
- Yes!
- That's not me. That's a genie.

339
00:13:18,351 --> 00:13:20,886
Okay, then my first wish is for a genie.

340
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:22,588
Again, you'd need a genie.

341
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:23,752
How wasted are you?

342
00:13:23,754 --> 00:13:24,977
Don't judge me.

343
00:13:24,979 --> 00:13:26,289
You live in a bottle.

344
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,281
It's a lamp. And I'm not a genie!

345
00:13:33,806 --> 00:13:35,140
All right, come on now, pal, seriously,

346
00:13:35,141 --> 00:13:36,308
who are you really?

347
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:38,620
I already told you, I'm Santa Claus.

348
00:13:38,622 --> 00:13:39,444
Oh, yeah?

349
00:13:39,445 --> 00:13:41,446
Well, if you're Santa,
then what did I ask for

350
00:13:41,447 --> 00:13:43,815
- for Christmas when I was 12?
- Nothing.

351
00:13:43,816 --> 00:13:45,317
Because it was the year
you found that<i> Penthouse</i>

352
00:13:45,318 --> 00:13:46,318
in the woods.

353
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:48,553
You really are Santa!

354
00:13:48,554 --> 00:13:50,388
Am I really heavier than you?

355
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:52,591
I-I got to, I got to take control.

356
00:13:52,592 --> 00:13:54,659
Look, I'm not very happy with you.

357
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,895
You can't go around in that suit
pretending you're me

358
00:13:56,896 --> 00:13:58,730
and acting like a complete jackass.

359
00:13:58,731 --> 00:14:00,398
What are you talking about?
People love me.

360
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,700
They give me free stuff.

361
00:14:01,701 --> 00:14:03,401
No, they love<i> me.</i>

362
00:14:03,402 --> 00:14:05,737
You're just exploiting
my brand for personal gain

363
00:14:05,738 --> 00:14:07,639
and destroying my reputation.

364
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,241
So there's, like, no
toilet on the sleigh,

365
00:14:09,242 --> 00:14:10,642
so you're, you're just,

366
00:14:10,643 --> 00:14:12,444
you're just crapping in
people's houses, right?

367
00:14:12,445 --> 00:14:13,445
You're not hearing me.

368
00:14:13,446 --> 00:14:15,714
Stop wearing that suit, or else.

369
00:14:15,715 --> 00:14:17,182
Or else what?

370
00:14:17,183 --> 00:14:21,586
Or else I will put you
at the top of my naughty list.

371
00:14:21,587 --> 00:14:23,688
You know, you're not talking
to a little kid anymore,

372
00:14:23,689 --> 00:14:25,357
so get the hell out of my face, Santa.

373
00:14:25,358 --> 00:14:27,359
I like this suit, and I'm keeping it.

374
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,627
Now, if you'll excuse me,

375
00:14:28,628 --> 00:14:30,762
you're standing in my
strip club spaghetti.

376
00:14:30,763 --> 00:14:33,164
I got to get this home
to my family for supper.

377
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,771
You better watch out.

378
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,584
Gail?

379
00:14:52,585 --> 00:14:54,252
Gail, is your Internet working?

380
00:14:54,253 --> 00:14:55,253
Mine's slow.

381
00:14:58,991 --> 00:15:00,792
Oh, my God, Gail, what happened?

382
00:15:00,793 --> 00:15:04,095
I just found out I'm part
of the downsizing you announced.

383
00:15:04,096 --> 00:15:05,123
Oh, no.

384
00:15:05,498 --> 00:15:07,432
So your Internet, is it...

385
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:08,700
is it slow?

386
00:15:08,701 --> 00:15:11,603
Gail, you were supposed
to be gone an hour ago.

387
00:15:11,604 --> 00:15:12,804
Hey, give her a break, man.

388
00:15:12,805 --> 00:15:14,673
This is Gail Devereaux-Slansky.

389
00:15:14,674 --> 00:15:17,175
Oh, it's just Gail Devereaux now.

390
00:15:17,176 --> 00:15:18,710
Oof. Tough week.

391
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:20,212
Why don't you stop rubbernecking

392
00:15:20,213 --> 00:15:22,814
and finish that
payroll report I asked for?

393
00:15:22,815 --> 00:15:24,916
I can't believe I got fired.

394
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:27,285
And right before the holidays.

395
00:15:27,286 --> 00:15:29,354
Oh, God, I've ruined Christmas.

396
00:15:29,355 --> 00:15:33,024
Like the Little Drummer Boy when
he got really into Neil Peart.

397
00:15:35,294 --> 00:15:38,463
♪ Our finest gifts we bring ♪

398
00:15:38,464 --> 00:15:41,299
♪ Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum ♪

399
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:01,931
Christmas is gonna be sick!

400
00:16:06,726 --> 00:16:09,127
So, Dad, now that you made Santa mad,

401
00:16:09,128 --> 00:16:11,496
aren't you scared he's gonna
do something bad to you?

402
00:16:11,497 --> 00:16:12,731
Ah, Santa's all talk.

403
00:16:12,732 --> 00:16:13,798
He ain't gonna do nothing.

404
00:16:16,502 --> 00:16:17,535
Hey, Peter.

405
00:16:17,536 --> 00:16:19,070
Ready to go to Build-A-Bear?

406
00:16:19,071 --> 00:16:20,572
What? What are you talking about?

407
00:16:20,573 --> 00:16:21,573
I got your text.

408
00:16:21,574 --> 00:16:23,642
It says, "Hey, Joe, cancel your plans.

409
00:16:23,643 --> 00:16:25,744
Let's go to Build-A-Bear."
I didn't send you a...

410
00:16:25,745 --> 00:16:27,879
Oh, son of a bitch, Santa.

411
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,614
Joe, I did not send you a text.

412
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:31,950
Well, you sent another text that says,

413
00:16:31,951 --> 00:16:35,453
"Hey, Joe, it's definitely me,
Peter, who sent the text."

414
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:38,056
Damn it, he covered all bases.

415
00:16:38,057 --> 00:16:39,090
What do you think, Peter?

416
00:16:39,091 --> 00:16:41,159
Maybe a little sun hat for Cindy?

417
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,395
Whatever, I'm done with my bear.
Let's get out of here.

418
00:16:43,396 --> 00:16:46,031
Well, the text you sent
earlier would disagree.

419
00:16:46,032 --> 00:16:48,133
You said, "No matter what I say,

420
00:16:48,134 --> 00:16:50,168
I want to build multiple bears."

421
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:52,537
Joe, I swear to you,
I do not want to do that.

422
00:16:53,606 --> 00:16:56,907
News flash, Peter, looks like you do.

423
00:16:59,945 --> 00:17:03,048
Would anyone like to lead
the family in a holiday prayer?

424
00:17:03,049 --> 00:17:05,817
I'll tell you who should be
saying his prayers, Santa.

425
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:07,786
He messes with me, I mess with him.

426
00:17:07,787 --> 00:17:10,088
That's why I replaced
one of his flying reindeer

427
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:12,590
with an ordinary, non-magical one.

428
00:17:15,695 --> 00:17:17,362
Cut it off, cut it off!

429
00:17:22,134 --> 00:17:24,502
You know, I think this year
is gonna be the best...

430
00:17:26,172 --> 00:17:28,505
Yay, free horse!

431
00:17:38,551 --> 00:17:39,551
What the hell?

432
00:17:39,552 --> 00:17:41,519
Hey, Chris, get in here.

433
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,021
This is impossible, right?

434
00:17:43,022 --> 00:17:44,989
All of Meg's farts here in this box?

435
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,458
I would think that's impossible.

436
00:17:46,459 --> 00:17:48,258
Yeah, right? That's impossible.

437
00:17:50,229 --> 00:17:52,196
Is this the box? Yeah, that's it.

438
00:17:54,734 --> 00:17:56,534
Yeah, that's impossible.
I know, it's impossible.

439
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:58,236
Right... O-okay, all right,
I'm opening it.

440
00:17:58,237 --> 00:18:01,005
Unless whoever sent it was magic.

441
00:18:01,006 --> 00:18:03,707
Oh, well, now that's interesting.

442
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,914
Chad, we got to talk about this report.

443
00:18:09,915 --> 00:18:11,916
Why do you write all
your twos backwards?

444
00:18:11,917 --> 00:18:13,818
Well, you know it's a two,
so why are we talking?

445
00:18:13,819 --> 00:18:16,354
Fix it, or you're fired.

446
00:18:16,355 --> 00:18:17,389
You know what?

447
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,757
I thought working in a cubicle

448
00:18:18,758 --> 00:18:20,425
at a mid-sized printing company

449
00:18:20,426 --> 00:18:22,293
would be the adventure of a lifetime.

450
00:18:22,294 --> 00:18:24,896
Instead, it's been nothing
but tedium and cruelty.

451
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:27,298
It's time to set things right.

452
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:28,800
Here you go, Warren.

453
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:30,135
Merry Christmas.

454
00:18:30,136 --> 00:18:31,770
$11,000?

455
00:18:31,771 --> 00:18:34,672
Yes, it's the maximum check
amount I'm authorized to cut.

456
00:18:34,673 --> 00:18:36,508
Cash it fast.

457
00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:40,378
Merry Christmas, cash it fast.
Merry Christmas, cash it fast.

458
00:18:40,379 --> 00:18:42,013
Merry Christmas, cash it fast.

459
00:18:42,014 --> 00:18:44,015
Thanks, Chadwick. This is awesome.

460
00:18:44,016 --> 00:18:46,417
I think you mean "Happy Holidays."

461
00:18:52,158 --> 00:18:54,191
You got to be kidding me.

462
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:59,630
Oh, this is too good.

463
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,437
Point, Griffin.

464
00:19:05,438 --> 00:19:06,738
Let's see you top...

465
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,374
Now you gonna listen?

466
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,575
Now you gonna listen, you little bitch?

467
00:19:10,576 --> 00:19:12,343
- Whose suit are you wearing?
- Your suit!

468
00:19:12,344 --> 00:19:13,778
- Whose suit?
- Your suit!

469
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:14,846
It's your suit!

470
00:19:18,184 --> 00:19:19,484
Okay, okay,

471
00:19:19,485 --> 00:19:21,286
I'll never wear that Santa suit again.

472
00:19:21,287 --> 00:19:24,355
Just stop terrorizing me and
take me off the naughty list.

473
00:19:24,356 --> 00:19:25,924
- You promise?
- Yes!

474
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,193
Thank you.

475
00:19:28,194 --> 00:19:31,863
I've always known you were
a good boy deep inside, Peter.

476
00:19:31,864 --> 00:19:34,365
And just so you know
there are no hard feelings,

477
00:19:34,366 --> 00:19:36,434
this is for you.

478
00:19:36,435 --> 00:19:38,937
It's that<i> Penthouse</i>
you found in the woods.

479
00:19:38,938 --> 00:19:42,607
With Vanessa Williams
and George Burns on the cover?

480
00:19:42,608 --> 00:19:43,741
I'm glad you like it.

481
00:19:43,742 --> 00:19:45,243
I had to buy it from a really creepy guy

482
00:19:45,244 --> 00:19:46,444
on the Internet.

483
00:19:46,905 --> 00:19:49,814
Look, Santa, I owe you an apology.

484
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:52,350
I'm sorry I took
advantage of your good name.

485
00:19:52,351 --> 00:19:55,854
You spread so much joy and
wonder to kids everywhere,

486
00:19:55,855 --> 00:19:58,784
and I just used that
to get stuff for myself.

487
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:00,825
Apology accepted.

488
00:20:00,826 --> 00:20:02,760
And truth is,

489
00:20:02,761 --> 00:20:04,162
you weren't the worst Santa.

490
00:20:04,163 --> 00:20:06,330
This was the worst Santa.

491
00:20:08,534 --> 00:20:10,001
Oh, ho, ho, ho!

492
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:11,302
Oh, and that's another thing.

493
00:20:11,303 --> 00:20:12,837
It's "Ho,<i> ho,</i> ho."

494
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:14,339
Everybody pronounces it wrong.

495
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,640
It's very irritating.

496
00:20:20,379 --> 00:20:21,646
So long, Peter.

497
00:20:21,647 --> 00:20:23,948
Glad to have you back on the nice list.

498
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:34,826
Merry Christmas!

499
00:20:34,827 --> 00:20:36,827
Ho,<i> ho,</i> ho.

500
00:20:41,967 --> 00:20:45,336
<i>And that was the
Christmas I would never forget.</i>

501
00:20:45,337 --> 00:20:49,407
<i>Until I went home and had,
like, 50 beers, and did forget.</i>

502
00:20:49,408 --> 00:20:52,043
<i>But only after I screamed
myself into a blackout</i>

503
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:54,379
<i>while my whole family held me down.</i>

504
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,849
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

505
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,041
