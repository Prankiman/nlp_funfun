1
00:00:32,493 --> 00:00:35,405
Peter, don't forget
you have a physical at one o'clock.

2
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:39,042
For the hundredth time, Lois, I won't forget.
Nag, nag, nag.

3
00:00:39,133 --> 00:00:42,523
I should have married that woman
I met on my bachelor party.

4
00:00:43,453 --> 00:00:47,651
I can't believe your friends just left you here.
Let's get you home.

5
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:50,372
Strange lady. You're so sexy.

6
00:00:50,453 --> 00:00:54,128
I should marry you tomorrow
instead of that pain in the ass Lois.

7
00:00:54,213 --> 00:00:56,329
- It's me.
- You know what? Screw it.

8
00:00:56,413 --> 00:01:00,804
I am so gonna cheat on Lois right now.
I don't care if she finds out.

9
00:01:00,893 --> 00:01:03,930
You got a condom? Never mind.
I got this Milky Way wrapper.

10
00:01:07,493 --> 00:01:08,642
- Put this on.
- Why?

11
00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:14,285
I'm skipping my physical to go have steaks
with the guys and I don't want Lois to know.

12
00:01:14,373 --> 00:01:15,362
OK.

13
00:01:15,453 --> 00:01:18,251
PETER: Lois, I'm going to my physical now.

14
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:20,528
OK, honey. I'll see you later.

15
00:01:24,213 --> 00:01:27,489
Um... What the hell, I'll just ask it.
Why did we need the horse suit?

16
00:01:33,573 --> 00:01:35,882
OK. All right.

17
00:01:35,973 --> 00:01:38,168
That's seven 16-ounce steaks.

18
00:01:38,693 --> 00:01:42,129
Come on, Joe. You haven't even finished one.
That guy had two.

19
00:01:42,213 --> 00:01:46,445
I know. I know. I'm terrible. Which is why
I'm gonna order the cheesecake.

20
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:50,164
I can't do it. I'm so full.

21
00:01:50,253 --> 00:01:54,087
Full of what? Oestrogen?
Come on, take the skirt off, you pansy.

22
00:01:54,173 --> 00:01:57,085
- Let's go. Chow down, Mary Jane.
- I said I can't.

23
00:01:57,173 --> 00:01:59,129
- Eat it. Eat the damn steak.
- No.

24
00:01:59,213 --> 00:02:01,773
- What are you waiting for?
- I can't. No. No. No.

25
00:02:01,853 --> 00:02:04,492
I said I'm not hungry!!

26
00:02:04,573 --> 00:02:06,882
Where is it now, huh? Where is it now?!

27
00:02:06,973 --> 00:02:09,328
Easy, sailor. Easy.

28
00:02:09,413 --> 00:02:13,247
- Put the gun down, Joe.
- Nobody's judging you, man. It's cool.

29
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:16,131
I'll put this in your purse,
next to your tampons.

30
00:02:18,653 --> 00:02:23,773
All right, let's start the bidding. Jennifer,
how much do you bid on the dinette set?

31
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:26,845
- 675, Bob.
- 675. Steven?

32
00:02:26,933 --> 00:02:29,163
- 780.
- 780. Tammy?

33
00:02:29,253 --> 00:02:31,084
- What was the last bid?
- 780.

34
00:02:31,173 --> 00:02:32,686
781.

35
00:02:32,773 --> 00:02:34,411
Fuck you!

36
00:02:35,373 --> 00:02:39,446
- Hi, honey. How was your physical?
- Good, good, good. Yeah, yeah.

37
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:42,331
Too good. You know what the doctor said?

38
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:48,124
The doctor said I was too healthy, you know?
In too good of shape. Don't even know how.

39
00:02:48,213 --> 00:02:50,932
- You didn't go to your physical, did you?
- I did not.

40
00:02:52,933 --> 00:02:55,288
So, Doctor? Is Peter healthy?

41
00:02:55,373 --> 00:02:57,728
- My goodness, you'll be dead in a month.
- What?!

42
00:02:57,813 --> 00:03:00,452
HÃ¤gar the Horrible,
if you keep up that lifestyle

43
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:03,445
of pillaging and turkey legs,
you'll be dead in a month.

44
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:06,331
- Now on to you.
- So what do you think? Pretty healthy?

45
00:03:06,413 --> 00:03:09,928
Well, Mr Griffin, let's take a look
at your physical results.

46
00:03:10,013 --> 00:03:12,322
There's a spider in here. Now, here we go.

47
00:03:12,413 --> 00:03:16,929
Mr Griffin, you're going to expire in a month.
This is your driver's licence, isn't it?

48
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:22,212
I'm afraid you are going to die when you
watch these Dean Martin celebrity roasts.

49
00:03:22,293 --> 00:03:24,523
Will you just tell us how Peter's health is?

50
00:03:24,613 --> 00:03:27,650
Mr Griffin, I'm not quite sure how to say this.

51
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:30,452
Kim Bassinger.

52
00:03:33,573 --> 00:03:35,689
- But now on to the cancer.
- My God.

53
00:03:35,773 --> 00:03:39,652
You are a Cancer, right? You were born
in July? On to these test results.

54
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:41,803
My, they're much worse than I thought.

55
00:03:41,893 --> 00:03:44,282
My son got a D minus on his history test.

56
00:03:44,373 --> 00:03:46,887
- Now, that liver's got to come out.
- What?

57
00:03:46,973 --> 00:03:49,806
It's been in the microwave
for three minutes. Now...

58
00:03:49,893 --> 00:03:52,168
Please. Please,

59
00:03:52,253 --> 00:03:54,608
we can't take any more shtick.

60
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:57,161
Please just tell us. Is Peter healthy?

61
00:03:57,253 --> 00:04:00,006
- He's fine. He's just really fat.
- Thank God.

62
00:04:00,093 --> 00:04:03,529
Wait, wait, wait. Hang on a second.
Did you just say I was fat?

63
00:04:03,613 --> 00:04:05,888
Well, yeah. You are pretty fat.

64
00:04:07,293 --> 00:04:10,524
OK. This is news to me.

65
00:04:10,613 --> 00:04:14,572
This is more awkward than having sex
with a rhinoceros who doesn't love you.

66
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:18,006
Why wouldn't you look at me during?

67
00:04:24,213 --> 00:04:28,252
- How was your physical?
- Doctor said I was fat. Can you believe that?

68
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,767
- You are on the large side.
- Please, Brian.

69
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:34,289
If I was fat, could I do this with a Hula Hoop?

70
00:04:41,413 --> 00:04:45,884
No, no, no.
I guess you couldn't do that if you were fat.

71
00:04:47,493 --> 00:04:52,647
Careful, Peter. That's an old family photo.
My mother gave it to me.

72
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:54,724
That's weird.

73
00:04:57,693 --> 00:05:01,652
- I didn't know you had a brother.
- I don't. I mean, I don't think so.

74
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:05,772
Hey, if I'm fat, then Stewie's fat too
because we wear the same size Onesie.

75
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,650
- Hello, pumpkin.
- Hello, Daddy.

76
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:17,169
- Did I miss your piano recital?
- No, Daddy. I'm in my 40s now.

77
00:05:17,253 --> 00:05:21,405
- Good God.
- I had a question I wanted to ask.

78
00:05:21,493 --> 00:05:24,087
Do I have a brother?

79
00:05:24,173 --> 00:05:28,530
- No. No. Don't be silly.
- Because I found this picture...

80
00:05:29,493 --> 00:05:33,611
- Dick. Thank God you're here. Talk to her.
- Message CM-27.

81
00:05:33,693 --> 00:05:38,403
The subscriber you are trying to reach
is unavailable or outside the calling area.

82
00:05:39,013 --> 00:05:42,642
- What do you feel like doing later?
- Message CM-42.

83
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:45,770
Let's go pay some hookers
to knock ourjunk around.

84
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:51,962
- Are you sure this is a good idea?
- Daddy will never tell me the truth.

85
00:05:52,053 --> 00:05:54,647
The only way is to check the family records.

86
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:57,201
Breaking into Grandma and Grandpa's house.

87
00:05:57,293 --> 00:06:01,605
This is more exciting than that time I saw
Bobby McFerrin fall down those stairs.

88
00:06:07,653 --> 00:06:09,166
Cool.

89
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:14,211
- What are you doing? They're sleeping.
- Please.

90
00:06:14,293 --> 00:06:19,287
They get so doped up on sleeping pills and
liquor, an earthquake wouldn't wake them up.

91
00:06:22,013 --> 00:06:26,484
My God. How does she sleep knowing
she has to funnel this old duffer's hog?

92
00:06:30,213 --> 00:06:34,604
This is it. "Patrick Pewterschmidt.
56 Meadow Lane, Brookfield. "

93
00:06:34,693 --> 00:06:38,049
I do have a brother.
My God. I've got to meet him.

94
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:41,205
Hey, Brian. You know what'd be fun?

95
00:06:41,293 --> 00:06:42,885
God, totally.

96
00:06:45,813 --> 00:06:46,848
Awesome.

97
00:06:46,933 --> 00:06:49,811
Sometimes the old-fashioned playthings
are the best.

98
00:06:49,893 --> 00:06:53,886
Hey, kids of America.
It's hand-painted wooden ball in a cup.

99
00:06:53,973 --> 00:06:58,046
Who needs constant electronic video
stimulation when there's ball in a cup?

100
00:06:58,133 --> 00:07:02,046
Mexico's favourite toy for over 340 years.

101
00:07:02,133 --> 00:07:04,249
Toss the ball, catch it in the cup,

102
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:08,292
dump it out of the cup, toss it,
and catch it in the cup again.

103
00:07:08,373 --> 00:07:13,652
The ball is on a string and attached to the cup
so there's no worry if you don't catch the ball.

104
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:17,043
And cleanup is as easy
as catching a ball in a cup.

105
00:07:17,133 --> 00:07:19,727
Why spend another day
not catching a ball in a cup

106
00:07:19,813 --> 00:07:22,771
when you could be catching a ball in a cup?

107
00:07:25,733 --> 00:07:28,088
Ball in a cup.

108
00:07:30,773 --> 00:07:33,162
I think you're in denial about this fat thing.

109
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:36,802
Yeah? Well, I challenge you
to prove to me that I'm fat.

110
00:07:36,893 --> 00:07:39,487
- OK, hang on. See this?
- Yeah.

111
00:07:39,573 --> 00:07:42,041
- You know what it is?
- It's an apple.

112
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:45,125
Good, good, good. All right, watch this.

113
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,609
What the hell? What is this?
What is this? Some kind of gag?

114
00:07:49,693 --> 00:07:51,729
No. That's orbit.

115
00:07:51,813 --> 00:07:57,092
- You have your own gravitational pull.
- That's a bunch of crap.

116
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:02,052
<i>Now The Three Stooges.</i>

117
00:08:10,613 --> 00:08:15,767
<i>Can you believe I'm meeting my long-lost
brother? Maybe Dateline will do a story.</i>

118
00:08:15,853 --> 00:08:20,608
I'll get to meet that ass Stone Phillips. He's
the kind of guy you hate till he's inside you.

119
00:08:20,693 --> 00:08:23,571
There it is. 56 Meadow Lane.

120
00:08:25,413 --> 00:08:27,881
Brookfield Insane Asylum?

121
00:08:27,973 --> 00:08:30,646
My God. Mom's brother's crazy.

122
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:33,122
No. I didn't catch the ball in the cup.

123
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:36,808
Wait. It's OK because the ball
is on a string and attached to the cup.

124
00:08:41,773 --> 00:08:43,843
Doctor, is my brother really insane?

125
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:48,688
Mrs Griffin, we don't use the word "insane".
We prefer the term "mentally hilarious".

126
00:08:48,773 --> 00:08:52,925
I can't wait to meet the lunatic.
I bet he's weirder than that commercial I saw.

127
00:08:53,013 --> 00:08:55,288
- Is that butter substitute?
- It sure is.

128
00:08:55,373 --> 00:08:59,048
- Is it true it has half the calories of butter?
- Yep.

129
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:00,805
- Can I have some?
- Get your own.

130
00:09:00,893 --> 00:09:03,088
- Take that, you bitch.
- What the hell?

131
00:09:03,173 --> 00:09:07,132
- How'd you like that?
- Joke's on you. I have hepatitis.

132
00:09:07,573 --> 00:09:09,086
- Patrick?
- Yes.

133
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:12,006
My name's Lois. I'm your sister.

134
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,765
My God, Lois.

135
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:17,084
- I never thought I'd see you again.
- These are my children.

136
00:09:17,173 --> 00:09:19,926
Why do you live in a crazy house,
Uncle Patrick?

137
00:09:20,013 --> 00:09:24,564
Well, when I was just a little boy,
I had a very traumatic experience.

138
00:09:25,413 --> 00:09:28,371
Mommy, can I have a drink of water?

139
00:09:28,453 --> 00:09:30,011
Jackie Gleason?

140
00:09:30,093 --> 00:09:32,653
Beat it, kid. Your mother's busy.

141
00:09:33,893 --> 00:09:35,292
Right in the kisser.

142
00:09:35,373 --> 00:09:37,728
- That's a horrible story.
- Yes.

143
00:09:37,813 --> 00:09:42,045
I was so traumatised they sent me here.
I guess they must have forgotten about me.

144
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:44,283
Well, you seem perfectly normal to me.

145
00:09:44,373 --> 00:09:47,649
No brother of mine is gonna be
cooped up in some insane asylum.

146
00:09:47,733 --> 00:09:50,201
We are taking you back to Quahog with us.

147
00:09:50,293 --> 00:09:56,687
That's a great idea. He can bring his sling
blade and order some French-fried potatoes.

148
00:09:58,653 --> 00:10:00,405
Thank God I'm out of hospital.

149
00:10:00,493 --> 00:10:04,691
It's great to eat with my family
instead of a bunch of chronic masturbators.

150
00:10:04,773 --> 00:10:09,289
- Those people are disgusting.
- Is it lonely up there on your pedestal?

151
00:10:09,373 --> 00:10:12,171
Peter, there you are.
This is my brother, Patrick.

152
00:10:12,253 --> 00:10:16,565
Good to meet you. Listen up, everybody.
I have something to tell you.

153
00:10:16,653 --> 00:10:19,770
I'm not quite sure how to say this.

154
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:23,448
I'm fat. Let me give you
a minute to absorb that.

155
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:28,687
That's the way it is. It's nobody's fault. Meg.
But I've decided to do something about it.

156
00:10:28,773 --> 00:10:31,890
- You gonna drop some weight, fat-ass?
- No, dummy.

157
00:10:31,973 --> 00:10:34,328
I'm gonna help make this a fat man's world

158
00:10:34,413 --> 00:10:38,611
by establishing the National Association
for the Advancement of Fat People.

159
00:10:38,693 --> 00:10:41,924
This is the best idea I've had
since I slayed that dragon.

160
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:46,122
- Cybill Shepherd?
- Yes.

161
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:03,645
People, you are free.

162
00:11:09,093 --> 00:11:11,288
I'm very glad you're here, Patrick.

163
00:11:11,373 --> 00:11:15,286
Well, I want to tell you that Marian and I
both appreciate what you've done.

164
00:11:15,373 --> 00:11:18,683
Marian? You have a girlfriend.

165
00:11:18,773 --> 00:11:23,164
Where are my manners? Marian is my wife.
She's sitting right next to me.

166
00:11:23,253 --> 00:11:25,608
Here we go.

167
00:11:26,613 --> 00:11:28,683
Nice to meet you, Marian.

168
00:11:28,773 --> 00:11:30,968
What's that, honey? Yes.

169
00:11:31,053 --> 00:11:33,851
Hang on. Marian wants some coffee.

170
00:11:33,933 --> 00:11:35,810
Lois, did you see that? He's nuts.

171
00:11:35,893 --> 00:11:38,691
Brian, he's been locked up
in that place for 30 years.

172
00:11:38,773 --> 00:11:43,005
It's perfectly understandable
that he'd invent an imaginary companion.

173
00:11:43,093 --> 00:11:46,130
He's more imaginative
than the people who invented singing.

174
00:12:16,973 --> 00:12:21,524
All right, everyone, I'd like to get started.
I'd like to get...

175
00:12:21,613 --> 00:12:26,767
We're start... You know what?
Maybe everyone should sit down.

176
00:12:36,573 --> 00:12:40,691
OK, that's better.
Welcome, everybody, to the...

177
00:12:44,533 --> 00:12:47,923
Snacks are best saved for later.

178
00:13:01,813 --> 00:13:04,327
I've prepared an agenda
for our organisation,

179
00:13:04,413 --> 00:13:09,089
what we want from the community
as fat people with pride.

180
00:13:24,493 --> 00:13:28,406
We got a lot accomplished here today.
We'll pick this up again tomorrow.

181
00:13:30,773 --> 00:13:35,688
Hey, guys. I'm going for a run. Do me a favour
and keep Marian company while I'm gone.

182
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,492
- Sure.
- Great. Bye, honey.

183
00:13:40,893 --> 00:13:43,726
Hey, Brian.
Marian just called you an alcoholic.

184
00:13:43,813 --> 00:13:46,486
Yeah? Marian just called you a homo.

185
00:13:46,573 --> 00:13:49,326
Wait a second. I'll be right back.

186
00:13:50,173 --> 00:13:54,166
Hey, Brian, Brian.
What if I put this cucumber right here?

187
00:13:54,253 --> 00:13:57,165
Put it right there.
Do you think Patrick would be angry?

188
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,244
I don't know, man. It's his wife.

189
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:02,962
You don't think he'd be ticked off
if I put that right there?

190
00:14:03,053 --> 00:14:05,442
Just right in that spot there on the couch?

191
00:14:05,533 --> 00:14:09,367
- Hey, Marian's giving you a thumbs up.
- You know what we should do?

192
00:14:09,453 --> 00:14:14,208
We should let it sit here
for a couple of weeks and see if it pickles.

193
00:14:14,293 --> 00:14:20,289
If after three weeks it pickles, then she's real
and we both have to buy Patrick a steak.

194
00:14:25,773 --> 00:14:28,685
Hey, pie. I know what you want.

195
00:14:28,773 --> 00:14:32,129
I saw you in that movie. Whore, slut, bitch.

196
00:14:32,213 --> 00:14:36,001
You don't deserve to have sex with me.
I'm gonna eat the whore out of you.

197
00:14:36,093 --> 00:14:40,245
- Peter, did you start a coalition for fat guys?
- Yeah. The fat-guy coalition.

198
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:44,246
Peter, you shouldn't encourage people
to be fat. Fat people are immoral.

199
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:48,963
- How do you figure, sports fan?
- They're just bad, like that Jackie Gleason.

200
00:14:49,053 --> 00:14:52,329
He was fat and he was bad.
One time when I was a boy...

201
00:14:52,413 --> 00:14:57,885
I love Jackie Gleason. Hey, take a look
at what I bought at this TV convention.

202
00:14:57,973 --> 00:15:00,851
It's a bus driver's uniform.

203
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,208
Right in the kisser.

204
00:15:04,173 --> 00:15:07,131
Right in the kisser.
Right in the kisser.

205
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:10,325
Right in the kisser.
Right in the kisser.

206
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:13,047
Right in the kisser.
Right in the kisser.

207
00:15:13,253 --> 00:15:16,051
Right in the kisser.
Right in the kisser.

208
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:18,772
Right in the kisser.

209
00:15:19,213 --> 00:15:21,932
That set him off like a Paul Shaffer fire alarm.

210
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:34,930
- Hello.
- Lois, it's your father.

211
00:15:35,013 --> 00:15:39,768
The hospital said you released Patrick.
Have you lost your mind? He's dangerous.

212
00:15:39,853 --> 00:15:42,811
Well, that's ridiculous.
Patrick is a very nice man.

213
00:15:42,893 --> 00:15:46,966
And you should be ashamed of yourself
for locking up your own son.

214
00:15:47,053 --> 00:15:48,611
Whose pickle is this?

215
00:15:48,693 --> 00:15:53,084
This just in. The body of a local fat man was
found murdered in Quahog Park last night.

216
00:15:53,173 --> 00:15:56,165
Police released this sketch of the suspect.

217
00:15:57,173 --> 00:15:58,925
My God.

218
00:15:59,013 --> 00:16:05,282
Police also released this sketch of
a female accomplice believed to be his wife.

219
00:16:09,253 --> 00:16:13,610
Hello, I'm Tom Tucker. Quahog's
newest serial killer has struck again.

220
00:16:13,693 --> 00:16:17,527
Since the first victim at Quahog Park,
three more men have been killed,

221
00:16:17,613 --> 00:16:19,683
all of them very very fat.

222
00:16:19,773 --> 00:16:23,368
- Lois, that sketch looks a lot like Patrick.
- That's ridiculous.

223
00:16:23,453 --> 00:16:26,684
He's clearly crazy.
Look at that imaginary wife of his.

224
00:16:26,773 --> 00:16:30,049
If she's imaginary,
how do you explain the pickle on the couch?

225
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:32,124
I don't understand what...

226
00:16:32,213 --> 00:16:34,329
Wait. Really?

227
00:16:34,413 --> 00:16:36,973
- Hey, Stewie.
- I know, I know. I heard.

228
00:16:39,293 --> 00:16:42,251
Patrick. Where have you been?

229
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:45,484
It's nothing you need to
concern yourself with, Lois.

230
00:16:45,573 --> 00:16:48,531
- Well, that's a relief.
- Yeah, that's a relief.

231
00:16:48,613 --> 00:16:52,208
The fat-guy strangler lives here
and there's a fat guy in the house.

232
00:16:52,293 --> 00:16:55,603
This'll be worse
than when Peter did Tara Reid's boob job.

233
00:16:56,893 --> 00:17:00,772
Dropped some pepperoni on there.
You know what? That works. Sew it up.

234
00:17:02,453 --> 00:17:05,650
Michael was one of our brothers.
He was a good man.

235
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,770
He was a kind man. He was a fat man.

236
00:17:08,853 --> 00:17:13,529
And now he's a dead man. And we're all next.
The fat-guy strangler's gonna get us.

237
00:17:13,613 --> 00:17:16,127
- He's right.
- Can someone tie my shoe?

238
00:17:16,213 --> 00:17:22,209
People, people. I know what'll make us
feel better. Let us sing the NAAFP anthem.

239
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:31,205
Make yourselves at home.
Lois, these are the fat guys. Fat guys, Lois.

240
00:18:31,293 --> 00:18:35,411
My God, look at you fat bastards. I bet
none of you can even find your own penis.

241
00:18:35,493 --> 00:18:40,442
Find your penis for a dollar. Find your penis,
one dollar. One dollar, find your penis.

242
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:43,605
- Peter, what's going on?
- Lois, my people are in danger.

243
00:18:43,693 --> 00:18:48,483
Until they find the fat-guy strangler, we will
stay here. Victor, don't lean against that.

244
00:18:48,573 --> 00:18:52,612
- Hey, everybody.
- Get these guys out. Patrick is the murderer.

245
00:18:52,693 --> 00:18:55,491
- What?
- You son of a bitch.

246
00:18:55,573 --> 00:18:58,610
Don't listen.
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

247
00:18:58,693 --> 00:19:00,843
Out of my way. Your brother is toast.

248
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:03,925
Warm, buttery toast.

249
00:19:04,013 --> 00:19:06,732
- That sounds good.
- I just found my penis.

250
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,168
- Run, Patrick, run.
- After him.

251
00:19:11,253 --> 00:19:13,483
Boys, to your Rascals.

252
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:25,726
- He went into James Woods. Let's find him.
- We'll head him off at the...

253
00:19:25,813 --> 00:19:27,565
Todd, you gotta chew your food.

254
00:19:29,373 --> 00:19:32,524
I know my brother.
He couldn't have done these things.

255
00:19:32,613 --> 00:19:36,401
Well, let's see if you feel that way
when you see this.

256
00:19:36,493 --> 00:19:38,370
Look.

257
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:46,011
So he has pictures of himself
strangling fat guys.

258
00:19:46,093 --> 00:19:50,723
- That doesn't mean he's the fat-guy strangler.
- What about the dead fat guy under his bed?

259
00:19:50,813 --> 00:19:53,850
- Coincidence?
- What about the half-dead fat guy?

260
00:19:53,933 --> 00:19:56,731
- Patrick tried to kill me.
- It's a different Patrick.

261
00:19:56,813 --> 00:19:58,724
- Lois.
- OK, OK.

262
00:19:58,813 --> 00:20:03,887
- My God. Peter's out there with him.
- Wait. You gonna eat that dead fat guy?

263
00:20:05,773 --> 00:20:09,049
- How are we gonna find them?
- I'm good at finding people.

264
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:11,522
I found Bush after Hurricane Katrina.

265
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:15,802
- Mr President, are you up there?
- Go away.

266
00:20:15,893 --> 00:20:18,851
<i>- Sir, there's a disaster.
- I'm reading Superfudge.</i>

267
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:21,527
- You gotta deal with this.
- Don't make me do stuff.

268
00:20:22,413 --> 00:20:24,881
Patrick. Patrick.

269
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:30,969
Crap. We lost him. Nothing left to do
but finish this sentence uninterrup...

270
00:20:33,293 --> 00:20:36,285
- Patrick, let him go.
- Don't come any closer.

271
00:20:36,373 --> 00:20:38,489
Patrick, let him go,

272
00:20:38,573 --> 00:20:40,370
or Marian gets it.

273
00:20:40,453 --> 00:20:42,921
Nice try, but Marian's over there.

274
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:47,684
Don't hurt her.

275
00:20:47,773 --> 00:20:50,685
- Now let him go.
- OK. OK.

276
00:20:50,773 --> 00:20:52,809
- You missed.
- No, I didn't.

277
00:20:52,893 --> 00:20:56,727
That's for rolling up the window
when I tried to jump into the General Lee.

278
00:20:56,813 --> 00:21:00,567
I'm sorry, Lois.
I never meant to hurt anybody.

279
00:21:00,653 --> 00:21:04,202
I did mean to kill those fat guys,
but I never meant to hurt you.

280
00:21:04,293 --> 00:21:07,171
You may be very sick, Patrick,
but I love you.

281
00:21:07,253 --> 00:21:09,972
You're my brother
and you'll always be my brother.

282
00:21:10,053 --> 00:21:14,205
- I have to go back to the hospital, don't I?
- Yeah. I'm afraid so.

283
00:21:14,293 --> 00:21:19,526
Patrick, did you see how that rock hit me
in the face? It was like, right in the kisser.

284
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:21,808
Right in the kisser.

285
00:21:21,893 --> 00:21:26,728
Stop screaming. You can't hear me.
Right in the kisser. Right in the kisser.

286
00:21:28,973 --> 00:21:31,168
- I miss Uncle Patrick.
- Don't worry.

287
00:21:31,253 --> 00:21:35,565
- I promise we can visit him once a month.
- We'll be his period.

288
00:21:35,653 --> 00:21:41,603
I was just upstairs and there's
a half-dead fat guy eating a dead fat guy.

289
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:44,928
So I guess we're looking the other way.

290
00:22:06,813 --> 00:22:09,327
