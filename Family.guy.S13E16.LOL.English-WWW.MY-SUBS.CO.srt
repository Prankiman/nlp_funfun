(shouting over music):
Hey, bro!

15
00:00:43,493 --> 00:00:46,459
Hey! You requesting a song or
ordering some sliced meat?

16
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:48,795
Meat! Half a pound
of turkey, please.

17
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:50,127
You want a sample?

18
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:51,800
You mean like
a slice of turkey,

19
00:00:51,834 --> 00:00:54,134
or like a short section
of one musical recording

20
00:00:54,168 --> 00:00:56,797
that's been digitally repurposed
to be part of a new song?

00:00:56,831 --> 00:00:57,831
I don't know.

22
00:00:57,837 --> 00:00:59,799
I might quit this job.

00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,859
God, late-night TV
is all terrible.

24
00:01:01,893 --> 00:01:03,526
Oh, we don't have
to watch this.

25
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,922
We could turn to channel 875
and watch<i> Conan.</i>

26
00:01:05,956 --> 00:01:07,654
Here, let me see
what else is on.

27
00:01:07,688 --> 00:01:10,321
(laughter, applause)

28
00:01:10,355 --> 00:01:13,148
In honor of Sammy,
on the bus ride over here,

29
00:01:13,183 --> 00:01:14,651
we all sat in the back.

30
00:01:14,685 --> 00:01:16,416
(laughter)

31
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,255
Lucille Ball was
back there with us,

32
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:22,257
and I saw her smoking a Cuban.

33
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,123
Then Desi zipped up his fly.

34
00:01:24,165 --> 00:01:26,826
(laughter)

35
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,465
(chuckles)
Whose wedding is this?

36
00:01:28,499 --> 00:01:29,833
It's hilarious.

37
00:01:29,867 --> 00:01:31,629
Peter, it's not a wedding,
it's an infomercial

38
00:01:31,663 --> 00:01:33,490
for<i> The Dean Martin</i>
<i>Celebrity Roasts.</i>

39
00:01:33,532 --> 00:01:35,332
Wait, you mean Comedy Central
didn't invent those?

40
00:01:35,366 --> 00:01:36,331
No.

41
00:01:36,365 --> 00:01:37,498
Well, what about funny news?

42
00:01:37,532 --> 00:01:38,496
Did they invent that?

43
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:39,494
N-Not really.

44
00:01:39,528 --> 00:01:40,661
But they invented comedy.

45
00:01:40,695 --> 00:01:41,827
They didn't
invent anything.

46
00:01:41,861 --> 00:01:44,159
Well, they centralized it,
that we know.

47
00:01:44,193 --> 00:01:45,494
Man, look at these people.

48
00:01:45,528 --> 00:01:46,661
They don't breathe.

49
00:01:46,695 --> 00:01:48,330
They just drink
and smoke and laugh.

50
00:01:48,364 --> 00:01:49,392
I want to do that.

51
00:01:49,426 --> 00:01:50,466
What are you
talking about?

52
00:01:50,498 --> 00:01:51,663
You want to
have a roast?

53
00:01:51,697 --> 00:01:53,328
Yeah! Look, he's the man
of the hour.

54
00:01:53,362 --> 00:01:54,327
Everybody loves him.

55
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:55,830
They got his picture
in a circle.

56
00:01:55,864 --> 00:01:56,997
How do they do that?

57
00:01:57,031 --> 00:01:59,130
Pictures come in squares.

58
00:02:03,173 --> 00:02:04,803
Hey, Cleveland,
how tall are you?

59
00:02:04,837 --> 00:02:05,802
I don't know.

60
00:02:05,836 --> 00:02:07,800
Cadillac come up
to about here on me.

61
00:02:07,842 --> 00:02:09,805
All right, so I guess I am
the tallest one of us.

62
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:11,602
What are you talking
about? I'm six-two.

63
00:02:11,636 --> 00:02:13,631
Says so right here on
my driver's license.

64
00:02:13,665 --> 00:02:14,825
Yeah, that-that
doesn't count.

65
00:02:14,832 --> 00:02:15,832
Why not?

66
00:02:15,838 --> 00:02:17,129
You're gonna
make me say it?

67
00:02:17,163 --> 00:02:18,463
Lay me out
on the floor.

68
00:02:18,497 --> 00:02:19,798
I'm six-two.

69
00:02:19,832 --> 00:02:20,798
Hey, you guys.

70
00:02:20,832 --> 00:02:22,270
Peter, how tall am I?

71
00:02:22,304 --> 00:02:24,135
I don't know,
how tall is a mailbox?

72
00:02:24,169 --> 00:02:25,471
You're about
a mailbox.

73
00:02:25,505 --> 00:02:27,807
But listen, I-I want
you guys to roast me.

74
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:29,808
What, you mean
like they do on TV?

75
00:02:29,842 --> 00:02:31,975
That's right, I want to be
the man of the hour.

76
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:34,477
And I want all my pals
to give me a good ribbing.

77
00:02:34,511 --> 00:02:36,812
Can we work blue,
like Marlin Johnson?

78
00:02:36,846 --> 00:02:39,313
♪ Oh-ee, oh-ee,
hey-yo, ha. ♪

79
00:02:39,347 --> 00:02:41,215
Oh, you know
it, homey!

80
00:02:42,248 --> 00:02:44,213
Huh, all right,
that could be fun.

81
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,547
Great. And you fellas
shouldn't pull any punches.

82
00:02:46,581 --> 00:02:47,714
Just let me have it.

83
00:02:47,748 --> 00:02:49,048
Nothing is off-limits.

84
00:02:49,082 --> 00:02:50,479
Geez, Peter,
you're more excited

85
00:02:50,513 --> 00:02:52,646
than Adrian Peterson
at an arboretum.

86
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,316
Daddy, what kind
of tree is that?

87
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:59,483
Man, I want to beat you
with so many things around here.

88
00:03:05,863 --> 00:03:08,496
JOE: Ladies and gentlemen
and people who have wandered in

89
00:03:08,538 --> 00:03:10,502
from the Chinese wedding
next door,

90
00:03:10,537 --> 00:03:12,836
welcome to the roast
of Peter Griffin,

91
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,801
with your roast master
Glenn Quagmire.

92
00:03:15,835 --> 00:03:17,463
(applause)

93
00:03:17,505 --> 00:03:19,145
Thank you, thank you,
thank you very much.

94
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,797
Joe, I'd tell you
to take your seat,

95
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:23,203
but I'd be
about 15 years too late.

96
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:24,834
(laughter)

97
00:03:26,434 --> 00:03:28,071
Ha! And we're off.

98
00:03:28,105 --> 00:03:31,074
Well, what can I say about the
man of the hour, Peter Griffin?

99
00:03:31,107 --> 00:03:32,578
Oh, boy, here
it comes.

100
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,912
Well, first off,
Peter's always been special.

101
00:03:34,946 --> 00:03:36,575
In high school,
he didn't play sports,

102
00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:37,848
but he did wear a helmet.

103
00:03:37,882 --> 00:03:40,714
(laughter)

104
00:03:40,756 --> 00:03:41,883
(chuckles)

105
00:03:41,925 --> 00:03:43,220
All right, that's kind of funny.

106
00:03:43,254 --> 00:03:44,556
Tough, but fair.

107
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,061
You know, Peter, I love
your chin, but I got to ask.

108
00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:48,397
What's it like
going through life

109
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:50,062
with a scrotum
so close to your mouth?

110
00:03:50,103 --> 00:03:51,103
You know what, hold on.

111
00:03:51,104 --> 00:03:52,335
I'll just ask
your teenage daughter.

112
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:55,576
(laughter)

113
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,176
That... that's inappropriate.

114
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,175
You know, Peter's
challenging the stereotype

115
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:02,446
of Irish guys being fat,
drunk and stupid

116
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,349
by throwing "a little gay"
in there, too.

117
00:04:05,383 --> 00:04:06,717
(laughter)

118
00:04:06,751 --> 00:04:08,717
Oh, nice, homophobia.

119
00:04:08,751 --> 00:04:11,386
But I got to say, the worst part
of being Peter's friend is

120
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,048
knowing that eventually
you're gonna have to be

121
00:04:13,082 --> 00:04:14,383
the fat-ass's pallbearer.

122
00:04:14,417 --> 00:04:16,283
Lift with the legs,
right fellas?

123
00:04:16,317 --> 00:04:19,744
(laughter)

124
00:04:20,785 --> 00:04:23,582
P-People think I'm fat?

125
00:04:23,616 --> 00:04:25,936
But seriously, everyone, let's
have a big round of applause

126
00:04:25,953 --> 00:04:28,588
for the real hero tonight:
Peter's chair.

127
00:04:28,622 --> 00:04:30,083
(chuckles) How you
holding up, buddy?

128
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,057
(laughter)

129
00:04:32,091 --> 00:04:34,719
Two chair jokes
in the same monologue.

130
00:04:34,753 --> 00:04:36,391
Sloppy.

131
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,590
Peter's got a small penis,

132
00:04:40,624 --> 00:04:43,627
but, hey, nothing
grows in the shade.

133
00:04:43,661 --> 00:04:45,121
This just in...

134
00:04:45,163 --> 00:04:47,727
is what Peter had to say to
his wife on their wedding night,

135
00:04:47,761 --> 00:04:49,128
so she knew it was
actually happening.

136
00:04:49,161 --> 00:04:51,127
Peter's so ugly,
he couldn't get raped

137
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:53,062
in our holding cell
down at the station.

138
00:04:53,096 --> 00:04:54,660
For those of you who don't know,

139
00:04:54,702 --> 00:04:57,132
we have a real serious problem
with people getting raped

140
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,436
in our holding cell
down at the station.

141
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,437
Hi, I'm Professor Comedy.

142
00:05:01,471 --> 00:05:03,469
QUAGMIRE:
No! (boos)

143
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,142
Peter, you're loud,
you can't hold down a job,

144
00:05:06,176 --> 00:05:08,142
and you got high blood pressure.

145
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:11,486
You could be a black guy if your
ding-a-ling wasn't so damn tiny.

146
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,621
LOIS: (laughs)
How does everyone know?!

147
00:05:14,655 --> 00:05:16,621
Peter moves his lips
while he's reading,

148
00:05:16,655 --> 00:05:19,290
'cause he's trying
to eat the book.

149
00:05:19,324 --> 00:05:21,057
Roasted!

150
00:05:21,091 --> 00:05:22,719
You know, as Lois's father,

151
00:05:22,753 --> 00:05:24,717
I hate the thought of her
having sex with Peter.

152
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,051
LOIS:
And so do I!

153
00:05:26,085 --> 00:05:28,050
Damn it, Lois, you stepped
on my punch line!

154
00:05:28,092 --> 00:05:29,322
Shut up! You're drunk!

155
00:05:29,356 --> 00:05:30,586
Stop serving her!

156
00:05:30,628 --> 00:05:32,923
I asked Peter
what he got on his S.A.T.s.

157
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:34,562
He said, "Mayonnaise."

158
00:05:34,596 --> 00:05:38,233
Peter's so fat and stupid,
Lamar Odom tried to bang him.

159
00:05:38,267 --> 00:05:40,267
(laughter)

160
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,572
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
now that we've had our fun,

161
00:05:46,606 --> 00:05:49,912
it's time to give our man of the
hour a chance to have his say.

162
00:05:49,954 --> 00:05:52,585
Please put your hands together
for Peter Griffin!

163
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,987
(applause)

164
00:05:55,028 --> 00:05:57,660
Okay, yeah,
I got something to say.

165
00:05:57,694 --> 00:05:58,996
Screw all you guys!

166
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,994
I hope you all eat turds
and die!

167
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,329
None of you bastards
are my friends no more!

168
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,129
(cries)

169
00:06:07,172 --> 00:06:09,308
Brian was the
worst one.

170
00:06:16,013 --> 00:06:18,514
Family, I have
an announcement to make.

171
00:06:18,548 --> 00:06:19,850
Peter, we're eating.

172
00:06:19,884 --> 00:06:22,185
Just tell us what color it was
and be done with it.

173
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:25,185
On account of my buddies
all being nasty sons of bitches,

174
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,185
I've decided I'm gonna
find new friends.

175
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:29,518
Oh, come on, you're
overreacting.

176
00:06:29,552 --> 00:06:31,190
The roast was
your idea.

177
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,190
You asked them to
make fun of you.

178
00:06:33,224 --> 00:06:34,860
Yeah, but I thought
they'd stick to material

179
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,197
about how I'm too handsome
to work at a brewery,

180
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:39,864
or-or how I have tiny
little baby sneezes.

181
00:06:39,898 --> 00:06:41,538
(imitates baby sneeze)

182
00:06:41,572 --> 00:06:43,677
I'm sure it was all
meant in good fun.

183
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,544
Yeah, it was supposed to be fun,
but it was humiliating.

184
00:06:46,586 --> 00:06:48,849
I felt like
a premature volcano.

185
00:06:48,883 --> 00:06:50,521
I just think you're a
really cool island,

186
00:06:50,555 --> 00:06:52,017
and I'd like to
get to know...

187
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:53,688
Oh, God!

188
00:06:53,722 --> 00:06:55,023
Oh, I'm so sorry.

189
00:06:55,057 --> 00:06:57,359
I am so sorry--
you're just so pretty.

190
00:06:57,394 --> 00:06:59,626
Please, don't tell
the other islands.

191
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:01,130
I've been thinking.

192
00:07:01,164 --> 00:07:03,804
Maybe I got to find friends who
can't make fun of my appearance

193
00:07:03,838 --> 00:07:06,139
'cause they're
weird-looking themselves.

194
00:07:06,173 --> 00:07:09,474
Like those two bearded dwarves
walking across the street there.

195
00:07:09,508 --> 00:07:13,147
Hey, will you bearded
dwarves be friends with me?

196
00:07:13,181 --> 00:07:15,484
We, sir, are
Italian children.

197
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,518
Good day.

198
00:07:20,455 --> 00:07:21,925
Thanks for hanging out
with me.

199
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:24,262
I never thought of my kids'
principal as being a friend.

200
00:07:24,296 --> 00:07:26,727
Well, "pal" is right
there in the name, Peter.

201
00:07:26,761 --> 00:07:27,967
(chuckles)
Yeah.

202
00:07:28,001 --> 00:07:29,864
Hey, it's cool you got
the keys to the school,

203
00:07:29,898 --> 00:07:31,905
and we can hang out
when no one else is here.

204
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:32,905
What should we do?

205
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:34,537
Oh, I got a few ideas.

206
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,377
Wow, I've never drank
so much milk in my life.

207
00:07:38,411 --> 00:07:39,713
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

208
00:07:39,747 --> 00:07:41,049
What other ideas you got?

209
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,050
How about this second
fridge of milk?

210
00:07:43,084 --> 00:07:45,050
Uh, how much milk
do you drink?

211
00:07:45,084 --> 00:07:47,584
I just drink milk until
somebody stops me.

212
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,987
I don't know.

213
00:07:53,021 --> 00:07:55,647
Maybe I'm just not meant
to find a new group of friends.

214
00:07:55,689 --> 00:07:57,718
Well, Peter, you're always
welcome to hang out with me.

215
00:07:57,752 --> 00:07:59,552
Yeah, but I'm talking
about the kind of friend

216
00:07:59,591 --> 00:08:02,053
that doesn't bark at horses
when I'm watching a movie.

217
00:08:02,087 --> 00:08:04,051
Fine, fine, you want to get
trampled in your living room?

218
00:08:04,093 --> 00:08:05,187
Be my guest.

219
00:08:05,221 --> 00:08:06,860
It's just... (sighs)

220
00:08:06,894 --> 00:08:09,525
I don't know, I-I don't seem
to fit in anywhere.

221
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:11,861
(sighs) All right, I'm gonna
go get some more coffee

222
00:08:11,902 --> 00:08:13,900
and maybe a gross
microwaved sandwich.

223
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:17,033
Excuse me.

224
00:08:17,068 --> 00:08:18,698
Can I please have
another no-foam latte?

225
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,139
Uh, yeah, sure.

226
00:08:20,173 --> 00:08:21,706
But, you know,
I don't work here.

227
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,873
Oh, I'm sorry.

228
00:08:22,907 --> 00:08:24,808
You look just like
one of the baristas.

229
00:08:24,842 --> 00:08:26,671
He doesn't look
that much like me.

230
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:28,206
WOMAN:
I think she meant me.

231
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,805
Oh. Oh, yeah.

232
00:08:29,846 --> 00:08:31,141
I could see that.

233
00:08:31,175 --> 00:08:32,478
Hey, we should make out.

234
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,847
You got it, mister.

235
00:08:36,451 --> 00:08:39,058
(chuckles)
Double-foam, am I right?

236
00:08:39,092 --> 00:08:40,058
(laughs)

237
00:08:40,092 --> 00:08:41,393
You're funny.

238
00:08:41,427 --> 00:08:43,394
Yeah. Oh, my God,
you're so twisted.

239
00:08:43,428 --> 00:08:45,730
I'm Jamie, and this is
Becca and Karen.

240
00:08:45,764 --> 00:08:46,994
You want to join us?

241
00:08:47,036 --> 00:08:48,363
Sure.
Great.

242
00:08:48,407 --> 00:08:50,437
We were just debating
if Jamie should hook up

243
00:08:50,471 --> 00:08:52,342
with this guy she met
a few nights ago.

244
00:08:52,376 --> 00:08:54,849
Okay, I want the deets,
like, yesterday.

245
00:08:54,883 --> 00:08:57,018
Wh-What the hell?
Did I just say that?

246
00:08:57,052 --> 00:08:58,018
You sure did.

247
00:08:58,052 --> 00:09:00,018
You're a natural
at this.

248
00:09:00,052 --> 00:09:01,353
Wh-What is "this"?

249
00:09:01,387 --> 00:09:03,690
It's what we do!

250
00:09:03,724 --> 00:09:05,624
(women whoop)

251
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:08,055
Wow, you know,
I know I just met you guys,

252
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,960
but I've kind of been looking
for a new group of friends.

253
00:09:10,994 --> 00:09:13,001
D-Do you maybe have room
for one more?

254
00:09:13,035 --> 00:09:15,000
Are you good at talking
about how busy you are?

255
00:09:15,034 --> 00:09:16,696
Because that's a lot
of what this is.

256
00:09:16,737 --> 00:09:19,031
Ugh, yeah, but don't talk
to me about anything

257
00:09:19,073 --> 00:09:20,367
until I've had
my morning coffee,

258
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,468
'cause it's like
I can't even deal.

259
00:09:22,502 --> 00:09:25,139
Well, I think I speak
for all of us when I say

260
00:09:25,173 --> 00:09:27,801
we'd love to have you in
our group of girlfriends.

261
00:09:27,843 --> 00:09:29,136
Oh, my God,
that's awesome!

262
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,472
Hey, can I be the one

263
00:09:30,506 --> 00:09:32,473
who laugh-screams
really loud at restaurants?

264
00:09:32,507 --> 00:09:34,743
As long as you're
picking up the check.

265
00:09:34,777 --> 00:09:36,174
(laugh-screams)

266
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,478
Oh, we're gonna ruin
so many people's evenings!

267
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:40,812
Oh, boy, I'm blending
right in with you gals.

268
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:44,651
Like a panda bear
on a bed full of pillows.

269
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:45,778
I'm hiding from the zoo.

270
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,249
They want me to have a baby.

271
00:09:47,283 --> 00:09:49,184
I don't want to have a baby!

272
00:09:53,257 --> 00:09:55,052
Hey, isn't it funny
that you guys came over

273
00:09:55,086 --> 00:09:56,880
for a dinner party,
and all we're doing is

274
00:09:56,922 --> 00:09:58,551
standing in the
kitchen, drinking wine?

275
00:09:58,585 --> 00:09:59,982
All our
toothbrushes were

276
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,822
in that one woman's
glass this morning.

277
00:10:01,856 --> 00:10:05,157
Girls, it is so nice to
be part of a group again.

278
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:06,823
And I'm having
the best time.

279
00:10:06,865 --> 00:10:09,430
Especially yesterday when
we all got mammograms.

280
00:10:11,463 --> 00:10:14,825
If I have cancer,
we're all going to Brazil.

281
00:10:14,867 --> 00:10:16,161
So what's for dinner?

282
00:10:16,195 --> 00:10:17,496
You said we were
having Italian?

283
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,168
Yeah, and then I
realized I'm not good

284
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:20,832
at making
fettuccine Alfredo,

285
00:10:20,866 --> 00:10:23,167
but I am good at
making reservations.

286
00:10:23,201 --> 00:10:24,201
(laughter)

287
00:10:24,202 --> 00:10:25,202
Do you get it?

288
00:10:25,204 --> 00:10:26,843
Oh, God, I'm so bad.

289
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:28,844
Stewie, it's time
for your bath.

290
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,845
Oh, what's
going on in here?

291
00:10:30,887 --> 00:10:31,853
Oh, hey, Lois.

292
00:10:31,887 --> 00:10:32,854
Hey, these are
my new friends:

293
00:10:32,888 --> 00:10:34,518
Jamie, Karen
and Becca.

294
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:36,086
Karen's the one
with the mommy blog,

295
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,850
so if you think you know her
from somewhere, that's where.

296
00:10:38,892 --> 00:10:40,688
Oh, nice to meet
you all.

297
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,420
Would you like to
join us for dinner?

298
00:10:42,454 --> 00:10:44,555
Oh, no, I don't want
to get in the way.

299
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:47,493
Besides, I got to get
this little man in the tub.

300
00:10:47,527 --> 00:10:50,061
Great. Now they're all
picturing my wiener.

301
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:52,796
Oh, thank God.

302
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,997
For a second, I thought
she was gonna come with us.

303
00:10:55,031 --> 00:10:56,069
What?

304
00:10:56,103 --> 00:10:57,933
Seriously, Peter,
how do you live with her?

305
00:10:57,967 --> 00:11:00,371
I know, that voice.
Ugh.

306
00:11:00,405 --> 00:11:02,106
And what is that hair color?

307
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,635
Creamy French Dressing?

308
00:11:03,677 --> 00:11:06,075
(women laughing)

309
00:11:06,109 --> 00:11:07,780
Oh, I love it.
I love it.

310
00:11:07,814 --> 00:11:08,780
(chuckles weakly)

311
00:11:08,814 --> 00:11:09,948
Yeah. Yeah.

312
00:11:09,982 --> 00:11:11,642
Hey, if you think that's funny,

313
00:11:11,684 --> 00:11:13,881
she once had a miscarriage
outside a Petco.

314
00:11:13,915 --> 00:11:16,079
I still have the security
camera footage somewhere.

315
00:11:16,113 --> 00:11:18,078
(women laughing)

316
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,150
Peter, I'm your conscience,
Jiminy Cricket.

317
00:11:21,184 --> 00:11:22,350
Ah! Bug!

318
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:27,589
Andrea, y-you set a place
for Jiminy again.

319
00:11:27,623 --> 00:11:30,324
Oh... so I did.

320
00:11:30,358 --> 00:11:31,692
Why?!

321
00:11:31,726 --> 00:11:34,930
Why did he have to go around
telling strangers what to do?

322
00:11:34,965 --> 00:11:38,299
Wasn't being a pediatric
oncologist enough for him?!

323
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,330
(sobbing)

324
00:11:42,338 --> 00:11:44,432
He hit on me
at your wedding.

325
00:11:50,804 --> 00:11:52,843
Ah, let's see, what else?
What else? What else?

326
00:11:52,877 --> 00:11:54,475
Oh, I-I got one.
I got one.

327
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:57,151
Lois tried to give CPR to
a kid at a wedding once,

328
00:11:57,186 --> 00:11:58,656
and when she knelt down,

329
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,057
she accidentally high-heeled
her own stink hole.

330
00:12:01,091 --> 00:12:03,489
(women laughing)

331
00:12:03,531 --> 00:12:05,193
Peter, your wife
is such a pig.

332
00:12:05,227 --> 00:12:06,666
Oh, I don't know
about that, Jamie.

333
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,034
Pigs eat slop,
Lois only cooks it.

334
00:12:09,068 --> 00:12:10,131
(laughter)

335
00:12:10,173 --> 00:12:11,635
What the hell?

336
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:13,539
Peter, can I speak
with you for a second?

337
00:12:13,573 --> 00:12:16,370
Oh, hang on, guys,
I got to talk to my dog.

338
00:12:16,404 --> 00:12:18,139
What the hell
are you doing?

339
00:12:18,181 --> 00:12:19,643
I'm just gabbing
with the girls.

340
00:12:19,677 --> 00:12:21,275
You know our cycles
have lined up?

341
00:12:21,317 --> 00:12:23,316
Mine's from wiping too hard.

342
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,317
You're saying horrible things
about Lois.

343
00:12:25,351 --> 00:12:27,022
Oh, yeah,
it cracks up the ladies.

344
00:12:27,056 --> 00:12:28,590
Yesterday, Karen laughed so hard

345
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:30,192
she popped a button
on her jeans.

346
00:12:30,226 --> 00:12:31,425
And then she cried.

347
00:12:31,499 --> 00:12:32,994
Peter, Lois
is your wife.

348
00:12:33,035 --> 00:12:34,298
You should be
defending her,

349
00:12:34,332 --> 00:12:37,204
not talking trash and
gossiping behind her back

350
00:12:37,238 --> 00:12:39,003
like some kind of
Midwestern teenager.

351
00:12:39,277 --> 00:12:41,497
Did you gals hear about Allie
Gallagher?

352
00:12:41,521 --> 00:12:43,783
She let Alan Ackerman
smack her in the back

353
00:12:43,813 --> 00:12:45,875
with his tallywhacker
behind the snack shack.

354
00:12:45,917 --> 00:12:48,011
What?
Nobody here in Maryland

355
00:12:48,045 --> 00:12:50,019
understands a single
word you're saying.

356
00:12:50,053 --> 00:12:51,587
You should move
back to Minnesota.

357
00:12:51,622 --> 00:12:52,820
I can't go back.

358
00:12:52,854 --> 00:12:54,452
I Snapchatted
Matt Gackerack

359
00:12:54,486 --> 00:12:56,524
a Kodak of my ass crack!

360
00:13:00,164 --> 00:13:01,690
Hey, Lois?

361
00:13:01,732 --> 00:13:04,065
I did something bad
I need to tell you about.

362
00:13:04,099 --> 00:13:05,361
Peter, I know.

363
00:13:05,395 --> 00:13:07,968
You used some of my magazines
for your fake ransom notes.

364
00:13:08,002 --> 00:13:09,031
It's okay.

365
00:13:09,065 --> 00:13:10,366
No, no, no, no,
that's not it.

366
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,320
But did you put the ice
cream where the guy said?

367
00:13:12,337 --> 00:13:13,968
Because he will
hurt your family.

368
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:17,073
Look, the thing is,
me and my new girlfriends,

369
00:13:17,107 --> 00:13:19,273
we've kind of been
talking trash about you

370
00:13:19,315 --> 00:13:20,714
and laughing
behind your back.

371
00:13:20,748 --> 00:13:22,377
Peter, of course
your new friends

372
00:13:22,411 --> 00:13:23,913
have been talking crap about me.

373
00:13:23,947 --> 00:13:25,385
That's what women do.

374
00:13:25,419 --> 00:13:26,385
What?

375
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:28,449
So... you're not mad?

376
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:31,288
Well, I'm not thrilled,
but I understand what it's like

377
00:13:31,322 --> 00:13:32,656
to be friends with women.

378
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:35,327
I'm sure they talk trash
about you behind your back.

379
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:37,127
They most
certainly do not!

380
00:13:37,161 --> 00:13:39,760
I guarantee you that
as soon as you leave the room,

381
00:13:39,802 --> 00:13:40,928
they tear you to shreds.

382
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,096
That's not true.

383
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,536
If it was, I would've
figured it out.

384
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,397
Just like I figured out who was
stealing my lunch at work.

385
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:48,332
(dramatic music playing)

386
00:13:48,405 --> 00:13:50,601
Next time there's a sandwich
in the fridge

387
00:13:50,635 --> 00:13:53,306
with somebody's name on it,
don't eat it, scumbag!

388
00:13:53,308 --> 00:13:54,641
Please, you don't understand!

389
00:13:54,675 --> 00:13:56,007
Oh, I understand.

390
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,775
That lunch didn't
have your name on it,

391
00:13:57,809 --> 00:13:59,311
but this bullet does.

392
00:14:01,514 --> 00:14:04,513
My name is Peter, too...!

393
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:12,888
Ugh, have you guys seen
the new Jessica Biel movie?

394
00:14:12,922 --> 00:14:14,592
I-I don't get
what men see in her.

395
00:14:14,626 --> 00:14:16,424
Um, her dumper?

396
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,191
I just think she's
really plain-looking.

397
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,761
She kind of annoys me.

398
00:14:20,803 --> 00:14:22,266
You know who's really beautiful?

399
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,403
Joan Allen.

400
00:14:23,437 --> 00:14:25,306
Yes!
Uh, stunning.

401
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,369
Yeah, uh... I-I think, um...

402
00:14:28,411 --> 00:14:30,377
Um, I'm maybe gonna
go use the restroom

403
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,105
and let you guys talk about

404
00:14:32,147 --> 00:14:33,777
whatever you're gonna
talk about.

405
00:14:37,654 --> 00:14:40,055
Huh, I guess Peter made
it to the bathroom,

406
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:41,896
'cause I can't feel
him walking anymore.

407
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:42,930
I know.

408
00:14:42,931 --> 00:14:45,435
"Fee-Fi-fo-fum!"
Right?

409
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,370
(women laughing)

410
00:14:49,035 --> 00:14:51,306
And what about
those drugstore glasses?

411
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,410
These aren't drugstore glasses,

412
00:14:53,445 --> 00:14:55,739
they came from
a doctor Halloween costume.

413
00:14:55,781 --> 00:14:57,107
(sighs)

414
00:14:57,149 --> 00:14:58,747
Lois was right.

415
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,912
They are making fun of me
behind my back.

416
00:15:00,946 --> 00:15:03,143
They're like a nasty wolf pack.

417
00:15:03,185 --> 00:15:05,149
Hey, man,
just a heads-up:

418
00:15:05,183 --> 00:15:07,011
instead of howling
at the moon tonight,

419
00:15:07,045 --> 00:15:09,744
we're all gonna yell
"cock-a-doodle-doo!"

420
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:10,778
Really?

421
00:15:10,783 --> 00:15:12,106
That seems weird.

422
00:15:12,148 --> 00:15:14,677
I'm just trying to make sure
you don't look silly.

423
00:15:18,873 --> 00:15:20,742
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

424
00:15:20,776 --> 00:15:22,973
(laughter)

425
00:15:23,007 --> 00:15:23,971
What an idiot!

426
00:15:24,005 --> 00:15:25,410
He actually believed me!

427
00:15:25,444 --> 00:15:28,070
That's what a rooster says, not
a wolf!

428
00:15:28,104 --> 00:15:30,175
(growling)

429
00:15:31,281 --> 00:15:33,512
Hi, Daddy!
How was howling at the moon?

430
00:15:33,546 --> 00:15:35,446
(slurring): Shut up!
Why aren't you asleep?

431
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,917
Why isn't he asleep?

432
00:15:36,951 --> 00:15:37,916
Leave him alone!

433
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,612
Have you been
drinking again, Phil?

434
00:15:39,654 --> 00:15:40,979
That's none of
your business!

435
00:15:41,021 --> 00:15:42,282
I never wanted a cub!

436
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,316
Get out!

437
00:15:43,355 --> 00:15:45,987
Get out now
and don't ever come back!

438
00:15:48,326 --> 00:15:51,394
Hey, buddy,
want to get high?

439
00:15:56,127 --> 00:15:57,828
Oh, my God. Phil?

440
00:15:57,862 --> 00:15:59,892
Hey... Robert.

441
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:00,932
Wow.

442
00:16:00,966 --> 00:16:04,162
Ah, hey,
listen, man...

443
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:06,033
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

444
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:08,127
(laughter)

445
00:16:12,935 --> 00:16:14,935
(sobbing)

446
00:16:16,705 --> 00:16:18,943
"Cock-a-doodle-doo"
is a passion project

447
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:20,709
I'd been mulling over for years,

448
00:16:20,743 --> 00:16:23,509
and when<i> Family Guy</i> gave me
the opportunity to shoot it,

449
00:16:23,543 --> 00:16:25,445
I knew there was only one actor

450
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:28,515
who could portray
Phil the Wolf: Glenn Quagmire.

451
00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:31,344
Peter gave me a beer that tasted
funny, and when I woke up,

452
00:16:31,386 --> 00:16:33,616
I was wearing lipstick
and a wolf suit.

453
00:16:37,553 --> 00:16:39,552
Lois, you were right.

454
00:16:39,594 --> 00:16:41,490
Those women
were talking about me.

455
00:16:41,531 --> 00:16:43,259
Oh, dear.
What did they say?

456
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:45,468
I don't even remember,
there was such a long cutaway,

457
00:16:45,502 --> 00:16:47,005
but I know it was really mean.

458
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,871
Oh, I'm so
sorry, Peter.

459
00:16:48,905 --> 00:16:50,271
So what do I do now?

460
00:16:50,305 --> 00:16:52,942
Confront them face-to-face
and explain why I'm angry?

461
00:16:52,976 --> 00:16:54,374
Of course not.

462
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:57,278
Being friends with women is
way more complex than that.

463
00:16:57,312 --> 00:16:59,678
You need to be more
underhanded and vicious.

464
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:03,252
You and I will get revenge
on those bitches lady-style.

465
00:17:03,286 --> 00:17:04,251
Really?

466
00:17:04,285 --> 00:17:05,683
We'll-we'll do it together?

467
00:17:05,717 --> 00:17:07,051
Yeah, it'll be fun.

468
00:17:07,084 --> 00:17:09,817
Like when we watched
<i>Battlestar Galactica</i> together.

469
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:12,024
Now, which Cylon is that?

470
00:17:12,058 --> 00:17:13,320
Ah, I-I don't know.

471
00:17:13,362 --> 00:17:14,455
I think it's Number Six.

472
00:17:14,489 --> 00:17:15,991
Wait, i-is that
the same Number Six

473
00:17:16,025 --> 00:17:17,791
that had sex with Dr. Baltar?

474
00:17:17,825 --> 00:17:19,327
I don't... I've been...
I've been watching this

475
00:17:19,361 --> 00:17:21,327
the same exact amount
of time you have, Lois.

476
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:22,631
I don't know
anything you don't.

477
00:17:22,665 --> 00:17:25,069
Ooh, what does that green button
on the far panel do?

478
00:17:25,103 --> 00:17:26,837
How in God's name
would I know that?!

479
00:17:26,872 --> 00:17:28,669
I don't know!

480
00:17:28,703 --> 00:17:32,170
It's green, so it probably
makes something go.

481
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:36,042
PETER:
Hello?

482
00:17:36,073 --> 00:17:37,101
Peter, where are you?

483
00:17:37,135 --> 00:17:38,655
I thought we were gonna
go after Becca.

484
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,970
Way ahead of you, Lois.
I just cut her brakes.

485
00:17:41,004 --> 00:17:42,242
What?!

486
00:17:42,276 --> 00:17:44,009
Don't you think
that's a little dangerous?

487
00:17:44,043 --> 00:17:46,440
Hey, you're the one who said we
should try to ruin her marriage.

488
00:17:46,474 --> 00:17:48,975
She bangs up her car,
her husband's gonna be furious.

489
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:49,976
(horns honking,
tires screeching)

490
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:50,975
What was that?

491
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:52,446
Oh, I-I just ran a red light.

492
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,080
My car won't slow down
for some reason.

493
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,882
Anyway, this is
gonna be awesome.

494
00:17:55,924 --> 00:17:57,857
Geez, I'm going, like, 95.

495
00:17:57,891 --> 00:18:00,190
Peter, are you sure
you didn't cut<i> your</i> brakes?

496
00:18:00,224 --> 00:18:02,054
That's ridiculous.
Why would I cut my own...

497
00:18:02,088 --> 00:18:03,886
Kids, get out of the way!
I can't stop!

498
00:18:03,928 --> 00:18:05,589
(kids screaming, horn honking)

499
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,524
All right, Peter,
next is Jamie.

500
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:11,729
Now, what's the most
important thing in her life?

501
00:18:11,763 --> 00:18:12,763
Oh, that's easy.

502
00:18:12,794 --> 00:18:14,624
Her daughter Emily
is a competitive diver.

503
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:15,929
The whole family's dream

504
00:18:15,963 --> 00:18:18,369
is that she gets a spot
on the U.S. Olympic Team.

505
00:18:18,403 --> 00:18:21,670
Okay, so get a lead pipe and
bust this girl's kneecaps.

506
00:18:21,704 --> 00:18:22,870
No, no, no, Lois.

507
00:18:22,904 --> 00:18:24,670
That's not how
we're gonna do this.

525
00:19:28,384 --> 00:19:31,349
(elegant piano music playing)

526
00:19:31,382 --> 00:19:32,388
(laughs)

527
00:19:34,023 --> 00:19:35,725
Okay, next is Karen.

528
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,096
Now, she's been planning her
daughter's wedding for a year.

529
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,729
If it doesn't go perfectly,
she'll be crushed.

530
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:41,864
Already on it, Lois.

531
00:19:41,898 --> 00:19:43,567
I bribed one of
the busboys.

532
00:19:43,601 --> 00:19:45,966
He has a little surprise
planned for her.

533
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,069
(man screams)

534
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,206
GUEST: Oh, my God!
Somebody stabbed the groom!

535
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,374
(guests screaming)

536
00:19:51,408 --> 00:19:54,239
(sobbing)

537
00:19:54,281 --> 00:19:56,941
Oh, no,
it's not a perfect day.

538
00:19:56,975 --> 00:19:58,541
(sobbing)

539
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:01,286
Well, we got those
bitches good, huh, Peter?

540
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,814
Yeah, thanks, Lois.

541
00:20:02,856 --> 00:20:04,023
And you were right.

542
00:20:04,057 --> 00:20:06,055
Being friends with women
is way too complicated

543
00:20:06,089 --> 00:20:07,520
and way too
intense for me.

544
00:20:07,562 --> 00:20:10,624
Now let me just pay the busboy
and we can get out of here.

545
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,694
Ah! I knew he didn't
understand the plan!

546
00:20:19,338 --> 00:20:21,207
Hey, guys.
Oh, hey, Peter.

547
00:20:21,242 --> 00:20:25,238
Look, I-I'm real sorry
I got so worked up at my roast.

548
00:20:25,273 --> 00:20:27,007
And if you're willing,

549
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,248
I'd like to be friends
with you guys again.

550
00:20:29,282 --> 00:20:31,479
Because men might
punch you in the gut

551
00:20:31,513 --> 00:20:32,845
and call you a fat idiot,

552
00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:35,244
but at least they do it
to your face and own it.

553
00:20:35,286 --> 00:20:36,778
You were mad at us?

554
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,345
Yeah, we ain't spoke
in a week.

555
00:20:38,387 --> 00:20:39,879
I thought you were out of town.

556
00:20:39,913 --> 00:20:42,779
People come, people go.
I didn't give no mind.

557
00:20:42,813 --> 00:20:45,283
So we're-we're
friends again?

558
00:20:45,317 --> 00:20:46,818
We were never not friends,
you idiot.

559
00:20:46,852 --> 00:20:48,482
I love you guys.

560
00:20:48,516 --> 00:20:49,817
Guys are the best.

561
00:20:49,851 --> 00:20:51,250
Not women.

562
