11
00:00:38,043 --> 00:00:40,143
Send in Stewie, please.

12
00:00:40,178 --> 00:00:41,544
Oh, I can go in now?

13
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,347
Oh, fantastic. <i>He's</i> ready. Marvelous.

14
00:00:44,382 --> 00:00:45,415
Thank you, Barbara.

15
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,750
I hope you get those Adele tickets.

16
00:00:46,751 --> 00:00:48,117
You deserve them.

17
00:00:48,153 --> 00:00:49,452
She won't get them. No way.

18
00:00:49,487 --> 00:00:51,187
She needed to get them,
like, a month ago.

19
00:00:51,222 --> 00:00:53,056
So, um, is that me over there?

20
00:00:53,091 --> 00:00:55,825
- If you like.
- Here we go.

21
00:01:00,098 --> 00:01:02,332
I saw the kid who has cancer leave.

22
00:01:02,367 --> 00:01:03,866
That must've been fun.

23
00:01:03,902 --> 00:01:06,536
I don't know why his parents are
still bringing him to school.

24
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:08,204
It's uncomfortable for everyone.

25
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,207
I've never seen him
when he's not just thrown up.

26
00:01:12,744 --> 00:01:14,510
Charming. This is charming.

27
00:01:14,546 --> 00:01:17,513
It reminds me of the therapist's
office Bethenny Frankel goes to

28
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:20,216
on<i> The Real Housewives of New York City.</i>

29
00:01:20,251 --> 00:01:21,584
I hate her.

30
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:23,486
She looks like a wooden doll you'd find

31
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:25,822
in an Eastern European toy shop.

32
00:01:25,857 --> 00:01:28,157
Oh, don't act
like you don't know who she is.

33
00:01:28,193 --> 00:01:29,759
Please, that doesn't impress me.

34
00:01:29,794 --> 00:01:30,893
We live in the world.

35
00:01:30,929 --> 00:01:32,762
We all know who Bethenny Frankel is,

36
00:01:32,797 --> 00:01:34,630
whether we like it or not.

37
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:37,300
You know, I actually don't mind her.

38
00:01:37,335 --> 00:01:39,302
And she's built quite a business
for herself.

39
00:01:39,337 --> 00:01:41,170
You have to hand it to her.

40
00:01:41,206 --> 00:01:44,574
I don't mean to name-drop,
but I kind of know Andy Cohen.

41
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:46,042
I guess I'm his type.

42
00:01:46,077 --> 00:01:47,577
Which, of course, is very flattering.

43
00:01:47,612 --> 00:01:49,312
He's outrageously successful.

44
00:01:49,347 --> 00:01:52,348
He originally wanted me
for<i> The Rachel Zoe Project,</i>

45
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,317
but I said no, so they went with Brad.

46
00:01:54,352 --> 00:01:57,053
And now look... that could've
been me on<i> Fashion Police</i>

47
00:01:57,088 --> 00:01:59,255
with Melissa Rivers 14 times a year.

48
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,991
Ah, well, hindsight.

49
00:02:02,026 --> 00:02:04,127
I see the tissue box is empty.

50
00:02:04,162 --> 00:02:06,396
Somebody was going through those like...

51
00:02:06,431 --> 00:02:08,531
well, tissues.

52
00:02:08,566 --> 00:02:11,267
Mm, I hope he didn't get cancer
all over this seat.

53
00:02:11,302 --> 00:02:12,902
Ugh. Yuck.

54
00:02:12,937 --> 00:02:14,170
Bad luck.

55
00:02:14,205 --> 00:02:16,506
Although I did hear
Ryan Reynolds visited him.

56
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,075
Something to do with<i> Deadpool,</i> I guess.

57
00:02:18,076 --> 00:02:19,709
So it's not all horrible.

58
00:02:19,744 --> 00:02:22,044
If they don't give us a day off
when he dies,

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,946
I'm gonna be so pissed.

60
00:02:23,982 --> 00:02:27,116
Oh, look, you got
your Dunkin' Donuts coffee.

61
00:02:27,152 --> 00:02:29,619
I don't know why those cups
always depress me.

62
00:02:29,654 --> 00:02:31,454
It's-it's like you've already given up

63
00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:33,089
before the day's even started.

64
00:02:33,124 --> 00:02:35,558
You might as well tattoo
"Can't afford Starbucks"

65
00:02:35,593 --> 00:02:37,059
on your forehead.

66
00:02:37,095 --> 00:02:38,461
What do I care, though?

67
00:02:38,496 --> 00:02:40,730
None of my business.

68
00:02:42,534 --> 00:02:44,468
I haven't heard of any
of the schools you went to,

69
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:45,701
but I'm sure they were great.

70
00:02:45,737 --> 00:02:47,236
I mean, you're here, right?

71
00:02:47,272 --> 00:02:49,405
And why are<i> you</i> here, Stewie?

72
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:50,773
Uh, that was lame.

73
00:02:50,809 --> 00:02:53,376
You seem to have
a lot of strong opinions.

74
00:02:53,411 --> 00:02:56,179
I do. Mostly because
I come across a lot of dicks.

75
00:02:56,214 --> 00:02:58,314
Or I guess I should say "wankers."

76
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:00,049
We do like that word, hmm?

77
00:03:00,084 --> 00:03:01,918
Or "tosser," "git," "prat,"

78
00:03:01,953 --> 00:03:03,586
"sod," "chuffer."

79
00:03:03,621 --> 00:03:05,988
Take your pick, eh, Dr. Pritchfield?

80
00:03:06,024 --> 00:03:07,723
- "We"?
- Yes, "we."

81
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,225
I'm not following.

82
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,060
- The accent.
- The accent?

83
00:03:11,095 --> 00:03:12,862
You speak with a British accent.

84
00:03:12,897 --> 00:03:14,397
Yes, I'm aware.

85
00:03:14,432 --> 00:03:16,999
Well, I've often been told
that I have a British accent.

86
00:03:17,035 --> 00:03:18,367
Oh?

87
00:03:18,403 --> 00:03:21,041
That's-that's all you're going to say?
"Oh"?

88
00:03:21,042 --> 00:03:23,273
What is it you'd like me to say, Stewie?

89
00:03:23,308 --> 00:03:25,274
That I have a British accent.

90
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,710
I apologize, but I can't hear it.

91
00:03:27,745 --> 00:03:29,346
You mean to tell me
you don't hear me speaking

92
00:03:29,347 --> 00:03:31,881
- with a British accent right now?
- No.

93
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:34,550
That's odd, because everybody else does.

94
00:03:34,586 --> 00:03:37,353
Have you spent much time
in Britain, then?

95
00:03:37,388 --> 00:03:38,855
No, I haven't.

96
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,523
- Excuse me?
- I said no!

97
00:03:40,558 --> 00:03:43,426
But you're the absolute only
person who hasn't noticed it.

98
00:03:43,461 --> 00:03:45,728
Really? Everyone hears this?

99
00:03:45,763 --> 00:03:47,530
Well, just the people
who can understand me,

100
00:03:47,565 --> 00:03:49,065
which you appear to be one of.

101
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,800
But that's too complicated to go into.

102
00:03:50,835 --> 00:03:52,134
I'm not even sure I get it.

103
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,670
The point is,
Stewie has a British accent.

104
00:03:54,706 --> 00:03:55,938
That's, like, a known thing.

105
00:03:55,974 --> 00:03:57,206
Ask anyone.

106
00:03:57,242 --> 00:03:59,108
I'm afraid I don't hear it.

107
00:03:59,143 --> 00:04:00,710
Yeah, you've said.

108
00:04:00,745 --> 00:04:02,612
It sounds like it's very important

109
00:04:02,647 --> 00:04:04,680
what other people think of you.

110
00:04:04,716 --> 00:04:06,382
Oh, is-is that what it sounds like?

111
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:08,518
To me, it does, yes.

112
00:04:08,553 --> 00:04:09,819
To you it does. I see, I see.

113
00:04:09,854 --> 00:04:12,555
So after five minutes, you think
you know me, is that it?

114
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,357
A little, perhaps.

115
00:04:14,392 --> 00:04:16,292
I am trained, Stewie, to observe things

116
00:04:16,327 --> 00:04:17,627
that give me an insight.

117
00:04:17,662 --> 00:04:20,596
And, yes, I do feel I know you a bit.

118
00:04:20,632 --> 00:04:22,732
You do feel you know me a bit.
Mm-hmm. Okay.

119
00:04:22,767 --> 00:04:25,001
All right, all right.
Well, that's-that's fair.

120
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,470
Might I?

121
00:04:27,505 --> 00:04:30,373
I'm not sure how this is going to help.

122
00:04:30,441 --> 00:04:31,574
Indulge me.

123
00:04:33,111 --> 00:04:35,244
Thank you.

124
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,481
I see you're on vacation
in Rio de Janeiro in this photo

125
00:04:38,516 --> 00:04:39,949
with your partner, I'm guessing.

126
00:04:39,984 --> 00:04:41,384
Or is he your husband?

127
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:43,786
Yes, probably wanted
to make it official, didn't you?

128
00:04:43,821 --> 00:04:45,455
Never thought you'd see it
in your lifetime.

129
00:04:45,456 --> 00:04:47,123
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

130
00:04:47,158 --> 00:04:48,891
At a quick glance,
I'd say there's roughly

131
00:04:48,927 --> 00:04:51,594
a 26-year age difference
between the two of you.

132
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:53,663
Not quite large enough to raise eyebrows

133
00:04:53,698 --> 00:04:55,932
while still giving you
a younger mind to shape.

134
00:04:55,967 --> 00:04:57,934
"Oh, you mean you haven't seen
<i>All About Eve,</i>

135
00:04:57,969 --> 00:05:00,403
<i>Gypsy, Valley of the Dolls?"</i> Et cetera.

136
00:05:00,438 --> 00:05:03,806
And a younger body
to make you feel more virile.

137
00:05:03,841 --> 00:05:05,808
Taking into consideration the math,

138
00:05:05,843 --> 00:05:07,743
he was probably born at a time

139
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:10,012
when the most popular name was...

140
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:12,181
Michael.

141
00:05:12,216 --> 00:05:14,817
From the dog-eared pages
of that volume of Shakespeare,

142
00:05:14,852 --> 00:05:19,155
I imagine you wooed Michael with
a sonnet or monologue each day.

143
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,691
And no one had ever done
anything so romantic

144
00:05:21,726 --> 00:05:23,960
as reciting Shakespeare
for Michael before.

145
00:05:23,995 --> 00:05:25,628
And he was smitten.

146
00:05:25,663 --> 00:05:27,363
While not as physically attracted to you

147
00:05:27,398 --> 00:05:29,131
as you are to him, that's okay...

148
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:31,801
You each bring something
important to the relationship.

149
00:05:31,836 --> 00:05:34,136
Isn't that what you believe,
Dr. Pritchfield?

150
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:36,572
I see a prescription

151
00:05:36,608 --> 00:05:38,441
for heart medication on that table.

152
00:05:38,476 --> 00:05:40,176
My guess is you keep that at the office.

153
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:42,311
You don't want to worry Michael,
you say to yourself,

154
00:05:42,347 --> 00:05:44,981
even though the truth is
it embarrasses you.

155
00:05:45,016 --> 00:05:46,649
Your age, your mortality.

156
00:05:46,684 --> 00:05:48,517
Best to keep appearing
as vital as possible.

157
00:05:48,553 --> 00:05:50,252
And no need to have reminders at home

158
00:05:50,288 --> 00:05:53,022
of what's just around
the corner, is there?

159
00:05:53,057 --> 00:05:54,557
And your office is your haven,

160
00:05:54,592 --> 00:05:56,859
since Michael doesn't work
and is often at home,

161
00:05:56,894 --> 00:05:58,928
perhaps as a result
of a low-level depression

162
00:05:58,963 --> 00:06:00,863
that you don't really want
to get into with him.

163
00:06:00,898 --> 00:06:02,865
Oh, he always planned to have a career,

164
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,934
but he could never settle
on exactly what it was

165
00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:06,302
he wanted to do.

166
00:06:06,337 --> 00:06:07,904
And at first
you liked having him at home

167
00:06:07,905 --> 00:06:10,139
to take care of the house
and plan trips.

168
00:06:10,174 --> 00:06:11,841
So that's just what happened.

169
00:06:11,876 --> 00:06:15,177
"And that's a job, too,"
he reminds you over the years.

170
00:06:15,213 --> 00:06:17,813
Michael likes to travel,
and he prefers the finer things.

171
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:19,769
And you'd like to give them
to him, wouldn't you?

172
00:06:19,784 --> 00:06:22,585
But it's a bit difficult
on a child psychologist's salary

173
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,987
at a Rhode Island preschool,
I'd imagine.

174
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,490
Fortunately, you don't have children,

175
00:06:26,491 --> 00:06:28,858
so you do have some disposable income.

176
00:06:28,893 --> 00:06:31,060
Oh, you<i> have</i> talked about it
with other couples,

177
00:06:31,095 --> 00:06:33,062
just for show, probably at dinner

178
00:06:33,097 --> 00:06:34,497
with younger friends of Michael's

179
00:06:34,532 --> 00:06:35,731
who are starting a family,

180
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:37,533
you know,
to be part of the conversation,

181
00:06:37,568 --> 00:06:38,734
to feel included.

182
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,137
But you said you preferred your trips

183
00:06:40,138 --> 00:06:42,138
and your rescue dog
named after a character

184
00:06:42,173 --> 00:06:43,906
most likely from Dickens.

185
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:45,875
Ah, how accomplished and affluent

186
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,343
you both look in this photo.

187
00:06:47,378 --> 00:06:50,146
Just the image Michael
is so desperate to project.

188
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:52,415
Let's look a little closer, shall we?

189
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,017
Now, I see you're both wearing
Ralph Lauren Purple Label

190
00:06:55,053 --> 00:06:58,421
dress shirts
that retail starting at $495.

191
00:06:58,456 --> 00:07:00,389
But from the disfigured
button holes on one

192
00:07:00,425 --> 00:07:02,158
and the small discoloration
on the other,

193
00:07:02,193 --> 00:07:04,560
I can see you bought them
at the outlet in Providence.

194
00:07:04,595 --> 00:07:05,961
Probably third markdown,

195
00:07:05,997 --> 00:07:08,164
in which case, $49, give or take.

196
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,166
Since you also have light jackets on,

197
00:07:10,201 --> 00:07:12,368
I can see that you went there
during summer vacation,

198
00:07:12,403 --> 00:07:14,503
which is, in fact, winter in Rio,

199
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:16,706
outside of the high tourist season.

200
00:07:16,741 --> 00:07:18,708
And I see that you're
on the rooftop pool deck

201
00:07:18,743 --> 00:07:20,710
at the Fasano Hotel in Ipanema,

202
00:07:20,745 --> 00:07:23,646
the most exclusive hotel
in all of Brazil.

203
00:07:23,681 --> 00:07:25,648
Michael would've been dying
to stay there.

204
00:07:25,683 --> 00:07:27,750
Had a friend that went
with<i> his</i> older boyfriend,

205
00:07:27,785 --> 00:07:29,885
who makes a lot of money
in, most likely, banking,

206
00:07:29,921 --> 00:07:31,220
much to your chagrin.

207
00:07:31,255 --> 00:07:34,223
But even in August,
it's almost $1,000 a night.

208
00:07:34,258 --> 00:07:36,892
You tell him people are starving
in the streets in Brazil.

209
00:07:36,928 --> 00:07:39,095
How do you justify paying those prices?

210
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,430
When the truth is,
you simply can't afford it.

211
00:07:41,466 --> 00:07:43,365
It's for another class of gay people.

212
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:44,567
The window that Michael

213
00:07:44,602 --> 00:07:46,502
is always desperately peering through

214
00:07:46,537 --> 00:07:48,104
and sadly on the other side of.

215
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:49,572
But you do your best.

216
00:07:49,607 --> 00:07:52,041
You don't go on Airbnb,
because you don't trust it,

217
00:07:52,076 --> 00:07:53,677
even though Michael has stories
of friends

218
00:07:53,678 --> 00:07:55,711
who have found the most fabulous places.

219
00:07:55,747 --> 00:07:57,012
You like a hotel.

220
00:07:57,048 --> 00:07:59,048
Besides, it's more romantic,
you tell him.

221
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,417
But when you take him to the
place you're actually staying,

222
00:08:01,452 --> 00:08:04,487
the one you found on TripAdvisor
that was rated number 27

223
00:08:04,522 --> 00:08:05,988
of all the hotels in Rio

224
00:08:06,023 --> 00:08:09,425
and was having a special rate
of 295 U.S. dollars a night...

225
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,393
Which is still not cheap,
you remind him,

226
00:08:11,429 --> 00:08:14,029
most people never get to visit
half the places he's seen,

227
00:08:14,065 --> 00:08:16,899
you tell him... you can't help
but feel like a bit of a failure

228
00:08:16,934 --> 00:08:18,901
as you see the look
of disappointment on his face

229
00:08:18,936 --> 00:08:20,603
as he enters the room.

230
00:08:20,638 --> 00:08:22,271
So you decide to go to the Fasano Hotel

231
00:08:22,306 --> 00:08:24,273
for dinner and drinks. No, just drinks,

232
00:08:24,308 --> 00:08:26,742
once you've seen
the restaurant prices online.

233
00:08:26,778 --> 00:08:28,944
And once there, you can see
how Michael begins looking

234
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,913
at all the older men who<i> can</i> afford

235
00:08:30,948 --> 00:08:33,215
to take their boyfriends...
I'm sorry, husbands...

236
00:08:33,251 --> 00:08:35,451
To such luxurious hotels.

237
00:08:35,486 --> 00:08:37,220
And you worry a little,
that you're diminishing

238
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:39,188
in his eyes with each passing year.

239
00:08:39,223 --> 00:08:41,123
But you tell yourself
you're being ridiculous,

240
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,859
as you see Michael
glancing about the rooftop deck,

241
00:08:43,895 --> 00:08:45,528
looking at all the young men,

242
00:08:45,563 --> 00:08:48,097
men that would be 20 years
younger than even Michael,

243
00:08:48,132 --> 00:08:49,732
men that you're invisible to.

244
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,867
But he isn't yet, not completely,

245
00:08:51,903 --> 00:08:55,037
and you're jealous
and you loathe yourself for it.

246
00:08:55,072 --> 00:08:56,405
But Michael wants a photo,

247
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,840
and he says, "Let's take a selfie."

248
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,309
But you say, "Let's ask someone
to take one of us"

249
00:09:00,344 --> 00:09:03,312
and make some tired joke about
selfies that only you laugh at,

250
00:09:03,347 --> 00:09:05,447
wishing that you could take it
out of the air

251
00:09:05,483 --> 00:09:08,117
as soon as you've said it,
as it's just one more indicator

252
00:09:08,152 --> 00:09:10,820
that you're older than everybody here.

253
00:09:10,855 --> 00:09:13,856
So Michael calls over a young
man wearing a tiny swimsuit

254
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:17,026
to take the photo and makes a
crude joke that embarrasses you.

255
00:09:17,061 --> 00:09:18,594
But the young man laughs,

256
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:20,910
and he and Michael share a
moment that you're not part of.

257
00:09:20,932 --> 00:09:22,898
And you feel humiliated and unseen.

258
00:09:22,934 --> 00:09:24,967
Which explains Michael's joyful grin

259
00:09:25,002 --> 00:09:27,303
and your slightly disconnected
half-smile.

260
00:09:27,338 --> 00:09:29,305
And you've posted the photo on Facebook,

261
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,308
and Michael's posted it to
his 86 followers on Instagram...

262
00:09:32,343 --> 00:09:33,943
You don't know how that one works...

263
00:09:33,978 --> 00:09:35,744
To at least give the impression,

264
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,246
in your Ralph Lauren shirts,

265
00:09:37,281 --> 00:09:39,114
holding your $20 cocktails,

266
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,750
that you're both way more
successful than you are.

267
00:09:41,786 --> 00:09:43,285
But it makes you feel a little dirty,

268
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:46,288
the lengths you have to go to
in order to keep Michael happy.

269
00:09:46,324 --> 00:09:48,557
And every time you glance
at this picture,

270
00:09:48,593 --> 00:09:52,027
you wonder,
"How long before he leaves me?"

271
00:09:52,063 --> 00:09:55,364
See? I guess we both know
each other a bit.

272
00:09:57,468 --> 00:10:00,436
You seem like a very lonely little boy.

273
00:10:00,471 --> 00:10:02,838
Oh, my God, I am!

274
00:10:02,874 --> 00:10:04,673
I'm so lonely!

275
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:08,110
Oh!

276
00:10:08,145 --> 00:10:11,513
You can see inside my soul!

277
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,050
Oh, God!

278
00:10:20,558 --> 00:10:21,690
Thank you.

279
00:10:21,726 --> 00:10:24,159
Thank you, Barbara.

280
00:10:28,232 --> 00:10:30,532
Are you all right now, Stewie?

281
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:31,934
Yes, I think.

282
00:10:31,969 --> 00:10:33,469
You're very kind.

283
00:10:33,504 --> 00:10:35,404
She's a gem, that one, you know.

284
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:36,739
I hope you appreciate her.

285
00:10:36,774 --> 00:10:38,908
Try taking some deep breaths.

286
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:46,849
I do this sometimes in yoga.

287
00:10:48,152 --> 00:10:49,251
I take yoga.

288
00:10:50,821 --> 00:10:52,021
I have a sick body.

289
00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:58,027
I do... I do feel a bit better.

290
00:10:58,062 --> 00:11:00,029
But still lonely.

291
00:11:00,064 --> 00:11:01,997
I'm sorry. It keeps spilling out.

292
00:11:02,033 --> 00:11:04,633
Oh, God. Oh, God.

293
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:07,770
It seems like you're keeping
a lot bottled up inside.

294
00:11:07,805 --> 00:11:10,739
I am. Nobody here likes me,
Dr. Pritchfield.

295
00:11:10,775 --> 00:11:12,875
I try to fit in with the other boys

296
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,077
and talk about things
like dirt and shapes,

297
00:11:15,112 --> 00:11:16,545
but they won't play with me.

298
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,213
And I-I don't have any friends,

299
00:11:18,249 --> 00:11:20,516
and I have nobody to eat lunch with.

300
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:22,752
It's very interesting you'd say
that you have no friends,

301
00:11:22,753 --> 00:11:25,921
Stewie, especially considering
the reason you're here.

302
00:11:25,957 --> 00:11:27,423
Oh. That.

303
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,091
Shall we talk about it?

304
00:11:29,126 --> 00:11:30,826
I don't know
what there is to talk about.

305
00:11:30,861 --> 00:11:33,295
You pushed a classmate down the stairs.

306
00:11:33,331 --> 00:11:35,998
It was an accident.
Haven't you ever seen<i> Showgirls?</i>

307
00:11:36,033 --> 00:11:38,400
Yes, of course I have.
But according to Tyler,

308
00:11:38,436 --> 00:11:39,969
it was no accident.

309
00:11:40,004 --> 00:11:42,271
Well, I guess it's my word
against his, then.

310
00:11:42,306 --> 00:11:44,273
It is creating
a bit of a con-trah-versy.

311
00:11:44,308 --> 00:11:46,075
- Excuse me?
- A con-trah-versy.

312
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,344
- I don't know what that is.
- Con-trah-versy?

313
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:49,912
"Con-trah-versy"?

314
00:11:49,947 --> 00:11:52,014
Oh! Oh, "con-troversy."

315
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:54,750
Apologies.
Those of us with British accents

316
00:11:54,785 --> 00:11:56,285
pronounce it "con-trah-versy."

317
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,820
But how would you know that?

318
00:11:57,855 --> 00:11:59,021
Yeah, how would I know that?

319
00:11:59,056 --> 00:12:00,289
Look, Dr. Pritchfield...

320
00:12:00,324 --> 00:12:01,824
"Cee-cil," if I may?

321
00:12:01,859 --> 00:12:03,492
It's pronounced "Cess-il."

322
00:12:03,527 --> 00:12:05,294
- Damn it!
- But, again, how would you know?

323
00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:08,030
- It's not as if you're...
- Okay, okay, we got it.

324
00:12:08,065 --> 00:12:10,299
I only pushed Tyler down
the stairs because I like him

325
00:12:10,334 --> 00:12:11,867
and I'm afraid he won't like me back.

326
00:12:11,902 --> 00:12:14,336
And-and not like him-like him.
I'm not gay.

327
00:12:14,372 --> 00:12:16,939
This whole thing isn't because
I'm gay, so-so calm down.

328
00:12:16,974 --> 00:12:19,008
I can already see you
lickin' your chops.

329
00:12:19,043 --> 00:12:22,077
I'm sure you live
for the coming out sessions.

330
00:12:22,113 --> 00:12:24,680
If anything,
I'm less gay than I used to be.

331
00:12:24,715 --> 00:12:27,016
Not that anybody
at this school would care.

332
00:12:27,051 --> 00:12:29,551
But do I think that
Grant Gustin and I would make

333
00:12:29,587 --> 00:12:31,220
the most adorable Instagram couple?

334
00:12:31,255 --> 00:12:33,188
Yes. Yes, we would.

335
00:12:33,224 --> 00:12:36,225
Grant Gustin plays the Flash on
the CW, if you were wondering.

336
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,327
Because, you know, most people over 70

337
00:12:38,362 --> 00:12:40,562
probably don't know who he is.

338
00:12:40,598 --> 00:12:43,132
Think young Anthony Perkins.

339
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:44,867
Ah. Oh.

340
00:12:44,902 --> 00:12:46,402
There we go.

341
00:12:46,437 --> 00:12:48,003
Anyway, "fluid" is something I hear

342
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:49,571
being tossed around a lot now.

343
00:12:49,607 --> 00:12:51,974
But I'm confident in my heterosexuality.

344
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:54,243
- That's a word, right?
- Yes, of course.

345
00:12:54,278 --> 00:12:57,046
Okay, just sounded strange for a second.

346
00:12:57,081 --> 00:13:00,616
It must be difficult for you,
Stewie, being so intelligent.

347
00:13:00,651 --> 00:13:02,084
It is.

348
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:04,286
Whew! Just that...

349
00:13:04,321 --> 00:13:06,288
just that acknowledgment.

350
00:13:06,323 --> 00:13:09,191
You know, sometimes
I don't know where I fit in.

351
00:13:09,226 --> 00:13:12,861
I just... I just want
to be like everybody else,

352
00:13:12,897 --> 00:13:16,031
but nobody's interested in the
things that<i> I'm</i> interested in.

353
00:13:16,067 --> 00:13:17,433
They think I'm weird.

354
00:13:17,468 --> 00:13:19,201
And I'm so anxious all the time,

355
00:13:19,236 --> 00:13:22,337
but I... I always put on
a brave face and try to hide it,

356
00:13:22,373 --> 00:13:24,706
and I... I give myself
these excruciating migraines.

357
00:13:24,775 --> 00:13:27,242
I actually have way more hair than this,

358
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:29,478
but I pull it out.

359
00:13:29,513 --> 00:13:31,747
I'm sorry, now I'm getting
all worked up again.

360
00:13:31,782 --> 00:13:33,816
I'm worse than Bethenny Frankel
on her period.

361
00:13:33,851 --> 00:13:35,684
I don't why I keep bringing her up.

362
00:13:35,719 --> 00:13:37,986
I j... it's just I think
about her a lot.

363
00:13:38,055 --> 00:13:40,789
Well, what<i> are</i> the things
you're interested in, Stewie?

364
00:13:40,825 --> 00:13:43,559
Me? Well, I like to talk
about world domination.

365
00:13:43,594 --> 00:13:46,328
Some people don't think
I talk about it enough anymore,

366
00:13:46,363 --> 00:13:49,164
but mind your own beeswax
is what I say to them.

367
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,300
I also like to talk about musicals.

368
00:13:51,335 --> 00:13:53,602
It's hard to find someone
who can converse

369
00:13:53,637 --> 00:13:55,671
on one of those topics, let alone both.

370
00:13:55,706 --> 00:13:57,973
And I really, really,
really want to see<i> Hamilton,</i>

371
00:13:58,008 --> 00:14:00,509
but by the time
it gets here, I'll be 30.

372
00:14:00,544 --> 00:14:03,412
I think I'm still the only one
in town who's even

373
00:14:03,447 --> 00:14:06,048
heard of it, and it's been out
for over two years.

374
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,417
Which just makes me even more depressed.

375
00:14:08,452 --> 00:14:10,719
How do you live in a place like that?

376
00:14:10,754 --> 00:14:12,588
Quahog. What a pile of garbage.

377
00:14:12,623 --> 00:14:14,456
And I've even memorized
some of the songs,

378
00:14:14,492 --> 00:14:17,392
but I have no one to sing
it for, and I'm really good.

379
00:14:17,428 --> 00:14:19,661
- Do you want to hear it?
- Oh. Um...

380
00:14:19,697 --> 00:14:21,263
Y-You mean now?

381
00:14:21,298 --> 00:14:24,299
I really... I really need you
to hear me sing<i> Hamilton.</i>

382
00:14:24,335 --> 00:14:27,236
I'm so good. Why<i> can't</i> I be on Broadway?

383
00:14:27,271 --> 00:14:28,837
I<i> want</i> to be on Broadway.

384
00:14:28,873 --> 00:14:32,374
I want the world to fall in love
with me eight times a week.

385
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:34,276
I'd love to hear you sing.

386
00:14:34,311 --> 00:14:36,345
Okay, okay, now I'm nervous.

387
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,548
If it's not good this time, just
remember it was good at home.

388
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,416
Don't look at me while I start.

389
00:14:41,452 --> 00:14:42,651
It's hard.

390
00:14:42,686 --> 00:14:44,720
It's a lot of words very fast.

391
00:14:44,755 --> 00:14:47,556
Like Gilbert and Sullivan,
but for Hispanics.

Well done!

428
00:16:22,753 --> 00:16:25,420
You're a very special
little boy, Stewie.

429
00:16:25,456 --> 00:16:27,456
I saw you check your watch.

430
00:16:27,491 --> 00:16:29,558
That was a bit emotional
for you, wasn't it?

431
00:16:29,593 --> 00:16:33,028
But it felt good. Like-like,
I got so much out, you know?

432
00:16:33,063 --> 00:16:36,732
- Would you like a cup of tea?
- I would<i> love</i> a cup of tea.

433
00:16:40,337 --> 00:16:42,404
It's hot<i> already?</i>

434
00:16:42,439 --> 00:16:44,539
Yes, it's an electric kettle.

435
00:16:44,575 --> 00:16:46,375
We don't have that at our house.

436
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:49,478
My mother boils water
in an old Jiffy Pop tin.

437
00:16:49,513 --> 00:16:51,513
She's just a useless old slut.

438
00:16:51,548 --> 00:16:53,548
Hey, my hiccups are gone!

439
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:56,618
If you liked Tyler and you
wanted to be friends with him,

440
00:16:56,654 --> 00:16:59,187
then why did you
push him down the stairs?

441
00:16:59,223 --> 00:17:02,457
Oh. I... I don't know.

442
00:17:02,493 --> 00:17:05,394
Can I tell you a story
about another little boy?

443
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:07,229
Um, okay.

444
00:17:07,264 --> 00:17:09,498
When I was your age, I grew up in London

445
00:17:09,533 --> 00:17:12,567
- when the Blitz had just ended.
- Good God, how old<i> are</i> you?

446
00:17:12,603 --> 00:17:15,304
Our neighborhood was reduced to rubble.

447
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:22,177
<i>And in the chaos, I searched
desperately for my parents.</i>

448
00:17:23,414 --> 00:17:25,347
Mum. Mum.

449
00:17:25,382 --> 00:17:27,182
Mother. Mother.

450
00:17:27,217 --> 00:17:29,184
Mum. Mummy.

451
00:17:29,219 --> 00:17:32,054
Mummy. Mummy. Mummy.

452
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:34,523
Mummy. Mum. Mother.

453
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:36,358
<i>- Don't.</i>
<i>- Don't what?</i>

454
00:17:36,393 --> 00:17:37,893
<i>You know what.</i>

455
00:17:37,928 --> 00:17:39,995
<i>But Mother was nowhere to be found.</i>

456
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:43,031
<i>And neither was Father.</i>

457
00:17:43,067 --> 00:17:46,468
<i>You see, I was
the sole survivor of my family.</i>

458
00:17:46,503 --> 00:17:48,904
<i>So I was sent to live
with an aunt in Cornwall.</i>

459
00:17:48,939 --> 00:17:52,708
<i>But she had too many mouths
of her own to feed, so...</i>

460
00:17:52,743 --> 00:17:56,044
<i>I was next sent to a distant
cousin in Northumberland.</i>

461
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,813
<i>But she didn't care for children,</i>

462
00:17:57,848 --> 00:17:59,448
<i>and off again I went,</i>

463
00:17:59,483 --> 00:18:01,817
<i>this time to an orphanage
in Gloucestershire.</i>

464
00:18:01,852 --> 00:18:03,251
<i>But they didn't like little boys</i>

465
00:18:03,287 --> 00:18:04,586
<i>from London in Gloucestershire.</i>

466
00:18:04,621 --> 00:18:06,722
<i>Or from Cornwall or Northumberland.</i>

467
00:18:06,757 --> 00:18:09,891
<i>So I pretended I was from
Shropshire, of all places.</i>

468
00:18:09,927 --> 00:18:13,061
<i>And eventually,
I became friends with six boys:</i>

469
00:18:13,097 --> 00:18:16,064
<i>Sebastian, Declan, Flibbit, Pipadoodle,</i>

470
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,900
<i>Scudger and Nonsenseword.</i>

471
00:18:18,936 --> 00:18:20,402
<i>And together, we traveled...</i>

472
00:18:20,437 --> 00:18:22,405
<i>Okay, before you say
another name of anything,</i>

473
00:18:22,406 --> 00:18:23,839
<i>I'm going to have to stop you.</i>

474
00:18:23,874 --> 00:18:25,941
- Yes?
- I'm only here for 40 minutes,

475
00:18:25,976 --> 00:18:28,076
and this is already a really long story

476
00:18:28,112 --> 00:18:29,878
with a lot of locations.

477
00:18:29,913 --> 00:18:33,115
And I don't feel like waiting to
see how it links up to my thing.

478
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,750
The point of the story is,

479
00:18:34,785 --> 00:18:36,752
I know what it's like to feel alone

480
00:18:36,787 --> 00:18:39,254
and to have to pretend that
you're something you're not.

481
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:43,925
Oh, and also, how my first kiss
was with a Nazi.

482
00:18:43,994 --> 00:18:46,595
See? We didn't need
to go back 1,000 years for that.

483
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,363
And I don't pretend
I'm something I'm not.

484
00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:50,298
- I never said that.
- You just said it.

485
00:18:50,334 --> 00:18:52,067
I might have implied it.

486
00:18:52,102 --> 00:18:56,071
I suppose the question is why
you feel the need to do that.

487
00:18:56,106 --> 00:18:58,373
I... I don't know.

488
00:18:58,409 --> 00:19:01,543
I-I guess I hadn't realized it before.

489
00:19:01,578 --> 00:19:05,046
Maybe I'm worried
nobody's going to like me.

490
00:19:05,082 --> 00:19:07,582
Lois left a tissue in the dryer again.

491
00:19:07,618 --> 00:19:10,719
And these are my only pants.
How sad is that?

492
00:19:10,754 --> 00:19:14,022
When I was in the orphanage,
my Sunday shoes were potatoes.

493
00:19:14,057 --> 00:19:15,724
Well, you win that one.

494
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:17,492
Look, I'm different, Dr. Pritchfield.

495
00:19:17,528 --> 00:19:19,161
I'm not like the other kids.

496
00:19:19,196 --> 00:19:21,430
I realized that
when you picked up that photo

497
00:19:21,465 --> 00:19:23,432
and decimated my entire life.

498
00:19:23,467 --> 00:19:25,667
Sorry. It's kind of
a parlor trick of mine.

499
00:19:25,702 --> 00:19:27,602
Have you ever thought
of just being yourself...

500
00:19:27,638 --> 00:19:30,639
Your real self...
And then see what happens?

501
00:19:30,674 --> 00:19:33,141
I... I don't think I know how.

502
00:19:33,177 --> 00:19:36,645
Everything about me is this
carefully-constructed persona

503
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,547
designed to keep people at arm's length.

504
00:19:38,582 --> 00:19:40,749
This isn't even how I really talk.

505
00:19:40,784 --> 00:19:43,552
This is. This is how I talk.

506
00:19:43,587 --> 00:19:45,720
The accent is-is nothing more
than an affectation,

507
00:19:45,756 --> 00:19:48,156
a-a coat of armor
to get me through the day,

508
00:19:48,192 --> 00:19:50,759
just an image I cultivated
so I could feel special.

509
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:55,230
Wow. What a relief.

510
00:19:55,265 --> 00:19:57,532
For once, to talk with my real voice

511
00:19:57,568 --> 00:19:59,100
without the... the burden

512
00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:01,002
of trying to sound like someone I'm not.

513
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:03,638
- What do you mean by that?
- Well, this is my real voice.

514
00:20:03,674 --> 00:20:05,273
I don't hear a difference.

515
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:07,590
How about now? You freakin' hear that?

516
00:20:07,611 --> 00:20:09,479
What about now?
Sound different? Giggity?

517
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,712
What about now?

518
00:20:10,747 --> 00:20:12,427
Coming up now, this voice.

519
00:20:12,449 --> 00:20:13,615
Ahoy. It's me.

520
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,650
And I'm a gay alien.

521
00:20:15,686 --> 00:20:18,620
I'm sorry. That just all sounds
like the same person.

522
00:20:24,061 --> 00:20:27,262
Well, Stewie, that was quite
a breakthrough we just had.

523
00:20:27,297 --> 00:20:28,930
How do you feel?

524
00:20:28,966 --> 00:20:32,200
I feel... relieved,

525
00:20:32,236 --> 00:20:33,902
like a weight has been lifted.

526
00:20:33,937 --> 00:20:35,737
I-I can finally be myself.

527
00:20:35,772 --> 00:20:37,772
I like this Stewie.

528
00:20:37,808 --> 00:20:39,875
I hope he stays for a while.

529
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:43,345
I-I've never been vulnerable
to anyone before.

530
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,981
You're the only one
who's ever met the real me.

531
00:20:46,016 --> 00:20:47,349
Well, I'm honored, and now,

532
00:20:47,384 --> 00:20:49,584
the rest of the world is going
to meet him.

533
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,119
Yes. Yes, that's right.

534
00:20:51,154 --> 00:20:52,954
There's no going back now!

535
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,156
I'm gonna talk to Tyler.
I'm gonna make friends.

536
00:20:55,192 --> 00:20:56,725
I'm gonna be a normal boy!

537
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,460
Yes, you are.

538
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,795
You're finally going
to be just like everybody else.

539
00:21:00,831 --> 00:21:04,299
Wha-what? Say-say that again.

540
00:21:04,334 --> 00:21:07,335
You're finally going
to be just like everybody else.

541
00:21:07,371 --> 00:21:09,971
But... But I don't...

542
00:21:10,007 --> 00:21:13,575
I don't <i>want</i> to be like everybody else.

543
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,809
What do you mean?

544
00:21:14,845 --> 00:21:16,678
I-I don't<i> want</i> to be like them.

545
00:21:16,747 --> 00:21:19,915
Like any other zero in this
miserable town, like my family.

546
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,951
I won't do it! I don't want
to be like any other person!

547
00:21:22,986 --> 00:21:24,152
Like you skiing in...

548
00:21:24,187 --> 00:21:25,754
Please don't pick up that photo.

549
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:27,722
I want to remain
what I've always been...

550
00:21:27,758 --> 00:21:29,991
Superior, brilliant, special.

551
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:31,826
Oh, God, what was I thinking?!

552
00:21:31,862 --> 00:21:34,296
I'm never going to lift the veil, ever.

553
00:21:34,331 --> 00:21:36,932
Nobody will ever know the real me.

554
00:21:36,967 --> 00:21:38,366
My accent's back, by the way.

555
00:21:38,402 --> 00:21:39,868
It was a very dramatic moment.

556
00:21:39,903 --> 00:21:41,903
If you say so.

557
00:21:41,939 --> 00:21:46,939
Now, let's talk about...

558
00:21:50,914 --> 00:21:54,182
Stewie, can you hand me
my heart medication, please?

559
00:21:54,217 --> 00:21:56,251
Of course!

560
00:21:56,286 --> 00:21:58,787
Except...

561
00:21:58,822 --> 00:22:01,356
there's one person
that<i> does</i> know the real me,

562
00:22:01,391 --> 00:22:03,458
and that's you.

563
00:22:03,493 --> 00:22:04,759
I don't understand.

564
00:22:04,795 --> 00:22:07,162
Why aren't you getting my medication?

565
00:22:07,197 --> 00:22:09,064
Mm, yeah.

566
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:11,666
Listen, you're not gonna like this.

567
00:22:11,702 --> 00:22:13,702
Please, there's not much time.

568
00:22:13,737 --> 00:22:16,404
I'd like to, really I would,
and you were super helpful,

569
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,407
and this... this kind of seems
like a crummy way to repay you,

570
00:22:19,443 --> 00:22:21,209
but... I'm not going to get it.

571
00:22:21,244 --> 00:22:23,378
Is this because I made you wait?

572
00:22:23,413 --> 00:22:25,780
It's because I can't have anyone
know the real me.

573
00:22:25,816 --> 00:22:27,482
And so, you must die.

574
00:22:27,517 --> 00:22:30,051
I guess that's what happens
in therapy, though.

575
00:22:30,087 --> 00:22:32,220
No, it's not!

576
00:22:32,255 --> 00:22:34,222
Ah, you're right.
That didn't make much sense.

577
00:22:34,257 --> 00:22:35,757
Not to sound ghoulish,

578
00:22:35,792 --> 00:22:38,393
but any indication how much
longer you're going to linger?

579
00:22:38,428 --> 00:22:39,694
I'm not sure.

580
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,430
I think it's different for everyone.

581
00:22:41,431 --> 00:22:43,099
Yeah, because you're still
pretty chatty, is...

582
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,232
is why I'm wondering.

583
00:22:44,267 --> 00:22:45,767
Don't do this, Stewie!

584
00:22:45,802 --> 00:22:47,402
It will stay with you forever.

585
00:22:47,437 --> 00:22:50,405
Mm, yeah, not worried.
For me, this is kind of no bigs.

586
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,741
Barbara! Barbara!

587
00:22:52,776 --> 00:22:54,442
Oh, didn't you hear her go to lunch?

588
00:22:54,478 --> 00:22:56,778
It was like an orchestra
of squeaky chair springs

589
00:22:56,813 --> 00:22:59,180
and groaning floorboards
playing her out.

590
00:22:59,216 --> 00:23:02,117
So... this is how you leave me.

591
00:23:02,152 --> 00:23:03,852
Sowwy.

592
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:09,824
"Eyes, look your last!

593
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,228
"Arms, take your last embrace.

594
00:23:13,263 --> 00:23:15,330
"And lips, O, you,

595
00:23:15,365 --> 00:23:18,700
"the doors of breath,
seal with a righteous kiss,

596
00:23:18,735 --> 00:23:23,735
a dateless bargain to engrossing death!"

597
00:23:27,544 --> 00:23:29,244
<i>Macbeth?</i>

598
00:23:29,312 --> 00:23:31,112
<i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

599
00:23:31,148 --> 00:23:33,715
But I wouldn't expect you to know,

600
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,951
since you're not in any way...

601
00:23:38,388 --> 00:23:39,754
British.

602
00:23:45,462 --> 00:23:47,629
I feel less bad.

603
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,901
You've reached the office
of Dr. Cecil Pritchfield.

604
00:23:52,936 --> 00:23:54,836
Please leave a mess-age.

605
00:23:54,871 --> 00:23:56,671
That one can't be right.

606
00:23:56,707 --> 00:23:59,541
It's Michael. I want a divorce.

607
00:23:59,576 --> 00:24:01,743
This is<i> not</i> your day.

608
00:24:11,688 --> 00:24:13,555
Hey, you okay?

609
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,257
Yes, Rupert just had
a nightmare, that's all.

610
00:24:16,293 --> 00:24:18,960
Go sleep on the floor
where you belong, whore!

611
00:24:18,995 --> 00:24:21,229
- All right, well...
- Hey... hey, Bri?

612
00:24:21,264 --> 00:24:22,931
Yeah?

613
00:24:22,966 --> 00:24:26,101
Would you mind maybe
sleeping with me tonight?

614
00:24:26,136 --> 00:24:28,136
- Sure.
- Thanks.

615
00:24:30,207 --> 00:24:32,674
Good night, Stewie.

616
00:24:32,709 --> 00:24:34,676
'Night, Brian.

617
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:38,012
- Brian?
- Yeah?

618
00:24:38,048 --> 00:24:40,648
I did something awful.

619
00:24:40,684 --> 00:24:42,984
Do you want to talk about it?

620
00:24:43,053 --> 00:24:45,019
No.
