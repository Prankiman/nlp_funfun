Ow!

3
00:00:38,376 --> 00:00:40,277
There's a rock right there!

4
00:00:40,343 --> 00:00:42,267
There's a huge rock right there,

5
00:00:42,268 --> 00:00:43,335
and it's covered up by grass

6
00:00:43,403 --> 00:00:44,987
and there's no way
you can see it.

7
00:00:45,055 --> 00:00:46,455
And I got lucky.

8
00:00:46,523 --> 00:00:48,173
But someone else could
hurt themselves,

9
00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:51,427
and, and a small cut is a, is a
death sentence in these times,

10
00:00:51,494 --> 00:00:53,429
so let's just, you know,
let's...

11
00:00:53,496 --> 00:00:56,031
let's get these rocks out
of here.

Thanks, everybody.
See you next week.

29
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:49,952
Yay! He's a good singer.

30
00:01:50,019 --> 00:01:51,553
Yeah, I've been catching
his library shows

31
00:01:51,621 --> 00:01:53,689
since there were only, like,
three or four kids here.

32
00:01:53,757 --> 00:01:55,140
You should have
been here, man.

somebody made a friend.

00:01:58,595 --> 00:02:00,462
I know.
Aren't they cute together?

Adorable. I'm Lois.

37
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,166
Hi, I'm Hope.

38
00:02:04,234 --> 00:02:06,969
Any relation
to Bob Hope? (laughs)

39
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,170
I'm kidding!

40
00:02:08,221 --> 00:02:09,421
I'm kind of known
for having

41
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:10,823
a twisted sense
of humor.

44
00:02:14,077 --> 00:02:15,644
Oh, so, you know.

45
00:02:15,712 --> 00:02:17,345
This is my husband Ben.

46
00:02:17,397 --> 00:02:18,597
Hi, glad to know you.

47
00:02:18,665 --> 00:02:20,432
Gosh, you know,
our little Scotty seems

48
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,885
to be having such a good time
with your son.

49
00:02:22,952 --> 00:02:24,203
Would you be interested

50
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,921
in getting them together
for a playdate?

51
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:28,590
Oh, that sounds
like a wonderful idea.

52
00:02:28,658 --> 00:02:30,092
Look at them.
They're getting along

53
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,127
like Billy Bob Thornton
and his cat.

54
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:33,996
WOMAN:
Billy Bob?

55
00:02:34,063 --> 00:02:35,764
Leave me alone!
I'm taking a bath!

56
00:02:39,619 --> 00:02:41,153
Stewie, do you want
to be the Autobots

57
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:42,654
or the Decepticons?

58
00:02:42,722 --> 00:02:44,356
What's with all
these labels, man?

59
00:02:44,424 --> 00:02:46,725
Autobots, Decepticons,
gay, straight--

60
00:02:46,793 --> 00:02:48,760
just pick a few robots,
and let's party.

61
00:02:48,845 --> 00:02:50,412
Hey, what's
going on in here?

62
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,164
Oh, hello, Brian.
We're playing Transformers.

63
00:02:52,232 --> 00:02:53,932
Oh, cool.
Who's this little guy?

64
00:02:54,017 --> 00:02:55,951
It's my new friend, Scotty.

65
00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:57,352
Do you mind? We're busy.
Oh.

66
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,987
Hi, doggie.
You want to play with us?

67
00:02:59,055 --> 00:03:00,255
Scotty, Scotty, it's fine.
It's fine.

68
00:03:00,323 --> 00:03:01,457
You don't have to.

69
00:03:01,524 --> 00:03:02,524
He doesn't know
Transformers.

70
00:03:02,592 --> 00:03:03,792
Yeah, actually,
I-I'd love to play.

71
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,960
Wh-Who should I be?

72
00:03:05,028 --> 00:03:06,612
Should I be one
of these guys?

73
00:03:06,696 --> 00:03:08,664
I-I'll be this guy.
Who's this guy, huh?

74
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:09,798
What's this guy's story?

75
00:03:09,866 --> 00:03:11,150
That's Optimus Prime.

76
00:03:11,217 --> 00:03:12,751
You can't be him.
Scotty's Optimus Prime.

77
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:15,320
Oh, all right. Well, I'll be,
I'll be this guy.

78
00:03:15,388 --> 00:03:16,755
How about this guy?
(growls)

79
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:19,057
What was that?
Did you just growl?

80
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,493
What robot growls?
That's Starscream.

81
00:03:21,561 --> 00:03:23,028
He's a Decepticon.
I'm the Decepticons.

82
00:03:23,096 --> 00:03:24,663
Look, why don't you
just beat it?

83
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:26,265
All right,
all right, relax.

84
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:28,400
I'll-I'll just, I'll be
this guy over here.

85
00:03:28,468 --> 00:03:30,469
That's He-Man.
We're playing Transformers.

86
00:03:30,537 --> 00:03:32,905
Well, maybe this is the one
where He-Man visits.

87
00:03:32,972 --> 00:03:35,324
Brian, how is He-Man
supposed to get to Cybertron?

88
00:03:35,391 --> 00:03:36,658
Hey, "Up, up,
and away," right?

89
00:03:36,726 --> 00:03:37,926
He-Man doesn't fly.

90
00:03:37,994 --> 00:03:39,928
Look, why are you being
such a dick about this?

91
00:03:39,996 --> 00:03:41,363
I'm just trying
to join in.

92
00:03:41,431 --> 00:03:43,265
Yeah, you don't know what
you're talking about, okay?

93
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,449
You sound like...
That's not fair.

94
00:03:44,517 --> 00:03:45,834
I think I'm doing
pretty well.

95
00:03:45,902 --> 00:03:47,352
No, you don't know
the characters, Brian.

96
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,520
You don't know
the characters.

97
00:03:48,588 --> 00:03:49,922
If you could hear
yourself right now,

98
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:51,089
you would not stop
throwing up.

99
00:03:51,157 --> 00:03:52,357
You can't just put He-Man

100
00:03:52,425 --> 00:03:53,525
in Transformers'
world, all right?

101
00:03:53,593 --> 00:03:55,794
He wouldn't be able
to get to Cybertron

102
00:03:55,862 --> 00:03:58,664
because he lives in Eternia,
and Eternia is in

103
00:03:58,731 --> 00:03:59,932
an entirely
different dimension.

104
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:01,867
He can just take
his rocket ship.

105
00:04:01,935 --> 00:04:04,836
Get... get out of here.

112
00:04:29,345 --> 00:04:30,712
Picking up steam
here, Scotty.

113
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,897
You'd better look out.

114
00:04:31,965 --> 00:04:33,465
I don't feel so well.

115
00:04:35,368 --> 00:04:38,670
Uh, kind of bad timing,
but gin.

116
00:04:38,738 --> 00:04:42,157
Hey, Lois, that
not-Stewie kid fell over!

117
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,076
Oh, my God,
he's unconscious!

118
00:04:44,143 --> 00:04:45,310
Peter, what happened?!

119
00:04:45,378 --> 00:04:47,212
Eh, you know me, Lois,
I don't pry.

120
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,914
Peter, he's not moving!

121
00:04:48,982 --> 00:04:50,616
We gotta get him
to the hospital!

122
00:04:50,683 --> 00:04:52,618
You got it, Lois!
To the Peter-rang!

123

(crashing)

126
00:05:03,096 --> 00:05:04,296
Just for the record,

127
00:05:04,364 --> 00:05:06,231
I was at the hospital
for a brief moment.

128
00:05:09,502 --> 00:05:11,003
Mrs. Griffin,
it's a good thing

129
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,337
you brought this child in.

130
00:05:12,405 --> 00:05:13,705
Why? Is he okay?

131
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:15,007
I'm afraid
he's very sick.

132
00:05:15,074 --> 00:05:17,442
In fact, his lab-work
shows he is suffering

133
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,044
from Hodgkin's lymphoma.

134
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:21,146
Oh, my God!

135
00:05:21,214 --> 00:05:22,814
Are you saying
Scotty has cancer?!

136
00:05:22,882 --> 00:05:24,850
I don't know, I didn't
read the whole Wikipedia entry,

137
00:05:24,917 --> 00:05:27,653
but the good news is that what
he has is highly treatable

138
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,854
with radiation first,

139
00:05:28,921 --> 00:05:30,555
and if necessary,
chemotherapy.

140
00:05:33,393 --> 00:05:35,093
(coughs,
clears throat)

141
00:05:35,161 --> 00:05:36,428
Oh, for God's sake.

142
00:05:36,496 --> 00:05:37,996
Look, do you have
any idea

143
00:05:38,064 --> 00:05:39,398
how expensive
medical school is?

144
00:05:39,465 --> 00:05:40,699
No, I don't.

145
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:42,701
Well, it's probably
pretty expensive.

146
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:44,987
Lois! We came as soon
as we got your call.

147
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:46,622
Oh, Hope, Ben,

148
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:49,224
I'm so sorry to have
to tell you this,

149
00:05:49,292 --> 00:05:50,926
but Scotty has...

150
00:05:50,994 --> 00:05:52,294
Cancer. We know.

151
00:05:52,362 --> 00:05:53,328
You do?

152
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:54,796
Yes, we're aware
of his condition.

153
00:05:54,864 --> 00:05:56,932
But you shouldn't have
brought him to the hospital

154
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,533
without talking to us first.

155
00:05:58,601 --> 00:06:00,736
Why wouldn't we bring him?
He was unconscious.

156
00:06:00,803 --> 00:06:02,504
He clearly
needed treatment.

157
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:04,906
Oh, no, he doesn't
receive treatment.

158
00:06:04,974 --> 00:06:05,841
What?!

159
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:08,010
We're Christian Scientists.

160
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:09,745
We don't accept medical care
for ourselves,

161
00:06:09,812 --> 00:06:11,513
and we don't permit it
for our children.

162
00:06:11,581 --> 00:06:12,814
But your son
has cancer!

163
00:06:12,882 --> 00:06:14,266
Wait a minute.
Christian Science.

164
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:15,801
Is that, is that
that thing

165
00:06:15,868 --> 00:06:17,269
all them gaybo
Hollywood actors do

166
00:06:17,337 --> 00:06:19,821
to keep their stuff away
from other guys' butts?

167
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:21,957
Don't you understand?
Scotty needs help.

168
00:06:22,025 --> 00:06:23,759
And he'll get it...
through faith.

169
00:06:23,826 --> 00:06:24,926
That's right.

170
00:06:24,994 --> 00:06:27,262
We will heal him
with the power of prayer.

171
00:06:28,865 --> 00:06:31,316
Y-You can't just let them
just walk out of here!

172
00:06:31,401 --> 00:06:32,851
Oh, I think
they'll be back.

173
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:34,853
Are those their keys?
No, they're my keys.

174
00:06:39,435 --> 00:06:41,036
And they said because
of their faith,

175
00:06:41,053 --> 00:06:42,553
they don't believe
in medicine.

176
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:45,056
Mom, I think there's a lot
of religions that do that.

177
00:06:45,124 --> 00:06:47,892
Well, that may be, Meg, but that
poor little baby has cancer,

178
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,161
and they're just gonna take him
home and pray over him?!

179
00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:51,529
Well, that's what they do.

180
00:06:51,597 --> 00:06:53,231
They believe that disease
is just an illusion.

181
00:06:53,299 --> 00:06:56,067
And the only way to fight it
is to make your faith stronger.

182
00:06:56,135 --> 00:06:58,636
Illusions?! You want to
talk about illusions?!

183
00:06:58,704 --> 00:07:00,838
If you die tomorrow,

184
00:07:00,906 --> 00:07:03,024
you think we're gonna be devastated!
But you know what?!

185
00:07:03,092 --> 00:07:05,259
We're just gonna go out
and buy another dog!

186
00:07:05,327 --> 00:07:07,195
And maybe <i>this</i> dog
will fetch a stick

187
00:07:07,262 --> 00:07:09,330
and bring me my slippers
instead of prattling on

188
00:07:09,398 --> 00:07:11,366
about the pros and cons
of various religions!

189
00:07:11,433 --> 00:07:13,434
Chris, I think you've had
too much sugar cereal.

190
00:07:13,502 --> 00:07:15,603
I think I haven't had enough!

191
00:07:17,072 --> 00:07:19,207
Peter, I have to go talk
to the Jennings

192
00:07:19,274 --> 00:07:22,160
and ask them to reconsider
getting treatment for Scotty.

193
00:07:22,227 --> 00:07:23,461
I'm going with
you, Lois.

194
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:24,729
Yeah, I'll go, too.

195
00:07:24,797 --> 00:07:26,664
All right, but try
to keep your mouth shut, okay?

196
00:07:26,732 --> 00:07:28,199
You have a habit
of saying the wrong thing.

197
00:07:29,401 --> 00:07:31,536
During his 22-year reign,

198
00:07:31,603 --> 00:07:34,639
this French monarch known
as "The Spider King" had

199
00:07:34,707 --> 00:07:37,942
an ongoing feud with Charles
the Bold, Duke of Burgundy.

200
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:38,843
Peter?

201
00:07:38,911 --> 00:07:40,545
Who was King Louis XII?

202
00:07:40,612 --> 00:07:44,482
Ooh, I'm sorry, Peter, we were
looking for King Louis XI.

203
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,851
Ah, damn it, I knew that!

204
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:48,619
Ah, well, (bleep) me
in the (bleep)

205
00:07:48,687 --> 00:07:50,355
with a big,
black (bleep).

206
00:07:50,422 --> 00:07:52,457
King Louis XI.

207
00:07:52,524 --> 00:07:53,691
Tim, select.

208
00:07:55,444 --> 00:07:57,628
(doorbell rings)

209
00:07:58,864 --> 00:08:01,666
Oh, Lois, Peter,
come on in.

210
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:03,835
We were just praying
for Scotty's recovery.

211
00:08:03,902 --> 00:08:05,603
If you'd like,
you can join us.

212
00:08:05,671 --> 00:08:07,789
Well, that's what we wanted
to talk to you about.

213
00:08:07,873 --> 00:08:09,907
You'd better not just have
church toys.

214
00:08:09,975 --> 00:08:12,693
Look, I don't mean to question
your religious beliefs,

215
00:08:12,761 --> 00:08:14,762
but as a mother,
I just can't bear the thought

216
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,432
of little Scotty
not getting the help he needs.

217
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:19,133
You really needn't worry, Lois.

218
00:08:19,201 --> 00:08:20,768
Scotty will get all
the help he needs.

219
00:08:20,836 --> 00:08:21,803
From where?

220
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,421
From here.

221
00:08:23,489 --> 00:08:25,490
<i>Science and Health with Key</i>
<i>to the Scriptures</i>

222
00:08:25,557 --> 00:08:27,325
by Mary Baker Eddy?

223
00:08:27,393 --> 00:08:28,459
Let me see that.

224
00:08:30,429 --> 00:08:33,398
This is your god?! A woman?!

225
00:08:33,465 --> 00:08:35,433
Well, she's the founder
of our faith.

226
00:08:35,501 --> 00:08:38,102
Oh, really? So with this book
from the 1800s,

227
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:41,139
you can pray away paralysis
or terminal illness?

228
00:08:41,206 --> 00:08:43,307
Yes, we would pray for
anyone who's afflicted.

229
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,910
Well, then I'll tell you who you
should really be praying for.

230
00:08:45,978 --> 00:08:46,944
Out-of-work clowns.

231
00:08:57,556 --> 00:08:59,157
I need 40.

232
00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:05,963
Ben, Hope, please,

233
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:08,900
I just want to do anything
I can to help your son.

234
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:11,335
Well, you can, Lois.
Stay and pray with us.

235
00:09:11,403 --> 00:09:13,171
I think you'll find
that with God's love

236
00:09:13,238 --> 00:09:14,705
and a true belief,

237
00:09:14,773 --> 00:09:16,741
all manner of miracles
are possible.

238
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:18,876
Look, I'm a churchgoer, too,

239
00:09:18,944 --> 00:09:21,379
but sometimes prayer
isn't enough.

240
00:09:21,447 --> 00:09:22,814
He needs professional
medical care.

241
00:09:22,881 --> 00:09:24,782
You know, Lois, this couch
would be perfect

242
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,818
for one of your red wine
pass-outs.

243
00:09:26,885 --> 00:09:28,519
Look, we appreciate
your concern, Lois,

244
00:09:28,587 --> 00:09:29,921
but Scotty is our son,

245
00:09:29,988 --> 00:09:32,457
and we have to tend
to him as we see fit.

246
00:09:32,524 --> 00:09:35,460
But your son is sick!
He needs help!

247
00:09:35,527 --> 00:09:37,462
Um, does your god also not
believe in

248
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:38,779
putting out snacks
for the guests?

249
00:09:38,847 --> 00:09:40,047
Come on, Lois.

250
00:09:40,115 --> 00:09:41,432
I think we're wasting
our time here.

251
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,551
They're obviously very committed
to their beliefs.

252
00:09:43,635 --> 00:09:45,336
But their beliefs
are crazy, Brian.

253
00:09:45,404 --> 00:09:47,338
I don't know
who's crazier--

254
00:09:47,406 --> 00:09:49,357
these people or those
Seventh-Day Adventists.

255
00:09:49,424 --> 00:09:50,491
I'm a Methodist.

256
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,260
We believe that
the Lord is our Savior,

257
00:09:52,327 --> 00:09:54,729
and we remember Him
by going to church

258
00:09:54,796 --> 00:09:56,230
and praising Him
every Sunday.

259
00:09:56,298 --> 00:09:57,565
I'm a Seventh-Day
Adventist.

260
00:09:57,633 --> 00:09:59,667
We believe all the same
things that you believe,

261
00:09:59,735 --> 00:10:01,235
but we go to church
on Saturdays.

262
00:10:01,303 --> 00:10:03,237
What...?!

263
00:10:03,322 --> 00:10:05,122
(laughing crazily)

264
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,491
Ga-ga-ga-ga-gahh!

265
00:10:06,542 --> 00:10:07,542
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

266
00:10:07,626 --> 00:10:09,560
Hoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo!
Hoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo!

267
00:10:12,447 --> 00:10:14,048
I know it's
frustrating, Lois,

268
00:10:14,116 --> 00:10:16,184
but the fact is,
there are no laws that say

269
00:10:16,251 --> 00:10:18,619
those people have to take
their child to the doctor.

270
00:10:18,687 --> 00:10:20,121
How can that be?

271
00:10:20,189 --> 00:10:22,757
Children are citizens, too.
They should have rights.

272
00:10:22,824 --> 00:10:25,159
Well, it's
a tricky area, Lois.

273
00:10:25,227 --> 00:10:27,562
You could file a suit,
but that could take months,

274
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:29,197
and even then,
there's no guarantee

275
00:10:29,264 --> 00:10:30,898
the court wouldn't support
the parents' right

276
00:10:30,966 --> 00:10:32,266
to practice their religion.

277
00:10:32,334 --> 00:10:34,402
How could we live in
a country that would allow

278
00:10:34,469 --> 00:10:35,937
a sick child to die?

279
00:10:36,004 --> 00:10:38,623
Look, this country was founded
by people who came here

280
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,157
to escape
religious persecution.

281
00:10:40,225 --> 00:10:42,593
They made sure we all had
a right to religious freedom,

282
00:10:42,661 --> 00:10:44,695
and it's my job
to protect that.

283
00:10:44,763 --> 00:10:46,364
So there's nothing
we can do?

284
00:10:46,431 --> 00:10:50,134
You could contribute
to the Policeman's Ball.

285
00:10:50,202 --> 00:10:51,184
What?!

286
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:53,189
What does that have
to do with a sick child?

287
00:10:53,238 --> 00:10:54,739
Look, it's
a nice night out,

288
00:10:54,806 --> 00:10:56,173
you're eating
at a fancy buffet,

289
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:58,042
the captain does
his Al Pacino...

290
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,411
Joe, we're really more
of a Fireman's Ball family.

291
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,247
Oh, yeah? Are the firemen gonna
come and put out the <i>rape?!</i>

292
00:11:03,315 --> 00:11:04,799
(sighs)

293
00:11:04,866 --> 00:11:06,534
Peter, we can't
let this happen.

294
00:11:06,602 --> 00:11:08,135
I-I mean, we're parents.

295
00:11:08,203 --> 00:11:10,004
What if this was
one of our kids?

296
00:11:10,072 --> 00:11:11,556
It's too bad we're
not the A-Team.

297
00:11:11,623 --> 00:11:13,724
'Cause then we could just go
in there and steal that kid.

298
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:15,459
I don't know
about that, Peter.

299
00:11:15,527 --> 00:11:17,011
Kidnapping is
against the law.

300
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:18,846
It's too bad we're
not Taken from <i>Taken.</i>

301
00:11:18,914 --> 00:11:20,915
Then I could dip my
head in brown paint

302
00:11:20,983 --> 00:11:23,050
and galumph around Europe
looking for my hot daughter.

303
00:11:23,118 --> 00:11:25,069
Although is it any worse
than what they're doing?

304
00:11:25,137 --> 00:11:26,704
They're letting a kid die.

305
00:11:26,772 --> 00:11:28,005
It's too bad we're
not Dragonheart.

306
00:11:28,073 --> 00:11:29,773
Then we could just fly
around on a dragon

307
00:11:29,825 --> 00:11:30,725
and forget
about all this.

308
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:31,926
You know what?

309
00:11:31,994 --> 00:11:33,427
That's exactly
what we should do.

310
00:11:33,495 --> 00:11:35,529
What? What the hell are
you talking about?

311
00:11:35,597 --> 00:11:37,398
I'm talking about
us going in there

312
00:11:37,466 --> 00:11:39,500
and taking that kid
and getting him some help.

313
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:41,035
I mean, I know it's wrong,

314
00:11:41,103 --> 00:11:42,687
but it's better than
just letting him die.

315
00:11:42,754 --> 00:11:44,121
Hey, that's not
a bad idea.

316
00:11:44,189 --> 00:11:45,723
It's like we're doing
a public service.

317
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,092
Like those idiots who get
together to paint a school.

318
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,795
This underachieving,
crime-ridden school

319
00:11:50,862 --> 00:11:52,697
is now fawn beige,

320
00:11:52,764 --> 00:11:55,650
thanks to guilty white people
with no weekend plans!

321
00:11:55,717 --> 00:11:57,551
OTHERS:
Yay!

322
00:12:01,757 --> 00:12:03,407
Peter, what the hell?

323
00:12:03,475 --> 00:12:04,742
Where's your ski mask?

324
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,377
It's kind of hard to
breathe in those things,

325
00:12:06,445 --> 00:12:07,745
so I just dressed up
like Harry Potter.

326
00:12:07,813 --> 00:12:08,746
(sighs)

327
00:12:08,814 --> 00:12:09,981
All right, let's go.

328
00:12:10,048 --> 00:12:11,983
Lois, if anything
should happen to us,

329
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:15,219
I want you to know, I haven't
been happy for a long time.

330
00:12:15,287 --> 00:12:17,888
Yes, Peter, you've
told me that, like, ten times.

331
00:12:22,361 --> 00:12:24,061
All right,
all the lights are out.

332
00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:25,129
They must be asleep.

333
00:12:25,197 --> 00:12:27,298
It's go time.

334
00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:31,752
Peter, what the
hell was that?

335
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,120
That's what you do, Lois.

336
00:12:33,188 --> 00:12:34,639
Okay, now,
take this walkie-talkie

337
00:12:34,706 --> 00:12:36,607
and confirm that I'm at
the various checkpoints.

338
00:12:36,675 --> 00:12:38,409
Oh. Okay.

339
00:12:38,477 --> 00:12:41,045
"Peter up on a telephone pole"?

340
00:12:41,113 --> 00:12:42,213
Check.

341
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,582
"Peter cutting the wires
to the alarm"?

342
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,516
Check.

343
00:12:45,584 --> 00:12:46,851
"Sexy Peter

344
00:12:46,918 --> 00:12:48,419
distracting the guards"?

345
00:12:48,487 --> 00:12:49,954
Check.

346
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:51,889
Hello, boys.

347
00:12:51,957 --> 00:12:54,208
Come up and have sex
with me some time.

348
00:12:54,292 --> 00:12:57,011
"Van full of Peters
who all have stern faces

349
00:12:57,079 --> 00:12:58,946
because they're about
to pull off a heist"?

350
00:12:59,014 --> 00:13:00,581
Check.

351
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:03,768
"Upside-down Peter who isn't
revealed to be upside-down

352
00:13:03,835 --> 00:13:06,270
until the camera spins around
and shows that he is"?

353
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:08,856
Check.

354
00:13:08,924 --> 00:13:11,258
"Peter in an open airplane door

355
00:13:11,326 --> 00:13:14,228
slapping other Peters on the
back as they parachute out"?

356
00:13:14,312 --> 00:13:16,714
Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go!

357
00:13:16,765 --> 00:13:17,715
Check!

358
00:13:17,783 --> 00:13:19,817
"Super gymnastic Asian Peter

359
00:13:19,885 --> 00:13:22,653
contorted into a box that will
be delivered into the house"?

360
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:25,189
<i>Hai!</i>

361
00:13:25,257 --> 00:13:26,824
"Peter who hasn't answered

362
00:13:26,892 --> 00:13:28,893
because something has gone
terribly wrong"?

363
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,628
Peter? Peter, are you there?

364
00:13:33,215 --> 00:13:35,483
Now, let's go get that kid.

365
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,585
Okay, he's in the
left upstairs bedroom.

366
00:13:37,652 --> 00:13:39,954
All right, you keep the car
going in case there's trouble.

367
00:13:44,826 --> 00:13:46,977
All right,
I got him, Lois.

368
00:13:47,045 --> 00:13:48,879
(quietly): Peter, what the--
that's not Scotty!

369
00:13:48,947 --> 00:13:50,314
That's Ben!

370
00:13:50,382 --> 00:13:52,817
Oh. Well, you know, we ain't
known this family that long.

371
00:13:52,884 --> 00:13:54,418
I'm still learning
everybody's names.

372
00:13:54,486 --> 00:13:56,987
Damn it, put him back and
go get Scotty, the baby!

373
00:13:57,055 --> 00:13:59,724
Okay, so I'll go get the baby,
and while I'm doing that,

374
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:02,426
maybe you do something
about that snatchy tone.

375
00:14:05,547 --> 00:14:06,981
Lois, is this the right one?!

376
00:14:07,048 --> 00:14:08,215
Shh! Peter!

377
00:14:08,283 --> 00:14:09,483
Yes. Now, come on.

378
00:14:12,621 --> 00:14:13,554
HOPE:
What was that?

379
00:14:13,622 --> 00:14:14,588
BEN:
I don't know.

380
00:14:14,656 --> 00:14:15,423
It came from
Scotty's room.

381
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,824
(tires screech)

382
00:14:18,994 --> 00:14:20,661
All right, we did it!

383
00:14:20,746 --> 00:14:22,830
Yes! We got the kid
and the treasure.

384
00:14:22,914 --> 00:14:24,048
Peter, there's
no treasure.

385
00:14:25,801 --> 00:14:27,668
Oh, well, never mind, then.

386
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,682
TV ANNOUNCER:
We now return to <i>One-Hour</i>

387
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:37,215
<i>Crime Show Where the Murderer</i>

388
00:14:37,216 --> 00:14:39,116
<i>is the Most Famous Person</i>
<i>in the Credits.</i>

389
00:14:39,184 --> 00:14:40,818
I think you're gonna want
to take a look at this.

390
00:14:40,886 --> 00:14:42,086
What do we got?

391
00:14:42,154 --> 00:14:43,654
Looks like somebody
had a rough night out.

392
00:14:43,722 --> 00:14:45,072
Boy, you can
say that again.

393
00:14:45,123 --> 00:14:46,424
Better get the
coroner down here.

394
00:14:46,491 --> 00:14:48,159
He's still got his watch
and his wallet.

395
00:14:48,243 --> 00:14:49,527
Guess that rules out robbery.

396
00:14:49,595 --> 00:14:51,462
Stabbed 17 times
in the chest;

397
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:54,115
I'd say the murderer knew
the victim intimately.

398
00:14:57,352 --> 00:14:59,754
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker
with some breaking news.

399
00:14:59,821 --> 00:15:02,223
A local kidnapping
has rocked Quahog tonight.

400
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,958
"Rocked Quahog"? Really?

401
00:15:04,026 --> 00:15:05,326
The whole town is r--

402
00:15:05,394 --> 00:15:06,661
The family maybe... is rocked.

403
00:15:06,728 --> 00:15:08,629
But the whole--
All right, well, in any event,

404
00:15:08,697 --> 00:15:11,365
we now go live to Asian reporter
Tricia Takanawa.

405
00:15:11,433 --> 00:15:13,634
Let's see how much
she's "rocked" by all this.

406
00:15:13,702 --> 00:15:14,869
Tricia?

407
00:15:14,937 --> 00:15:18,105
Tom, I'm standing here
with Mayor Adam West,

408
00:15:18,173 --> 00:15:20,374
with the latest information
about the disappearance

409
00:15:20,442 --> 00:15:22,209
of young Scotty Jennings.

410
00:15:22,277 --> 00:15:24,145
What can you tell us,
Mr. Mayor?

411
00:15:24,212 --> 00:15:26,547
Please, Mr. Mayor
is my father.

412
00:15:26,615 --> 00:15:28,182
Call me John Mayor.

413
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,685
Your body is a
wonderland, by the way.

414
00:15:30,752 --> 00:15:34,455
What is the city doing
to help rescue the missing boy?

415
00:15:34,523 --> 00:15:36,290
Well, we're looking
for this child

416
00:15:36,358 --> 00:15:39,860
using all the latest technology,
including the newest,

417
00:15:39,928 --> 00:15:42,396
most advanced
multimedia milk cartons.

418
00:15:42,464 --> 00:15:43,831
Help me!
I'm missing!

419
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:45,066
Help!

420
00:15:45,133 --> 00:15:46,701
Why are you still
eating breakfast?!

421
00:15:46,768 --> 00:15:47,902
I'm kidnapped!

422
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,737
Why are you turning me
the other way?!

423
00:15:49,805 --> 00:15:51,172
I'm still here!

424
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:52,607
Scotty Jennings?

425
00:15:52,674 --> 00:15:54,191
Oh, my God!

426
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:56,027
I know she was upset,
but do you think

427
00:15:56,094 --> 00:15:57,945
Lois would've gone
so far as to kidnap him?

428
00:15:58,013 --> 00:15:59,080
Of course she did.

429
00:15:59,147 --> 00:16:00,181
She'll do anything
for attention.

430
00:16:00,248 --> 00:16:01,382
I know.

431
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,817
She's like the boy
who cried wolf.

432
00:16:02,884 --> 00:16:04,468
(sheep bleating)

433
00:16:04,536 --> 00:16:05,736
Wolf, wolf!

434
00:16:05,821 --> 00:16:07,104
Did you hear that?

435
00:16:07,172 --> 00:16:08,990
Somebody needs help!
Let's go!

436
00:16:11,359 --> 00:16:12,276
(screams)

437
00:16:12,344 --> 00:16:14,045
Oh, my God, Charles!

438
00:16:14,112 --> 00:16:15,913
Oh, my God,
I'll run and get help.

439
00:16:15,981 --> 00:16:17,448
No, no, we've got
to carry him!

440
00:16:17,516 --> 00:16:19,583
We can't leave him
here; there's a wolf!

441
00:16:19,651 --> 00:16:22,253
Um, there's not
really a wolf.

442
00:16:22,321 --> 00:16:23,387
What?!

443
00:16:23,455 --> 00:16:26,123
Tell my kids I love 'em.

444
00:16:26,191 --> 00:16:29,327
Charlie! Charlie!

445
00:16:29,394 --> 00:16:32,196
This was so funny in my head
when I planned it.

446
00:16:34,883 --> 00:16:36,216
Don't you worry, Scotty.

447
00:16:36,268 --> 00:16:37,935
We're gonna get you
to the hospital

448
00:16:38,003 --> 00:16:39,720
and get you the medical
attention you need.

449
00:16:39,771 --> 00:16:41,022
Yeah, hang in
there, buddy.

450
00:16:41,073 --> 00:16:43,024
When this is over, we
can get some ice cream.

451
00:16:43,075 --> 00:16:45,159
Me and Lois can get
some ice cream, not you.

452
00:16:45,226 --> 00:16:46,911
They're gonna be sticking
needles in you everywhere.

453
00:16:46,995 --> 00:16:48,228
You know, Peter,
you were right,

454
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,914
this is actually
kind of a rush.

455
00:16:49,998 --> 00:16:52,333
I mean, look at us,
we're like Thelma and Louise.

456
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,752
Yeah, but we all know that
didn't end well for them.

457
00:16:54,836 --> 00:16:56,037
(sirens wailing)

458
00:16:56,088 --> 00:16:57,421
You know what?

459
00:16:57,506 --> 00:16:59,874
Let's just turn ourselves in.

460
00:16:59,925 --> 00:17:01,625
I got a great lawyer.

461
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:04,211
And he says, worst case,
eight to 12 years.

462
00:17:04,262 --> 00:17:05,930
And when we get out,
we'll still have

463
00:17:06,014 --> 00:17:07,598
the rest of our
lives ahead of us.

464
00:17:14,322 --> 00:17:16,057
(women screaming)

465
00:17:16,124 --> 00:17:17,091
(crash)

466
00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:18,926
Good-bye, terrible women.

467
00:17:25,534 --> 00:17:26,984
Oh, my God!

468
00:17:29,121 --> 00:17:31,072
This is Tricia Takanawa.

469
00:17:31,139 --> 00:17:33,874
I am standing outside
Quahog Hospital,

470
00:17:33,942 --> 00:17:36,477
where accused kidnappers
Lois and Peter Griffin

471
00:17:36,545 --> 00:17:37,945
have just arrived.

472
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:40,881
Also arriving is
my overprotective boyfriend,

473
00:17:40,949 --> 00:17:44,218
who is suspicious whenever I am
called into work at night,

474
00:17:44,286 --> 00:17:47,354
even though I've been a
reporter for years, Tyrone.

475
00:17:47,422 --> 00:17:49,857
I thought I told you
to mention my painting business.

476
00:17:52,794 --> 00:17:55,129
Lois, Peter, stop right there.

477
00:17:55,197 --> 00:17:56,497
You're under arrest
for kidnapping.

478
00:17:56,565 --> 00:17:58,132
I'm gonna have to ask you

479
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,800
to hand over the baby
and surrender.

480
00:17:59,868 --> 00:18:02,002
Joe, please get out of our way.

481
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,739
I promise, when this is over,
I'll gladly go to prison

482
00:18:04,806 --> 00:18:07,241
for the rest of my life,
but not until I bring

483
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:09,310
this defenseless child
into the hospital

484
00:18:09,377 --> 00:18:11,212
to get him the treatment
he deserves.

485
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:13,914
Uh, Joe, we would
like two tickets

486
00:18:13,982 --> 00:18:15,015
to the
Policeman's Ball.

487
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:15,983
Too late!

488
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:16,984
(tires screech)

489
00:18:17,035 --> 00:18:18,119
There they are!

490
00:18:18,186 --> 00:18:20,521
Lois, please!

491
00:18:20,589 --> 00:18:23,090
Stop what you're doing and
give Scotty back to us!

492
00:18:23,158 --> 00:18:24,625
I can't do that, Hope.

493
00:18:24,693 --> 00:18:27,194
But we've entrusted our
son into the Lord's hands.

494
00:18:27,262 --> 00:18:28,562
I know.

495
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,765
And maybe that's why
he ended up in my hands.

496
00:18:30,832 --> 00:18:33,334
The Lord can't do everything,
you know.

497
00:18:33,401 --> 00:18:34,635
Blasphemy!
Heresy!

498
00:18:34,703 --> 00:18:36,036
Sodomy!

499
00:18:36,104 --> 00:18:37,404
(chuckles) Sorry, I don't even
know what's going on.

500
00:18:37,472 --> 00:18:38,422
How you doin'?

501
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,824
Ben, Hope,

502
00:18:39,891 --> 00:18:41,859
I know you don't believe
in modern medicine,

503
00:18:41,927 --> 00:18:44,195
but you do believe
in the power of prayer.

504
00:18:44,262 --> 00:18:45,095
That's right.

505
00:18:45,163 --> 00:18:46,464
And through the years,

506
00:18:46,531 --> 00:18:48,332
when there was disease
or infection,

507
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,135
people of good faith
would pray to God for a cure.

508
00:18:51,203 --> 00:18:52,736
Yes. It's what we do.

509
00:18:52,804 --> 00:18:56,073
Well, then isn't it possible
that penicillin, vaccines

510
00:18:56,141 --> 00:18:59,310
and antibiotics are all
actually answered prayers?

511
00:19:00,812 --> 00:19:02,379
And isn't it possible that

512
00:19:02,447 --> 00:19:04,165
the amazing men and women
of medicine

513
00:19:04,232 --> 00:19:05,983
who brought about these miracles

514
00:19:06,051 --> 00:19:09,286
could be the instruments
of God's answers to our prayers?

515
00:19:09,354 --> 00:19:10,504
It's good so far, Lois.

516
00:19:10,555 --> 00:19:12,473
Try to work a few laughs
in there if you can.

517
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,275
Look, I believe
life is sacred.

518
00:19:14,342 --> 00:19:16,677
And I know you want Scotty
to live a full life.

519
00:19:16,745 --> 00:19:17,878
(laughs)

520
00:19:17,946 --> 00:19:19,346
And if that's
true, then I think

521
00:19:19,414 --> 00:19:20,681
it's wrong for
you to ignore

522
00:19:20,749 --> 00:19:22,817
what very well could
be the Lord's will.

523
00:19:22,884 --> 00:19:24,985
I mean, what's the
point in praying to God

524
00:19:25,053 --> 00:19:27,321
if you're just going to wipe
your butt with his answers?

525
00:19:28,974 --> 00:19:31,492
Hope, Ben,

526
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:33,894
please let God
answer your prayers.

527
00:19:33,945 --> 00:19:35,796
Please let your son get help.

528
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:39,466
Well, I guess through
the Lord's will,

529
00:19:39,534 --> 00:19:42,203
anything is possible.

530
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,470
All right, Lois.

531
00:19:43,538 --> 00:19:45,072
Scotty can have
his treatment.

532
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,740
Oh, thank you!

533
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:49,393
Thank you,
and God bless you both!

534
00:19:49,461 --> 00:19:50,644
Hey, everybody!

535
00:19:50,712 --> 00:19:52,246
We're all gonna get laid!

536
00:19:52,314 --> 00:19:55,316
(wild cheering)

537
00:19:59,754 --> 00:20:02,656
TV ANNOUNCER: We now return to
<i>Dracula in San Francisco.</i>

538
00:20:15,704 --> 00:20:16,937
Ooh.

539
00:20:17,005 --> 00:20:19,440
Well, that's why
we have the lab.

540
00:20:19,507 --> 00:20:21,458
Well, I just got off
the phone with Hope,

541
00:20:21,543 --> 00:20:24,061
and it sounds like Scotty's
gonna make a full recovery.

542
00:20:24,129 --> 00:20:25,529
You hear that, Stewie?

543
00:20:25,597 --> 00:20:27,131
Looks like your little
friend's gonna be okay.

544
00:20:27,198 --> 00:20:28,566
Eh, I don't care about him.

545
00:20:28,633 --> 00:20:30,234
I've got a new friend
who's got leprosy.

546
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,237
(chuckles)
See, he's funny.

547
00:20:33,305 --> 00:20:35,306
Peter, are you actually reading
that Christian Science book?

548
00:20:35,373 --> 00:20:37,474
Yeah, you know, I figured
I'd give it a shot.

549
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:39,443
I mean, wouldn't it
be cool if you could

550
00:20:39,511 --> 00:20:42,162
pray really hard for something,
and it actually happened?

551
00:20:44,766 --> 00:20:47,067
I am so happy for me.

552
00:20:47,135 --> 00:20:48,602
I deserve this.

553
00:20:48,653 --> 00:20:50,154
When do you think
the Queen's gonna die?

554
00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:55,269
