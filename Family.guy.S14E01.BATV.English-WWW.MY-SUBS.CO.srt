12
00:00:35,212 --> 00:00:37,079
Ugh, look at Miss Tammy.

13
00:00:37,114 --> 00:00:38,513
What a skank.

14
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:40,849
She's free-muffin it
at a baby school.

15
00:00:40,884 --> 00:00:42,985
Hi, Stewie.
Mommy's here to pick you up.

16
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,920
Why do you feel
the need to narrate

17
00:00:44,955 --> 00:00:46,254
every little thing you do?

18
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,823
Oh, hi, Mrs. Griffin.

19
00:00:47,858 --> 00:00:49,224
You know, I've
actually been meaning

20
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:50,659
to talk to you
about Stewie.

21
00:00:50,694 --> 00:00:52,861
I'm concerned that he might
have an attention problem.

22
00:00:52,896 --> 00:00:54,396
Attention problem?

23
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:57,199
Yes, he's been a little
difficult to deal with,

24
00:00:57,234 --> 00:01:00,335
and on page two of three in the
<i>How To Be a Teacher</i> manual,

25
00:01:00,371 --> 00:01:01,770
it says that any child

26
00:01:01,805 --> 00:01:03,872
who's being difficult
should be medicated.

27
00:01:03,907 --> 00:01:05,841
What?! Drugging a baby?

28
00:01:05,876 --> 00:01:07,075
Are you sure?

29
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:08,610
That sounds so serious.

30
00:01:08,646 --> 00:01:11,313
I'm afraid his behavior has
been an issue for a while.

31
00:01:11,348 --> 00:01:13,882
He's even been bothering
students during nap time.

32
00:01:13,917 --> 00:01:16,518
Hey, you up?

33
00:01:16,553 --> 00:01:19,655
Guess where
I have a crayon.

34
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,527
So, I spend, like,
$75 on cat toys,

35
00:01:25,562 --> 00:01:27,195
and what does she play with?

36
00:01:27,231 --> 00:01:28,830
A shoelace.
That's crazy.

37
00:01:28,866 --> 00:01:31,433
Joe, that's been your answer
every time I tell a story.

38
00:01:31,468 --> 00:01:32,901
It's like
you're not even listening.

39
00:01:32,936 --> 00:01:34,336
Well, that's 'cause
you interrupted me

40
00:01:34,371 --> 00:01:35,971
when I was telling
you about Kevin

41
00:01:36,006 --> 00:01:38,206
trying to hang himself
with an extension cord.

42
00:01:38,242 --> 00:01:40,008
I know, that's crazy.

43
00:01:40,044 --> 00:01:42,611
Hey, y'all want to try
some of our new food?

44
00:01:42,646 --> 00:01:45,480
I'm trying to turn this place
into a gastropub.

45
00:01:45,516 --> 00:01:49,251
These are Korean tacos, 'cause
whatever the hell nowadays.

46
00:01:50,621 --> 00:01:52,354
Ugh! These are terrible!

47
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:53,622
(laughs)

48
00:01:53,657 --> 00:01:55,724
Quagmire,
when it comes to tacos,

49
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,726
I'll trust the Koreans,
thank you.

50
00:01:57,761 --> 00:02:01,263
You're nuts. This tastes like
Ani DiFranco after a bike ride.

51
00:02:01,298 --> 00:02:04,132
Geez, Quagmire, since when are
you such an expert on food?

52
00:02:04,168 --> 00:02:06,468
For your information,
I'm an excellent cook.

53
00:02:06,503 --> 00:02:08,236
(laughs):
You? A cook?

54
00:02:08,238 --> 00:02:11,006
Huh. What's your specialty?
No-way soufflé?

55
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:13,141
(laughs) I'm sorry,
that was out of line.

56
00:02:13,177 --> 00:02:15,744
I<i> am</i> a good cook,
and I'll prove it to you!

57
00:02:15,779 --> 00:02:17,879
Saturday night, you
and all your wives are coming

58
00:02:17,915 --> 00:02:19,181
to my place for dinner.

59
00:02:19,216 --> 00:02:20,415
Fine. We'll be there.

60
00:02:20,451 --> 00:02:21,850
Ooh, can we make it
Sunday?

61
00:02:21,885 --> 00:02:24,252
Saturday, I'm giving
Javier Bardem a haircut.

62
00:02:24,288 --> 00:02:25,954
So, what'll it be?
Everything.

63
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:27,289
What do you mean?

64
00:02:27,324 --> 00:02:30,258
Long in the short places,
short in the long places.

65
00:02:30,294 --> 00:02:33,195
It should be from both
the future and the past.

66
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,465
Something a child
would do to a doll.

67
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,904
Sorry, I just prefer
to do number two at home.

68
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,439
Where were we?

69
00:02:44,475 --> 00:02:45,907
It's Stewie,
Dr. Hartman.

70
00:02:45,943 --> 00:02:47,576
He's having trouble
focusing at school.

71
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:50,445
Ah, yes. So you're telling me
your baby won't sit still

72
00:02:50,481 --> 00:02:52,380
in a way that's convenient
for his teacher?

73
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,782
Yes.

74
00:02:53,817 --> 00:02:55,250
I'd heard stories,
but never thought

75
00:02:55,285 --> 00:02:56,918
I'd see it
with my own eyes.

76
00:02:56,954 --> 00:02:59,020
Mrs. Griffin, I'm going
to write Stewie a prescription

77
00:02:59,056 --> 00:03:00,722
for ADHD medication.

78
00:03:00,758 --> 00:03:02,724
Really? Well,
I don't know.

79
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,893
Doesn't that stuff
make you wired?

80
00:03:04,928 --> 00:03:07,028
Well, if you're low-energy
and lethargic, yes.

81
00:03:07,064 --> 00:03:08,263
But if you're high energy,

82
00:03:08,298 --> 00:03:10,432
it actually calms you down
and helps you focus.

83
00:03:10,467 --> 00:03:12,534
At least that's what I'm reading
on WebMD.

84
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:15,237
Wow, there are a lot
of different kinds of medicines.

85
00:03:15,272 --> 00:03:16,805
There's a cat in here.

86
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,974
Okay, I guess we
can give it a try.

87
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:20,342
Here you go.

88
00:03:20,377 --> 00:03:22,611
Now, who's this little guy?

89
00:03:27,151 --> 00:03:30,185
Wow, when did you learn
to cook, Glenn?

90
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,820
Well, as a young man, I found

91
00:03:31,855 --> 00:03:34,623
that a great meal was the
quickest way to a woman's heart.

92
00:03:34,658 --> 00:03:36,057
How romantic.

93
00:03:36,093 --> 00:03:38,860
I mean, how do you think NBA
players get all those chicks?

94
00:03:38,896 --> 00:03:40,862
They're all great cooks.
Except Kobe Bryant.

95
00:03:40,898 --> 00:03:42,631
His-his... his secret
is different.

96
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,099
Quagmire, you're really good.

97
00:03:44,134 --> 00:03:45,901
You could probably
make money at this.

98
00:03:45,936 --> 00:03:48,103
Yeah, maybe you could
open a restaurant.

99
00:03:48,138 --> 00:03:50,038
Or maybe get a cooking show.

100
00:03:50,073 --> 00:03:51,673
You know,
the 11:30 cooking show

101
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,542
on Channel Five
needs a new host.

102
00:03:53,577 --> 00:03:55,210
The old one burned off
his eyebrows,

103
00:03:55,245 --> 00:03:57,012
and was just too weird
to look at.

104
00:03:57,047 --> 00:03:58,547
You should do
it, Quagmire!

105
00:03:58,582 --> 00:04:00,482
I'll even come along
and cheer you on!

106
00:04:00,517 --> 00:04:02,350
You'd do that for me?
Course I would.

107
00:04:02,386 --> 00:04:05,153
I love cheering people on,
like when I go to NASCAR.

108
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:06,922
(crowd cheering)
Go in a circle!

109
00:04:06,957 --> 00:04:10,358
Go in a circle!
Go in a circle!

110
00:04:10,394 --> 00:04:13,061
Advertise stuff!
Advertise Stu...!

111
00:04:13,096 --> 00:04:15,063
Go in a circle!

112
00:04:20,037 --> 00:04:21,503
Hey, where's Stewie?

113
00:04:21,538 --> 00:04:23,724
Oh, he's probably
sleeping off his pills.

114
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:24,308
What?

115
00:04:24,308 --> 00:04:26,608
Well, the school said
he had an attention problem,

116
00:04:26,643 --> 00:04:28,343
so Dr. Hartman gave him
a prescription.

117
00:04:28,378 --> 00:04:30,145
You're giving a
one-year-old drugs?!

118
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,680
You're doping up a baby!

119
00:04:31,715 --> 00:04:33,181
Peter, are you
okay with this?

120
00:04:33,217 --> 00:04:34,549
Will you stop talking?

121
00:04:34,585 --> 00:04:37,552
I'm trying to think about a girl
I saw at the gas station.

122
00:04:37,588 --> 00:04:39,487
(door creaks)

123
00:04:39,523 --> 00:04:41,756
Stewie?

124
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:45,560
(slowly):
Welcome to Pillow-World, Bri.

125
00:04:45,596 --> 00:04:47,896
Let me get up and greet you.

126
00:04:49,299 --> 00:04:50,966
There we go.

127
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:52,367
How you doing?

128
00:04:52,402 --> 00:04:54,569
Oh, my God, Stewie,
you're totally drugged out!

129
00:04:54,605 --> 00:04:55,837
You know something?

130
00:04:55,873 --> 00:04:57,439
I have been thinking

131
00:04:57,474 --> 00:05:02,043
about how everyone in this
family, Brian, does their job.

132
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,946
And they do a pretty
good job of it.

133
00:05:10,087 --> 00:05:12,087
God, I'm really freaking
out over this audition.

134
00:05:12,122 --> 00:05:13,655
What if I blow it?

135
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,523
Quagmire, when I agreed
to come to this,

136
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:18,326
I didn't know it would require
this level of emotional support.

137
00:05:18,362 --> 00:05:19,761
You Glenn Quagmire?

138
00:05:19,796 --> 00:05:21,630
I'm Carson, the
producer of the show.

139
00:05:21,665 --> 00:05:23,298
Peter Griffin.
I should be at work.

140
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,733
Okay, let's see
what you've got.

141
00:05:24,768 --> 00:05:26,134
I think you're gonna like this.

142
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:28,436
Cedar plank salmon
with a maple glaze

143
00:05:28,472 --> 00:05:31,973
and slow-roasted cherry tomatoes
on a bed of mesclun greens.

144
00:05:33,677 --> 00:05:35,243
Hmm. Not bad.

145
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,880
Also, the tomatoes can be eyes,
and the lettuce can be hair.

146
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:41,082
Look down.
There's also a carrot.

147
00:05:41,118 --> 00:05:42,951
(laughs) This is great!

148
00:05:42,986 --> 00:05:45,387
Terrific food
<i>and</i> a hilarious sidekick?

149
00:05:45,422 --> 00:05:46,655
This! This
is the show!

150
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:47,822
What do you mean?

151
00:05:47,858 --> 00:05:49,257
I'm saying
you're hired!

152
00:05:49,293 --> 00:05:51,126
Just as long as your
friend joins you.

153
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:52,494
What do you say, Peter?

154
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:54,362
I say let's do it!

155
00:05:54,398 --> 00:05:55,897
Whoops. Uh, uh.

156
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:57,299
Oh, I'm...
I'm sorry.

157
00:05:57,334 --> 00:05:59,668
What do I...
what-what do I do?

158
00:06:03,974 --> 00:06:07,108
I-I don't...
I don't know what to do now.

159
00:06:09,112 --> 00:06:11,146
That was the wrong choice,
Peter.

160
00:06:17,315 --> 00:06:18,814
Wow, Quagmire,
look at you!

161
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,183
You're a real TV chef!
I know.

162
00:06:21,219 --> 00:06:23,786
It might sound silly,
but being a chef is something

163
00:06:23,821 --> 00:06:25,054
I've always dreamed about.

164
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:27,623
I always dream about my
house filling up with water.

165
00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:30,626
That's crazy. But anyway, thanks
for encouraging me, Peter.

166
00:06:30,662 --> 00:06:32,128
DIRECTOR:
All right, places!

167
00:06:32,163 --> 00:06:35,264
We're rolling
in three, two, one.

168
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,099
Welcome back to
<i>Quagmire's Kitchen.</i>

169
00:06:37,135 --> 00:06:39,235
Now, this mince pie
is about ready to go.

170
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,803
Just needs a pinch
of cinnamon.

171
00:06:40,838 --> 00:06:43,739
And while we're at it, how about
we take the cinnamon challenge?

172
00:06:43,775 --> 00:06:45,408
Okay, Peter, we've all seen
the Internet videos.

173
00:06:45,443 --> 00:06:46,475
We're not doing that.

174
00:06:46,511 --> 00:06:47,944
I was talking about
something else.

175
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:50,212
I was talking about a
serious cooking thing.

176
00:06:50,248 --> 00:06:52,448
Now, the ingredients
of a mince pie are traceable

177
00:06:52,483 --> 00:06:54,183
to the 13th century,

178
00:06:54,218 --> 00:06:56,319
when returning European
crusaders brought back

179
00:06:56,354 --> 00:06:58,354
Middle Eastern recipes
containing meats,

180
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:00,890
fruits and--
oh, boy-- spices.

181
00:07:00,925 --> 00:07:02,658
Right here,
I'm using cloves.

182
00:07:02,694 --> 00:07:03,993
(coughing)

183
00:07:04,028 --> 00:07:06,095
Of course, most people associate
mince pie with Christmas.

184
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,663
(hacking)
But I'll be honest.

185
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:09,765
I'm not afraid of
a summer mince pie.

186
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:11,867
I remember the first time
I had mince pie.

187
00:07:11,903 --> 00:07:13,135
Our neighbor, Mrs. Morrin,

188
00:07:13,171 --> 00:07:15,004
introduced it to me one afternoon.
Oh, God!

189
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,339
I had house-sat for her
Aah!

190
00:07:16,374 --> 00:07:18,007
while she was visiting her aunt in Vernon
Oh, God.

191
00:07:18,042 --> 00:07:19,342
and she wanted to thank me.

192
00:07:19,377 --> 00:07:21,410
And, oh, boy,
what a treat it was.

193
00:07:21,446 --> 00:07:23,779
You done?
Yeah.

194
00:07:23,815 --> 00:07:26,682
All right, best two
out of three, cinnamon.

195
00:07:34,892 --> 00:07:36,859
Still on those meds, huh?

196
00:07:36,894 --> 00:07:41,130
Uh, yeah, they, uh...
they help me to, um...

197
00:07:41,165 --> 00:07:43,199
uh... think.

198
00:07:43,234 --> 00:07:46,302
Okay, time for
an eyes-open nap.

199
00:07:48,072 --> 00:07:50,306
God, look what those pills
are doing to you.

200
00:07:50,341 --> 00:07:52,575
Putting you on that stuff
was a huge mistake.

201
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,211
Like inviting a turtle
to a cocktail party.

202
00:07:55,246 --> 00:07:58,648
Hey. Ask me why they
call me a box turtle.

203
00:07:58,683 --> 00:08:00,983
(loud munching)

204
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:03,686
See, this is how
American society treats unique,

205
00:08:03,721 --> 00:08:05,287
enthusiastic children.

206
00:08:05,323 --> 00:08:07,323
Instead of embracing
their mental gifts,

207
00:08:07,358 --> 00:08:09,225
their first reaction
is to shoot them up

208
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,627
with hard-core drugs
until they're mindless sheeple.

209
00:08:11,663 --> 00:08:13,596
All the better
to send off to Kuwait

210
00:08:13,631 --> 00:08:15,965
and feed the Halliburton
oil machine, right?!

211
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
(scoffs):
Bush.

212
00:08:18,036 --> 00:08:20,836
Yup. Takes all kinds.

213
00:08:20,872 --> 00:08:23,639
You know, a lot of kids
at my school take ADD pills.

214
00:08:23,675 --> 00:08:25,808
They say if you're lazy
and unmotivated,

215
00:08:25,843 --> 00:08:28,177
it makes you super energized
and productive.

216
00:08:28,212 --> 00:08:31,080
Rea... Really? Productive?

217
00:08:31,115 --> 00:08:33,215
Yeah. And college kids
take it all the time

218
00:08:33,251 --> 00:08:34,884
so they can focus
on their studies

219
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,719
and drinking alcohol
with their butts.

220
00:08:38,756 --> 00:08:40,723
Focus, huh?

221
00:08:40,758 --> 00:08:42,058
Okay, well, Stewie,

222
00:08:42,093 --> 00:08:44,794
these babies can help
the garbage disposal focus

223
00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:46,662
because that's where
they're going.

224
00:08:46,698 --> 00:08:47,997
No need to follow me,

225
00:08:48,032 --> 00:08:50,366
because I just said
what I was gonna do.

226
00:08:54,572 --> 00:08:56,605
My God, I can't stop!

227
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:58,974
The words are
just pouring out of me!

228
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,877
I have more energy than a guy
who caught a T-shirt!

229
00:09:01,913 --> 00:09:03,879
(crowd cheering)

230
00:09:03,915 --> 00:09:06,182
My wife can wear this to sleep!

231
00:09:06,217 --> 00:09:09,085
My wife can wear this
to sleep!

232
00:09:13,658 --> 00:09:16,225
Okay, today we're putting
together duck breast medallions

233
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,827
with a port wine reduction.

234
00:09:17,862 --> 00:09:19,628
And as I'm walking you
through the steps,

235
00:09:19,664 --> 00:09:22,565
watch your screen for
Junior Chef Peter's pop-up tips:

236
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,568
helpful hints and food factoids
to make your meal a success.

237
00:09:25,603 --> 00:09:27,036
Now, you're gonna want to start

238
00:09:27,071 --> 00:09:29,238
with a large,
self-sealing plastic bag.

239
00:09:29,273 --> 00:09:31,507
And in that bag,
we'll combine one large,

240
00:09:31,542 --> 00:09:33,642
finely-chopped garlic clove;

241
00:09:33,678 --> 00:09:36,245
one tablespoon of grated,
peeled fresh ginger;

242
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,514
two teaspoons
of five-spice powder;

243
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:41,784
a teaspoon of salt; and a half
teaspoon of fresh ground pepper.

244
00:09:41,819 --> 00:09:44,086
Then you're gonna want
to add the duck breasts,

245
00:09:44,122 --> 00:09:47,189
seal the bag, and refrigerate
that for at least one hour,

246
00:09:47,225 --> 00:09:50,192
or up to 24 hours, if you want
to prepare this ahead of time.

247
00:09:50,228 --> 00:09:52,561
Just make sure you remove
the bag from the refrigerator

248
00:09:52,597 --> 00:09:54,130
one hour before cooking.

249
00:09:54,165 --> 00:09:57,767
You're gonna put that in your
oven, preheated to 400 degrees.

250
00:09:59,637 --> 00:10:01,370
So we just spoon
on the drippings,

251
00:10:01,405 --> 00:10:03,105
and that'll brown
the skin nicely.

252
00:10:03,141 --> 00:10:07,476
If you bang these metal spoons
on everything, it's like<i> Stomp.</i>

253
00:10:07,512 --> 00:10:10,146
Look at me! I'm huge in 2002!

254
00:10:10,181 --> 00:10:11,647
Peter...

255
00:10:11,682 --> 00:10:14,483
Nothing like a night at the
theater that ends in a headache!

256
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:15,985
Damn it, Peter,
that's it!

257
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,454
I can't do this show with
you anymore! You're fired!

258
00:10:18,489 --> 00:10:19,755
What?! You can't fire me!

259
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,557
Only Mr. Spacely can fire me.

260
00:10:21,592 --> 00:10:24,760
Griffin...
you're fired!

261
00:10:24,796 --> 00:10:27,463
(voice breaking):
Okay, that's fair.

262
00:10:27,498 --> 00:10:30,132
(crying)

263
00:10:31,869 --> 00:10:33,502
Peter, can
I come in?

264
00:10:33,538 --> 00:10:36,672
Hold on, let me put on
my weird old actress turban.

265
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,375
Yes?

266
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,811
Listen, I saw what happened,
but you should know,

267
00:10:41,846 --> 00:10:43,913
we at the station
would hate to lose you.

268
00:10:43,948 --> 00:10:45,447
You're a big hit
with the viewers.

269
00:10:45,483 --> 00:10:48,150
I will not work
with that man again.

270
00:10:48,186 --> 00:10:49,985
I'm not asking
you to. In fact,

271
00:10:50,021 --> 00:10:52,555
we'd like to offer you
your own cooking show.

272
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,157
Hmm, let me consult
with my lawyer.

273
00:10:55,193 --> 00:10:57,660
Well, Peter, since the DUIs
happened so close together,

274
00:10:57,695 --> 00:10:59,662
we don't really have
much wiggle room here.

275
00:10:59,697 --> 00:11:02,865
I suggest you take the jail time
and just get it over with.

276
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,835
I'll do it.
After October 13.

277
00:11:12,944 --> 00:11:14,443
Come on, Rupert.

278
00:11:14,478 --> 00:11:15,711
Wait-wait till you see this.

279
00:11:15,746 --> 00:11:18,180
This is really
something special.

280
00:11:18,216 --> 00:11:22,718
Check out how much water
is in the dehumidifier.

281
00:11:22,753 --> 00:11:25,321
Wow!

282
00:11:25,356 --> 00:11:27,690
That was all in the air.

283
00:11:27,725 --> 00:11:29,225
(light clattering)

284
00:11:30,928 --> 00:11:32,061
Brian?

285
00:11:32,096 --> 00:11:33,629
Is that... is that, uh...

286
00:11:33,664 --> 00:11:35,931
Is that, uh... you?

287
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:37,333
Stewie! Rearrange.

288
00:11:37,368 --> 00:11:38,834
Ewiets. Rearrange.

289
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,236
Wieest. Restore.

290
00:11:40,271 --> 00:11:42,271
Stewie. Hey, come see
what I've been working on.

291
00:11:44,108 --> 00:11:47,076
I call it
Space Shire Seven.

292
00:11:47,111 --> 00:11:48,711
Nice, nice.

293
00:11:48,746 --> 00:11:52,047
It's like, uh, it's like
a fake, uh, place you made?

294
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,817
It's a medieval sci-fi universe,
adaptable to TV,

295
00:11:54,852 --> 00:11:56,485
movies, toys, games,
and mobile apps!

296
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,554
I threw together a 2,000-page
treatment last night.

297
00:11:58,589 --> 00:12:00,256
And I just figured,
the hell with it,

298
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,124
why not build a scale model
and record voices

299
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:04,293
for all the characters? Watch.

300
00:12:04,328 --> 00:12:05,761
Well met, stranger.

301
00:12:05,796 --> 00:12:07,963
<i>Arasha deekaba plitcho.</i>

302
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:09,832
That's a Nebulon Mage.
He speaks Ga'bi,

303
00:12:09,867 --> 00:12:11,667
this dumb language I wrote.

304
00:12:11,702 --> 00:12:13,736
It's then... illegal?

305
00:12:13,771 --> 00:12:15,738
What?

306
00:12:15,773 --> 00:12:17,773
Hello?

307
00:12:22,146 --> 00:12:24,380
Okay, now we add
the diced tomatoes.

308
00:12:24,415 --> 00:12:25,881
(thumping dance music,
applause in distance)

309
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:27,082
Just gonna keep going here.

310
00:12:27,118 --> 00:12:28,951
I like to drizzle these
with a fig balsamic...

311
00:12:28,986 --> 00:12:30,386
(crowd cheers in distance)
Damn it.

312
00:12:30,421 --> 00:12:32,087

♪ A place to stay... ♪

315
00:12:36,794 --> 00:12:39,128
And that's my famous paella
that looks and tastes

316
00:12:39,163 --> 00:12:40,529
just like a pizza bagel.

317
00:12:40,564 --> 00:12:41,864
It's a pizza bagel.

318
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:45,567
Now, as always,
add butter to taste.

319
00:12:45,603 --> 00:12:47,269
Mmm, delicious!

320
00:12:47,305 --> 00:12:49,305
Butter dunk!
(buzzer sounds)

321
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,340
(crowd cheering)

00:12:52,543 --> 00:12:54,310
Stop it!
Stop the show!

323
00:12:54,345 --> 00:12:55,811
What the hell
are you doing?

324
00:12:55,846 --> 00:12:57,813
You're just pouring
melted butter onto frozen foods.

325
00:12:57,848 --> 00:12:59,315
You're not a chef.

326
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,017
Oh, really? Then why do I
already have a restaurant

327
00:13:02,053 --> 00:13:04,720
in Orlando's largest
indoor water park?

328
00:13:04,755 --> 00:13:07,289
This is an insult to anyone
who cares about cooking.

329
00:13:07,325 --> 00:13:09,491
Either you leave
the network or I do!

330
00:13:09,527 --> 00:13:12,328
Guys, guys, look, I know how
we can settle this: a cook-off.

331
00:13:12,363 --> 00:13:13,862
Each of you
cooks a meal

332
00:13:13,898 --> 00:13:16,532
using a secret ingredient,
<i>Iron Chef</i> style.

333
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:18,300
Will we be allowed
to use calculators?

334
00:13:18,336 --> 00:13:19,568
Um, I... I don't...

335
00:13:19,603 --> 00:13:20,836
What?

336
00:13:20,871 --> 00:13:22,338
I say bring it on!

337
00:13:22,373 --> 00:13:23,939
Fine! A cook-off it is.

338
00:13:23,975 --> 00:13:25,674
See you in the
kitchen, jerk.

339
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:28,477
I'll see you
in hell, loser.

340
00:13:29,947 --> 00:13:31,947
Bad day to carpool.
Yeah.

341
00:13:36,934 --> 00:13:38,900
Okay, Joe, Peter and I
are going head-to-head

342
00:13:38,962 --> 00:13:40,128
in that cooking
competition,

343
00:13:40,163 --> 00:13:41,796
and they're letting us
each use an assistant.

344
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:43,131
Will you help me out?

345
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,999
Okay, but just promise me
there's no reading.

346
00:13:45,035 --> 00:13:46,200
I'm not a strong reader.

347
00:13:46,236 --> 00:13:47,435
What?

348
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,736
I'm not illiterate,
I'm just slow.

349
00:13:48,772 --> 00:13:50,238
What are you talking about?

350
00:13:50,273 --> 00:13:53,808
I never tried hard in school
'cause I could always run fast.

351
00:13:55,445 --> 00:13:58,146
So you're cool with being
my chef helper for the big show?

352
00:13:58,181 --> 00:13:59,647
Sure, but I got
to be honest--

353
00:13:59,683 --> 00:14:01,115
if it ain't a
fish with whiskers,

354
00:14:01,151 --> 00:14:02,750
I don't know what
to do with it.

355
00:14:02,786 --> 00:14:03,985
But if it is?

356
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,988
Then sweet sassy molassey!
(chuckles)

357
00:14:07,023 --> 00:14:09,724
Great. Don't talk that way

Almost always.

So? What do you think?

424
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,659
It was terrible.

425
00:16:58,695 --> 00:16:59,894
Ah, you're
speaking the language

426

I'm very flattered.

428
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:03,965
No, it's garbage.

429
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,533
You just took a lot of pills,

430
00:17:05,568 --> 00:17:08,002
mashed together a bunch
of sci-fi and fantasy clichés

431

and crapped out
a 2,000-page turd.

Y-You could tell
I was on medication?

433
00:17:13,276 --> 00:17:16,077
Oh, sure. But that stuff
doesn't make you write well,

434
00:17:16,112 --> 00:17:17,879
it just makes you
write a lot.

435
00:17:17,914 --> 00:17:19,380
Now, if you'll excuse me,

436
00:17:19,415 --> 00:17:22,416
I have to go wash the nerd
chotch out of my beard.

God. I didn't realize

438

how those drugs were
ruining me creatively.

439
00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:32,193
I haven't been feeling
quite right either.

440
00:17:32,228 --> 00:17:35,463
Yesterday, I watched Chris
shower for half an hour

441
00:17:35,498 --> 00:17:38,065
just because
I thought it was the TV.

He, um...

Stewie, this drug
is ruining us.

445

We don't need these.

You're right.

But there's
nothing wrong with us.

butter.

a delicious five-course
butter feast.

474
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,010
Son of a bitch,
I never cook with butter.

475
00:18:56,045 --> 00:18:57,979
Joe, grab my recipe book
and find a dish

476
00:18:58,014 --> 00:19:00,081
where I can substitute
olive oil with butter.

477
00:19:02,185 --> 00:19:03,317
Joe, come on, hurry!

478
00:19:03,353 --> 00:19:05,820
I told you
I'm not a strong reader!

479
00:19:10,193 --> 00:19:11,559
Damn it, Joe,
pull it together!

480
00:19:11,594 --> 00:19:14,495
Hey, Quagmire, FYI, I got to
take off in, like, ten minutes.

481
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,230
I got a clarinet lesson.

482
00:19:16,265 --> 00:19:17,598
What?! Ugh.

483
00:19:17,633 --> 00:19:18,866
I can't do this.

484
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:20,901
(sobbing)

485
00:19:22,772 --> 00:19:25,239
Aw, look at Quagmire.

486
00:19:25,274 --> 00:19:27,141
This was his dream.

487
00:19:27,176 --> 00:19:28,342
Time's almost up, Peter.

488
00:19:28,378 --> 00:19:29,977
We're gonna win!

489
00:19:31,881 --> 00:19:33,881
No, we're not.

490
00:19:38,187 --> 00:19:39,954
TOM: And in a stunning
turn of events,

491
00:19:39,989 --> 00:19:42,056
Chef Griffin
is eating his entire meal.

492
00:19:42,091 --> 00:19:43,591
He'll have nothing to serve.

493
00:19:46,129 --> 00:19:47,595
(buzzer sounds)

494
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,830
(panting)

495
00:19:49,866 --> 00:19:51,599
Well, that's it.
If Chef Quagmire

496
00:19:51,634 --> 00:19:54,969
has prepared a dish of any kind,
he wins this competition.

497
00:19:55,004 --> 00:19:56,370
Let's see what he has.

498
00:19:56,406 --> 00:19:58,839
A warm packet
of tartar sauce

499
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,841
brought in
from somewhere else.

500
00:20:00,877 --> 00:20:03,544
"When are you gonna use that?"
Bonnie said.

501
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:05,279
We have a winner!

502
00:20:05,314 --> 00:20:06,314
(crowd cheering)

503
00:20:08,384 --> 00:20:11,285
Peter, you threw
the cook-off for me?

504
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,686
I couldn't take
your dream away...

505
00:20:12,722 --> 00:20:13,888
Heart attack!

506
00:20:13,923 --> 00:20:15,456
...from you, buddy.
You're the...

507
00:20:15,491 --> 00:20:17,058
Mini stroke!
...one with the real...

508
00:20:17,093 --> 00:20:18,826
Heart attack!
...talent. You...

509
00:20:18,861 --> 00:20:20,294
Heart attack!
...deserve the show...

510
00:20:20,329 --> 00:20:22,029
Regular stroke!
...not me.

511
00:20:22,031 --> 00:20:24,331
You're a good
friend, Peter.

512
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:26,967
But... I don't want
a show either.

513
00:20:27,003 --> 00:20:28,035
You don't?

514
00:20:28,071 --> 00:20:29,170
Of course not.

515
00:20:29,205 --> 00:20:31,072
I mean, look what
the show did to us.

516
00:20:31,107 --> 00:20:33,441
It destroyed the most
important friendship I have.

517
00:20:33,476 --> 00:20:34,708
JOE:
Thanks.

518
00:20:34,744 --> 00:20:36,610
You know what?
Let's end this for good.

519
00:20:36,646 --> 00:20:37,812
How?

520
00:20:37,847 --> 00:20:39,046
The same way Paula Deen

521
00:20:39,082 --> 00:20:41,048
got her cooking show
taken off the air.

522
00:20:41,084 --> 00:20:44,018
By saying the one word
you can't come back from.

523
00:20:44,053 --> 00:20:45,152
What?

524
00:20:45,188 --> 00:20:47,388
Say the word? Right now?

525
00:20:47,423 --> 00:20:49,757
Yeah. Together.

526
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,486
Ready?

527
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:53,054
You bet.
(both inhale)

528
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,857
