Peter, I'm thrilled that you want to spend
so much time with the family.

But we're exhausted.

Maybe we could just sit
and watch some TV together?

- We were.

But now it might be nice to watch
other people have fun or get killed.

- You know, whatever's on.
- Look, Peter. It's your favorite show.

317
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,300
This is a dangerous mission.
And it's likely one of us will be killed.

318

Mr. Spock, Dr. McCoy, and Ensign Rickey.

It's called...

starring Peter Griffin as himself.

Don't you miss TV just a little?

324

characters, the convenient plot turns...

...that bring a character around
at exactly the right moment?

No, I don't want to miss
the all-you-can-eat schnitzel bar.

Come along. I bet you could squeeze
into Lois' lederhosen.
