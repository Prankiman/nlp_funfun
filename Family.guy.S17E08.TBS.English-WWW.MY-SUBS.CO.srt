<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

00:00:04,898 --> 00:00:08,177
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:00:08,187 --> 00:00:11,822

good old-fashioned values</i>

00:00:11,832 --> 00:00:14,825
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:18,195
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:00:18,205 --> 00:00:21,565

11
00:00:37,688 --> 00:00:39,680
Why do you still read the newspaper?

12
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,870
Nobody does that anymore.

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,512
I like to keep up on local news.

14
00:00:42,522 --> 00:00:44,070
Like the police blotter.

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,657
Huh, most of these arrests
are Cleveland.

16
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:48,993
And the arresting officer
is Joe Swanson.

17
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:50,260
Can I help you, sir?

18
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,329
I'm doing my mail route, Joe.

19
00:00:52,339 --> 00:00:54,331
Maybe you'd be more comfortable

20
00:00:54,341 --> 00:00:56,374
talking about it down at the station.

21
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,002
You're right.

22
00:00:58,012 --> 00:00:59,837
It <i>is</i> more comfortable here.

23
00:00:59,847 --> 00:01:01,271
<i>The police station:</i>

24

00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,984
<i>stay for the comfort.</i>

26
00:01:08,322 --> 00:01:10,147
Is that... is that you?

27
00:01:10,157 --> 00:01:13,150
Oh. Yeah. A friend invited me
to this charity ball.

28
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,319
A friend? She's 100!

29
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:17,321
What are you up to?

30
00:01:17,331 --> 00:01:19,256
Nothing. I enjoy her company.

31
00:01:19,266 --> 00:01:21,425
Older women are cultured, worldly.

32
00:01:21,435 --> 00:01:23,761
I've got nothing to be defensive about.

33
00:01:23,771 --> 00:01:25,162
Her husband passed away.

34
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:26,330
She appreciates my friendship.

35
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,765
I'm providing companionship.

36
00:01:27,775 --> 00:01:28,999
Dogs are known for that.

37
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:30,743
I don't like it.

38
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:40,711
Peter, I need you to mow the lawn.

39
00:01:40,721 --> 00:01:42,046
It's out of control.

40
00:01:42,056 --> 00:01:43,213
I can't mow the lawn, Lois.

41
00:01:43,223 --> 00:01:45,315
The Friends of Distinction
are out there,

42
00:01:45,325 --> 00:01:46,884
grazing in the grass.

45

Oh, let me get in on that!

52
00:02:16,523 --> 00:02:18,162
Where'd they go?

53
00:02:21,095 --> 00:02:23,420
Cleveland? You okay in there?

54
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,588
Cleveland!

55
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:26,023
Wha-Wha-What? What?

56
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:28,859
Oh. Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

57
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:31,061
Mmm, that was a good toilet dream

58
00:02:31,071 --> 00:02:33,512
about my neighbor and his lawn.

59
00:02:33,957 --> 00:02:35,866
Peter, I don't care who's grazing.

60
00:02:35,876 --> 00:02:37,267
The lawn looks terrible.

61
00:02:37,277 --> 00:02:38,435
Get out there and mow it.

62
00:02:38,445 --> 00:02:40,871
Why can't Chris mow it? He's old enough.

63
00:02:40,881 --> 00:02:42,439
Look, I'm all for Chris mowing the lawn,

64
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:43,774
but you got to teach him.

65
00:02:43,784 --> 00:02:45,209
Fine, I'll do it tomorrow.

66
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:47,111
After my weekend job as a zookeeper

67
00:02:47,121 --> 00:02:49,480
with very muscular thighs.

68
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,248
"Thigh" there, nice to see you all.

69
00:02:51,258 --> 00:02:54,251
As you can see right here and here,

70
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:56,086
I am qualified to be a zookeeper.

71
00:02:56,096 --> 00:02:57,588
This is my friend Frederick.

72
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:00,023
And I am sure you're all
wondering how much I can squat.

73
00:03:00,033 --> 00:03:02,092
For that answer, you'll have
to go to my Instagram,

74
00:03:02,102 --> 00:03:03,927
YourThighness99.

75
00:03:03,937 --> 00:03:06,263
Now, I'd like to open up
the floor for questions.

76
00:03:06,273 --> 00:03:08,265
- Yes, what food does the bird...
- Not about the bird!

77
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:10,434
Now, who wants to see me jump
over this fence

78
00:03:10,444 --> 00:03:11,902
from a standing start?

79
00:03:11,912 --> 00:03:15,639
Let me scooch these shorts up
a little "thigher."

80
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:17,141
Look out, elephants!

81
00:03:19,507 --> 00:03:22,246
So, everybody happy
they went to the zoo?

82
00:03:22,256 --> 00:03:23,814
No?

83
00:03:23,824 --> 00:03:26,383
Well, that's the zoo.

84
00:03:35,102 --> 00:03:38,162
Is that a diamond-encrusted watch fob?

85
00:03:38,172 --> 00:03:39,930
This? Oh, yeah, I-I've had this.

86
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,633
Nobody's owned one of those
for 80 years!

87
00:03:42,643 --> 00:03:45,135
What are you up to?

88
00:03:45,145 --> 00:03:46,637
You already did this.

89
00:03:46,647 --> 00:03:48,205
I'm not trying to show skepticism.

90
00:03:48,215 --> 00:03:49,740
My head is too heavy!

91
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,374
I heard the doctor whisper
to Lois, "3,000th percentile."

92
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,117
Okay, Chris, now, if you're
gonna learn how to mow a lawn,

93
00:04:00,127 --> 00:04:03,187
the first lesson is that
you always start by 7:00 a.m.,

94
00:04:03,197 --> 00:04:06,356
before everyone wakes up,
including roosters.

95
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:09,459
What the...?

96
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:10,861
Hey, shut up!

97
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:12,029
You shut up!

98
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:14,198
Oh, real original.

99
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,465
Now, to start the mower,

100
00:04:15,475 --> 00:04:17,301
you grab this pull cord like so

101
00:04:17,311 --> 00:04:19,203
and give it a nice hard yank.

102
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:22,668
Can I change my grip?

103
00:04:26,653 --> 00:04:28,378
Wow, much better.

104
00:04:28,388 --> 00:04:30,314
It's a more familiar motion.

105
00:04:30,324 --> 00:04:34,284
For the rest, you can just watch
this how-to video on YouTube.

106
00:04:34,294 --> 00:04:36,386
What's going on, guys? I'm Corey,

107
00:04:36,396 --> 00:04:38,822
here to take your lawn mowing
skills to the next lev.

108
00:04:38,832 --> 00:04:40,991
But, first, make sure
you subscribe to my channel,

109
00:04:41,001 --> 00:04:42,125
Corey's World.

110
00:04:42,135 --> 00:04:44,027
Okay, now let's start that mower.

111
00:04:44,037 --> 00:04:46,196
Did you know
Corey got recruited by ISIS?

112
00:04:46,206 --> 00:04:49,132
He disappeared, and now there's
this guy doing ISIS videos

113
00:04:49,142 --> 00:04:51,068
and they think it's Corey.

114
00:04:51,078 --> 00:04:52,736
Assalamu alaikum, guys!

115
00:04:52,746 --> 00:04:55,172
This is Corey, here to talk
about making a dirty bomb

116
00:04:55,182 --> 00:04:57,434
with stuff you can find in your kitchen.

117
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,253
Great Caesar's ghost!

118
00:05:09,263 --> 00:05:11,521
Chris <i>and</i> a chubby little friend?

119
00:05:11,531 --> 00:05:14,324
It's like in my dream!

120
00:05:14,334 --> 00:05:15,893
Hey there, Chris.

121
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:18,428
You know, I've been looking
for a muscley-armed young fella

122
00:05:18,438 --> 00:05:19,630
to mow my lawn.

123
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,064
Sorry, Mr. Herbert,

124
00:05:21,074 --> 00:05:23,066
but I don't even want to mow this lawn.

125
00:05:23,076 --> 00:05:25,736
You could bring your friend
over there to help you.

126
00:05:25,746 --> 00:05:28,238
Come on, Herbert. Rope this calf.

127
00:05:28,248 --> 00:05:31,241
Would $600 a week change your mind?

128
00:05:31,251 --> 00:05:33,810
Uh, would it? You got a deal!

129
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,013
And I can pay you under the table.

130
00:05:36,023 --> 00:05:38,181
I like to make a little fort
under there.

131
00:05:38,191 --> 00:05:41,184
I call it Fort Dix.

132
00:05:41,194 --> 00:05:42,519
Did you hear that, Dad?

133
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:44,521
He'll pay us $600!

134
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:47,176
Uh, yeah, did-did you not hear
about Fort Dix?

135
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,637
Oh, Admiral, you've been so good
to me these past weeks,

136
00:06:00,647 --> 00:06:02,239
with my husband gone

137
00:06:02,249 --> 00:06:05,142
and me alone to tend
to his massive estate.

138
00:06:05,152 --> 00:06:07,077
You know, helping you
might have been difficult

139
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:09,079
were you not so utterly charming.

140
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:13,083
Oh...

141
00:06:13,093 --> 00:06:15,152
Plus, helping you helps me forget

142
00:06:15,162 --> 00:06:16,253
my own country's troubles

143
00:06:16,263 --> 00:06:18,588
and my struggle to save
our national flower,

144
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:20,157
the <i>Masdevallia</i> orchid.

145
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:22,326
That's my favorite flower.

146
00:06:22,336 --> 00:06:24,428
And pet charity.

147
00:06:24,438 --> 00:06:25,829
Really?

148
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:28,765
I've devoted my life
to raising money to save it.

149
00:06:28,775 --> 00:06:30,100
What a coincidence.

150
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,835
You <i>and</i> the count.

151
00:06:31,845 --> 00:06:34,552
- The count?
- Yes, of Monte Hall.

152
00:06:34,863 --> 00:06:37,140
We like to October in Zurich.

153
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,776
Ah, yes, the best place to October.

154
00:06:39,786 --> 00:06:42,179
The secret, however,
is to October in Zurich

155
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:45,849
but in September, to avoid
the obnoxious Octobering crowds,

156
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:48,285
saving October for Paris...
Novembering there...

157
00:06:48,295 --> 00:06:50,287
Then Decembering in Palm Beach
in November

158
00:06:50,297 --> 00:06:52,122
and, in December, Januarying, of course,

159
00:06:52,132 --> 00:06:53,457
as always, in Gstaad.

160
00:06:53,467 --> 00:06:55,525
We December in London.

161
00:06:55,535 --> 00:06:58,362
You, madame, are a cream-faced loon.

162
00:06:58,372 --> 00:07:01,865
Count, I don't believe
you've met the admiral.

163
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,200
Well, he may be an admiral,

164
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:06,203
but he's certainly not <i>admirable.</i>

165
00:07:06,213 --> 00:07:07,404
Panty drop.

166
00:07:07,414 --> 00:07:08,438
Swoon.

167
00:07:08,448 --> 00:07:09,916
Commercial.

168
00:07:18,018 --> 00:07:21,210
So, Admiral, you must have had
quite the military career.

169
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,852
Your honors are impressive.

170
00:07:22,862 --> 00:07:25,805
Is that medal
a stretched-out carnival penny?

171
00:07:25,815 --> 00:07:27,295
Thank you for noticing, Count.

172
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:29,251
It means a lot from a man whose top hat

173
00:07:29,261 --> 00:07:31,020
looks suspiciously like an Amazon Echo

174
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,421
with a cardboard brim.

175
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:34,990
Why, wha-wha-what a preposterous notion!

176
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,481
- Alexa?
- No, don't say that!

177
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:39,366
What the hell are you doing here?

178
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,397
This is my scam. Now butt out.

179
00:07:41,407 --> 00:07:43,065
Now, why would I do that, Brian?

180
00:07:43,075 --> 00:07:44,466
These old bags are going to die.

181
00:07:44,476 --> 00:07:46,568
Someone's going to end up
with their money.

182
00:07:46,578 --> 00:07:47,770
Look, all right,

183
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,271
there's no reason
to sabotage each other.

184
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:52,041
There's plenty of Newport
heiresses for the both of us.

185
00:07:52,051 --> 00:07:54,043
Maybe we could even help each other.

186
00:07:54,053 --> 00:07:55,144
Exactly.

187
00:07:55,154 --> 00:07:57,146
Two con men like us working together?

188
00:07:57,156 --> 00:07:58,185
We'll be set.

189
00:07:58,195 --> 00:08:00,582
Like a passive-aggressive alarm clock.

190
00:08:00,592 --> 00:08:02,918
Uh, I don't know if you've noticed,

191
00:08:02,928 --> 00:08:04,687
but the sun's been up
for, like, an hour.

192
00:08:04,697 --> 00:08:06,555
No, no, no, no,
you don't have to get up.

193
00:08:06,565 --> 00:08:07,956
Let your wife do everything.

194
00:08:07,966 --> 00:08:10,125
Just keep sleeping.
You're a good husband.

195
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:12,628
I'm sure she doesn't fantasize
about your contractor,

196
00:08:12,638 --> 00:08:14,897
who's already downstairs working on...

197
00:08:14,907 --> 00:08:17,466
Well, I can't really figure out
what he's working on.

198
00:08:17,476 --> 00:08:19,815
OH, I KNOW: your wife.

199
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:25,383
Hey there, Chris!

200
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:27,042
And what's your pal's name??

201
00:08:27,052 --> 00:08:28,073
I'm Peter, sir.!

202
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,612
You're big for your age,
ain't ya, Petey?

203
00:08:30,622 --> 00:08:33,882
Yeah. Doctor says I eat too much candy.

204
00:08:33,892 --> 00:08:35,651
Ain't no shame in being chubby.

205
00:08:35,661 --> 00:08:37,152
You're a growing boy.

206
00:08:37,162 --> 00:08:39,088
Why, what's this?

207
00:08:39,098 --> 00:08:41,323
Wow! How'd you do that?

208
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,558
It wasn't a trick.

209
00:08:42,568 --> 00:08:43,992
It was stuck to your neck.

210
00:08:44,002 --> 00:08:46,891
Oh, yeah. Sometimes
I fall asleep on candy.

211
00:08:53,812 --> 00:08:55,370
There she is.

212
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,774
The wealthiest heiress
in all of Newport.

213
00:08:58,784 --> 00:09:01,343
- The Holy Grail for guys like us.
- Who is she?

258
00:10:33,436 --> 00:10:34,691
She goes by "Pip."

259
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:36,104
- Pip?
- Pip.

260
00:10:36,114 --> 00:10:38,407
Been trying to schmooze her for months.

261
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:40,409
The only catch is
her 95-year-old husband

262
00:10:40,419 --> 00:10:42,544
is still hanging on by a thread.

263
00:10:42,554 --> 00:10:44,213
I can't make a move until he dies,

264
00:10:44,223 --> 00:10:45,714
which, hopefully, is any day now.

265
00:10:45,724 --> 00:10:48,283
If we can charm her,
we'll be set for life.

266
00:10:48,293 --> 00:10:50,118
No more scraping and scavenging,

267
00:10:50,128 --> 00:10:51,954
like a laughing hyena.

268
00:10:51,964 --> 00:10:53,956
I don't sound desperate,

269
00:10:53,966 --> 00:10:55,624
but I'm very desperate.

270
00:10:55,634 --> 00:10:58,994
I'm not a very capable predator.

271
00:10:59,004 --> 00:11:03,098
My family's back
at the den waiting for me.

272
00:11:03,108 --> 00:11:06,702
I think this
is the day I starve to death.

273
00:11:06,712 --> 00:11:09,972
Just kidding, I have no family.

274
00:11:09,982 --> 00:11:13,542
But I'm a very involved uncle.

275
00:11:20,092 --> 00:11:23,185
Dad, shouldn't we attach a bag
to the mower?

276
00:11:23,195 --> 00:11:25,020
That's too much work.
Just mow with the blower

277
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,465
always pointed toward Joe's lawn.

278
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,363
Hey, will you put a bag on that thing?

279
00:11:34,373 --> 00:11:37,032
Just poop into your hand if you have to.

280
00:11:37,042 --> 00:11:38,914
I'll be down in a minute.

281
00:11:39,816 --> 00:11:44,172
Hey, boys. I've got some cookies
and special grape juice for you.

282
00:11:44,182 --> 00:11:46,141
Come on and get it, Petey.

283
00:11:46,151 --> 00:11:47,985
Sweet.

284
00:11:50,022 --> 00:11:53,048
But, Mr. Herbert,
you always made the cookies

285
00:11:53,058 --> 00:11:55,817
with the large pill
in the center for me.

286
00:11:55,827 --> 00:11:58,887
Sorry, Chris. He just got to them first.

287
00:11:58,897 --> 00:12:01,153
I thought <i>I</i> was your favorite.

288
00:12:08,974 --> 00:12:12,200
<i>You mustn't think you've failed me</i>

289
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:15,837
<i>Just because there's someone else</i>

290
00:12:15,847 --> 00:12:19,141
<i>You were the first real love</i>

291
00:12:19,151 --> 00:12:22,253
<i>I ever had</i>

292
00:12:24,256 --> 00:12:27,249
<i>And all the things I ever said</i>

293
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:30,886
<i>I swear they still are true</i>

294
00:12:30,896 --> 00:12:33,255
<i>For no one else</i>

295
00:12:33,265 --> 00:12:36,191
<i>Can have the part of me</i>

296
00:12:36,201 --> 00:12:40,595
<i>I gave to you</i>

297
00:12:40,605 --> 00:12:45,000
<i>Torn between two lovers</i>

298
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:48,737
<i>Feeling like a fool</i>

299
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:52,007
<i>Loving both of you</i>

300
00:12:52,017 --> 00:12:55,777
<i>Is breaking all the rules</i>

301
00:12:55,787 --> 00:13:00,248
<i>Torn between two lovers</i>

302
00:13:00,258 --> 00:13:03,418
<i>Feeling like a fool</i>

303
00:13:03,428 --> 00:13:08,466
<i>Loving you both
is breaking all the rules.</i>

304
00:13:12,437 --> 00:13:14,963
All right, now let's kick it up a notch.

305
00:13:14,973 --> 00:13:17,666
<i>Come on, shake your body,
baby, do that conga</i>

306
00:13:17,676 --> 00:13:19,901
<i>You know you can't
control yourself any longer.</i>

307
00:13:28,353 --> 00:13:29,644
There she is.

308
00:13:29,654 --> 00:13:31,480
We just got to wait
for our chance to move in.

309
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,015
Brian, look.

310
00:13:38,864 --> 00:13:40,989
You think this might be... the end?

311
00:13:40,999 --> 00:13:43,000
I don't know, but now's our chance.

312
00:13:46,238 --> 00:13:48,139
I hate myself for doing this.

313
00:13:50,767 --> 00:13:54,503
Is that a Cats Protective League
pin on your lapel?

314
00:13:54,513 --> 00:13:56,138
Why, yes.

315
00:13:56,148 --> 00:13:58,440
It's my favorite charity.

316
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,175
I love cats.

317
00:14:00,185 --> 00:14:03,145
I've devoted my life to helping them.

318
00:14:03,155 --> 00:14:04,946
I like this party.

319
00:14:04,956 --> 00:14:06,648
Pussies.

320
00:14:06,658 --> 00:14:08,109
- Cock.
- Cock.

321
00:14:08,504 --> 00:14:12,187
I'm sorry, gentlemen,
but my husband is feeling ill

322
00:14:12,197 --> 00:14:14,189
and stepped into the men's locker room.

323
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:16,992
Would you be so kind as to check on him?

324
00:14:17,002 --> 00:14:19,039
Well, I'm not sure if we'll be able
to find him.

325
00:14:19,049 --> 00:14:20,731
Don't worry. I've got a very thick,

326
00:14:20,741 --> 00:14:23,434
yellow toenail finder app on my phone.

327
00:14:27,145 --> 00:14:30,138
Ew. Ew. Ew. Ew. Ew.

328
00:14:30,148 --> 00:14:32,107
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.

329
00:14:32,117 --> 00:14:33,834
Ew!

330
00:14:33,844 --> 00:14:34,969
Got him.

331
00:14:36,165 --> 00:14:37,571
Do you think he's dead?

332
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:41,850
Get the hell out of my face, Brian.

333
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,218
Wha... Quagmire?

334
00:14:43,228 --> 00:14:45,353
No. Quagmire!

335
00:14:45,363 --> 00:14:47,556
- That's what I said.
- Oh. Oh, sorry.

336
00:14:47,566 --> 00:14:49,724
I didn't, I didn't hear you
'cause of the prosthetics.

337
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:52,060
Hey, just checking to see
if the old man is dead.

338
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,262
Oh, hey, guys.

339
00:14:53,272 --> 00:14:55,172
Geez, how many of us are doing this con?

340
00:14:55,173 --> 00:14:58,166
I've got no chance, have I?
A tertiary character like me.

341
00:14:58,176 --> 00:15:00,802
You most certainly do not.
I don't even think

342
00:15:00,812 --> 00:15:02,504
we're going to give you
the dance you rehearsed.

343
00:15:12,268 --> 00:15:14,760
- <i>You're</i> Margaret's husband?
- That's right.

344
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,595
Listen, rookie,
you're out of your league.

345
00:15:16,605 --> 00:15:19,331
You think you know how to bang
a woman who's seen a dodo bird?

346
00:15:19,341 --> 00:15:20,933
Wait, but how can you be married?

347
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:22,368
You don't even live together.

348
00:15:22,378 --> 00:15:24,303
She's old. She says,
"You weren't here yesterday."

349
00:15:24,313 --> 00:15:26,305
I say, "Yes, I was." And that's it.

350
00:15:26,315 --> 00:15:29,041
Well, you've clearly invested
a lot of time into this.

351
00:15:29,051 --> 00:15:31,810
And yet two fellows like us
with loose lips

352
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,746
could cause it all to fall apart.

353
00:15:33,756 --> 00:15:35,481
- Who's this trombone?
- I'm the guy

354
00:15:35,491 --> 00:15:38,784
who enjoyed like hell
shopping for this little ruse.

355
00:15:38,794 --> 00:15:41,487
Look, there's plenty
of money to go around,

356
00:15:41,497 --> 00:15:43,289
and I don't know how much more
of this I can take,

357
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:44,890
so I'll make a deal with you guys.

358
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,925
If you can help me "wrap this up,"

359
00:15:46,935 --> 00:15:49,128
if you know what I mean...
Take her skydiving,

360
00:15:49,138 --> 00:15:52,097
something that might, you know,
overwhelm her elderly heart...

361
00:15:52,107 --> 00:15:53,799
I'll split the estate with you two.

362
00:15:53,809 --> 00:15:56,044
But unless you're prepared
to kill her, get the hell out.

363
00:15:57,146 --> 00:15:59,171
All right, I got to run.
It's her birthday.

364
00:15:59,181 --> 00:16:00,839
Happy birthday

Petey, let's play horsey.

390

That's it!

391
00:17:17,259 --> 00:17:21,854
It's time you do all the work
and I goof off with Mr. Herbert.

392
00:17:21,864 --> 00:17:23,422
Like hell it is.

393
00:17:30,305 --> 00:17:33,399
Jesse, is this really happening?

394
00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:35,701
You're going down, old man.

395
00:17:35,711 --> 00:17:38,036
 I ain't the one going down.
<i>You're</i> going down.

396
00:17:38,046 --> 00:17:40,572
No way. I'm gonna pound your ass!

397
00:17:40,582 --> 00:17:43,442
You're seeming kind of cocky,.

398
00:17:43,452 --> 00:17:45,043
Boo, cocky!

399
00:17:45,053 --> 00:17:47,012
Oh!

400
00:17:52,361 --> 00:17:55,154
Why are you being such a jerk, Dad?

401
00:17:55,164 --> 00:17:57,689
D-D-D-D-D-Dad?

402
00:17:57,699 --> 00:18:00,192
Yeah, this is my dad.

403
00:18:05,707 --> 00:18:09,368
Well, he often said he wanted
to explode all over me.

404
00:18:09,378 --> 00:18:11,069
He finally did.

405
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:12,905
Sorry I got jealous, Dad.

406
00:18:12,915 --> 00:18:14,773
That's all right, Chris.

407
00:18:14,783 --> 00:18:17,276
Hey, did you get a little
aroused when we were wrestling?

408
00:18:17,286 --> 00:18:19,253
- No.
- Me, neither.

409
00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:31,423
I am Herbert!

410
00:18:33,435 --> 00:18:35,461
I am Herbert.

411
00:18:35,471 --> 00:18:38,573
I am Herbert. I am Herbert.

412
00:18:42,878 --> 00:18:44,169
Good Quahog, evening.

413
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:46,171
Uh, let's, uh, let's do that again.

414
00:18:46,181 --> 00:18:49,154
Good evening, Hog-quo,
I'm Tucker Tom. Nope.

418
00:18:57,793 --> 00:19:00,352
Newport's wealthiest heiress,
Margaret Woolworth...

419
00:19:00,362 --> 00:19:02,120
Holy God, I'm not reading all that...

420
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:05,457
Was found dead in her home
of an apparent heart attack.

421
00:19:05,467 --> 00:19:07,793
- Did you...?
- No. Did you?

422
00:19:07,803 --> 00:19:10,529
No. You think Quagmire did?

423
00:19:13,742 --> 00:19:16,301
You, uh... you guys actually did it.

424
00:19:16,311 --> 00:19:18,971
And made it look like a heart attack.

425
00:19:18,981 --> 00:19:21,173
Wow. I, uh...

426
00:19:21,183 --> 00:19:22,941
I didn't think you had it in you.

427
00:19:22,951 --> 00:19:25,711
I... I guess you thought wrong.

428
00:19:25,721 --> 00:19:28,347
Listen, I-I know there's been
some bad blood between us,

429
00:19:28,357 --> 00:19:30,182
but I-I promise, it won't happen again.

430
00:19:30,192 --> 00:19:31,717
I hope you can forgive me.

431
00:19:31,727 --> 00:19:34,620
Well... just watch your step.

432
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,154
Well, a deal's a deal,

433
00:19:36,164 --> 00:19:38,257
so here's your share of the estate.

434
00:19:38,267 --> 00:19:40,268
Just sign here.

435
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:45,898
- We're rich!
- We're rich!

436
00:19:48,443 --> 00:19:50,035
We're rich, Stewie.

437
00:19:50,045 --> 00:19:52,704
And no flip joke can take that away.

438
00:19:52,714 --> 00:19:55,707
Gentlemen,
due to a disastrous investment

439
00:19:55,717 --> 00:19:58,310
in a <i>Mindy Project amusement park,</i>

440
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,479
Miss Woolworth etcetera, etcetera,

441
00:20:00,489 --> 00:20:03,482
died owing $18 million,

442
00:20:03,492 --> 00:20:05,851
for which you are now liable.

443
00:20:05,861 --> 00:20:07,252
We owe money?

444
00:20:07,262 --> 00:20:09,187
Look, Stewie, it-it could be worse.

445
00:20:09,197 --> 00:20:10,789
We could be dead, like Margaret.

446
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,724
You're right. Poor thing.

447
00:20:12,734 --> 00:20:16,070
I guess she just died of natural causes.

448
00:20:19,274 --> 00:20:21,233
What a couple of rubes.

449
00:20:21,243 --> 00:20:24,570
I'm finally out
from under that crushing debt.

450
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,582
I suppose I don't need this anymore.

451
00:20:29,084 --> 00:20:32,298
Yes, that's right. It was a Meg story.

452
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:45,664
<i>Come on, shake your body,
baby, do the conga</i>

453
00:20:45,674 --> 00:20:47,733
<i>I know you can't control
yourself any longer</i>

454
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,368
<i>Feel the rhythm of the music
getting stronger</i>

455
00:20:49,378 --> 00:20:50,903
<i>Don't you fight it
till you've tried it</i>

456
00:20:50,913 --> 00:20:52,171
<i>Do the conga beat</i>

457
00:20:52,181 --> 00:20:55,941
<i>Everybody, gather 'round now</i>

458
00:20:55,951 --> 00:20:58,586
<i>Let your body feel the heat...</i>

459
00:20:59,548 --> 00:21:03,049
