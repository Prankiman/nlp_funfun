ANNOUNCER: We now return
to<i> Hard Knocks CFL:</i>

13
00:00:35,588 --> 00:00:38,122
<i>Training Camp</i>
<i>with the Toronto Argonauts.</i>

14
00:00:38,157 --> 00:00:39,289
I hope you make it.

15
00:00:39,325 --> 00:00:40,457
You're real good.

16
00:00:40,493 --> 00:00:41,959
No way, not as
good as you.

17
00:00:41,994 --> 00:00:43,127
I hope you make it.

18
00:00:43,162 --> 00:00:44,795
What're you gonna do
with all your money?

19
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:45,963
Oh, probably
just save it.

20
00:00:45,998 --> 00:00:47,464
Yeah, that's
real smart.

21
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,366
Well, back
to my book.

22
00:00:49,401 --> 00:00:51,535
Peter, I was at the park
with Stewie,

23
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,537
and someone stole
his tricycle.

24
00:00:53,572 --> 00:00:55,038
And during, like,
the one second

25
00:00:55,074 --> 00:00:57,307
I was looking down at my phone
and not at him.

26
00:00:57,343 --> 00:00:58,742
Stupid thief.

27
00:00:58,777 --> 00:01:01,145
It's got a vanity plate
that won't even apply to him.

28
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,312
Hey.

29
00:01:02,348 --> 00:01:04,314
You like your reggae
watered down

30
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,649
and acceptable
at a wedding?

31
00:01:05,684 --> 00:01:07,151
Hop on.

32
00:01:07,186 --> 00:01:09,820
Ugh, can't believe somebody
stole Stewie's trike.

33
00:01:09,855 --> 00:01:11,989
I only had nine payments
left on that thing.

34
00:01:12,024 --> 00:01:13,323
How much do you make?

35
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:15,325
Don't worry, Lois, I'm
gonna find that tricycle.

36
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:18,495
I'll just have four to five
beers to stop the shaking,

37
00:01:18,531 --> 00:01:20,097
and then I'll
go outside.

38
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,104
Huh, never seen that kid
around the neighborhood.

39
00:01:27,139 --> 00:01:28,872
Maybe he's got something
to do with it.

40
00:01:28,908 --> 00:01:30,374
Hey, kid.

41
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:31,729
You know anything
about a tricycle

42
00:01:31,744 --> 00:01:33,210
that just got stolen
from the park?

43
00:01:33,245 --> 00:01:34,545
No, sir, I've been
sitting here

44
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,547
for the last three hours
selling lemonade.

45
00:01:36,582 --> 00:01:38,048
Would you like
an ice-cold glass?

46
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:40,884
Why, sure.

47
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,053
You couldn't have been here
for three hours on this,

48
00:01:43,088 --> 00:01:44,388
the hottest day
of the year,

49
00:01:44,423 --> 00:01:46,557
or the ice cubes in your
pitcher would have melted.

50
00:01:46,592 --> 00:01:47,624
Ow...

51
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,060
You have the right
to remain silent.

52
00:01:49,094 --> 00:01:50,094
Anything you say...

53
00:01:50,095 --> 00:01:51,562
Peter, Peter! We
can't arrest him.

54
00:01:51,597 --> 00:01:52,896
If anything, they
can arrest you.

55
00:01:52,932 --> 00:01:54,898
Hey, here's
the tricycle.

56
00:01:54,934 --> 00:01:56,400
You were right,
Peter.

57
00:01:56,435 --> 00:01:57,734
This kid's a thief.

58
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:58,770
We did it!

59
00:01:58,771 --> 00:01:59,903
Wow, look at us.

60
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:01,905
Hey, you know,
we make a great team, guys.

61
00:02:01,941 --> 00:02:03,574
Like Huey Lewis
and the Jews.

62
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:05,576
♪ We don't
need money... ♪

63
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:07,277
Sorry, the band's
breaking up.

64
00:02:09,982 --> 00:02:11,615
Here you go, Stewie.

65
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,950
Don't bother sniffing
the seat.

66
00:02:12,985 --> 00:02:14,318
It don't smell
like nothing.

67
00:02:14,353 --> 00:02:15,485
Oh, yeah, my trike.

68
00:02:15,521 --> 00:02:16,987
Eh, I'm kind of
over that thing.

69
00:02:17,022 --> 00:02:20,991
Now I'm way into wooden
beads you move along wires.

70
00:02:21,026 --> 00:02:22,326
Whoa...

71
00:02:22,361 --> 00:02:24,494
Oh, yeah...

72
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,830
Boy, when you find
a baby's tricycle,

73
00:02:26,865 --> 00:02:28,665
it feels like there's
nothing you can't do.

74
00:02:28,701 --> 00:02:30,334
Man, I wish we
could quit our jobs

75
00:02:30,369 --> 00:02:32,669
and solve children's
crimes full-time.

76
00:02:32,705 --> 00:02:34,671
I heard you guys are
good at solving cases.

77
00:02:34,707 --> 00:02:37,507
I'll give you 50 cents to
find my lucky baseball card.

78
00:02:37,543 --> 00:02:39,676
Guys, we're
in business.

79
00:02:39,712 --> 00:02:41,111
(celebrating)

80
00:02:41,146 --> 00:02:43,780
Oh, wait a minute, I didn't
notice you have a pierced ear.

81
00:02:43,816 --> 00:02:44,948
We can't help you.

82
00:02:44,984 --> 00:02:46,450
You go home
and tell your mother

83
00:02:46,485 --> 00:02:48,685
she's supposed to be
a parent, not a friend.

84
00:02:53,392 --> 00:02:55,192
All right, guys, this'll be
the headquarters

85
00:02:55,227 --> 00:02:57,194
for our new
detective agency.

86
00:02:57,229 --> 00:02:59,129
This milk crate
will be my chair,

87
00:02:59,164 --> 00:03:01,331
this overturned rain barrel
will be my desk,

88
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:03,166
and this DNA evidence
centrifuge

89
00:03:03,202 --> 00:03:05,636
and fingerprint scanner
will be my coatrack.

90
00:03:05,671 --> 00:03:07,638
Piece of junk.

91
00:03:07,673 --> 00:03:10,641
I guess all our detective
agency needs now is a name.

92
00:03:10,676 --> 00:03:13,310
Well, we're detectives
solving children's crimes.

93
00:03:13,345 --> 00:03:14,978
There's only one name
that makes sense.

94
00:03:15,014 --> 00:03:16,647
"Dicks for Kids"?
"Dicks for Kids."

95
00:03:16,682 --> 00:03:18,982
But wait, we want people
to know<i> we're</i> grown-ups.

96
00:03:19,018 --> 00:03:20,651
Okay, "Big Dicks
For Kids."

97
00:03:20,686 --> 00:03:22,319
But we don't want
to sound too old.

98
00:03:22,354 --> 00:03:24,821
They're gonna think we're a
bunch of old, bald geezers.

99
00:03:24,857 --> 00:03:26,323
"Big Hairy Dicks
for Kids."

100
00:03:26,358 --> 00:03:29,326
How are we gonna let them
know we're "veiny"?

101
00:03:31,797 --> 00:03:34,097
So, you say this gumball machine
took your dime

102
00:03:34,133 --> 00:03:35,432
and didn't give you
a gumball?

103
00:03:35,467 --> 00:03:36,467
That's right.

104
00:03:36,468 --> 00:03:37,768
Well, I'll take care
of that.

105
00:03:37,803 --> 00:03:39,770
Hand over the dime, buddy.

106
00:03:39,805 --> 00:03:40,937
Come on, hand it over.

107
00:03:40,973 --> 00:03:42,272
Don't make this
hard on yourself.

108
00:03:42,308 --> 00:03:43,607
Wait a minute.

109
00:03:43,642 --> 00:03:45,742
This gumball machine
takes quarters, not dimes.

110
00:03:45,778 --> 00:03:47,077
(siren wails)

111
00:03:47,112 --> 00:03:48,412
Holy crap, it's a setup.

112
00:03:48,447 --> 00:03:49,946
Time to make a quick getaway.

113
00:03:56,755 --> 00:03:58,221
You were set up,
too, huh?

114
00:03:58,257 --> 00:03:59,556
Yeah.

115
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:03,727
You realize that kid is plowing
both our wives right now.

116
00:04:05,764 --> 00:04:07,097
So what do we got
today, boys?

117
00:04:07,132 --> 00:04:09,466
Well, it seems like we got
a bit of a crime spree.

118
00:04:09,501 --> 00:04:11,468
Just this morning,
we've had multiple reports

119
00:04:11,503 --> 00:04:12,803
of stolen items.

120
00:04:12,838 --> 00:04:16,473
Uh, couple marbles, ball
of yarn, two Wiffle ball bats.

121
00:04:16,508 --> 00:04:20,877
Someday a rain'll come and wash
all this scum off the streets.

122
00:04:20,913 --> 00:04:23,380
Guys, I think I've got a
lead on all these thefts.

123
00:04:23,415 --> 00:04:26,049
One of the kids had
a nanny-cam hidden in his room.

124
00:04:28,921 --> 00:04:31,888
Come on, let's do it
on your son's tiny bed.

125
00:04:31,924 --> 00:04:33,757
Hurry, he gets home
at 3:00.

126
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:35,092
Okay, it's later than this.

127
00:04:35,127 --> 00:04:36,927
Y-Yeah,
f-fast-forward ahead.

128
00:04:36,962 --> 00:04:37,962
Forward. Forward.

129
00:04:37,963 --> 00:04:38,963
Keep forwarding.

130
00:04:38,964 --> 00:04:40,263
Is that woman
gonna be okay?

131
00:04:40,299 --> 00:04:41,299
Yeah, yeah, she's fine.

132
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,766
We're having brunch
after this.

133
00:04:42,801 --> 00:04:45,102
God, I look huge
in that bed, don't I?

134
00:04:45,137 --> 00:04:46,770
You think other
guys hang out

135
00:04:46,805 --> 00:04:49,773
and watch their friend's
naked gyrating butt?

136
00:04:49,808 --> 00:04:52,776
It's been so long, I don't
know what other friends do.

137
00:04:52,811 --> 00:04:54,778
Forwarding, forwarding,
forwarding...

138
00:04:54,813 --> 00:04:55,946
And there we go.

139
00:04:55,981 --> 00:04:57,013
Our thief.

140
00:05:00,486 --> 00:05:01,618
(gasps)

141
00:05:01,653 --> 00:05:03,954
Chris Gaines was Garth Brooks.

142
00:05:03,989 --> 00:05:05,789
I just figured that out.

143
00:05:08,327 --> 00:05:10,994
Oh, my God, Chris stole
all that stuff.

144
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:12,496
No way,
he wouldn't do that.

145
00:05:12,531 --> 00:05:13,830
Peter, Chris is
on the tape.

146
00:05:13,866 --> 00:05:15,165
We got to search
his bedroom.

147
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,500
Fine, go ahead.

148
00:05:16,535 --> 00:05:19,002
But I'm telling you, it's gonna
be a bigger waste of time

149
00:05:19,037 --> 00:05:21,138
than writing tough-guy dialogue
for a Jet Li movie.

150
00:05:24,309 --> 00:05:25,842
(grunting)

151
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,445
(grunting, bone cracking)

152
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:33,049
This is your
last warning.

153
00:05:33,085 --> 00:05:34,384
Give me back my wife.

154
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,052
What? Excuse me?

155
00:05:36,088 --> 00:05:38,555
Give me back my wife, or
you're in a lot of trouble.

156
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,723
I'll kick all
your faces.

You got me?

158
00:05:40,926 --> 00:05:42,893
You're kind of undoing
everything you just did

159
00:05:42,928 --> 00:05:44,060
when you kicked
my ass.

160
00:05:44,096 --> 00:05:46,630
I know, but I have
to say for audience.

161
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:56,473
Chris still has
an Aaron Hernandez poster up?

162
00:05:56,508 --> 00:05:58,041
That's not cool.

163
00:05:59,945 --> 00:06:01,411
See, there's nothing here.

164
00:06:01,447 --> 00:06:03,246
Just a weird life-sized
lady doll

165
00:06:03,282 --> 00:06:05,182
made out of all the stuff
that got stolen.

No!

Don't hurt Heather.

168
00:06:10,456 --> 00:06:11,755
Don't hurt my girlfriend.

Chris made
a sex doll?!

a walk-in closet?

with that disgusting
homemade sex doll.

He actually thinks
it's his girlfriend.

Why?!

194
00:08:14,107 --> 00:08:17,208
Okay, Peter, I got to take
the kids to school now.

Hey, Chris,

196
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:25,016
your mother wanted me
to talk to you.

Um, she doesn't think
it's healthy for you

to be spending all your time
with a homemade sex doll.

00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:30,389
Sex doll?

200
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,689
I wish.

201
00:08:31,725 --> 00:08:33,691
Heather hasn't even let
me get to second base.

202
00:08:33,727 --> 00:08:34,859
Wh... H-Hang on.

203
00:08:34,894 --> 00:08:36,194
What's second base?

204
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:38,029
Is that touching
one of the cabbages?

205
00:08:38,064 --> 00:08:39,530
Yeah.

206
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:42,700
(groans) But I'm such a loser,
she'll never let me do that.

207
00:08:42,736 --> 00:08:44,869
Come on, Chris,
don't sell yourself short.

208
00:08:44,904 --> 00:08:47,305
You are every bit as good
as that bag of garbage.

209
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,473
You really think so?

210
00:08:48,508 --> 00:08:49,807
Sure, I do.

211
00:08:49,843 --> 00:08:52,477
And look, if you really want
to learn how to bang that thing,

00:13:24,945 --> 00:13:27,846
Oh. Well, tomorrow, Heather
and I are going to the park

316
00:13:27,882 --> 00:13:29,515
to picnic and fly kites.

317
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,783
And on Saturday,
she's hosting her book club,

318
00:13:31,819 --> 00:13:33,819
so I have to drop by,
say something funny,

319
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,787
and then stay upstairs.

320
00:13:35,823 --> 00:13:38,624
Wow, your plans sound
very sweet and romantic, Chris.

321
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:41,026
And how a man
should treat his woman.

322
00:13:41,061 --> 00:13:42,581
Oh, Lois, your breath
smells like eggs.

323
00:13:42,596 --> 00:13:45,464
Talk that way.

324
00:13:45,499 --> 00:13:47,633
Chris, when you go on your
picnic tomorrow,

325
00:13:47,668 --> 00:13:50,402
c-can your father
and I come with you?

326
00:13:50,437 --> 00:13:52,471
Let me just ask Heather.

327
00:13:52,506 --> 00:13:54,773
I know, but I think we better.

328
00:13:54,808 --> 00:13:57,075
Apparently the cancer's
already in his bones.

329
00:13:57,111 --> 00:13:59,578
What?
We'd love to, sounds great!

330
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,080
What are you doing?
You can't let him

331
00:14:02,116 --> 00:14:03,849
keep thinking
that doll is real.

332
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,285
I know. But I just
want Peter to see

333
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,320
what a thoughtful man looks
like for one afternoon.

334
00:14:08,322 --> 00:14:10,789
Maybe he'll learn something.

335
00:14:10,824 --> 00:14:12,057
Are you sure about this?

336
00:14:12,092 --> 00:14:13,492
It seems pretty extreme.

337
00:14:13,527 --> 00:14:15,060
Well, I got to try something.

338
00:14:15,095 --> 00:14:16,762
Peter and I used
to be so close.

339
00:14:16,797 --> 00:14:19,364
But now we're like
apples and oranges.

340
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,934
People say we're different, but
we're really not that different.

341
00:14:21,969 --> 00:14:23,769
Mm-hmm, yeah, we
both work in marketing.

342
00:14:23,804 --> 00:14:25,204
We've both lost children.

343
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,306
We both own cars, but
we like to take the bus.

344
00:14:27,341 --> 00:14:29,074
And we both cheat
at Words With Friends.

345
00:14:29,109 --> 00:14:30,409
Oh, nice try!

346
00:14:30,444 --> 00:14:31,577
I certainly do not!

347
00:14:31,612 --> 00:14:33,478
And we're both gonna
have a moderate time

348
00:14:33,514 --> 00:14:34,813
at the party tonight.

349
00:14:34,848 --> 00:14:36,548
And we're not gonna count
each other's drinks.

350
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,985
We won't have to
because we won't be drinking.

351
00:14:44,024 --> 00:14:47,492
Wow, it sure is fun going
on a picnic, isn't it, Peter?

352
00:14:47,528 --> 00:14:48,827
Yeah. Will you hold
this beer bottle

353
00:14:48,862 --> 00:14:51,163
while I try to kick
the top off it?

354
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:52,264
Ow! Damn it!

355
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:53,732
You moved it.

Close your eyes, Heather.

366
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:27,866
I've got a surprise for you.

367
00:15:27,901 --> 00:15:30,969
None of your business
how much it was.

368
00:15:31,005 --> 00:15:32,504
He bought her a scarf.

369
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:34,339
And it actually goes well
with her colors.

370
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,541
Peter, don't you see
what's going on here?!

371
00:15:36,577 --> 00:15:38,477
Your son's relationship
with that doll

372
00:15:38,512 --> 00:15:40,445
is better than our own marriage!

373
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,281
Peter?

374
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:45,584
Hey, can me and Ramon
go ride shirtless bikes?

375
00:15:45,619 --> 00:15:46,952
(sighs)

376
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,598
(hinges creaking)

377
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,676
(screams)

378
00:16:10,711 --> 00:16:12,377
My morning scream.

379
00:16:12,413 --> 00:16:13,645
(sighs)

380
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,846
(screams)

381
00:16:14,882 --> 00:16:16,815
Heather's gone!

382
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,717
Mom! Heather's disappeared!

383
00:16:18,752 --> 00:16:20,085
Have you seen her?!

384
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,720
No, I haven't, sweetheart.

385
00:16:21,755 --> 00:16:22,921
B-But you know what?

386
00:16:22,956 --> 00:16:25,657
Sometimes relationships
run their course

387
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,626
and come to a natural end.

388
00:16:27,661 --> 00:16:30,429
This could be a sign
that it's time to move on.

389
00:16:30,464 --> 00:16:32,964
Aw, and I just helped him
pick out that scarf.

390
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,599
I miss her so much.

391
00:16:34,635 --> 00:16:35,934
I know, honey.

392
00:16:35,969 --> 00:16:37,736
But if you give it
a little time,

393
00:16:37,771 --> 00:16:39,404
I'm sure you'll get over her.

394
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,874
Just like you got over your
Hamster Dance Tourette Syndrome.

395
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,776
Excuse me, Mom,
could you please pass the...

00:16:53,687 --> 00:16:56,521

but it's fun.

401
00:17:00,427 --> 00:17:02,427
(crying)

402
00:17:05,933 --> 00:17:07,332
Hey, Chris.

403
00:17:07,368 --> 00:17:08,867
I-I see you're sad.

404
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,569
And also sitting
on the remote.

405
00:17:10,604 --> 00:17:13,071
Why did Heather leave me?!

406
00:17:13,107 --> 00:17:15,741
I don't know, but sometimes
when life's got you down,

407
00:17:15,776 --> 00:17:18,009
you-you got to stand
up for a second.

408
00:17:18,045 --> 00:17:19,344
Like-like, just for a second.

409
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,947
I've never felt this sad!

410
00:17:21,982 --> 00:17:24,683
Aw, looks like somebody
could use a hug.

411
00:17:24,718 --> 00:17:26,718
(crying)

412
00:17:30,124 --> 00:17:31,256
Here we go.

413
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,691
Oh, no, I hit input!

414
00:17:32,726 --> 00:17:34,426
Oh, no! Oh, God!

415
00:17:34,461 --> 00:17:35,794
We may have to throw
away the television.

416
00:17:35,829 --> 00:17:37,729
What should I do, Dad?

417
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,297
I don't know. Hey, where's
that girlfriend of yours?

418
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,299
She seems cool.

419
00:17:41,335 --> 00:17:42,801
(crying)

420
00:17:43,871 --> 00:17:45,237
(crying)

421
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:49,007
This day has Haagen-Dazs
written all over it.

422
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,944
(crying)

423
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,379
Boy, he's really upset.

424
00:17:54,415 --> 00:17:55,680
(groans) I can't
deal with anything

425
00:17:55,716 --> 00:17:57,249
until I've had my
after-nap coffee.

426
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,918
(slurping)

427
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:02,687
I don't think guys should have
two hands on a coffee mug ever.

428
00:18:02,723 --> 00:18:04,723
What?

429
00:18:04,758 --> 00:18:06,391
Mmm, oh, yummy.

430
00:18:06,427 --> 00:18:07,726
Don't do that, either.

431
00:18:07,761 --> 00:18:09,895
J-Just-just don't do anything.

432
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,434
(sighs)

433
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,769
Hey, Chris.

434
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,272
I see you turned your hat around
so you can really get in there.

435
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,307
Oh, what do you care?

436
00:18:22,342 --> 00:18:24,342
What does anybody care?

437
00:18:24,378 --> 00:18:25,710
Why don't you come with me?

438
00:18:25,746 --> 00:18:27,612
I-I've got something
to show you.

439
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,581
If it's the shot from<i> Psycho</i>
where you can see

440
00:18:29,616 --> 00:18:32,417
Anne Heche's bunghole,
I've already seen it.

441
00:18:32,453 --> 00:18:34,319
No, Chris, it's
something else.

442
00:18:34,354 --> 00:18:36,988
Come on.

443
00:18:50,804 --> 00:18:53,572
Heather? Oh, my God!

444
00:18:53,607 --> 00:18:54,706
I'm sorry, Chris.

445
00:18:54,741 --> 00:18:57,175
You-you did this?

446
00:18:57,211 --> 00:18:58,543
I did.

447
00:18:58,579 --> 00:19:01,146
I took your doll
because it's not a natural

448
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,815
or healthy thing for a boy
your age to have.

449
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,051
It looks like
you stabbed her.

450
00:19:06,086 --> 00:19:08,420
Like, 50 times.

451
00:19:08,455 --> 00:19:11,656
I was kind of jealous of it, so
I guess I went a little crazy.

452
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,125
Also, her lipstick
is all smeared.

453
00:19:14,161 --> 00:19:16,828
I was having a lot
of strange feelings!

454
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,865
Look, Chris, I'm sorry.
You can have Heather back.

455
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,467
But I just want you to know,
if you ever treat a real woman

456
00:19:22,503 --> 00:19:24,402
the way you treat that doll,

457
00:19:24,438 --> 00:19:27,272
you're gonna make her
very happy.

458
00:19:27,307 --> 00:19:28,473
Really?

459
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:29,774
Absolutely.

460
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:32,978
And I know she'll make you
very happy, too.

461
00:19:33,013 --> 00:19:35,413
You know... I don't think

462
00:19:35,449 --> 00:19:37,782
I need Heather anymore.

463
00:19:37,818 --> 00:19:39,451
You don't?
No.

464
00:19:39,486 --> 00:19:41,152
I'm glad to hear
that, Chris.

465
00:19:41,188 --> 00:19:43,522
Seems like maybe
you're growing up.

466
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,190
Maybe.

467
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,865
I guess there's just
one thing left to do.

468
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:47,926
What's that?

469
00:19:47,961 --> 00:19:49,027
Give me that knife.

470
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,195
I got to cut out the baby.

471
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,230
Oh, my God!

472
00:19:51,265 --> 00:19:53,098
It's made of Skittles.

473
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:55,834
You want to eat the baby
together on the way home?

474
00:19:55,869 --> 00:19:59,371
Yeah, I'd like that, Chris.

475
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,822
You know, Lois, I've been
thinking about what you said.

476
00:20:17,858 --> 00:20:19,958
And I did learn
a little something

477
00:20:19,993 --> 00:20:21,927
from watching
Chris and Heather.

478
00:20:21,962 --> 00:20:23,295
You did?
Yeah.

479
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,063
From now on, I am gonna be

480
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,866
treating you like garbage.

481
00:20:27,901 --> 00:20:30,001
Oh, Peter. Thank you.

482
00:20:30,037 --> 00:20:31,970
I love you, Lois.

483
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:33,405
CHRIS:
Mom? Dad?

484
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,441
I want you to meet
my new girlfriend!

485
00:20:36,476 --> 00:20:38,009
This is Mistress Vita.

486
00:20:38,045 --> 00:20:39,711
We met on Craigslist.

487
00:20:39,746 --> 00:20:42,380
No talking unless I say!

488
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,249
Hi, Peter.

489
00:20:44,991 --> 00:20:46,451
How'd she know your name?

490
00:20:46,452 --> 00:20:50,744
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==
<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

491
00:20:50,745 --> 00:20:52,711
Peter, are-are you just
trying to take a knee

492
00:20:52,746 --> 00:20:55,313
until the end of the show?

493
00:20:55,348 --> 00:20:57,482
Peter, that's not gonna work.
You can't just...
