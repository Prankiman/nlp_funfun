Ugh. This is gonna suck.

80% of these acts are either air guitar

or girls dancing to songs from<i> Frozen.</i>

14
00:00:42,756 --> 00:00:45,323
Yeah, back in my day you
had to be a triple threat

15
00:00:45,358 --> 00:00:46,724
to even get on that stage.

16
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,092
You were a triple threat?

17
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,127
I sure was.

18
00:00:49,162 --> 00:00:50,461
I could sing, dance,

19
00:00:50,497 --> 00:00:53,398

Yes. Everything takes
him longer these days.

His cataracts are getting worse.

Hey, Lois, look over there...

- You got to be kidding!
- Son of a bitch!

Wake up, people, Monsanto
is poisoning the world

45
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:21,719
with frankenfoods, and
we're letting it happen.

46
00:02:21,755 --> 00:02:23,821
Monsanto equals murder!

47
00:02:23,857 --> 00:02:25,990
- Monsanto equals murder!
- That's enough.

48
00:02:26,025 --> 00:02:28,526
I am so sick of this
being used as a platform

49
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:30,862
to attack genetically modified foods.

50
00:02:30,897 --> 00:02:32,897
You can't silence the truth!

51
00:02:32,932 --> 00:02:34,232
What, what?

52
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:35,633
It's over, Patty.

53
00:02:35,668 --> 00:02:38,002
Hi, Patty. I like Patty.

54
00:02:40,707 --> 00:02:43,508
Okay, up next, here's Evelyn Fong,

55
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:45,810
our 11-year-old high school junior.

56
00:03:03,096 --> 00:03:05,196
Oh, my God.

57
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:06,764
What is that?

58
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,067
It's... it's the most beautiful
thing I've ever heard.

59
00:03:10,103 --> 00:03:11,969
It's a violin, Peter.

60
00:03:12,005 --> 00:03:14,472
And now, two football players
are going to do something

61
00:03:14,507 --> 00:03:17,341
that only makes sense to the
rest of the football team.

62
00:03:17,377 --> 00:03:19,043
Coach, the bus is here.

63
00:03:19,078 --> 00:03:21,078
This is an away game?

64
00:03:21,114 --> 00:03:23,281
It's true!

65
00:03:23,316 --> 00:03:24,916
Remember that happened?

66
00:03:24,951 --> 00:03:27,385
Those are the
kids I bought beer for.

67
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,887
- I got to take a leak.
- Daddy, you can't see.

68
00:03:29,923 --> 00:03:31,789
Let me help you to the bathroom.

69
00:03:31,825 --> 00:03:33,257
I can see fine.

70
00:03:34,027 --> 00:03:36,561
All right, there's only
so many seats on the bus.

71
00:03:36,596 --> 00:03:39,063
One of you will have to sit next to me.

72
00:03:39,098 --> 00:03:40,631
I will, Coach.

73
00:03:41,968 --> 00:03:44,402
Oh! He talked
on the whole bus ride!

74
00:03:47,707 --> 00:03:49,407
How are you, gentlemen

75
00:03:49,442 --> 00:03:50,908
Dude! What the hell?

76
00:03:50,944 --> 00:03:52,743
Whoa! With cataracts like those,

77
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:54,979
someone needs a<i> big</i> pair of glasses.

78
00:03:55,014 --> 00:03:56,866
Hey! Jessica Chastain!

79
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:03,588
I'm glad you finally agreed to have

80
00:04:03,623 --> 00:04:05,256
the cataract surgery, Daddy.

81
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,457
I wish I hadn't!

82
00:04:06,493 --> 00:04:08,593
I can't see anything
now! This is terrible!

83
00:04:08,628 --> 00:04:12,296
Well, tha-that's why the whole
family came to support you.

84
00:04:12,332 --> 00:04:15,333
Oh, really? Oh, wow, that's
so kind. Who's here?

85
00:04:15,368 --> 00:04:17,736
Oh, uh, well, as you know, I'm here.

86
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,762
- Who else?
- Uh, Stewie and Brian.

87
00:04:20,795 --> 00:04:22,373
Hey, hope you feel better soon.

88
00:04:22,408 --> 00:04:24,509
That doesn't sound
like the whole family.

89
00:04:24,544 --> 00:04:27,378
Hey, hope those
eyes get better soon, Pop.

90
00:04:27,413 --> 00:04:29,614
It's me, Peter. Shipoopi.

91
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:31,616
Oh, thanks for coming, Peter.

92
00:04:31,651 --> 00:04:33,976
I-I'm here, too, Grandpa.

93
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:37,955
And, uh, and Meg went down
to-to put money in the meter.

94
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:39,257
Aw, I don't care.

95
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:41,459
Now, Mr. Pewterschmidt, your
vision will be impaired

96
00:04:41,494 --> 00:04:43,461
for a few weeks while you recover.

97
00:04:43,496 --> 00:04:45,530
I recommend you and your
wife have someone around

98
00:04:45,565 --> 00:04:46,998
to help you during this time.

99
00:04:47,033 --> 00:04:48,966
Well, I'd love to help you, Daddy,

100
00:04:49,002 --> 00:04:51,135
but Stewie's just been so fussy lately.

101
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:54,138
He's constantly crying for no reason.

102
00:04:54,174 --> 00:04:55,439
What are you talking about? I'm fine.

103
00:04:55,475 --> 00:04:56,841
Ow! Bitch!

104
00:04:56,876 --> 00:04:58,276
She does this a lot!

105
00:04:58,311 --> 00:05:00,278
You know, maybe Brian could help you.

106
00:05:00,313 --> 00:05:02,713
He could be your service dog.

107
00:05:02,749 --> 00:05:04,658
Come on, Lois,
I don't want to do that.

108
00:05:04,758 --> 00:05:06,551
Your father and I have
nothing in common.

109
00:05:06,586 --> 00:05:08,753
Brian, please. If you do this for me,

110
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:10,888
you'll be a hero... just like King Arthur

111
00:05:10,924 --> 00:05:13,324
when he pulled the sword from the stone.

112
00:05:15,428 --> 00:05:17,962
Oh... yeah!

113
00:05:17,997 --> 00:05:19,163
Whew!

114
00:05:19,198 --> 00:05:20,898
Oh, God, this is embarrassing.

115
00:05:20,934 --> 00:05:22,800
I'm so sorry.

116
00:05:22,835 --> 00:05:24,702
It's been, like, 500 years.

117
00:05:24,737 --> 00:05:28,272
Aw, this is your big
moment and I'm ruining it.

118
00:05:33,846 --> 00:05:35,680
Peter, what the hell are you doing?

119
00:05:35,715 --> 00:05:38,182
I'm learning violin. It's
kind of like my new hobby.

120
00:05:38,217 --> 00:05:40,785
Well, if we're talking
about new hobbies...

121
00:05:41,988 --> 00:05:43,921
What is this? It's a Mason jar

122
00:05:43,957 --> 00:05:45,523
filled with layered sand.

123
00:05:45,558 --> 00:05:47,325
You can put it in your bathroom

124
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,360
or anywhere you want to feel peaceful.

125
00:05:50,363 --> 00:05:51,762
Now it's nothing.

126
00:05:51,798 --> 00:05:53,531
I always liked the violin,

127
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:56,123
'cause it kind of has
curves like a lady.

128
00:05:56,154 --> 00:05:58,636
Hey, you know what? Maybe you guys
can learn an instrument, too,

129
00:05:58,671 --> 00:06:00,338
and then we could all play together.

130
00:06:00,373 --> 00:06:02,073
Really? That sounds like a lot of work.

131
00:06:02,108 --> 00:06:04,542
Yeah, no offense, muchacho,
but I don't know

132
00:06:04,577 --> 00:06:06,744
if I have time for that, muchacho.

133
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:08,179
Yeah, you're doing "muchacho" wrong.

134
00:06:08,214 --> 00:06:10,047
Come on, guys, it could be cool.

135
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,049
I did play the oboe in high school,

136
00:06:12,085 --> 00:06:14,151
and the girls wouldn't leave me alone.

137
00:06:14,187 --> 00:06:16,020
Girls do like guys in a band.

138
00:06:16,055 --> 00:06:17,221
I'm in. Giggity.

139
00:06:17,256 --> 00:06:20,491
Oh, Quagmire,
you are so predictable.

140
00:06:20,526 --> 00:06:22,627
And that's why I love you, muchacho.

141
00:06:22,662 --> 00:06:24,495
See? That's how you do "muchacho."

142
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,330
And, you know, there's four of us...

143
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:27,999
We could be a string quartet.

144
00:06:28,034 --> 00:06:29,266
All right, I'll do it.

145
00:06:29,302 --> 00:06:31,802
But first you guys got
to do one thing for me.

146
00:06:31,838 --> 00:06:33,104
Sure, Joe. What is it?

147
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:34,805
I want you to put me in the booth.

148
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:37,208
I want to feel like a
person for a second.

149
00:06:37,243 --> 00:06:38,542
Aw, yeah, sure, no problem.

150
00:06:38,578 --> 00:06:40,745
All right, Quagmire, you
do upper, I'll do lower?

151
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,979
Sure. Let's do it!

152
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:53,724
Wow. Thanks, guys.

153
00:06:54,761 --> 00:06:56,761
Uh-oh.

154
00:06:56,796 --> 00:06:59,030
Hey, guys, guys, put him back up.

155
00:06:59,065 --> 00:07:00,183
I just thought of something.

156
00:07:05,672 --> 00:07:07,550
This is gonna be a blast.

157
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:17,174
Mr. Pewterschmidt, your
service dog has arrived.

158
00:07:17,244 --> 00:07:18,944
- Hey, Carter.
- Brian!

159
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:21,313
Y-You have a butler? Then why am I here?

160
00:07:21,348 --> 00:07:23,348
- Why can't<i> he</i> help you?
- What? That's stupid.

161
00:07:23,384 --> 00:07:24,440
Who would announce him?

162
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:25,786
See, this right here,

163
00:07:25,822 --> 00:07:27,955
this is the one-percenter
crap I can't stand.

164
00:07:27,991 --> 00:07:30,525
Yes, it is. Now, sit your
99-percenter ass down

165
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,160
and read me the comics.

166
00:07:33,429 --> 00:07:36,264
Okay. The Wizard of Id is
addressing his subjects.

167
00:07:36,299 --> 00:07:38,299
- Is he up on that balcony?
- Yes.

168
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:40,334
Ha-ha! Then it's a good one.

169
00:07:49,846 --> 00:07:51,646
Okay, hang on, hang on, hang on.

170
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:53,214
Peter, what note are you playing?

171
00:07:53,249 --> 00:07:55,416
I-I'm sorry, I'm not familiar. Note?

172
00:07:55,451 --> 00:07:57,018
Haven't you been practicing?

173
00:07:57,053 --> 00:07:58,486
All right, fine, I haven't.

174
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:00,454
But I've been doing other violin stuff.

175
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,957
Like I bought this jacket
like what Bugs Bunny wears

176
00:08:02,992 --> 00:08:04,992
when he's with that opera guy.

177
00:08:05,995 --> 00:08:07,562
Wow, that looks sharp.

178
00:08:07,597 --> 00:08:10,831
Yeah, I've been practicing
how to sit down in it.

179
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:13,601
Ew, Peter, those tails are soaking wet.

180
00:08:13,636 --> 00:08:15,970
They may have been in the toilet.

181
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:21,576
Brian! Get in here!

182
00:08:21,611 --> 00:08:23,144
Wh-What's up? What do you need?

183
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:25,046
I'm done with my bath.
Put on this lady wig

184
00:08:25,081 --> 00:08:28,149
- and help me out of the tub.
- What? Why do I have to wear a wig?

185
00:08:28,184 --> 00:08:29,951
Otherwise it's weird.

186
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:32,853
Thank you, Penelope.

187
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:35,223
Hey, it's 4:30... time for dinner.

188
00:08:35,258 --> 00:08:38,559
But first, grab that Gold
Bond and powder my speed bag.

189
00:08:42,832 --> 00:08:45,089
Ah. There's the tingle.

190
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,915
Wow, so you can just
bypass all that gridlock?

191
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,444
Having a helicopter's amazing!

192
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:58,546
And that's not all... I also use it

193
00:08:58,581 --> 00:09:00,881
to throw boxes of frogs
down on that church.

194
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,650
They go bananas!

195
00:09:02,685 --> 00:09:06,320
Boy, I could really get used
to this rich guy stuff.

196
00:09:52,101 --> 00:09:53,467
You guys, I got great news!

197
00:09:53,503 --> 00:09:55,603
Some skank I used to
bang is getting married,

198
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:57,705
and they need someone to
play at the ceremony.

199
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,574
- We got our first gig!
- Wow, a wedding... that's awesome!

200
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,576
All right, then we should
probably practice our piece.

201
00:10:13,516 --> 00:10:15,983
Wait, hold on, hold on.
Peter, uh, that's terrible.

202
00:10:16,017 --> 00:10:18,284
You sounded like you
were strangling a cat.

203
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:20,686
Well, I was... that's how I
got revved up to perform.

204
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,312
No, just now. Look, it's clear

205
00:10:22,347 --> 00:10:24,180
that you still haven't practiced at all.

206
00:10:24,216 --> 00:10:26,283
Yeah, this was your idea
in the first place,

207
00:10:26,318 --> 00:10:28,451
but you're the only one
who's done no work.

208
00:10:28,487 --> 00:10:31,221
No work? I stared in a mirror for hours

209
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:34,224
playing air violin to the
song "Bittersweet Symphony."

210
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,059
Peter, you're out of the group.

211
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,193
What?!

212
00:10:37,229 --> 00:10:40,096
Well, fine. Screw you guys!

213
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,199
Wow, he seemed pretty angry.

214
00:10:43,235 --> 00:10:44,834
Yeah, I haven't seen him this upset

215
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,504
since he got caught using that fake ID.

216
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:49,550
Can I see your ID, please?

217
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:54,878
Give me one second.

218
00:10:54,913 --> 00:10:58,201
Uh, sir, that lady who came in
and ate all the pies is back.

219
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:05,221
Okay, let's see how
those eyes are doing.

220
00:11:05,257 --> 00:11:07,324
See if you can tell me where Waldo is.

221
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:09,559
He's right there buying
an ice cream cone.

222
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:11,895
Damn it! I've been stuck
on that page for two days.

223
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,663
Oh, and your eyes are fine.

224
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:15,362
Hey, that's terrific, Carter!

225
00:11:15,396 --> 00:11:16,599
Seems like it's time to go home

226
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:18,835
and pour some of that Scotch
of yours to celebrate.

227
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,603
That sounds like a great idea.

228
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,038
See you later. Wait, wait, wait.

229
00:11:22,074 --> 00:11:23,273
What are you talking about?

230
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,774
I meant, like... like, both of us.

231
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,242
Didn't you hear him? I'm all healed.

232
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:28,011
I don't need a service dog anymore.

233
00:11:28,046 --> 00:11:29,512
What are you saying?

234
00:11:29,548 --> 00:11:30,914
I'm saying I'm done with you.

235
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:32,215
Now, before I go,

236
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,853
I'm just gonna old-man
drink this glass of water.

237
00:11:46,598 --> 00:11:48,698
Now, to take an old man pee.

238
00:11:50,902 --> 00:11:53,269
Ow. Ow.

239
00:11:53,305 --> 00:11:54,838
Ow.

240
00:11:54,873 --> 00:11:57,907
Ow. Ow.

241
00:11:57,943 --> 00:11:59,409
Ow.

242
00:11:59,444 --> 00:12:02,078
Ow. Ow.

243
00:12:02,114 --> 00:12:03,480
Ow.

244
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:06,116
Ow. Ow.

245
00:12:06,151 --> 00:12:08,985
Ow. Ow.

246
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:11,506
Ow.

247
00:12:16,401 --> 00:12:18,486
Oh, Brian, just in time for dinner.

248
00:12:18,525 --> 00:12:20,058
We're having sloppy Joes.

249
00:12:20,074 --> 00:12:21,374
Eh, what else you got?

250
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:23,167
How about a knuckle sandwich?

251
00:12:23,203 --> 00:12:24,936
If Peter said that,

252
00:12:24,971 --> 00:12:27,205
you all would've lost
your minds laughing.

253
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,606
It's just that at Carter's house,

254
00:12:28,641 --> 00:12:29,941
if you don't want something heavy,

255
00:12:29,976 --> 00:12:32,210
Étienne will whip you up an
egg dish with some shallots

256
00:12:32,245 --> 00:12:34,145
and chanterelles or whatever's fresh.

257
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,980
Yeah, I know all about Étienne.

258
00:12:36,015 --> 00:12:38,383
He climbed into my bed when I was 11.

259
00:12:39,619 --> 00:12:41,619
I'm sure this is a step
down for you, Bri,

260
00:12:41,654 --> 00:12:43,254
but now you're back in the real world

261
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:45,356
where our poop stinks,
and we all eat garbage.

262
00:12:45,392 --> 00:12:46,557
Yeah, I guess I got used

263
00:12:46,593 --> 00:12:48,426
to being a little pampered
over at Carter's.

264
00:12:48,461 --> 00:12:50,328
Well, I'd be careful
with your uptown ways.

265
00:12:50,363 --> 00:12:52,330
Some of the other kids don't like it.

266
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:55,900
He thinks he's better than us.

267
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,069
What time you going to bed, fancy boy?

268
00:12:58,104 --> 00:12:59,670
I don't know. 9:00?

269
00:12:59,706 --> 00:13:01,205
9:00, Chris.

270
00:13:01,241 --> 00:13:03,674
Look, it's not even about the stuff.

271
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,777
Carter and I became friends.

272
00:13:05,812 --> 00:13:07,345
Wait a minute! Of course!

273
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,814
Whatever you're going to say
next, I bet it's wrong.

274
00:13:09,849 --> 00:13:12,583
I offended Carter by
offering to work for him.

275
00:13:12,619 --> 00:13:14,352
I mean, once it became a friendship,

276
00:13:14,387 --> 00:13:16,220
he didn't want me working for him.

277
00:13:16,256 --> 00:13:17,488
He wanted a pal.

278
00:13:17,524 --> 00:13:18,756
Brian, you're not kidding anyone.

279
00:13:18,792 --> 00:13:20,625
We all know you don't care about Carter.

280
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,026
You only care about his money.

281
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:24,061
No, no, no. He<i> knows</i> I'm his friend.

282
00:13:24,097 --> 00:13:27,231
Yeah, right. That's what Woody
thought about Buzz Lightyear.

283
00:13:27,267 --> 00:13:29,801
Bo Peep!

284
00:13:29,836 --> 00:13:32,103
What-what's going on here?

285
00:13:32,138 --> 00:13:35,594
Um... you've got a friend in me?

286
00:13:40,046 --> 00:13:41,779
What are you doing here?

287
00:13:41,815 --> 00:13:43,915
I-I thought you were
rehearsing with the guys.

288
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,484
Ah, the bastards kicked me out
'cause I'm not good enough.

289
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:48,085
Oh, and they also taught me

290
00:13:48,121 --> 00:13:51,652
that if your hand is bigger than
your face, you have cancer,

291
00:13:52,229 --> 00:13:55,893
so maybe you should, uh,
you know, do the test.

292
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:58,095
I<i> had</i> cancer, Peter. Remember?

293
00:13:58,131 --> 00:14:00,531
I was in the hospital? You
weren't there for it.

294
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:02,233
Well, maybe you have it again.

295
00:14:02,268 --> 00:14:04,168
Peter, I'm not falling for your trick,

296
00:14:04,204 --> 00:14:05,870
but if you're upset about the guys

297
00:14:05,905 --> 00:14:08,206
kicking you out of the group,
you can't really blame them.

298
00:14:08,241 --> 00:14:11,142
The violin takes
discipline and dedication.

299
00:14:11,177 --> 00:14:13,044
You never even practiced.

300
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:15,580
They probably thought you
were just wasting their time.

301
00:14:15,615 --> 00:14:16,981
Maybe you're right. I guess...

302
00:14:17,016 --> 00:14:19,417
guess I could've been a
little more serious about it.

303
00:14:19,452 --> 00:14:20,885
Well, it's not too late.

304
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,621
Maybe you could find a teacher
who could help you learn,

305
00:14:23,656 --> 00:14:25,823
and if you work at it and
get a little better,

306
00:14:25,859 --> 00:14:27,325
they'll see you care about them.

307
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,559
You know what? That's a great idea!

308
00:14:28,595 --> 00:14:29,827
I'll take some lessons.

309
00:14:29,863 --> 00:14:32,530
I'm gonna work really hard
just like my deodorant.

310
00:14:32,532 --> 00:14:34,665
How does a guy like me stay fresh

311
00:14:34,701 --> 00:14:36,734
I use Fat Guys Deodorant.

312
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:38,536
Whether you're sitting, leaning,

313
00:14:38,571 --> 00:14:41,806
lying down or sitting,
Fat Guys keeps ya dry.

314
00:14:41,841 --> 00:14:44,842
Apply every five minutes, and
you're good for five minutes.

315
00:14:44,878 --> 00:14:47,378
And now for the confusing
commercial backstory.

316
00:14:47,413 --> 00:14:49,687
Ready for the fund-raiser, Dad?

317
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:51,238
Yeah, be right there, buddy.

318
00:14:51,718 --> 00:14:54,369
We're going to a fund-raiser,
and we share a bedroom.

319
00:14:58,892 --> 00:15:01,592
Mr. Pewterschmidt, you have a visitor.

320
00:15:01,628 --> 00:15:03,327
Hey, buddy, looking good!

321
00:15:03,363 --> 00:15:04,529
So, what are we drinking?

322
00:15:04,564 --> 00:15:06,797
Or better yet, why <i>aren't</i> we drinking?

323
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,266
Get the hell out of here!

324
00:15:08,301 --> 00:15:09,734
I told you I'm done with you!

325
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:12,603
And besides, I'm off to
the spa down at the club.

326
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,639
How's the temp? Good and hot?

327
00:15:16,342 --> 00:15:18,342
Oh, yeah, that's the stuff.

328
00:15:18,378 --> 00:15:22,179
Hey, did you also not wash
your ass before getting in?

329
00:15:22,215 --> 00:15:25,000
Yeah, that sign.

330
00:15:29,489 --> 00:15:31,522
- There you go, Mr. Glenn.
- Thanks.

331
00:15:31,558 --> 00:15:34,225
Hey, can I get a couple of
extras of these plastic bags?

332
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,928
Let me just test this out quickly.

333
00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:41,532
Yeah, that works. Okay, now you go.

334
00:15:41,568 --> 00:15:43,681
I have to get back to
teaching violin lesson.

335
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,476
Those scales sound terrible!

336
00:15:52,512 --> 00:15:54,345
You fat and lazy! You leave now!

337
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,047
No, please! I got to get better

338
00:15:56,082 --> 00:15:57,798
so I can be as good as my friends.

339
00:15:58,003 --> 00:15:59,437
I really let 'em down.

340
00:16:01,888 --> 00:16:03,287
You fingers no bleeding.

341
00:16:03,323 --> 00:16:04,722
You no try hard enough!

342
00:16:04,757 --> 00:16:06,624
You want me press iron
on your back again?

343
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:08,059
I'm trying! I'm trying!

344
00:16:08,094 --> 00:16:09,594
Try harder! Play better!

345
00:16:15,101 --> 00:16:17,642
Is somebody making a Cuban sandwich?

346
00:16:21,274 --> 00:16:23,374
Lousy no-good rotten frassum-rassum...

347
00:16:26,045 --> 00:16:27,478
Brian, what's up?

348
00:16:27,513 --> 00:16:30,081
Why are you engaging
in cartoon profanity?

349
00:16:30,116 --> 00:16:31,749
Carter wants nothing to do with me.

350
00:16:31,784 --> 00:16:33,818
- I'm just so mad.
- Don't you mean sad?

351
00:16:33,853 --> 00:16:35,653
You know, about the friendship?

352
00:16:35,688 --> 00:16:38,189
Oh, no, of course, you
mean mad about the money.

353
00:16:38,224 --> 00:16:39,957
All right, fine, it was about the money.

354
00:16:39,993 --> 00:16:41,359
- I miss the money.
- Yes, I know.

355
00:16:41,394 --> 00:16:43,527
I saw all your Instagrams
on his helicopter

356
00:16:43,563 --> 00:16:44,996
like it was your helicopter.

357
00:16:45,031 --> 00:16:46,831
I never said it was my helicopter.

358
00:16:46,866 --> 00:16:48,332
Yeah, never said it wasn't.

359
00:16:48,368 --> 00:16:51,569
The implication was that it was
a regular part of your life.

360
00:16:51,604 --> 00:16:54,639
Anyway, I know this makes me
sound awful, but I almost wish

361
00:16:54,674 --> 00:16:57,108
Carter was still blind
so he'd still need me.

362
00:16:57,143 --> 00:16:58,442
Yeah, but he's not.

363
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,746
But... he<i> could</i> be.

364
00:17:01,781 --> 00:17:04,548
But he isn't. But he<i> should</i> be.

365
00:17:04,584 --> 00:17:06,150
Oh, no.

366
00:17:06,185 --> 00:17:07,652
Come on, it'd be temporary,

367
00:17:07,687 --> 00:17:09,320
just until he realizes I'm a great hang.

368
00:17:09,355 --> 00:17:11,589
But you're not, so I don't
want any part of this.

369
00:17:11,624 --> 00:17:12,957
Okay. I get it. I get it.

370
00:17:12,992 --> 00:17:14,258
Nah, you-you wouldn't want to help me.

371
00:17:14,293 --> 00:17:16,927
What was I thinking? He...
he's your grandfather.

372
00:17:16,963 --> 00:17:19,397
Even though he did say
that thing about you.

373
00:17:19,432 --> 00:17:20,631
What? What did he say about me?

374
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:22,566
Oh, I... I'm sorry. I
thought I told you.

375
00:17:22,602 --> 00:17:25,670
Um, he said you couldn't cut it
as a member of One Direction.

376
00:17:25,705 --> 00:17:27,872
What?! But they have an opening!

377
00:17:27,907 --> 00:17:29,040
Zayn is gone!

378
00:17:29,075 --> 00:17:30,675
He does know Zayn is gone, right?

379
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,942
Oh, he definitely knows.

380
00:17:31,978 --> 00:17:33,678
Yeah, he-he thinks you
could be in O-Town,

381
00:17:33,713 --> 00:17:35,012
but not One Direction.

382
00:17:35,048 --> 00:17:37,214
Okay, I'm pretty sure
you're manipulating me,

383
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,338
but let's go blind that old bastard.

384
00:17:47,093 --> 00:17:50,761
Listen, Peter, we know you've
been working hard on the violin,

385
00:17:50,797 --> 00:17:53,597
but more importantly, you're our pal,

386
00:17:53,633 --> 00:17:55,366
and we'd like you to
be back in the group.

387
00:17:55,401 --> 00:17:57,902
Really? What if I'm not good enough?

388
00:17:57,937 --> 00:17:59,403
Well, that's the thing.

389
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:02,573
We decided we'd rather be lousy
with you than great without you.

390
00:18:02,608 --> 00:18:05,409
Joe, no offense, but I'd prefer
to hear it from someone else.

391
00:18:05,445 --> 00:18:07,578
- That's fair.
- So, what do you say, Peter?

392
00:18:07,613 --> 00:18:09,647
Will you come and play
the wedding with us?

393
00:18:09,682 --> 00:18:11,393
Oh, you bet I will! Oh, thanks!

394
00:18:11,413 --> 00:18:14,151
You guys won't regret this,
and don't you worry.

395
00:18:14,187 --> 00:18:18,155
I'll be ready, unlike Lois
getting dressed for a night out.

396
00:18:18,191 --> 00:18:19,757
Tell them the truth!

397
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:21,158
It's me. It's me.

398
00:18:21,194 --> 00:18:23,027
I'm the one who takes
too long to get ready.

399
00:18:23,062 --> 00:18:25,000
It's 'cause I don't
have any nice clothes.

400
00:18:25,002 --> 00:18:25,781
Peter!

401
00:18:25,783 --> 00:18:28,065
All right. It's 'cause I
don't like the way I look.

402
00:18:34,006 --> 00:18:35,840
Okay, Brian, Carter's in the shower.

403
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,909
As soon as he comes out, we
spray this right in his eyes.

404
00:18:38,945 --> 00:18:40,344
What'd you put in there again?

405
00:18:40,379 --> 00:18:42,847
Oh, it's just tap water
from Flint, Michigan.

406
00:18:45,618 --> 00:18:48,719
♪ And that's how the penis song goes. ♪

407
00:18:48,755 --> 00:18:50,921
Aah! Son of a bitch! My eyes!

408
00:18:50,957 --> 00:18:52,089
You're up.

409
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,390
Carter, what happened?

410
00:18:53,426 --> 00:18:54,725
You look like you could use some help.

411
00:18:54,761 --> 00:18:56,660
Aah! My face! Aah!

412
00:18:59,031 --> 00:19:00,865
Oh, my God!

413
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,033
What did I let money do to me?

414
00:19:03,069 --> 00:19:04,769
Who did this? Who are you?

415
00:19:04,804 --> 00:19:06,871
Carter, it's me, Brian.

416
00:19:06,906 --> 00:19:09,373
I did this, and it's made me realize

417
00:19:09,408 --> 00:19:12,042
that I was blinded by
luxury and comfort,

418
00:19:12,078 --> 00:19:14,779
but now I see that none of
that matters if I don't...

419
00:19:14,814 --> 00:19:16,814
Brian, Brian, hold on.

420
00:19:23,623 --> 00:19:27,057
Looks like we've learned a
lot, and my face is better.

421
00:19:37,703 --> 00:19:39,170
God, I'm so nervous.

422
00:19:39,205 --> 00:19:41,105
You sure you guys want
me to play with you?

423
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,407
Yes, Peter. You play away.

424
00:19:43,442 --> 00:19:44,809
We're a quartet.

425
00:19:44,844 --> 00:19:46,710
Just do the best you can.

426
00:19:46,746 --> 00:19:48,833
You may kiss the bride.

427
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,379
Peter, that was amazing!

428
00:20:13,414 --> 00:20:15,748
I know. Those lessons really paid off!

429
00:20:15,783 --> 00:20:17,583
I'll say! The way you play,

430
00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:19,719
we'll have more gigs than we can handle.

431
00:20:19,754 --> 00:20:22,989
Not a chance. Mr. Washy Washy
took all the joy out of this.

432
00:20:23,024 --> 00:20:25,291
I hate the violin. I hate music.

433
00:20:25,326 --> 00:20:27,526
I hate life, and I'm
never doing this again!

434
00:20:28,863 --> 00:20:31,430
All right, guys, let's go
drink a bunch of free booze

435
00:20:31,466 --> 00:20:33,966
and be a huge presence
in the wedding photos.
