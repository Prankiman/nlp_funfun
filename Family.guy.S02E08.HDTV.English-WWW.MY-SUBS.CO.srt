00:00:02,686 --> 00:00:06,076
It seems today that all you see

2
00:00:06,166 --> 00:00:09,442
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

3
00:00:09,526 --> 00:00:13,075
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

4
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:15,157
On which we used to rely?

5
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:19,397
Lucky there's a family guy

6
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:24,401
Lucky there's a man who positively
can do all the things that make us

7
00:00:24,486 --> 00:00:26,078
Laugh and cry

8
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:31,365
He's a family guy

9
00:00:34,966 --> 00:00:37,275
Boy, that lotion sure feels good.

10
00:00:37,366 --> 00:00:40,756
- Sure is hot.
- And it just got hotter.

11
00:00:40,846 --> 00:00:43,041
Here. Now let me do you.

12
00:00:44,006 --> 00:00:48,955
Pawtucket Patriot beer. If you buy it,
hot women will have sex in your back yard.

13
00:00:49,046 --> 00:00:52,561
Typical male fantasy! Women drinking beer!

14
00:00:52,646 --> 00:00:55,160
I guarantee you a man made that commercial.

15
00:00:55,246 --> 00:00:59,603
Of course a man made it. It's a commercial,
Lois, not a delicious Thanksgiving dinner.

16
00:00:59,686 --> 00:01:03,235
Dad, we won a boat! We won a boat! Ha-ha!

17
00:01:03,326 --> 00:01:06,318
Holy crap! We did!
We won a free freakin' boat!

18
00:01:06,406 --> 00:01:08,556
Dad, nobody gives things away for free.

19
00:01:08,646 --> 00:01:11,399
I know plenty of people
who give things away.

20
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,357
I'll take it.

21
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:21,603
Hello, China? I have something
you may want, but it's gonna cost you.

22
00:01:22,326 --> 00:01:25,204
That's right. All the tea.

23
00:01:27,846 --> 00:01:32,442
I knew there was a catch. You have to sit
through an awful time-share presentation.

24
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:37,316
A small price to pay. I'm gonna be the first
one on Spooner Street to have his own boat.

25
00:01:37,406 --> 00:01:39,920
Whoa! All hands on deck! I'm gettin' a boat!

26
00:01:40,006 --> 00:01:43,476
Hey, Quagmire, I'm also getting a boat too.

27
00:01:43,566 --> 00:01:45,443
Right on! Whoo!

28
00:01:45,526 --> 00:01:48,120
I can't wait to get my sea legs! Yeah!

29
00:01:48,206 --> 00:01:51,596
Well, at least I'll be the fattest guy
on Spooner Street to get a boat.

30
00:01:51,686 --> 00:01:53,563
Hey, hey, hey! I'm gettin' a boat!

31
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:57,036
Oh, man. Even Della Reese is getting a boat.

32
00:02:00,526 --> 00:02:03,598
These wonderful homes
on this beautifully secluded island

33
00:02:03,686 --> 00:02:06,917
can be yours with almost no strings attached.

34
00:02:07,006 --> 00:02:09,839
Beautiful island.
Nothing out of the ordinary here.

35
00:02:09,926 --> 00:02:13,396
Just beautiful homes and nothing else.

36
00:02:13,486 --> 00:02:16,444
Each residence has 200 feet
of pristine ocean front.

37
00:02:16,526 --> 00:02:19,484
No city noise,
no flesh-eating ogres, no pollution.

38
00:02:21,206 --> 00:02:23,959
I hate these high-pressure sales situations.

39
00:02:24,046 --> 00:02:29,120
That's so cute. You're just afraid that because
you're a woman, you'll do something stupid,

40
00:02:29,206 --> 00:02:34,360
like buy that time-share, or not realise I taped
over our wedding video with soft-core porn.

41
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:39,042
- You taped over our wedding video?
- Relax. I just taped over the boring stuff.

42
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:42,596
The couple has written their own vows,
which they will now recite.

43
00:02:42,686 --> 00:02:44,483
Peter, I...

44
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:49,157
Look, the only reason I got myself arrested
was to find out what happened to my sister.

45
00:02:49,246 --> 00:02:51,840
Excuse me, ladies, it's laundry time.

46
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,804
It's so cold in here. I mean, look at my...

47
00:03:02,286 --> 00:03:05,881
Oh, my God, Peter. I sent a copy
of that tape to my great-aunt Lil.

48
00:03:08,006 --> 00:03:09,883
This wedding is hot!

49
00:03:09,966 --> 00:03:12,275
Wake up, dammit! Wake up!

50
00:03:12,966 --> 00:03:18,836
Mr and Mrs... Griffin. If you sign this contract
without reading it, I'll take your blank cheque,

51
00:03:18,926 --> 00:03:22,043
and you won't not be not loving
your time-share before you know it.

52
00:03:22,126 --> 00:03:25,675
We're not gonna buy your lousy time-share,
all right? Now where's my boat?

53
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:28,326
Hold on! You have a choice.

54
00:03:28,406 --> 00:03:31,637
You can have the boat or the mystery box.

55
00:03:31,726 --> 00:03:34,877
- Are you crazy? We'll take the boat.
- Not so fast, Lois.

56
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:38,561
A boat's a boat,
but the mystery box could be anything.

57
00:03:38,646 --> 00:03:41,524
It could even be a boat!
You know how much we want one.

58
00:03:41,606 --> 00:03:43,005
- Let's...
- We'll take the box.

59
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:48,760
"We'll take the box." You gave up a boat
for free tickets to a crappy comedy club.

60
00:03:48,846 --> 00:03:52,521
You're acting like this is the first time
I've ever done something stupid.

61
00:03:52,606 --> 00:03:54,722
Remember the time we went to get that boat?

62
00:03:54,806 --> 00:03:58,401
A boat's a boat,
but the mystery box could be anything.

63
00:03:58,486 --> 00:04:01,478
It could even be a boat!
You know how much we want one.

64
00:04:01,566 --> 00:04:02,885
- Let's...
- We'll take the box.

65
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:07,403
- Peter, that just happened ten minutes ago.
- Who cares? I bet nobody took the boat.

66
00:04:07,486 --> 00:04:11,001
Who could resist the call of the mystery box?

67
00:04:11,086 --> 00:04:12,917
Yahoo!

68
00:04:13,006 --> 00:04:16,681
Hey, look at me!
I'm the man in the boat! All right!

69
00:04:18,286 --> 00:04:21,881
- Joe, look to the right. It's the Griffins.
- We're nautical now, baby.

70
00:04:21,966 --> 00:04:27,438
That's called starboard. But I'll forgive you
cos you sex me up. Now give me some sugar.

71
00:04:28,286 --> 00:04:31,961
- Hey, neighbours! Where's your boat?
- We didn't take the boat.

72
00:04:32,046 --> 00:04:35,482
We took the mystery box. Hop in.

73
00:04:38,886 --> 00:04:42,162
Hey, Quagmire, maybe
the comedian will tell some jokes

74
00:04:42,246 --> 00:04:45,795
about boats or boating or owning a boat.

75
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:49,925
Yeah. Or maybe he'll tell some jokes
about being a sucker.

76
00:04:50,006 --> 00:04:55,956
Oh, Quagmire,
you're what the Spaniards call el terrible. 

77
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,640
Why are you upset?
I never even knew you liked boats.

78
00:04:58,726 --> 00:05:02,321
Boating's in my blood. Ever since
my great-grandfather, Huck Griffin,

79
00:05:02,406 --> 00:05:04,362
rafted down the mighty Mississippi.

80
00:05:04,446 --> 00:05:07,643
- What did you just call me?
- I... I thought that was your name.

81
00:05:07,726 --> 00:05:10,286
That is our word. You've got no right using it.

82
00:05:10,366 --> 00:05:12,800
Hey, hey, hey. I'm cool, I'm cool. No problem.

83
00:05:14,806 --> 00:05:18,640
- Could you pass me the oar, N-word Jim.
- Thank you.

84
00:05:20,566 --> 00:05:24,081
This comic sucks!
He couldn't make me laugh

85
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:28,239
even if I was laughing my ass off
and he was making me do it. Huh?

86
00:05:28,326 --> 00:05:32,239
- Come on, Skinny! Make me laugh!
- Peter, that's a microphone stand.

87
00:05:32,326 --> 00:05:34,237
Oh, well, pardon me for thinking

88
00:05:34,326 --> 00:05:37,557
a microphone stand in a comedy club
should tell a joke or two.

89
00:05:37,646 --> 00:05:40,956
I guess I'm just old-fashioned that way.

90
00:05:41,046 --> 00:05:43,560
- Hi. Welcome to...
- Ha-ha-ha-ha! Very funny!

91
00:05:43,646 --> 00:05:46,604
- Excuse me, sir. I haven't even...
- That one was hilarious.

92
00:05:46,686 --> 00:05:50,076
That was even funnier than your first joke.
Put Skinny back up there.

93
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,884
- Peter!
- You think this is easy?

94
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:55,481
- You wanna come up here and try this?
- I thought you'd never ask.

95
00:05:55,566 --> 00:05:59,195
Maybe you shouldn't do this.
You've never had a lot of luck telling jokes.

96
00:05:59,846 --> 00:06:05,523
OK, OK. How many dirty, stinking apes
does it take to screw in a light bulb?

97
00:06:05,606 --> 00:06:09,758
Three. One dirty, stinking ape
to screw in the light bulb,

98
00:06:09,846 --> 00:06:14,044
and two dirty, stinking apes
to throw faeces at each other.

99
00:06:14,126 --> 00:06:16,117
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

100
00:06:16,926 --> 00:06:19,759
Don't worry. I... I got it under control.

101
00:06:21,686 --> 00:06:24,723
Hey, hey, how about that Viagra, huh?

102
00:06:24,806 --> 00:06:27,718
You know what that stuff does? Huh?

103
00:06:27,806 --> 00:06:29,444
Huh?

104
00:06:29,526 --> 00:06:31,244
Come on!

105
00:06:31,326 --> 00:06:33,715
What, are you people stupid?

106
00:06:35,966 --> 00:06:39,003
Ah! You like a little abuse, huh?

107
00:06:39,086 --> 00:06:42,635
Yeah. Well, you gu...
you guys are stupid and ugly.

108
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:48,162
If there was a stupid-and-ugly contest,
you'd all win!

109
00:06:49,286 --> 00:06:52,278
Or lose. Whichever's funnier.

110
00:06:54,566 --> 00:06:58,479
Hey, Lois. What do you call a woman
who takes for ever to cook breakfast?

111
00:06:58,566 --> 00:07:01,717
- I swear to God, Peter...
- You call her Lois.

112
00:07:01,806 --> 00:07:02,841
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

113
00:07:02,926 --> 00:07:06,316
Ha-ha-ha-ha! Well, the fat man made a funny.

114
00:07:06,406 --> 00:07:10,285
I rather enjoyed that.
Yes, yes. Yes, you cook very slowly.

115
00:07:10,366 --> 00:07:14,484
As a matter of fact, if you were
any slower at cooking, you'd...

116
00:07:14,566 --> 00:07:19,321
well, you wouldn't be cooking very fast at all,
now, would you? That one wasn't very good.

117
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:24,355
They laughed because it looked like you peed
yourself, not because they liked your jokes.

118
00:07:24,446 --> 00:07:28,234
Well, maybe that was part of my act.
Urine happens to be very edgy,

119
00:07:28,326 --> 00:07:31,284
but an unfunny person like you
wouldn't understand that.

120
00:07:31,366 --> 00:07:33,482
OK, OK, I've got it, I've got it.

121
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:37,525
If you cooked any more slowly,
you wouldn't need an egg timer,

122
00:07:37,606 --> 00:07:40,837
you'd need an egg calendar! Ha-ha-ha!

123
00:07:41,806 --> 00:07:43,717
That's right. I went there.

124
00:07:46,446 --> 00:07:48,835
OK, OK, OK. Wait. Here's another one.

125
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,917
Why do women have boobs?

126
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:55,755
So you got something to look at
while you're talking to 'em.

127
00:07:55,846 --> 00:07:59,077
- That's great!
- That's a good one. That's what they're for!

128
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,964
Are you telling jokes? I love jokes.

129
00:08:02,046 --> 00:08:04,765
All right. Then you'll love this one. OK.

130
00:08:05,806 --> 00:08:08,195
Why do women have boobs?

131
00:08:08,286 --> 00:08:12,837
So you got something to look at
while you're talking to 'em. Ha-ha-ha-ha!

132
00:08:14,726 --> 00:08:19,277
So you got something to look at
while you're talking to 'em. Ha-ha-ha-ha!

133
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:20,922
So you got...

134
00:08:21,406 --> 00:08:23,601
You... you wanted to see me, Mr Weed?

135
00:08:23,686 --> 00:08:25,642
Peter, we have a problem.

136
00:08:25,726 --> 00:08:30,242
Mr Griffin, I'm Gloria Ironbox. I represent
one of your co-workers, Sarah Bennett.

137
00:08:30,326 --> 00:08:33,318
She's suing you and the company
for sexual harassment.

138
00:08:33,406 --> 00:08:35,761
Sarah... Sarah... I don't...

139
00:08:35,846 --> 00:08:38,838
Oh, is she the one
we video-taped taking a dump?

140
00:08:39,526 --> 00:08:41,437
Why? What happened?

141
00:08:45,886 --> 00:08:49,196
Sexual harassment is
a very serious charge, Mr Griffin.

142
00:08:49,286 --> 00:08:53,564
First of all, if I can speak in my own defence,
all I did was tell a little joke.

143
00:08:53,646 --> 00:08:55,523
Second of all, women are not people.

144
00:08:55,606 --> 00:08:59,155
They are devices built by the Lord
Jesus Christ for our entertainment.

145
00:08:59,246 --> 00:09:00,361
Peter, please!

146
00:09:00,446 --> 00:09:05,236
Miss Ironbox, I assure you this company
in no way condones Peter's conduct.

147
00:09:05,326 --> 00:09:07,203
In fact, a film on employee relations

148
00:09:07,286 --> 00:09:10,915
has been a mandatory part
of our personnel training for 50 years.

149
00:09:14,366 --> 00:09:19,042
Irrational and emotionally fragile by nature,
female co-workers are a peculiar animal.

150
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:21,686
They are very insecure
about their appearance.

151
00:09:21,766 --> 00:09:24,326
Be sure to tell them
how good they look every day,

152
00:09:24,406 --> 00:09:26,237
even if they're homely and unkempt.

153
00:09:26,326 --> 00:09:30,717
You're doing a great job, Muriel,
and you're prettier than Mamie Van Doren.

154
00:09:32,326 --> 00:09:37,764
And, remember, nothing says "good job"
like a firm, open-palm slap on the behind.

155
00:09:40,766 --> 00:09:45,556
I teach a workplace sensitivity training class
for the Women's Action Coalition.

156
00:09:45,646 --> 00:09:48,479
If Mr Griffin completes my course,
we'll drop the lawsuit.

157
00:09:48,566 --> 00:09:52,798
I assure you, Peter will be there.
His job depends on it.

158
00:09:52,886 --> 00:09:55,081
Good. I'm looking forward to it.

159
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:59,284
You know, if I wasn't so sure you were
a lesbian, I'd say you were coming on to me.

160
00:10:09,686 --> 00:10:13,281
All right, now let's do some role-playing.
I'll be the office assistant.

161
00:10:13,366 --> 00:10:17,325
Mr Hanson, you play the boss
and we'll see what you've learned tonight.

162
00:10:17,406 --> 00:10:18,077
OK.

163
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:21,203
- The filing is done, Mr Hanson.
- Thank you, Miss Ironbox.

164
00:10:21,286 --> 00:10:23,516
You are a valued member
of our business team

165
00:10:23,606 --> 00:10:26,200
and every bit as important
to this company as I am.

166
00:10:26,286 --> 00:10:29,722
Excellent. Mr Griffin, why don't you
come up here and give it a try?

167
00:10:29,806 --> 00:10:30,841
All right.

168
00:10:30,926 --> 00:10:34,316
- The filing is done, Mr Griffin.
- Thank you, Miss Ironbox.

169
00:10:34,406 --> 00:10:38,604
You're a valued member of our business
team and I will give you a raise tomorrow

170
00:10:38,686 --> 00:10:40,961
if you come to work without a shirt on.

171
00:10:41,046 --> 00:10:43,606
- Mr Griffin!
- I'm sorry. That came out wrong.

172
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:45,483
Let me try again.

173
00:10:45,566 --> 00:10:48,239
- Nice ass.
- You haven't heard a word I've said.

174
00:10:48,326 --> 00:10:51,318
That's not fair.
I've heard everything you've said.

175
00:10:51,406 --> 00:10:55,604
There's some subtleties to the rules
that aren't so easy to understand.

176
00:10:55,686 --> 00:10:57,563
- Honk, honk.
- OK, that's it!

177
00:10:57,646 --> 00:11:00,922
Obviously normal sensitivity training
isn't enough for you.

178
00:11:01,006 --> 00:11:03,315
No. We're gonna have to
do something drastic.

179
00:11:04,766 --> 00:11:08,600
A week at a women's retreat. What the hell
am I supposed to learn from that?

180
00:11:08,686 --> 00:11:12,076
Face it, your attitude towards women
isn't exactly enlightened.

181
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:16,078
That's a bad mud puddle.
I wouldn't want you to step in that

182
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,726
and get your nice shoes all ruined.

183
00:11:23,126 --> 00:11:25,924
Then you got caught peeping
in the ladies' locker room.

184
00:11:26,006 --> 00:11:29,794
OK, move the towel, move the towel.

185
00:11:29,886 --> 00:11:31,877
Oh! Oh! They spotted me!

186
00:11:33,046 --> 00:11:35,606
Peter, I think this'll be good for you.

187
00:11:35,686 --> 00:11:39,565
You know I love you,
but I have to admit there are times

188
00:11:39,646 --> 00:11:42,399
when I wish you were a little more sensitive.

189
00:11:42,486 --> 00:11:44,761
Look at me. Look at me!

190
00:11:47,806 --> 00:11:50,878
Hello, ladies. I'm Miss Watson,
director of the retreat.

191
00:11:50,966 --> 00:11:55,835
I'd like to welcome Peter Griffin, who's here
to get in touch with his feminine side.

192
00:11:55,926 --> 00:11:58,998
This world would be far better
if there were more men like him.

193
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:04,001
OK, OK, so here's what I'm thinking.
I'll be Charlie and you can all be my angels.

194
00:12:05,126 --> 00:12:07,924
Except you. You'll be Bosley.

195
00:12:09,326 --> 00:12:12,557
We women have so much strength inside us.

196
00:12:12,646 --> 00:12:16,525
If we can endure the pain of childbirth,
imagine what else we're capable of.

197
00:12:16,606 --> 00:12:18,358
Right on, sister!

198
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:22,234
Wah, wah, wah. Come on!
It's only childbirth. How much could it hurt?

199
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:27,036
It's like taking your bottom lip and stretching
it over your head to the back of your neck.

200
00:12:27,126 --> 00:12:29,401
Hey, you wanna hear some horror stories,

201
00:12:29,486 --> 00:12:32,239
what about what I went through
when Lois was pregnant?

202
00:12:45,366 --> 00:12:49,723
We are conditioned to feel competitive with
other women when we should be supportive.

203
00:12:49,806 --> 00:12:54,561
Lizzy, I know you feel alone and unattractive
since your husband left you.

204
00:12:54,646 --> 00:12:59,162
But you are a beautiful person
and I am here for you.

205
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:03,285
Notice I'm making physical contact with her
in order to establish a connection.

206
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,880
You'd make more of a connection
if you hugged her.

207
00:13:05,966 --> 00:13:08,764
Very good, Peter! That's true.

208
00:13:09,606 --> 00:13:11,995
That's it. Now rub her back.

209
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:15,240
OK, that's good. Yeah, comfort her.

210
00:13:15,326 --> 00:13:17,840
Yeah. Oh, yeah. You like that, don't you?

211
00:13:17,926 --> 00:13:21,316
It's OK. It's OK to like it. It's very natural.

212
00:13:21,406 --> 00:13:24,398
OK, good, good. Now smell her a little.

213
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:30,040
- I can't do it.
- Yes, you can.

214
00:13:30,126 --> 00:13:33,198
Trust your sisters. Jump into the trust quilt.

215
00:13:33,286 --> 00:13:37,325
- Jump! Trust us. We love you!
- We'll catch you.

216
00:13:38,326 --> 00:13:40,317
OK, me next, me next!

217
00:13:41,846 --> 00:13:45,395
OK, ladies. I'm gonna start with
a Greg Louganis triple Salchow

218
00:13:45,486 --> 00:13:47,920
and tuck into a flying Mary Lou Retton half...

219
00:13:48,006 --> 00:13:50,076
Aagh! Aagh! Ooh! Aagh!

220
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,077
Ow! Aagh! Aagh! Aagh!

221
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,997
Aaaaaagh! Aagh! Ow!

222
00:13:56,006 --> 00:14:00,284
Now that you've felt a woman's pain,
the learning can begin.

223
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,523
Welcome back, Peter.

224
00:14:08,606 --> 00:14:10,278
Lois!

225
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:14,245
I missed you so much. And my babies!

226
00:14:14,326 --> 00:14:16,794
Chris, be a munchkin
and bring my bags inside.

227
00:14:16,886 --> 00:14:20,083
- Peter, you're, uh...
- Brian, put the tea on. I have stories.

228
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:23,283
But first I'm gonna go freshen up
and rinse out a few things.

229
00:14:23,366 --> 00:14:27,041
Oh, fudge! I broke a nail. Excuse me.

230
00:14:27,126 --> 00:14:29,117
Oh, my God! Dad's a chick!

231
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:37,716
I can't remember the last time
we cuddled like this.

232
00:14:37,806 --> 00:14:40,957
I can't remember the last time
I loved you so much.

233
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,276
Oh, how did you get so sweet?

234
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:46,597
When I was born, my mommy
dunked me in a barrel of sugar.

235
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:48,119
Oh, for God's sake.

236
00:14:55,886 --> 00:14:58,195
Oh, yes. Yes, I want the coffee cake.

237
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:02,002
- Hello!
- Hey, Quagmire.

238
00:15:02,086 --> 00:15:04,884
- Hey, Peter, what's up?
- Not much.

239
00:15:04,966 --> 00:15:08,754
- Well, what do you want?
- Nothing. I just called to talk.

240
00:15:09,886 --> 00:15:14,038
- What you thinking about?
- What do you mean? You called me.

241
00:15:14,126 --> 00:15:17,084
I just wanted to say hi. So what are you d...?

242
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:24,238
Sometimes I just can't believe
we could make something so beautiful.

243
00:15:24,326 --> 00:15:26,203
He looks just like his father.

244
00:15:26,286 --> 00:15:30,802
I really appreciate all the hard work you did
giving birth and mothering our kids.

245
00:15:30,886 --> 00:15:32,763
I'll never know that joy.

246
00:15:32,846 --> 00:15:36,555
Peter, I'm sure you would have been
a great mother if you'd had the chance.

247
00:15:36,646 --> 00:15:38,637
- You think so?
- I know so.

248
00:16:22,806 --> 00:16:25,274
One of these days
I'm gonna need the mirror.

249
00:16:25,366 --> 00:16:28,164
Oh, beans! I can't get this spit curl to...

250
00:16:28,766 --> 00:16:31,234
- Lois, what day is it?
- Thursday.

251
00:16:31,326 --> 00:16:34,602
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! I'm late.

252
00:16:34,686 --> 00:16:38,440
- If you spent less time fixing your hair...
- No, Lois. I'm late late!

253
00:16:38,526 --> 00:16:43,156
- Do we still have that pregnancy test?
- Are you insane? You can't have a baby.

254
00:16:43,246 --> 00:16:46,443
Well, I don't have a lot of options.
I'm Catholic!

255
00:16:46,526 --> 00:16:48,596
God! I thought you'd be happy!

256
00:16:54,766 --> 00:17:00,318
Oh. Oh, this is just great. Now my own wife is
forced to cook dinner for her lousy husband?

257
00:17:00,406 --> 00:17:03,523
Peter, you're my husband.
At least, you used to be.

258
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:07,042
Oh, Mother, I come bearing a gift.
I'll give you a hint.

259
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:11,244
- It's in my diaper and it's not a toaster.
- Meg, can you change Stewie?

260
00:17:11,326 --> 00:17:16,081
Fine. But this time if a boy calls,
please don't tell him I'm wrist-deep in poopie.

261
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:19,920
Honey, I'm glad you discovered
your feminine side,

262
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:22,918
but I didn't want you to forget about mine.

263
00:17:23,006 --> 00:17:25,315
Remember this? Huh?

264
00:17:25,406 --> 00:17:27,840
- Remember?
- Oh, my God. That reminds me.

265
00:17:27,926 --> 00:17:29,917
I gotta get myself a breast exam.

266
00:17:30,726 --> 00:17:32,921
Uh-oh. Uh-oh!

267
00:17:33,006 --> 00:17:35,839
A lump. A lump! Oh, God! Oh, God!

268
00:17:35,926 --> 00:17:37,803
No, Cheeto.

269
00:17:40,886 --> 00:17:42,717
Lois.

270
00:17:42,806 --> 00:17:44,478
How expected.

271
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:47,842
Hi, Glen. I'm sorry to bother you.
Is this a bad time?

272
00:17:47,926 --> 00:17:51,601
It's never a bad time when
you're with the Q man. Come on in.

273
00:17:51,686 --> 00:17:56,396
Well, as you may have noticed,
Peter's been acting a little different lately.

274
00:17:56,486 --> 00:18:01,514
It was refreshing at first, but now... well, he
doesn't even treat me like a woman any more.

275
00:18:01,606 --> 00:18:05,918
I know where this is going, Lois,
and I'm already semi there. Oh!

276
00:18:45,846 --> 00:18:49,202
Anyways, Glen,
I was wondering if you and Cleveland

277
00:18:49,286 --> 00:18:52,039
could help change Peter
back to the way he was.

278
00:18:52,646 --> 00:18:55,240
Of course that's why you're here.

279
00:18:56,006 --> 00:18:58,395
- Don't worry, I'd do everything to you.
- What?

280
00:18:58,486 --> 00:18:59,965
I'd do anything for you.

281
00:19:01,886 --> 00:19:05,561
If we're gonna remasculate Peter,
we need to surround him with chicks.

282
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:08,285
Let's blow this sausagefest
and hit the house of tail.

283
00:19:08,366 --> 00:19:12,518
No. He needs to learn
how to respect his fellow man.

284
00:19:12,606 --> 00:19:14,995
That's what this march is all about.

285
00:19:15,086 --> 00:19:17,805
Respect for your fellow man.

286
00:19:17,886 --> 00:19:21,640
I can't respect men. Men are the reason
our world is in such lousy shape.

287
00:19:21,726 --> 00:19:24,877
If men were as caring as women,
we wouldn't have crime or violence.

288
00:19:24,966 --> 00:19:27,764
My brothers, we need to stand together...

289
00:19:27,846 --> 00:19:32,158
Excuse me. I'd like to say a couple of truths
to the men in this audience.

290
00:19:32,246 --> 00:19:35,044
It's your fault we have
so much crime in this country

291
00:19:35,126 --> 00:19:38,118
and it's your fault we have
so much violence in this country.

292
00:19:38,206 --> 00:19:41,801
You are ruining our society
and you should be ashamed!

293
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:54,356
Look, I don't care how many letters we gotta
write. The View should be on for three hours.

294
00:19:54,446 --> 00:19:56,641
You just get going and it's News at Noon. 

295
00:19:56,726 --> 00:19:58,284
- Can we go soon?
- Not yet.

296
00:19:58,366 --> 00:20:01,961
Gloria Ironbox and Camille Paglia are
gonna whip it out and see whose is bigger.

297
00:20:02,046 --> 00:20:04,321
Peter, I'm so glad you could make it.

298
00:20:04,406 --> 00:20:08,160
- Gloria, this is my life partner Lois.
- I'm his wife.

299
00:20:08,246 --> 00:20:12,159
His wife, yes. Peter tells me
you don't have a career of your own.

300
00:20:12,246 --> 00:20:17,559
Oh, no. Life outside my kitchen
is so bright and scary.

301
00:20:17,646 --> 00:20:20,638
I'm just here because you caught me
between pregnancies.

302
00:20:20,726 --> 00:20:24,036
Well, I'm sorry you're so hostile
toward someone who's fighting

303
00:20:24,126 --> 00:20:27,641
so a woman like you can become
more than just a housewife.

304
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,365
Oh, just a housewife?

305
00:20:30,446 --> 00:20:35,361
Look, I'm all for equality,
but if you ask me feminism is about choice.

306
00:20:35,446 --> 00:20:39,758
I choose to be a wife and mother. And now
I'm choosing to end this conversation.

307
00:20:39,846 --> 00:20:42,883
No wonder your husband
didn't respect women.

308
00:20:42,966 --> 00:20:44,115
Excuse me?

309
00:20:44,206 --> 00:20:47,596
I can't imagine how screwed up
your kids must be.

310
00:20:47,686 --> 00:20:49,802
You bitch!

311
00:21:01,446 --> 00:21:05,121
Ten banana cream pies.

312
00:21:10,246 --> 00:21:12,635
Holy crap, this is hot.

313
00:21:25,926 --> 00:21:28,121
Lois, we gotta go.

314
00:21:32,846 --> 00:21:35,485
- That was wonderful.
- Who said that?

315
00:21:35,566 --> 00:21:39,320
Oh, hey, Lois. I'm starving.
How about a sandwich?

316
00:21:41,046 --> 00:21:45,517
- Glad to have you back, Peter.
- Lois, less talky, more fetchy.

317
00:21:45,606 --> 00:21:48,962
I'm just gonna assume
that's Chinese for "I love you".

318
00:22:22,606 --> 00:22:24,961
