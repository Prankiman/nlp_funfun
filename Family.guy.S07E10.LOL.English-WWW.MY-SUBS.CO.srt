1
00:00:34,857 --> 00:00:37,437
Check it out guys. New driver's license.

2
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:39,110
What's wrong with your picture?

3
00:00:39,111 --> 00:00:41,217
Well, see, I got drunk and
then got my picture taken.

4
00:00:41,252 --> 00:00:45,390
So that way, when I get pulled over
for drunk driving I'll look the
same as on my license.

5
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,415
Y'know, and then the copper,
copper'll say "Oh, you're fine,
you're not drunk.

6
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:50,687
This is you normal,
 I can tell by the picture."

7
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:52,092
I wish I thought of that.

8
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:54,482
I just got my new license a month ago.

9
00:00:56,632 --> 00:00:57,869
What's with the big grin?

10
00:00:57,869 --> 00:01:02,140
Oh, I'd just gotten a new tube of
Aquafresh and I was feeling cocky.

11
00:01:02,175 --> 00:01:04,110
Hey, let's see yours, Quagmire.

12
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:07,651
Hey, wait a second. You were born in 1948?

13
00:01:07,865 --> 00:01:08,446
Uuh....yeah.

14
00:01:08,481 --> 00:01:10,651
You're 61 years old?

15
00:01:10,652 --> 00:01:11,652
Ah, yes sir.

16
00:01:11,653 --> 00:01:12,935
What's your secret?

17
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:17,019
Uh...carrots. Sometimes I grind 'em
up into juice, or just eat 'em raw.

18
00:01:17,054 --> 00:01:20,245
Or insert them anally. Long as I
get 'em into my body somehow.

19
00:01:21,775 --> 00:01:22,914
Jigga-jigga.

20
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,887
And now back to the FOX News
Report with Rhonda Latimer.

21
00:01:25,922 --> 00:01:29,826
Oh, God. That new FOX news
reporter is so freakin' hot.

22
00:01:29,861 --> 00:01:33,719
Good evening. I'm Rhonda
Latimer for FOX News.
Here are tonight's top stories.

23
00:01:33,754 --> 00:01:36,546
Oh, she's just so smokin' hot.

24
00:01:36,617 --> 00:01:39,114
God, I would do things to her that....

25
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:41,446
...she would probably laugh at.

26
00:01:41,395 --> 00:01:42,532
You bitch!!

27
00:01:45,925 --> 00:01:48,052
Turn to the FOX News.
It's time for Rhonda Latimer.

28
00:01:48,452 --> 00:01:53,171
And we also want to remind
you that FOX News switches
to high definition starting Monday.

29
00:01:53,172 --> 00:01:55,871
Ah, crap! Does this mean gotta get a new TV?

30
00:01:55,872 --> 00:01:59,507
- Looks that way.
- Great, I need another expense
like I need a hole in the head.

31
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,213
And I don't need that.

32
00:02:01,095 --> 00:02:03,846
I'm tellin' you this thing has
turned out to be nothing but a burden.

33
00:02:03,543 --> 00:02:06,187
Oh, my God! Peter,
when did you get that?

34
00:02:06,188 --> 00:02:08,025
Oh, a few of the fellows
at work talked me into it.

35
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,577
Said it was something I might need.

36
00:02:09,743 --> 00:02:11,115
Wha...? It's horrible.

37
00:02:11,116 --> 00:02:14,154
The worst thing is, I found
out I got it on the gay side.

38
00:02:14,155 --> 00:02:15,852
- Hey, are you coming out tonight?

39
00:02:15,887 --> 00:02:18,379
I'm not gay. They put
the hole in the wrong side.

40
00:02:21,153 --> 00:02:23,163
All right family. The wait is over.

41
00:02:23,516 --> 00:02:26,214
I give you......
High Def television.

42
00:02:26,502 --> 00:02:28,083
Oooh! Can I have the box?

43
00:02:28,702 --> 00:02:31,806
Look at me. I'm an
Iraq war vet in 10 years.

44
00:02:32,138 --> 00:02:33,602
Naah! We're gonna take good care of them.

45
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,669
Wow! Look at that HD picture.

46
00:02:36,955 --> 00:02:40,265
Yeah, it's so clear you can
even see Ellen DeGeneris' breath.

47
00:02:40,765 --> 00:02:43,299
Well, my guest today is, uh, Seth Rogan.

48
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,300
Who's got a new movie out.

49
00:02:44,645 --> 00:02:46,675
Now, now Seth. This movie is hot.

50
00:02:46,946 --> 00:02:49,564
It's just hot......hot......hot.

51
00:02:49,565 --> 00:02:52,674
How's it feel to have
the hottest film in Hollywood?

52
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:53,967
What the #%*$ ???

53
00:02:57,729 --> 00:03:00,506
And now the real reason to have an HD TV.

54
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:04,161
And now the FOX News 6
o'clock report with Rhonda Latimer.

55
00:03:04,196 --> 00:03:05,575
In High Definition.

56
00:03:05,576 --> 00:03:10,232
Good evening everyone and I
hope you're as thrilled about
the new format change as I am.

57
00:03:10,073 --> 00:03:10,807
A-a-a-a-a-a-a!!!

58
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,424
            A-a-a-a-a-a-a!!!

59
00:03:11,545 --> 00:03:12,260
A-a-a-a-a-a-a!!!

60
00:03:12,328 --> 00:03:12,944
            A-a-a-a-a-a-a!!!

61
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:13,544
A-a-a-a-a-a-a!!!

62
00:03:13,643 --> 00:03:14,343
             A-a-a-a-a-a-a!!!

63
00:03:14,344 --> 00:03:15,044
A-a-a-a-a-a-a!!!

64
00:03:15,044 --> 00:03:15,499
           A-a-a-a-a-a-a!!!

65
00:03:15,745 --> 00:03:16,643
Oh no.

66
00:03:16,911 --> 00:03:17,857
Oh no.

67
00:03:17,858 --> 00:03:18,858
Oh.

68
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:19,859
A-a-a-a-a-a!

69
00:03:20,498 --> 00:03:22,976
I'll get all of the A's out of my body.

70
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,960
A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a!

71
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:32,212
We interrupt this report to
inform you Rhonda Latimer has
been relocated to Guantanamo Bay.

72
00:03:32,461 --> 00:03:35,467
Coming up, the new
format that makes HD obsolete.

73
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,639
Son of a bitch!

74
00:03:41,657 --> 00:03:45,145
Mom, do you ever feel....
not so fresh down there?

75
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:47,688
No. There must be something wrong with you.

76
00:03:47,753 --> 00:03:48,769
- Really?
- Yeah.

77
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,849
I've never had that problem
and I don't know any woman who has.

78
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:56,154
Hey, look at this. FOX News is looking
for a replacement for Rhonda Latimer.

79
00:03:56,189 --> 00:03:57,713
Hey, mom, you should try out.

80
00:03:57,714 --> 00:04:00,437
I mean, you majored in journalism
and you've never done anything with it.

81
00:04:00,784 --> 00:04:03,429
Well, I did write for my college newspaper.

82
00:04:03,563 --> 00:04:06,586
Yeah, didn't you do an interview
with that fast talking FedEx guy?

83
00:04:06,587 --> 00:04:08,924
Yeah, I ended up dating him for 3 months.

84
00:04:09,203 --> 00:04:11,098
Thats a beautiful shade of lipstick.
I bet you enjoy the music of Men at Work.

85
00:04:11,246 --> 00:04:13,260
You're incredibly foxy.
Take off your shirt. Take off your pants.

86
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,344
Wow, what a body, that feels good,
I'll give you a call. You'd better get tested.

87
00:04:15,784 --> 00:04:17,974
Yeah, mom, you should be a reporter.

88
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:20,367
Well, I mean I guess
there's no harm in trying out.

89
00:04:20,402 --> 00:04:24,292
Hey, Lois. A little less yackity-yak,
little more cuttin' up my banana.

90
00:04:24,293 --> 00:04:26,321
What am I supposed to do?
Stick the whole thing in my mouth?

91
00:04:26,406 --> 00:04:27,654
I mean .... Oh...... hello.

92
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,369
Lois, you can't possibly be
considering working for FOX News.

93
00:04:30,648 --> 00:04:31,784
Well, why not?

94
00:04:31,785 --> 00:04:34,120
Why not? Because they're
evil and they distort the truth.

95
00:04:34,155 --> 00:04:36,116
And they do the
bidding of the Republican party.

96
00:04:36,117 --> 00:04:38,154
I mean ... what other
reasons do you need?

97
00:04:38,155 --> 00:04:40,676
Don't listen to Brian, Lois.
You'd be great on camera.

98
00:04:40,677 --> 00:04:43,635
Like I was, when I played
that dead body on Law and Order.

99
00:04:43,636 --> 00:04:45,328
Well, until I got that itch in my crotch.

100
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,895
The contusion on
his left temple implies he
was hit by a blunt object.

101
00:04:48,486 --> 00:04:50,699
And the cuts imply a struggle.

102
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,648
- So it was murder?
- But the question is who?

103
00:04:53,649 --> 00:04:55,567
Well, whoever it was wears nail polish.

104
00:04:55,568 --> 00:04:59,810
- We found traces in the wounds.
- Well, that narrows it down.
At least we know it wasn't the father.

105
00:04:59,811 --> 00:05:01,631
Yeah, but we still gotta find out ...

106
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:07,821
Aaaaaaah ......... thank God.

107
00:05:13,507 --> 00:05:15,816
Alright, FOX News auditions. Take 1.

108
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:19,616
And even though this
Iraqi veteran lost his hands

109
00:05:19,617 --> 00:05:22,367
he didn't lose his ability to feel.

110
00:05:22,368 --> 00:05:24,751
I'm Lois Griffen for FOX News.

111
00:05:24,752 --> 00:05:27,499
- Great story, Lois.
- Thanks. I just made it up.

112
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,278
Y'know, I've been doing
this job a long time, and I
think  you've got what it takes.

113
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,051
Ha-haa. You're kidding. Really?

114
00:05:33,052 --> 00:05:36,226
Yes. How would you like to
be our newest on-air reporter?

115
00:05:36,227 --> 00:05:40,083
W-w-well ... y'know I came down
here not even thinking I had a shot

116
00:05:40,084 --> 00:05:42,035
and now you're telling me this?

117
00:05:42,473 --> 00:05:45,020
Gosh, it's an awfully big decision.

118
00:05:45,021 --> 00:05:47,858
Lois, please. Take the job for FOX sake.

119
00:05:47,859 --> 00:05:51,094
Well .... alright. I'll do it!

120
00:05:51,095 --> 00:05:52,663
Great. Here's your contract.

121
00:05:52,698 --> 00:05:55,797
Now run home Lois.
Run as fast as you can.

122
00:06:14,702 --> 00:06:16,572
A-a-a-a-a-h.

123
00:06:18,032 --> 00:06:19,781
A-a-a-a-a-h.

124
00:06:21,426 --> 00:06:23,095
A-a-a-a-a-h.

125
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:26,520
A-a-a-a-a-h.

126
00:06:28,385 --> 00:06:30,556
A-a-a-a-a-a-h.

127
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:39,249
Good morning everyone.
Well, do I look TV ready?

128
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:44,009
Lois, I can't believe you're
doing this. If you work for FOX News
you're  going to be selling your soul.

129
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,896
Oh, Brian, come on!
They're a major news network.

130
00:06:46,931 --> 00:06:48,832
I would think you would be excited for me.

131
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:52,681
Are you kidding?
They're a lie factory. They report
whatever they damn well please.

132
00:06:52,682 --> 00:06:56,169
Y'know Brian, you're welcome
to come with me to see for
yourself that it's all on the level.

133
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,533
Y'now, I just might
take you up on that, Lois.

134
00:06:58,534 --> 00:07:01,075
And I know another way
we can take advantage of this.

135
00:07:01,076 --> 00:07:04,571
Chris ... Meg. Meet me in
the living room in 10 minutes
and bring a pencil and paper.

136
00:07:06,415 --> 00:07:10,057
- Dad? What are we doing?
- Meg, now that Lois has connections at FOX,

137
00:07:10,058 --> 00:07:12,866
we are gonna invent our own cartoon show.

138
00:07:12,867 --> 00:07:15,734
And we are here to
brainstorm ideas. Alright, GO!

139
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,067
Anything that pops into your head.

140
00:07:17,068 --> 00:07:19,785
Ooh ... how about a show
about a bunch of disabled ducks

141
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,782
and we'll call it "Handi-Quacks."

142
00:07:21,643 --> 00:07:24,422
Wow, caught fire a little earlier
than I thought we would, Perfect!

143
00:07:24,423 --> 00:07:28,139
Alright, let's spend many hours on this.
Alright, the main duck ... what's his name?

144
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,485
I don't know, uh ... Red Hynie Monkey?

145
00:07:30,486 --> 00:07:33,967
Ha-ha-ha, I love it.
I love it. Alright, now what's
his wacky neighbour duck's name?

146
00:07:33,834 --> 00:07:34,798
Giddy Goose?

147
00:07:35,227 --> 00:07:38,976
Meg, please try to formulate
ideas clearly before you vocalize them.

148
00:07:38,977 --> 00:07:40,710
I'm not sure you're gettin' the show, Meg.

149
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,192
Alright. Names. Names. Names. C'mon now.

150
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,270
Poopy Faced Tomato Nose.

151
00:07:44,271 --> 00:07:46,669
Yes! Write it down.
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!

152
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,926
Maybe they live in a pond?

153
00:07:48,672 --> 00:07:50,775
Chris, can I talk to
you in the kitchen for a sec?

154
00:07:52,928 --> 00:07:55,545
- I don't think she's gettin' it ...
- I know she's not gettin' it, but ...

155
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,328
- There's no 'but', she's not gettin' it.
- What the hell d'ya wanna do?

156
00:07:58,363 --> 00:08:00,359
- She's poison.
- Absolutely, she's dead weight.

157
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:03,895
- She doesn't understand.
- .....it's just not funny

158
00:08:03,975 --> 00:08:07,949
- She's completely ruining it.
- Yeah, but I think it's important to
have a female perspective in the room.

159
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,542
Alright, then I think we're going to
have to expect nothing, right, and then

160
00:08:10,577 --> 00:08:12,153
- maybe be pleasantly surprised.
- OK.

161
00:08:16,921 --> 00:08:19,672
Welcome to FOX News, Lois.
We're very excited to have you.

162
00:08:19,673 --> 00:08:21,837
Well, I'm excited to be here.

163
00:08:21,838 --> 00:08:26,016
Oh, this is my dog, Brian. He
was just dying to see the studio.

164
00:08:26,017 --> 00:08:28,093
- Well, hi there, Brian.
- How's it going, Adolf?

165
00:08:28,094 --> 00:08:30,801
I'll have you know my
grandparents died in the holocaust.

166
00:08:31,402 --> 00:08:33,855
Ha-ha-ha, No, I'm just joking.
They were there though.

167
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:37,093
This whole place just feels like a warm blanket.

168
00:08:37,094 --> 00:08:40,848
I'll show you to our day
care facilities shortly, but
first let's have a look around.

169
00:08:42,142 --> 00:08:44,459
This is our control room,
where we have the ability

170
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,527
to monitor up to 500 different
news stories in any given hour.

171
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:50,441
- What's that big button do?
- Oh, that's kinda fun.

172
00:08:50,442 --> 00:08:52,848
It emits a noise that only Al Gore can hear.

173
00:08:55,048 --> 00:08:58,157
- There it is again.
- It's probably just wind, honey.

174
00:08:58,251 --> 00:08:59,251
It's not the wind!

175
00:09:00,764 --> 00:09:04,565
And this is the kitchen. We've got all
kinds of snacks and cold drinks in here.

176
00:09:04,566 --> 00:09:05,892
Well, I don't see the refrigerator.

177
00:09:05,893 --> 00:09:08,044
Oh, we just use Anne Coulter.

178
00:09:09,642 --> 00:09:10,628
Hmmmmm......

179
00:09:10,629 --> 00:09:12,610
There's never anything good in here.

180
00:09:15,953 --> 00:09:18,905
Alright, here we go. Handy Quacks.
Episode 1, scene 1.

181
00:09:18,906 --> 00:09:22,310
Let's get 'em laughing right off the bat.
"Interior, Red Hynie Monkey's house."

182
00:09:22,345 --> 00:09:23,711
What's Red Hynie Monkey doing?

183
00:09:23,812 --> 00:09:27,999
Um, maybe he just got up?
He's making breakfast?

184
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,008
Ah, I don't think people eat
breakfast anymore. More suggestions.

185
00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:33,912
Ooh! What if Red Hynie Monkey
and Poopy Faced Tomato Nose

186
00:09:33,987 --> 00:09:35,987
are trying to build a house of cards

187
00:09:35,988 --> 00:09:37,703
and it keeps falling down?

188
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:41,652
- Oh, ho-ho. Jiminy Christmas, we
have all been there. That's goin' in.

189
00:09:41,653 --> 00:09:43,873
Oh, we are cooking.
Cooking, cooking, cooking.

190
00:09:44,074 --> 00:09:47,295
Now. Alright. Let's take a walk down
this road and see where it leads us.

191
00:09:47,196 --> 00:09:48,439
Dialogue. What are they saying?

192
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,474
Umm ... maybe Poopy
Faced  Tomato Nose says, uh ..

193
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,464
"Boy, this house of cards
just doesn't wanna stay up."

194
00:09:55,465 --> 00:09:58,113
Well, I mean, yeah, if you wanna
go right at it like a neanderthal

195
00:09:58,148 --> 00:10:00,656
sure, but I think we're shooting
for a little more subtilty here, y'know.

196
00:10:00,691 --> 00:10:04,177
Y'know, I don't believe
that. I don't believe that that's a

197
00:10:04,217 --> 00:10:07,373
real conversation when I hear
it. People don't talk like that, Meg.

198
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:10,235
Oooh ...oooh! What if they just
bought a new wood stove

199
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:15,076
and Red Hynie Monkey says,
"Boy, it's so hot in here because
we just bought that new wood stove

200
00:10:15,077 --> 00:10:17,181
(Both) and we're sweating,
and our hands are all slippery

201
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:19,359
and that's why we can't
get the card house to stay up."

202
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,408
Thank you, Chris.
We have lift off! Ha ha ha!

203
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:27,106
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry but none
of this stuff seems to make sense.

204
00:10:27,107 --> 00:10:30,179
I mean, we haven't even
referenced the fact that they're ducks

205
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,344
or that they're handicapped.
But the show is called "Handi-Quacks."

206
00:10:36,087 --> 00:10:38,066
Uh-huh. Chris, can
I see you in the kitchen?

207
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,649
- This is not working out. This is not workin' ..
- Dad, Dad, she's trying ....

208
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,638
- She gets along with everybody.
- She does not get along with everybody.

209
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:49,566
- She's kinda hot.
- She's 'Office' hot.

210
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,351
- You're right. You're right.
- She's the only woman around.

211
00:10:51,352 --> 00:10:52,352
Yeah, in the real world
she doesn't know about it.

212
00:10:52,353 --> 00:10:54,446
And in addition to
everything else, she's GOT B.O.!!

213
00:10:54,594 --> 00:10:55,360
She's got B.O.

214
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,206
Alright, Lois, for your first assignment
we want you to do

215
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:06,444
an investigative expose on
one of America's greatest enemies.

216
00:11:06,445 --> 00:11:09,376
Oh, that sounds important.
Who is it?

217
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,210
Michael Moore.

218
00:11:10,334 --> 00:11:13,134
Oh, here we go. This is exactly
what I was talking about, Lois.

219
00:11:13,169 --> 00:11:15,824
FOX News will take down
anyone who doesn't agree with them.

220
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:18,118
Wha...? Now wait a
minute, Brian. Give him a chance.

221
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:20,158
What exactly do you want me to do?

222
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:22,000
We have reason to
suspect that Michael Moore

223
00:11:22,035 --> 00:11:25,041
may be a closet homosexual.
We need you to get the proof.

224
00:11:25,042 --> 00:11:27,994
Well, if you think that Michael
Moore's possible homosexuality

225
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:30,693
is news worthy, I'll
do my best to get the story.

226
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,882
Alright, I have come up
with a design for Red Hynie Monkey

227
00:11:37,883 --> 00:11:39,266
the head of the Handi-Quacks.

228
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:41,720
I want only positive feedback, please.

229
00:11:41,721 --> 00:11:43,740
Why does he have such a big red bum?

230
00:11:43,741 --> 00:11:45,283
Because it's funny, Meg.

231
00:11:45,284 --> 00:11:47,034
People will tune in
to Handi-Quacks each week

232
00:11:47,069 --> 00:11:49,257
and see that big red
bum and get a big laugh out of it.

233
00:11:49,258 --> 00:11:51,699
Why? Because it's relatable.

234
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,384
- They'll see themselves in it.
- I think the design is great, Dad.

235
00:11:55,385 --> 00:11:59,000
Good note. Good note. OK, now I
also had a thought for a female character

236
00:11:59,001 --> 00:12:01,380
who's always nagging at
Red Hynie Monkey, and telling him not

237
00:12:01,415 --> 00:12:03,514
to leave his beer cans
lying around and what-not.

238
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:05,452
And her name is Bitch Duck.

239
00:12:05,453 --> 00:12:07,833
- That kinda looks like mom.
- Not finished talking, Meg.

240
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:10,209
OK, and this is Poopy Faced Tomato Nose.

241
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,207
You can see I gave him a funny little suitcase.

242
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,784
Now, see the joke
is, most people only carry

243
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:16,497
a suitcase when
they're going on vacation.

244
00:12:16,498 --> 00:12:19,846
But Poopy Faced Tomato
Nose carries one all the time.

245
00:12:19,847 --> 00:12:23,445
And see, he's got a sleeve
hangin' out. He didn't pack it right.

246
00:12:23,446 --> 00:12:24,852
Oh, well, you know
what could be funny?

247
00:12:24,887 --> 00:12:27,108
Maybe one week
he actually goes on vacation.

248
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:30,629
And ... he's already got the suitcase.

249
00:12:31,553 --> 00:12:33,422
Chris, can I see you in the kitchen for a sec?

250
00:12:34,677 --> 00:12:38,570
Your writing partner is out of her mind.
- OK first of all stop calling her my parsha.

251
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,030
- She's terrible.
- I know that.

252
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:42,380
But you know what? It's not fair to her.

253
00:12:42,381 --> 00:12:44,967
- Well, that's sort of a cop out.
- Having her here is not fair to her.

254
00:12:44,968 --> 00:12:47,076
Dad, if you want to fire
her, you go ahead and fire her.

255
00:12:47,077 --> 00:12:49,409
But don't pretend that
you're doing it for her benefit.

256
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,410
- Don't put that on me, she firing herself.
- She's can't fire herself.

257
00:12:50,411 --> 00:12:52,683
- No, you decide ...
- She's firing herself.
- She's can't fire herself.

258
00:12:52,684 --> 00:12:55,210
- You decided ...
- And her lack of talent and her lack of funniness...

259
00:12:55,211 --> 00:12:59,721
I just, y'know I just feel that
you and I have captured lightning
in a bottle with the Handi-Quacks.

260
00:12:59,998 --> 00:13:02,903
- We have. Yes!
- And she's just coming in,
unscrewin' the top and lettin' it all out.

261
00:13:03,863 --> 00:13:06,084
Meg, you're services will no longer be needed.

262
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,473
Ah, still nothing.

263
00:13:15,474 --> 00:13:18,612
I don't understand. The lights
are on. Somebody must be home.

264
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:20,396
Aah! Get down.

265
00:13:23,227 --> 00:13:24,731
Rush Limbaugh?

266
00:13:24,732 --> 00:13:28,094
What's he doing coming out
of Michael Moore's house at this hour?

267
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:31,194
Unless .... Oh, my God.

268
00:13:31,595 --> 00:13:33,306
Oh, my God, it's true!

269
00:13:33,707 --> 00:13:38,118
Michael Moore is
gay with Rush Limbaugh!

270
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,612
And I just laid in dog poop.

271
00:13:40,613 --> 00:13:43,755
That's not dog poop.
Sorry, we've been out here a long time.

272
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:53,303
And look, there's Rush
Limbaugh coming out of Michael
Moore's house at 2 in the morning.

273
00:13:53,304 --> 00:13:55,542
I wouldn't believe
it if I hadn't seen it myself.

274
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,725
Well, your dog was right,
Lois. Looks like there's no story here.

275
00:13:58,726 --> 00:14:02,152
- Michael Moore is clearly not gay.
- Wha...? No story?

276
00:14:02,153 --> 00:14:04,565
What are you talking about?
You're the one who sent me to

277
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,982
investigate, and now I'm showing
you proof and you're dismissing it?

278
00:14:08,482 --> 00:14:09,779
I don't understand.

279
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:13,925
Lois, I'll be honest.
Rush Limbaugh is one of us.

280
00:14:13,926 --> 00:14:16,058
We have no wish to smear a fellow conservative.

281
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:19,676
That would be as foolish as F.D.R
hiring that midget press secretary.

282
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:25,170
The President has just
confirmed a devastating surprise attack

283
00:14:25,171 --> 00:14:26,896
by the Japanese at Pearl Harbor.

284
00:14:27,097 --> 00:14:29,371
Much of our naval
fleet has been destroyed

285
00:14:29,372 --> 00:14:32,450
and the death toll is
believed to be in the thousands.

286
00:14:32,451 --> 00:14:34,372
He's adorable!

287
00:14:37,547 --> 00:14:41,298
OK, actors. Welcome to the
first voice record for Handi-Quacks.

288
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:44,658
Alright. Episode 1. "What the Duck?"
Take 1.

289
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:47,567
Oh, darn it, Poopy Faced Tomato Nose.

290
00:14:47,602 --> 00:14:51,669
I know, Red Hynie Monkey.
This card house won't stay up.

291
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:54,594
Probably because the
wood stove is so warm.

292
00:14:54,595 --> 00:14:56,893
It's making our
hands sweaty and slippery.

293
00:14:56,928 --> 00:14:57,999
It's all comin' together.

294
00:14:58,183 --> 00:15:01,224
It's all comin' together.
This is it. Our vision. Come to life.

295
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:03,252
I know. Just listen to that voice.

296
00:15:03,253 --> 00:15:06,273
And then picture him holding that
suitcase with the sleeve sticking out.

297
00:15:06,274 --> 00:15:07,074
Ha-ha.

298
00:15:07,175 --> 00:15:10,399
- Hi, everybody.
- Hello, Colonel Tush Finger.

299
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,768
I just built a space ship. Wanna
come up in space with me in it?

300
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:16,586
Whoa. Whoah, Whoah, Whoah.
Cut. Cut. Cut, Cut.

301
00:15:16,587 --> 00:15:18,324
Cleveland. What are you doing?

302
00:15:18,325 --> 00:15:22,737
I just figured I'd give Colonel
Tush Finger an Australian thing.

303
00:15:22,738 --> 00:15:25,094
Colonel Tush Finger
lives on the moon, you idiot!

304
00:15:25,095 --> 00:15:27,392
He talks with a moon accent. Y'know?

305
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,529
He. talks. like. this.
with. a. moon. accent.

306
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:32,753
You understand? I. am. Colonel.
Tush. Finger. and. I. live. on. the. moon

307
00:15:32,754 --> 00:15:35,295
so. I. talk. like. this.
with. a. moon. accent. Do that!

308
00:15:35,496 --> 00:15:38,378
- You know, Bonnie also acts.
- Oh, here we go.

309
00:15:41,714 --> 00:15:46,033
So they want me to drop the
story completely because they don't
want to embarrass Rush Limbaugh.

310
00:15:46,034 --> 00:15:48,238
Now do you see what
I was saying about FOX News?

311
00:15:48,273 --> 00:15:50,461
They have an incredibly biased agenda.

312
00:15:50,462 --> 00:15:52,734
- You should do the story anyway.
- You think so?

313
00:15:52,735 --> 00:15:55,638
Absolutely. They're hypocrites. They
wanted you to do the story when they

314
00:15:55,673 --> 00:15:58,173
thought it would embarrass Michael
Moore, but they don't want you to

315
00:15:58,177 --> 00:16:00,142
do it if it's going to
embarrass Rush Limbaugh.

316
00:16:00,243 --> 00:16:03,674
But you didn't want me
to do the story when it was
gonna embarrass Michael Moore.

317
00:16:03,675 --> 00:16:07,150
But you want me to
do the story if it's gonna
embarrass Rush Limbaugh?

318
00:16:07,151 --> 00:16:10,938
Can you picture the 2 of those
guys pokin' each other in the chops?

319
00:16:10,939 --> 00:16:13,780
Eeuugh! It'd be like sticking
your arm in a backed up sink.

320
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:17,874
OK. You're right. I'm a little biased
myself but at least I'm willing to admit it.

321
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,898
Imagine that? The 2 of them going at it?

322
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:24,869
An oversized Armani suit and an
oversized cheap wind breaker
tossed casually on the floor.

323
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:28,150
Look, they started this,
Lois. But it's up to you to finish it.

324
00:16:28,151 --> 00:16:29,675
I guess you're right, Brian.

325
00:16:29,676 --> 00:16:33,128
Next day at work, Limbaugh finds
a Detroit Tigers ball cap up in there.

326
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,677
- Stewie, shut up!
- Why? It's just a weird image.

327
00:16:35,891 --> 00:16:39,318
Like the way Commissioner Gordon
tells Batman that he just took a poop.

328
00:16:40,593 --> 00:16:42,507
Eeuugh! I don't need to know about that.

329
00:16:48,288 --> 00:16:50,067
Thanks for hearing our pitch, Mr Chernin.

330
00:16:50,103 --> 00:16:53,019
You realise that the only
reason I'm taking this meeting is that

331
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,963
your wife is a reporter for our news division?

332
00:16:54,964 --> 00:16:57,286
You have absolutely no prior credits.

333
00:16:57,287 --> 00:16:59,221
Sir, I promise you won't regret it.

334
00:16:59,222 --> 00:17:01,316
Handi-Quacks is going to be the next Simpsons.

335
00:17:01,317 --> 00:17:03,647
We fire the jokes at you
like an automatic weapon of comedy.

336
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,706
We throw a curve ball joke
at you, hit you right in the head

337
00:17:05,741 --> 00:17:07,390
You go "Wow, what happened?"

338
00:17:07,391 --> 00:17:08,142
Hmmmmmmm.

339
00:17:08,143 --> 00:17:11,349
We take you on a little trolley ride
down story lane. You're havin' a good time,

340
00:17:11,384 --> 00:17:13,417
enjoying out little tale, think
you know what's coming. BOOM!

341
00:17:13,436 --> 00:17:17,285
Left turn! You don't know how
it happened. You don't know
where you are, but you like it.

342
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,282
Uh-huh?

343
00:17:17,282 --> 00:17:20,284
You're watchin' the show. The ducks are sayin' stuff.

344
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,971
You're yukking it up, you're
laughing, your sides are hurting.
All of a sudden you realise,

345
00:17:22,996 --> 00:17:24,397
you're feeling something too.

346
00:17:24,732 --> 00:17:25,964
When did that happen?

347
00:17:25,965 --> 00:17:28,324
When did the Handi-Quacks
become people I care about?

348
00:17:28,325 --> 00:17:31,136
When did they become like
welcome guests in your home

349
00:17:31,171 --> 00:17:33,787
whose weekly visits the
whole family eagerly awaits?

350
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:36,070
Take a look at what we got, Peter.

351
00:17:38,345 --> 00:17:40,861
♪ One day 3 ducks
were crossing the road ♪

352
00:17:40,862 --> 00:17:43,095
♪ Going to get some soda ♪

353
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:45,463
♪ But they weren't looking
where they were going ♪

354
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,862
♪ And a bus came along and hit them all ♪

355
00:17:47,863 --> 00:17:50,405
♪ Now they're handicap-ded

356
00:17:50,406 --> 00:17:53,741
Yeah ... Uh ... N-no, that's pretty much it..

357
00:17:54,413 --> 00:17:55,649
♪ Handi-Quacks ♪

358
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:59,864
♪ And they never got their soda ♪

359
00:18:03,389 --> 00:18:05,720
Why won't this card house stay up?

360
00:18:05,721 --> 00:18:11,341
Our palms are slippery and sweaty
because of the heat from that
new wood stove we just bought.

361
00:18:11,342 --> 00:18:13,655
(Giggles) That's gonna be his catch phrase.

362
00:18:13,656 --> 00:18:16,107
How did you afford that wood stove?

363
00:18:16,108 --> 00:18:19,220
Easy. I just walked into
the wood stove store and said

364
00:18:19,455 --> 00:18:21,044
"Put it on my bill."

365
00:18:21,045 --> 00:18:24,000
- Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
- Ah ha ha. You with me?

366
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:25,823
- I sure am.
- You're with me now?

367
00:18:25,824 --> 00:18:27,473
- I love it.
- You know you love it.

368
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,949
I just have one small change.

369
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:33,866
- Oh?
- Could Poopy Faced
Tomato Nose's nose be a plum?

370
00:18:34,775 --> 00:18:37,315
How dare you?

371
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:41,116
It's a small change. And if you do
it, we'll really get behind this show.

372
00:18:41,117 --> 00:18:43,664
A plum? What is this .... 1986?

373
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:47,703
Well, if you're gonna
be a TV producer, you've
gotta be open to collaboration.

374
00:18:47,704 --> 00:18:52,104
So everybody just
gets to stick their big chef's
spoon  into my comedy gumbo, eh?

375
00:18:52,105 --> 00:18:53,248
Well, no deal!

376
00:18:53,249 --> 00:18:56,001
You know something? I like your passion.

377
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:58,897
OK, we'll do the show, and we'll do it your way.

378
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,399
No.

379
00:19:01,586 --> 00:19:03,420
Well, that was a miscalculation.

380
00:19:06,287 --> 00:19:08,354
Alright, there it is. Stay close to me.

381
00:19:20,602 --> 00:19:22,170
Aah, this is it. Let's go.

382
00:19:23,676 --> 00:19:27,713
Mr Moore. Mr Limbaugh.
Do you have anything to say to
FOX News about this ...

383
00:19:28,046 --> 00:19:29,181
What the hell??

384
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:30,497
Who are you?

385
00:19:30,498 --> 00:19:32,083
What's that suit on the bed?

386
00:19:32,084 --> 00:19:34,646
And what have you done
with your gay lover, Rush Limbaugh?

387
00:19:35,087 --> 00:19:38,294
Aaaah. I am Rush
Limbaugh. That's a costume.

388
00:19:38,295 --> 00:19:40,663
Wait a minute! You mean
all these years Rush Limbaugh

389
00:19:40,698 --> 00:19:42,615
has just been Michael Moore in disguise?

390
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:45,447
Well, it's a little more complex than that.

391
00:19:45,448 --> 00:19:46,913
What are you talkin' about?

392
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:53,449
- Fred Savage?!
- Wait a minute. You're Rush
Limbaugh AND Michael Moore?

393
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:56,199
Yes I am. They're both characters I created.

394
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,120
But ...... why?

395
00:19:58,121 --> 00:20:01,774
Well, after the Wonder
Years I was hungry to do more
acting but the pickings were slim

396
00:20:01,775 --> 00:20:04,939
so I came up with this
scheme to satisfy my need to perform

397
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,627
and I guess it got a little out of hand.

398
00:20:06,628 --> 00:20:07,750
This is unbelievable.

399
00:20:07,751 --> 00:20:09,044
Well that's not the end of it.

400
00:20:09,604 --> 00:20:12,983
I'm also Tony Danza, Camryn
Manheim, Malcolm-Jamar Warner,

401
00:20:13,028 --> 00:20:14,028
Kevin Nealon, John Forsythe, 

402
00:20:14,094 --> 00:20:16,259
and Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich.

403
00:20:16,532 --> 00:20:21,414
Wow! Fred Savage is the
greatest actor in the history of the world.

404
00:20:21,615 --> 00:20:23,365
That's all I ever wanted people to know.

405
00:20:23,366 --> 00:20:26,539
Well if you let us run this
story, I promise you they will.

406
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,012
You got a deal.

407
00:20:28,013 --> 00:20:29,715
Well, it finally happened.

408
00:20:29,716 --> 00:20:32,424
I had finally gotten
the recognition I deserved.

409
00:20:32,425 --> 00:20:33,472
I don't need you anymore!!

410
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,805
This Sunday on FOX, it's the new hit comedy

411
00:20:41,806 --> 00:20:44,896
starring America's greatest actor, Fred Savage.

412
00:20:44,897 --> 00:20:47,611
Well, Lois, you did a
good thing for a talented guy.

413
00:20:47,612 --> 00:20:49,621
Yeah, but that should've been our timeslot.

414
00:20:49,622 --> 00:20:51,705
Well I'm just glad that
everything's back to normal.

415
00:20:51,706 --> 00:20:54,248
I don't think I was cut
out to be a TV reporter.

416
00:20:54,249 --> 00:20:56,304
Yeah, how did you lose your job there anyway?

417
00:20:56,305 --> 00:20:58,625
Oh, I don't know.
Do you really care, Peter?

418
00:20:58,626 --> 00:21:00,257
Does anyone really care?

419
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:01,529
Yeah, you're right.

420
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,914
The story's over. Everything
will be back to normal next week.

421
00:21:03,915 --> 00:21:05,146
So yeah, who gives a damn.

422
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:06,901
Anybody got any more jokes?

423
00:21:06,902 --> 00:21:08,779
Stewie? Anything funny? No?

424
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,064
Brian? Meg? Chris?

425
00:21:11,265 --> 00:21:11,754
No?

426
00:21:11,755 --> 00:21:14,136
Alright. See ya folks.

427
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,000
