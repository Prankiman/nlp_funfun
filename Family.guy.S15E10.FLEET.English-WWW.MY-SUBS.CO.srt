1
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:41,892
And now,
The History Channel presents

2
00:00:41,928 --> 00:00:45,663
The True Story of Henry Ford.

3
00:00:45,698 --> 00:00:47,999
This is my Jew Flattening Machine.

4
00:00:48,034 --> 00:00:49,600
It'll flatten any Jew.

5
00:00:49,636 --> 00:00:50,901
Simply climb behind the wheel,

6
00:00:50,937 --> 00:00:52,703
drive it towards a Jew, and flatten him.

7
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,405
Could you also use it just to drive

8
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,073
from place to place and stuff?

9
00:00:56,109 --> 00:00:57,508
It-It's a Jew Flattening Machine.

10
00:00:57,543 --> 00:00:58,776
It's not what it's designed for.

11
00:00:58,811 --> 00:01:00,244
But you could use it that way?

12
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,013
Yeah, yeah, you cou...
Yeah, yeah, you-you could

13
00:01:02,048 --> 00:01:05,116
also use the Mona Lisa
as a placemat. God.

14
00:01:05,151 --> 00:01:06,651
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hey, Quagmire.

15
00:01:06,686 --> 00:01:08,452
How was marching band practice?

16
00:01:08,488 --> 00:01:10,788
Peter, you know
this is a pilot's uniform.

17
00:01:10,823 --> 00:01:13,057
It represents years
of specialized training.

18
00:01:13,092 --> 00:01:14,492
Yeah, well, you know
what else takes years

19
00:01:14,527 --> 00:01:16,761
of specialized training?
Crossing your eyes.

20
00:01:18,965 --> 00:01:20,798
Aah! Aah! Aah! Too far! Too far!

21
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:22,800
Hold still.

22
00:01:25,738 --> 00:01:27,972
Thank you, Korean sweatshop animator.

23
00:01:28,007 --> 00:01:30,141
You've earned your nickel this week.

24
00:01:30,176 --> 00:01:31,609
Where're you coming from, Quagmire?

25
00:01:31,644 --> 00:01:34,078
I had to fly to Aruba,
so I brought my mom along

26
00:01:34,113 --> 00:01:35,880
with my "friends and family" discount.

27
00:01:35,915 --> 00:01:36,881
Did you...

28
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:39,450
Yes, Joe, I got you a magnet.

29
00:01:39,485 --> 00:01:41,619
Where do you even
put all those magnets, Joe?

30
00:01:41,654 --> 00:01:43,721
Well, you know I have
that fridge in the garage

31
00:01:43,756 --> 00:01:45,756
with bags of blood in my blood type?

32
00:01:47,727 --> 00:01:49,293
What's "friends and family"?

33
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:51,329
Oh, airline employees
can get discounted tickets

34
00:01:51,364 --> 00:01:53,064
for family and close friends.

35
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:55,499
What? How-how come
you've never done that for us?

36
00:01:55,535 --> 00:01:57,001
If I'm being honest, I've also got

37
00:01:57,036 --> 00:01:58,636
a few Celeste pizzas in that fridge.

38
00:01:58,671 --> 00:02:00,771
I don't know, I-I guess
I just figured you guys

39
00:02:00,807 --> 00:02:02,673
always have to work,
or you're with your kids.

40
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:04,308
But sure, yeah,
I could take you somewhere.

41
00:02:04,344 --> 00:02:06,777
I'm going to San Francisco next
week. You guys want to come?

42
00:02:06,813 --> 00:02:08,312
San Francisco?

43
00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:10,548
That city from And the Band
Played On and Milk?

44
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:11,749
I'm in!

45
00:02:11,784 --> 00:02:13,250
Yeah, thanks, Quagmire.

46
00:02:13,286 --> 00:02:14,885
Oh, wow, this'll be great.

47
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:16,921
Hey, can you make us X-Men?

48
00:02:20,393 --> 00:02:22,560
What a surprise.

49
00:02:26,632 --> 00:02:28,766
Well, I'm off to San Francisco
with the guys.

50
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:31,502
Okay, I'm off to Hilton Head
with the girls.

51
00:02:31,537 --> 00:02:32,703
- You what?
- Peter,

52
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:34,939
I told you about this a month ago.

53
00:02:34,974 --> 00:02:36,440
I'm going with Bonnie and Donna

54
00:02:36,476 --> 00:02:38,209
to Donna's sister's time share.

55
00:02:38,244 --> 00:02:40,711
Well, we can't both
go on a trip at the same time.

56
00:02:40,747 --> 00:02:43,981
I'm sorry, Peter, but I already
have a taxi waiting.

57
00:02:44,016 --> 00:02:47,151
All right, I'll go
tell the guys I'm not going.

58
00:02:47,186 --> 00:02:49,687
Why is he taking his suitcase
to tell the guys?

59
00:02:49,722 --> 00:02:51,655
You guys, come on, we got to
go now. Let's go, move it.

60
00:02:51,691 --> 00:02:53,023
I'm in the shower.
It doesn't matter,

61
00:02:53,059 --> 00:02:55,826
we're stealing Lois' cab.

62
00:02:55,862 --> 00:02:57,228
Son of a...

63
00:02:57,263 --> 00:03:01,065
Oh, and the idiot took my suitcase.

64
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,969
Aw, he was taking me with him.

65
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:14,245
Ah, San Francisco.

66
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,480
Aah! San Francisco!

67
00:03:16,516 --> 00:03:17,948
So what are we gonna do first?

68
00:03:17,984 --> 00:03:19,483
I want to see the Golden Gate Bridge.

69
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,118
I want to see Lombard Street.

70
00:03:21,154 --> 00:03:22,553
I want to see Ghirardelli Square.

71
00:03:22,588 --> 00:03:23,854
Guys, guys.

72
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,224
Let's get lesbian
haircuts and see 'em all.

73
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,746
All right, the gay jokes
are out of the way,

74
00:03:48,781 --> 00:03:50,614
now let's get down to business.

75
00:03:54,654 --> 00:03:58,022
Okay, guys, this is the
original Levi Jeans factory,

76
00:03:58,057 --> 00:04:01,559
created by Levi Strauss in the year 1853

77
00:04:01,594 --> 00:04:04,361
so that gold miners could wear a
comfortable yet durable fabric.

78
00:04:04,397 --> 00:04:05,763
This is boring.

79
00:04:05,798 --> 00:04:07,498
Well, then you plan the vacation!

80
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:08,732
Aah!

81
00:04:08,768 --> 00:04:10,668
Peter, Peter, calm down, it-it's okay,

82
00:04:10,703 --> 00:04:12,102
we'll-we'll do whatever you want.

83
00:04:12,138 --> 00:04:13,704
All right, if you promise.

84
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:16,006
I was thinkin' we could
tuck our shirts into our pants,

85
00:04:16,042 --> 00:04:18,709
put on huge helmets, and ride Segways.

86
00:04:18,744 --> 00:04:22,012
We're not from here!
We're not from here!

87
00:04:24,826 --> 00:04:25,983
You guys, look.

88
00:04:26,018 --> 00:04:28,853
It's Golden State Warriors
star Steph Curry.

89
00:04:29,989 --> 00:04:31,889
Oh, my God, Steph, I'm such a big fan.

90
00:04:31,924 --> 00:04:33,424
Thanks. It's nice to meet you.

91
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:35,759
Hey, I know we just met,
but can I sit on your lap

92
00:04:35,795 --> 00:04:37,828
during your next
post-game press conference?

93
00:04:37,864 --> 00:04:39,830
Sure, I don't see why not.

94
00:04:39,866 --> 00:04:41,699
This is exciting for the whole Bay Area,

95
00:04:41,734 --> 00:04:44,034
to be just four games away
from the championship...

96
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,336
Dad, I dooked.

97
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:47,304
That other team's not just
gonna go away, though.

98
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,707
We've got to stay focused, keep
doing what we've been doing.

99
00:04:49,742 --> 00:04:52,209
Fat lady. Dad, Dad, a fat lady.

100
00:04:52,245 --> 00:04:53,544
Yeah, I-I see her, Peter.

101
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:54,778
Make her go.

102
00:04:54,814 --> 00:04:56,280
That's not how we talk to people.

103
00:04:56,315 --> 00:04:57,481
Make her go.

104
00:04:57,517 --> 00:04:58,682
I'll leave.

105
00:04:58,718 --> 00:05:01,418
Yay! I'm learning bad lessons.

106
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:09,260
Wow. So that was San Francisco.

107
00:05:09,295 --> 00:05:11,862
I didn't realize
how hilly it was gonna be.

108
00:05:11,898 --> 00:05:13,731
Thanks again for taking us, Quagmire.

109
00:05:13,766 --> 00:05:14,965
Hey, no problem.

110
00:05:15,001 --> 00:05:16,200
Hey, you know, we're here early.

111
00:05:16,235 --> 00:05:18,068
You guys want a little
tour of the plane?

112
00:05:18,104 --> 00:05:19,270
Yeah, that'd be great.

113
00:05:19,305 --> 00:05:21,005
Normally I'd just go to Hudson News

114
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,607
and pretend to be
the most important guy there.

115
00:05:23,643 --> 00:05:24,708
Can I help you?

116
00:05:24,744 --> 00:05:26,777
Yes, I will have eight Dasanis

117
00:05:26,812 --> 00:05:29,013
and a JD Power & Associates.

118
00:05:34,854 --> 00:05:36,620
Wow, this place is cool.

119
00:05:36,656 --> 00:05:38,689
Yeah. What do all these buttons do?

120
00:05:38,724 --> 00:05:40,157
Like, what's this red one?

121
00:05:40,192 --> 00:05:42,593
Oh, that's a voice filter,
so the passengers always think

122
00:05:42,628 --> 00:05:45,029
the pilot is a 60-year-old
Midwestern white man.

123
00:05:45,064 --> 00:05:47,231
What? That's impossible.

124
00:05:47,266 --> 00:05:49,667
Hi y'all, this is Cleveland.

125
00:05:49,702 --> 00:05:51,035
Good afternoon, folks,

126
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,404
this is Captain Dale Clark
up here in the flight deck.

127
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:55,472
We're way up in the air.

128
00:05:55,508 --> 00:05:58,809
We've reached our cruising
altitude of 37,000 feet.

129
00:05:58,844 --> 00:06:01,645
Y'all get ready to watch
Big Momma's House.

130
00:06:01,681 --> 00:06:03,113
Our in-flight entertainment today

131
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:05,015
will be Under the Tuscan Sun.

132
00:06:05,051 --> 00:06:06,216
Ooh, I like that.

133
00:06:06,252 --> 00:06:07,551
I hear it's good.

134
00:06:07,587 --> 00:06:09,587
Hey, what's this button? "Autopilot"?

135
00:06:09,622 --> 00:06:12,323
Oh, that allows the plane to fly
itself when I need a break.

136
00:06:12,358 --> 00:06:13,591
W-What do you mean, "a break"?

137
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:15,025
You don't have to fly the plane?

138
00:06:15,061 --> 00:06:17,595
Of course I do. I just take
a short break sometimes.

139
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,930
Short break? It looks like you had time

140
00:06:19,966 --> 00:06:22,833
to put together
the 10,000-piece Lego Hogwarts.

141
00:06:22,868 --> 00:06:25,736
You don't have to touch it, Joe,
you can just say you noticed it.

142
00:06:25,771 --> 00:06:27,705
And what's this booth over here?

143
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,373
Oh, that's my back-in-time box.

144
00:06:29,408 --> 00:06:31,408
I go inside, magically go back in time,

145
00:06:31,444 --> 00:06:34,044
and then come out and react
to the fact that we're flying.

146
00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:38,382
By God, we're levitating.

147
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:40,284
That's just a box full of costumes.

148
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,852
It's my back-in-time box!

149
00:06:41,887 --> 00:06:43,954
What the hell, Quagmire?
So-so, basically,

150
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,389
your job is just goofin' off.

151
00:06:45,424 --> 00:06:46,423
That's not true.

152
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:47,958
I broke Gandalf in half.

153
00:06:47,994 --> 00:06:48,959
It's Dumbledore!

154
00:06:48,995 --> 00:06:50,594
Screw you guys. You know, being a pilot

155
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,663
is hard work. Look, I tried to be nice

156
00:06:52,698 --> 00:06:54,365
and take you fellas on a free trip,

157
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,634
and all you can do
is crap all over my job.

158
00:06:56,669 --> 00:06:58,769
I was a Navy pilot, you jerks.

159
00:06:58,804 --> 00:07:00,437
Get the hell out of my cockpit.

160
00:07:03,109 --> 00:07:05,876
Joke's on him. I farted
just before he kicked us out.

161
00:07:05,911 --> 00:07:08,212
Ugh. Oh, God!

162
00:07:13,285 --> 00:07:15,677
All right, let's see what's
in the in-flight magazine.

163
00:07:16,111 --> 00:07:17,788
Muscular old guy.

164
00:07:17,823 --> 00:07:20,124
Already filled-in crossword puzzle.

165
00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:23,293
Ooh, this is food
for different routes I'm not on.

166
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,563
All right, time to use the potty.

167
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:28,966
Don't say "potty." You're an adult.

168
00:07:35,141 --> 00:07:37,474
Okay, nobody move!

169
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:40,444
Oh, my God, those guys
in first class have guns.

170
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,312
Cleveland, just be happy
with what you have.

171
00:07:42,348 --> 00:07:43,514
Don't envy people.

172
00:07:43,549 --> 00:07:45,349
No, Peter, we're being hijacked.

173
00:07:45,384 --> 00:07:46,884
Close the cockpit door!

174
00:07:51,023 --> 00:07:52,990
This plane now belongs to us.

175
00:07:53,025 --> 00:07:54,591
You move, you're dead.

176
00:07:54,627 --> 00:07:56,660
So nobody try to get smart.

177
00:07:56,696 --> 00:07:59,363
Mm, page 100. Mm.

178
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,880
Control tower, this is flight 364.

179
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,615
We have a hijacking in progress.

180
00:08:07,651 --> 00:08:09,317
Our flight has been...

181
00:08:09,352 --> 00:08:11,419
Oh, damn it,
they jammed the transmission.

182
00:08:11,454 --> 00:08:13,922
I'm gonna have to go to
the backup communication system.

183
00:08:18,495 --> 00:08:19,994
Hello? Can you hear me?

184
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,529
This is Flight 364.

185
00:08:21,565 --> 00:08:22,864
We're being hijacked.

186
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:24,265
I can hear you... Oh!

187
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:30,672
This is your last chance.

188
00:08:30,707 --> 00:08:33,241
Open the door, or your copilot gets it.

189
00:08:33,276 --> 00:08:35,276
No. I'm landing at the closest airfield,

190
00:08:35,312 --> 00:08:38,079
which is less than an hour away.
So just let him go,

191
00:08:38,114 --> 00:08:40,081
'cause you're not
getting control of this plane.

192
00:08:41,117 --> 00:08:43,551
Aah! Jimmy! Oh, my God!

193
00:08:43,587 --> 00:08:44,786
Why are you doing this?

194
00:08:44,821 --> 00:08:46,321
America needs to be punished

195
00:08:46,356 --> 00:08:49,357
for supporting the other side
of my country's civil war.

196
00:08:49,392 --> 00:08:50,658
Which country?

197
00:08:50,694 --> 00:08:51,993
Do you really want to know,

198
00:08:52,028 --> 00:08:53,494
or are you just asking because

199
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,430
we're gonna be on a plane for a while

200
00:08:55,465 --> 00:08:57,765
and you think you
should make small talk?

201
00:08:57,801 --> 00:08:59,634
The second thing.

202
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:00,969
Open the door, or I'll start

203
00:09:01,004 --> 00:09:03,638
executing passengers.

204
00:09:03,673 --> 00:09:06,841
Man, coming on this trip
was a terrible idea.

205
00:09:06,876 --> 00:09:08,943
I know, now I wish I'd just stayed home

206
00:09:08,979 --> 00:09:11,412
and finished my remake of Inside Out.

207
00:09:11,448 --> 00:09:12,614
I'm Joy.

208
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:13,982
I'm Sadness.

209
00:09:14,017 --> 00:09:15,049
I'm Anger.

210
00:09:15,085 --> 00:09:16,317
I'm Disgust.

211
00:09:16,353 --> 00:09:18,386
I'm Poo.

212
00:09:19,456 --> 00:09:22,257
Ooh, I need to use the bathroom.

213
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:24,459
Yay! I win!

214
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,300
We interrupt this program
with a special report.

215
00:09:32,335 --> 00:09:34,502
A flight from San Francisco to Quahog

216
00:09:34,537 --> 00:09:36,971
has lost contact
with air traffic control.

217
00:09:37,007 --> 00:09:39,774
Oh, my God, that's your father's flight.

218
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:40,842
Government officials

219
00:09:40,877 --> 00:09:42,410
are monitoring the situation closely.

220
00:09:42,445 --> 00:09:44,846
I'll be here to update you
as this story progresses.

221
00:09:44,881 --> 00:09:47,382
Coming up on the midday news,
a couple in their 30s

222
00:09:47,417 --> 00:09:49,751
gets married without their dog
being in the wedding.

223
00:09:49,786 --> 00:09:52,086
You're not gonna believe their story.

224
00:09:55,191 --> 00:09:56,324
What's it gonna be?

225
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:57,692
Are you going to open this door,

226
00:09:57,727 --> 00:09:59,294
or am I going to start killing people?

227
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:00,628
I'm not opening it.

228
00:10:00,664 --> 00:10:02,830
Excuse me, I'd just like to ask
the mom behind me

229
00:10:02,866 --> 00:10:05,366
who told me to stop watching
Game of Thrones on my laptop

230
00:10:05,402 --> 00:10:09,370
if I'm still "the worst person
on this plane."

231
00:10:09,406 --> 00:10:11,105
You, fat guy. Get up here!

232
00:10:11,141 --> 00:10:12,473
Aah!

233
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,343
Last chance. Open the door,

234
00:10:15,378 --> 00:10:16,978
or this idiot gets it.

235
00:10:17,013 --> 00:10:18,646
Don't open it, Quagmire.
It's not worth it.

236
00:10:18,682 --> 00:10:19,847
Okay.

237
00:10:19,883 --> 00:10:21,316
Wait... wait, what?

238
00:10:21,351 --> 00:10:22,884
That-that was quick.

239
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:25,486
I'm sorry, Peter, but I have
to think about the whole plane.

240
00:10:25,522 --> 00:10:27,789
There's over 150 passengers back there,

241
00:10:27,824 --> 00:10:29,824
several of whom are in
our Commander's Club,

242
00:10:29,859 --> 00:10:32,493
and to them I'd like to
issue a special welcome.

243
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:34,162
Oh, man, we got to help Peter!

244
00:10:34,197 --> 00:10:36,764
Those crazy European guys
are gonna kill him!

245
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,033
You know, I have a gun
in the bag I checked.

246
00:10:39,069 --> 00:10:40,568
If we can get to the galley,

247
00:10:40,603 --> 00:10:43,204
we can take the elevator
down to the cargo hold.

248
00:10:43,239 --> 00:10:44,872
Good idea, Joe.

249
00:10:44,908 --> 00:10:48,543
Oh, man, it feels like we're in
one of those hijacking movies.

250
00:10:48,578 --> 00:10:51,145
You're right, it does. There's
even an impatient businessman

251
00:10:51,181 --> 00:10:53,147
who really wants to
reach his destination

252
00:10:53,183 --> 00:10:55,516
so he can conduct more business.

253
00:10:55,552 --> 00:10:57,185
Can't you see how important I am?

254
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,187
My shirt is blue, but
the collar is white.

255
00:10:59,222 --> 00:11:00,922
It's the same shirt!

256
00:11:00,957 --> 00:11:02,957
Quick, he's distracted.

257
00:11:11,497 --> 00:11:13,067
"Get off my plane."

258
00:11:13,103 --> 00:11:15,336
"Get off my plane."

259
00:11:15,372 --> 00:11:16,738
- What's that, now?
- Hmm?

260
00:11:16,773 --> 00:11:18,152
Nothing.

261
00:11:18,863 --> 00:11:20,942
"Always bet on black."

262
00:11:20,977 --> 00:11:22,543
"Always bet on black."

263
00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:24,545
- Did you say something?
- I don't think so.

264
00:11:26,182 --> 00:11:27,682
- "Double trouble!"
- "Double trouble!"

265
00:11:27,717 --> 00:11:29,550
That's it. We found it.

266
00:11:30,261 --> 00:11:31,285
What the hell?!

267
00:11:31,321 --> 00:11:34,222
Hey! Two of the passengers are missing!

268
00:11:34,257 --> 00:11:35,823
Okay, you guys watch the main cabin.

269
00:11:35,859 --> 00:11:36,991
I'll go find them.

270
00:11:37,026 --> 00:11:39,427
I'll take this fat guy
as a human shield.

271
00:11:39,462 --> 00:11:41,562
Oh, nice. Last guy picked for dodgeball,

272
00:11:41,598 --> 00:11:43,731
first guy for human shield.

273
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,103
Everybody be quiet!

274
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:50,905
There's another update!

275
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,306
Good afternoon. I'm Tom Tucker.

276
00:11:52,342 --> 00:11:54,509
The search for
a missing airliner continues,

277
00:11:54,544 --> 00:11:57,645
as speculation grows that
the plane has been hijacked.

278
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,647
Oh, this is all so awful!

279
00:11:59,682 --> 00:12:03,117
What will our lives be like
if our husbands don't make it?

280
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:31,646
Oh, my God! Now I want Dad to die!

281
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:37,351
Hey, Joe, look at me.

282
00:12:37,387 --> 00:12:39,287
Do I look like Mickey the Mouse?

283
00:12:39,322 --> 00:12:40,888
Get out of people's stuff!

284
00:12:40,924 --> 00:12:42,790
Ah, here's my bag.

285
00:12:45,995 --> 00:12:48,763
Hey! What are you two doing down here?

286
00:12:51,234 --> 00:12:53,868
Oh, someone's shipping live lobsters.

287
00:12:53,903 --> 00:12:55,403
Yum.

288
00:12:55,438 --> 00:12:56,404
Prepare to die.

289
00:12:56,439 --> 00:12:57,538
You first!

290
00:12:57,574 --> 00:12:59,774
That's what you think.

291
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:04,412
Peter! Grab on to something!

292
00:13:04,447 --> 00:13:06,881
Uh-oh. I grabbed my own belt.

293
00:13:27,303 --> 00:13:30,204
Attention, passengers,
I know we're being hijacked,

294
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,039
but I would be remiss
if I didn't point out

295
00:13:32,075 --> 00:13:34,976
that we're presently passing
over Yosemite National Park.

296
00:13:35,011 --> 00:13:38,246
Wow! That is truly awe-inspiring!

297
00:13:38,281 --> 00:13:39,714
It certainly is.

298
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:41,716
And you know what you don't see
from up here?

299
00:13:41,751 --> 00:13:43,451
Borders.

300
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:52,560
Die in hell, Eurotrash!

301
00:13:52,595 --> 00:13:54,028
Hang on, Peter!

302
00:13:56,099 --> 00:13:58,733
Holy crap, that was close.

303
00:13:58,768 --> 00:14:01,068
Joe, how'd you know that lever
would open the landing gear?

304
00:14:01,104 --> 00:14:02,803
Wheels are my expertise, Peter.

305
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:06,107
I notice every wheel in
a room as soon as I enter.

306
00:14:09,345 --> 00:14:12,446
Special delivery from the U.S. of A.!

307
00:14:13,983 --> 00:14:14,982
Aw, rats.

308
00:14:15,018 --> 00:14:16,918
My bullets are in my shaving kit.

309
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:26,174
Get off my pl... Double trouble!

310
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,629
Sorry. Come on, man!

311
00:14:30,366 --> 00:14:31,666
Oh, my God, you guys did it!

312
00:14:31,701 --> 00:14:32,833
We're saved!

313
00:14:32,869 --> 00:14:34,435
Yep, we wrapped this up quicker

314
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,571
than the treaty signing at Appomattox.

315
00:14:36,606 --> 00:14:39,106
So, if I sign this, the war is over,

316
00:14:39,142 --> 00:14:42,643
we surrender, and we still
get to be dicks forever?

317
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:45,307
Okay, you win.

318
00:14:45,848 --> 00:14:47,315
You can all relax now, everybody!

319
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,783
We're ten minutes away from landing

320
00:14:48,818 --> 00:14:50,284
at an airfield in Nevada.

321
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,154
Looks like you'll make
that business meeting after all.

322
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:56,557
Great! Thanks for keeping us
in the sky, boys.

323
00:14:56,593 --> 00:14:58,559
Now reach for it.

324
00:14:58,595 --> 00:15:00,628
You're one of the hijackers, too?!

325
00:15:00,663 --> 00:15:04,298
Yes. I was in reserve in
case the plan went awry.

326
00:15:04,334 --> 00:15:06,567
And now I can finally get
into the cockpit

327
00:15:06,603 --> 00:15:08,235
and execute our plan:

328
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:10,504
crashing this plane
into the ultimate symbol

329
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,173
of American materialism,

330
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,141
Las Vegas.

331
00:15:14,177 --> 00:15:16,277
You know, I've lost a ton in Vegas,

332
00:15:16,312 --> 00:15:18,679
but I never thought
I'd lose my life there.

333
00:15:18,715 --> 00:15:21,082
- Did you just think of that?
- Yeah, just now.

334
00:15:21,117 --> 00:15:23,217
You know, you are seriously funny, man.

335
00:15:23,252 --> 00:15:25,286
I know I crap on you
a lot, but sometimes,

336
00:15:25,321 --> 00:15:28,122
when I'm driving, I think
about stuff you say and I laugh.

337
00:15:28,157 --> 00:15:30,391
- Thank you, Peter.
- No, thank you.

338
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:38,653
Very good. We are less than
20 minutes from Las Vegas.

339
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:42,857
Get ready to say good-bye
to your precious Rita Rudner.

340
00:15:42,893 --> 00:15:45,593
Is-is your plan
just to kill Rita Rudner?

341
00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:48,930
No. We're going to crash into
the biggest hotel on the Strip!

342
00:15:48,965 --> 00:15:52,800
Killing Rita Rudner will just be
the custard on the dumpling.

343
00:15:52,836 --> 00:15:54,269
You know, we never quite nailed down

344
00:15:54,304 --> 00:15:56,504
what region you guys are from.

345
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,443
Good afternoon.
I'm Tom Tucker with the latest

346
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:03,845
on the hijacking crisis.

347
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,780
As you can see, I've taken off my blazer

348
00:16:05,815 --> 00:16:07,649
to show the severity of the situation.

349
00:16:07,684 --> 00:16:10,318
We understand the plane
has been found by satellite.

350
00:16:10,353 --> 00:16:12,253
It's apparently veered off
its flight plan

351
00:16:12,289 --> 00:16:13,988
and is headed for Las Vegas.

352
00:16:14,024 --> 00:16:15,590
The government, fearing the worst,

353
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,392
is considering shooting it down.

354
00:16:17,427 --> 00:16:19,994
Now here's an over-the-top news graphic.

355
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:24,799
Nightmare over Vegas.

356
00:16:26,503 --> 00:16:30,638
Hijack Jackpot.

357
00:16:35,445 --> 00:16:37,712
Oh, look, there's one guy who
slept through this whole thing.

358
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,080
Hey, buddy, wake up.

359
00:16:39,115 --> 00:16:40,548
We're all about to die.

360
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,283
What? What are you talking about?

361
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:43,751
Yeah, I thought I should wake you up.

362
00:16:43,787 --> 00:16:45,219
Nobody wants to die in their sleep.

363
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,722
Oh, my God! No! I have a family!

364
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:50,158
There you go.

365
00:16:50,193 --> 00:16:52,560
Only a few more minutes
until your country pays

366
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,696
for its imperialistic sins.

367
00:16:54,731 --> 00:16:56,397
Us? What about you?!

368
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:58,333
Like-like, how come
you Eastern European guys

369
00:16:58,368 --> 00:17:00,001
can't be quieter in pornos?

370
00:17:00,036 --> 00:17:03,037
I mean, nobody's ever been like,
"Yeah, yeah, more guy noises."

371
00:17:03,073 --> 00:17:04,839
They ask us to do that
to cover up the sound

372
00:17:04,874 --> 00:17:06,374
of children playing nearby.

373
00:17:06,409 --> 00:17:09,010
Now shut up and get ready to die.

374
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,021
So, uh, you ever been to Vegas before?

375
00:17:20,056 --> 00:17:21,189
No.

376
00:17:21,224 --> 00:17:22,857
Well, I think you're gonna...

377
00:17:22,892 --> 00:17:24,359
flip for it!

378
00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:35,403
Attention, passengers, the plane...

379
00:17:37,774 --> 00:17:40,942
Oh, come on! Doesn't anybody
pay attention to the sign?!

380
00:17:45,015 --> 00:17:46,714
That was some quick thinking, Glenn.

381
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,984
And look! Even that plane with
all the missiles is impressed.

382
00:17:52,022 --> 00:17:54,655
Missiles? That's a military fighter jet!

383
00:17:54,691 --> 00:17:56,324
He's here to shoot us down!

384
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:58,426
- Or "she."
- What?!

385
00:17:58,461 --> 00:18:00,595
They must think the hijackers
still control the plane!

386
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:01,996
And our communications are jammed,

387
00:18:02,032 --> 00:18:04,065
so we can't even tell them
everything's okay!

388
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,900
Don't worry, I'll signal to 'em.

389
00:18:05,935 --> 00:18:08,736
Hey! We knocked out all the bad guys!

390
00:18:08,772 --> 00:18:10,405
See? We don't need your help!

391
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,740
We kicked their asses
and we have their guns!

392
00:18:12,776 --> 00:18:14,542
I've got a visual on the terrorists.

393
00:18:14,577 --> 00:18:17,345
They've got a hostage in a blue
shirt with a white collar.

394
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,013
He must be an important businessman.

395
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:21,349
Copy that. Prepare to engage.

396
00:18:23,987 --> 00:18:25,486
Oh, good, he's movin' away.

397
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:27,488
No, he isn't. He's g getting
in position to fire!

398
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:29,290
He thinks we're gonna crash
into the Strip!

399
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:30,792
Everybody in your seats!

400
00:18:52,415 --> 00:18:54,849
Frank Caliendo does a 5:00 show?

401
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,818
Quagmire, land this plane!

402
00:19:04,194 --> 00:19:05,359
We've been hit!

403
00:19:07,097 --> 00:19:08,329
Oh, God, this is it!

404
00:19:08,364 --> 00:19:09,464
We're gonna die!

405
00:19:09,499 --> 00:19:10,598
Like hell we are!

406
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:12,166
We're gonna make it.

407
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:27,548
We're going too fast!

408
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,350
We're gonna crash into that lake!

409
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:32,220
Oh, no, we're not!

410
00:19:42,665 --> 00:19:45,299
Oh, yeah,
right there. That's good.

411
00:19:45,335 --> 00:19:48,836
And now to discharge
the plane's fire retardant.

412
00:19:48,872 --> 00:19:50,838
Giggity.

413
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:03,985
Wow, Quagmire, thanks for
saving all of our lives.

414
00:20:04,343 --> 00:20:06,320
We're sorry for saying
your job was easy.

415
00:20:06,356 --> 00:20:08,523
Yeah, you're the best
damn pilot in the world.

416
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:11,526
He's right. What you did
up there was amazing.

417
00:20:11,561 --> 00:20:13,327
Thanks, guys, that means a lot.

418
00:20:13,363 --> 00:20:15,062
Boy, that was quite a trip, wasn't it?

419
00:20:15,098 --> 00:20:18,266
Sure was. And we learned
a lot about blue jeans,

420
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:20,268
- didn't we, guys?
- Yes, yes, we did, yeah.

421
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:23,271
- That's right, Peter.
- Thank you for planning a wonderful day.

422
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:29,980
- Cleveland!
- Joe!

423
00:20:30,016 --> 00:20:30,878
Peter!

424
00:20:36,961 --> 00:20:38,219
Dad, I was really worried,

425
00:20:38,254 --> 00:20:40,221
so I pulled a record
of your credit card purchases

426
00:20:40,256 --> 00:20:42,290
in San Francisco, and I saw some things

427
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:44,225
I think you'd prefer to keep private.

428
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,560
We'll talk later, Chris.

429
00:20:45,595 --> 00:20:47,161
I think we will.

430
00:20:47,197 --> 00:20:49,330
I do believe we will.

431
00:20:49,365 --> 00:20:50,731
Well, let's head home.

432
00:20:50,767 --> 00:20:53,467
I know I, for one, am ready
to put all this behind us.

433
00:20:53,503 --> 00:20:54,969
Sounds good.

434
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:58,066
Oh, yeah, in case we didn't say,
this was Spirit Airlines.
