00:00:06,088 --> 00:00:09,282
It seems today that all you see

2
00:00:09,283 --> 00:00:12,591
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

3
00:00:12,592 --> 00:00:16,296
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

4
00:00:16,297 --> 00:00:19,437
On which we used to rely?

5
00:00:19,438 --> 00:00:22,366
Lucky there's a family guy

6
00:00:22,627 --> 00:00:25,907
Lucky there's a man
who positively can do

7
00:00:25,908 --> 00:00:27,626
All the things that make us

8
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:29,237
Laugh and cry

9
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:34,823
He's... a...Fam... ily... Guy!

10
00:00:42,268 --> 00:00:43,770
God, I hate coming to the vet.

11
00:00:43,774 --> 00:00:46,289
They charge me 90 bucks a day
to keep Brian here.

12
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:48,774
For 60 bucks, I could
put him up at the Holiday Inn.

13
00:00:48,776 --> 00:00:50,351
Who's with me?

14
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:53,930
My apologies.

15
00:00:53,935 --> 00:00:56,973
My pet cricket has
restless leg syndrome.

16
00:00:57,786 --> 00:01:00,891
I hope Brian's stomach pains
aren't anything serious.

17
00:01:01,175 --> 00:01:02,283
Ugh, look at that, Lois.

18
00:01:02,288 --> 00:01:04,011
That's why cats freak me out.

19
00:01:04,016 --> 00:01:04,981
He's doing that weird,

20
00:01:04,987 --> 00:01:07,482
stretchy leg thing where they lick themselves.

21
00:01:10,788 --> 00:01:11,950
Look at that, huh?

22
00:01:11,956 --> 00:01:13,482
Look at that -bleep-.

23
00:01:14,795 --> 00:01:17,440
Oh, thank God the vets are here to help Brian.

24
00:01:17,455 --> 00:01:19,820
I want to be a veterinarian when I grow up.

25
00:01:19,825 --> 00:01:21,101
Meg, we've been over this.

26
00:01:21,116 --> 00:01:22,881
You're gonna gain 150 pounds and

27
00:01:22,897 --> 00:01:24,691
write Ugly Betty fan fiction.

28
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:25,542
But Dad...

29
00:01:25,545 --> 00:01:28,460
Meg, that's final.

30
00:01:28,476 --> 00:01:30,523
See, this bird knows what I'm talking about.

31
00:01:30,528 --> 00:01:33,233
Thank you.

32
00:01:33,238 --> 00:01:35,332
You're very polite.

33
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:37,002
You do not see that these days.

34
00:01:37,007 --> 00:01:38,441
You do not see that.

35
00:01:38,457 --> 00:01:39,800
I like you.

36
00:01:39,806 --> 00:01:41,041
Oh, thank God.

37
00:01:41,147 --> 00:01:43,360
You knyou never really know what somebody thinks of you,

38
00:01:43,366 --> 00:01:45,310
but I'm glad I made a good
first impression.

39
00:01:45,415 --> 00:01:46,912
Would you like to be friends?

40
00:01:46,928 --> 00:01:47,940
Like to be friends.

41
00:01:47,945 --> 00:01:50,171
Oh, God, this is all going so smoothly.

42
00:01:50,187 --> 00:01:51,611
What's your name?
I'm Peter.

43
00:01:51,615 --> 00:01:52,112
Peter.

44
00:01:52,117 --> 00:01:53,760
No way!
That's my name!

45
00:01:53,777 --> 00:01:55,650
Hey, you should come home and spend the night at my house.

46
00:01:55,656 --> 00:01:57,343
Lois, will you make up the guest room?

47
00:01:57,345 --> 00:01:58,803
Peter, that's someone's pet.

48
00:01:58,816 --> 00:02:00,163
You can't just take it.

49
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:02,450
Well, maybe they never know it's gone.

50
00:02:08,925 --> 00:02:11,571
Oh, Brian, I'm so glad you're okay.

51
00:02:11,586 --> 00:02:12,823
Yes, he's doing fine.

52
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,801
We were able to clear the stomach obstruction.

53
00:02:14,805 --> 00:02:16,941
Tuout it was a used diaper.

54
00:02:17,495 --> 00:02:18,722
Gross!

55
00:02:18,726 --> 00:02:20,380
Oh, yes.

56
00:02:20,388 --> 00:02:22,582
Get off my back.
I thought it was Indian food.

57
00:02:22,586 --> 00:02:25,260
Oh, thank you so much for your help, Dr. Jewish.

58
00:02:25,277 --> 00:02:27,242
I really thought we were gonna lose him.

59
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,891
It was my pleasure,Mrs. Griffin.

60
00:02:28,896 --> 00:02:31,172
Go ahead and check outwith my intern, Anna.

61
00:02:42,985 --> 00:02:49,460
I never wantedanyone like this It's all brand new

62
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:53,621
You'll feel it in my kiss

63
00:02:53,627 --> 00:03:02,691
I'm crazy for you Bah Bah Bah Bah Ah-ah.

64
00:03:03,965 --> 00:03:05,751
Crazy for you.

65
00:03:08,946 --> 00:03:11,720
We now return to Busy Business Lady Whose Life

66
00:03:11,728 --> 00:03:13,092
Is Missing Something But She Doesn't

67
00:03:13,097 --> 00:03:15,563
Realize It Because She's So Busy With Business.

68
00:03:15,565 --> 00:03:17,451
No, no, I cannot make that business meeting.

69
00:03:17,467 --> 00:03:19,373
I've got a different business meeting at 3:00,

70
00:03:19,377 --> 00:03:20,981
and will be doing business there.

71
00:03:20,987 --> 00:03:22,642
I was wondering if you're free for coffee.

72
00:03:22,646 --> 00:03:23,800
Oh, no, I can't!

73
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:24,882
I've got a lunch meeting,

74
00:03:24,885 --> 00:03:27,210
and then a meeting after lunch, after that...

75
00:03:28,248 --> 00:03:30,131
Over the next 90 minutes, I'd like to show you

76
00:03:30,136 --> 00:03:32,180
that all your problems can be solved

77
00:03:32,185 --> 00:03:33,521
by my penis.

78
00:03:41,337 --> 00:03:43,970
Hey, guys, whatis going on?

79
00:03:43,985 --> 00:03:45,320

00:03:49,485 --> 00:03:50,602
Pick a lane, bitch.

83
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:51,522
Isn't that funny?

84
00:03:51,527 --> 00:03:53,583
He heard me say that onthe way over in the car.

85
00:03:53,585 --> 00:03:54,410
I gotta pee.

86
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:55,911
Where's thatSnapple bottle?

87
00:03:56,827 --> 00:03:58,852
I had a gayexperience at camp.

88
00:03:59,748 --> 00:04:01,970
We, we had the radio on and they were talking

89
00:04:01,978 --> 00:04:03,101
about some goofy stuff...

90
00:04:03,106 --> 00:04:04,442
So, what are you, whatare you guys drinking?

91
00:04:04,446 --> 00:04:06,213
Hey, Peter, you kind oflook like a pirate with

92
00:04:06,218 --> 00:04:07,713
that thing on your shoulder.

93
00:04:07,716 --> 00:04:09,402
A pirate? Ah, cool!

94
00:04:09,408 --> 00:04:10,772
You should geta pirate name.

95
00:04:10,775 --> 00:04:12,943
And a peg leg.And a hook hand.

96
00:04:12,945 --> 00:04:13,903
And you should have sexwith

97
00:04:13,907 --> 00:04:15,402
that crossing guard even though she lookedoung andthen I

98
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:17,171
found out she was 12.

99
00:04:17,898 --> 00:04:19,482
I mean, you shouldget an eye patch.

100
00:04:20,787 --> 00:04:22,203
Eye patchwould be cool.

101
00:04:26,286 --> 00:04:27,792

102
00:04:27,795 --> 00:04:29,891

114
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:59,392
Just a few sea dogs frommy fishin' boat days.

115
00:04:59,397 --> 00:05:01,102
I don't care who theyare, they stink!

00:05:01,996 --> 00:05:03,892
They stink of good cheer, Lois!

118
00:05:06,837 --> 00:05:08,913
After we've had our fillof bread and wine,

119

120
00:05:10,865 --> 00:05:12,582
our fillof bread and wine.

121
00:05:12,586 --> 00:05:15,941
God, this is a more disturbingsight than Tom Hanks and E.T.

122
00:05:15,945 --> 00:05:17,142
in Philadelphia.

123
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,302
Ouch...

124
00:05:19,896 --> 00:05:20,971
There you go, you're good.

125
00:05:20,985 --> 00:05:22,102
You didn't touch me.

126
00:05:22,107 --> 00:05:23,791
I don't wanna get AIDS.

127
00:05:29,876 --> 00:05:31,292
Kristallnacht!

128
00:05:32,086 --> 00:05:35,732
'Tis Long John Peter and hismerry men come seeking plunder.

129
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:38,411
All your Tuck'sMedicated Pads be ours.

130
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,252
Aah! Oh, my God!

131
00:05:43,706 --> 00:05:45,483
For no reason I'm going to fireth

132
00:05:45,487 --> 00:05:47,172
is cannon all over your store.

133
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:54,643
Terrible pharmacy toys.

134
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,153
We'll see to it that no childever receives these

135
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:59,272
as at-minute gift hastilybought on

136
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,611
the way to the party.

137
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:07,961
Dear me, it's almost 3:00.

138
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,883
I've got to get this shipment ofsugarcane,

139
00:06:09,887 --> 00:06:12,851
tobacco and spices to the harbor before day's end.

140
00:06:14,747 --> 00:06:17,252
That car is coming upawfully fast,

141
00:06:17,526 --> 00:06:19,743
but at least it's flyingthe British flag.

142
00:06:25,296 --> 00:06:27,163
Oh no. Privateers.

143
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,830
No doubt they're after mysugarcane, tobacco and spices.

144
00:06:29,844 --> 00:06:31,739
Well, Shelley Boothbishopisn't

145
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:34,194
about to let you over-egg this pudding.

146
00:06:47,346 --> 00:06:48,971
Prepare to be boarded.

147
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:50,810
You'll never take my cargo.

148
00:07:06,065 --> 00:07:07,373
Load the cannon.

149
00:08:05,428 --> 00:08:06,750
All clear, sir.

150
00:08:09,046 --> 00:08:10,442
Shoot it again.

151
00:08:10,536 --> 00:08:12,143
What? I didn'tunderstand that.

152
00:08:12,207 --> 00:08:14,801
I said "shoot it again,"but I said it pirate-like.

153
00:08:30,585 --> 00:08:33,600
Well done, you barnacle-munchingscallywiggers.

154
00:08:33,606 --> 00:08:35,412
Sir, we've got a man down.

155
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,193
Oh my God! Adrien Beaky.

156
00:08:37,198 --> 00:08:38,373
Say something.

157
00:08:38,386 --> 00:08:41,223
Shoot... me.

158
00:08:41,238 --> 00:08:43,223
Oh, God, this is my fault.

159
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:44,520
I did this.

160
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,552
I've screwed up worsethan Disney did

161
00:08:46,558 --> 00:08:49,580
when they cast Michael J. Fox inthat Zorro remake

162
00:08:49,688 --> 00:08:52,323
Who was that masked manwho saved us?

163
00:08:52,326 --> 00:08:55,033
I don't know,but he left his insignia.

164
00:09:01,617 --> 00:09:03,011
Give it to mestraight, Dr. Jewish.

165
00:09:03,016 --> 00:09:04,491
Is he gonna live?

166
00:09:04,496 --> 00:09:06,883
Mr. Griffin, I'm afraidyour parro dead.

167
00:09:06,886 --> 00:09:08,912
No!

168
00:09:10,887 --> 00:09:12,881
Did he at least diewith dignity?

169
00:09:12,888 --> 00:09:15,963
Well, he convulsed a lot andfell off the operating table.

170
00:09:15,966 --> 00:09:18,191
Then he flopped arounda little on the floor,

171
00:09:18,198 --> 00:09:19,783
and then a passing nurseaccidentally

172
00:09:19,787 --> 00:09:22,271
stepped on him and kicked himinto a puddle of urine.

173
00:09:22,276 --> 00:09:23,582
Which must'vefrightened him,

174
00:09:23,586 --> 00:09:25,781
because his bowelsreleased all over himself.

175
00:09:25,786 --> 00:09:27,080
I tried to pick him up,

176
00:09:27,087 --> 00:09:29,703
but then I got angry because some of itgot on my thumb,

177
00:09:29,705 --> 00:09:32,712
so I threw him against the walland that's where he died.

178
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:34,581
That's the wayI want to go.

179
00:09:34,746 --> 00:09:36,710
I'm really sorry aboutyour dad's parrot.

180
00:09:36,716 --> 00:09:37,790
Oh, that's okay.

181
00:09:37,797 --> 00:09:39,190
He'll get overit pretty quickly

182
00:09:39,195 --> 00:09:40,913
then move onto another wacky thing.

183
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:42,822
Lois, whose pipeorgan is this?

184
00:09:42,828 --> 00:09:44,041
My name's Anna.

185
00:09:44,056 --> 00:09:45,852
Um... I'm Chris.

186
00:09:46,697 --> 00:09:49,442
Sometimes I have to poopfor a long time.

187
00:09:50,398 --> 00:09:51,761
Now you say something.

188
00:09:52,928 --> 00:09:53,912
You're funny.

189
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:56,100
But I bet a lot of girlstell you that, huh?

190
00:09:56,107 --> 00:09:59,803
Well, the only girl I knowmy sister, and she sucks.

191
00:09:59,998 --> 00:10:01,923
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

192
00:10:01,927 --> 00:10:04,392
Wow, we're havinga conversation!

193
00:10:05,848 --> 00:10:07,731
Listen, I haveto get back to work,

194
00:10:07,738 --> 00:10:11,730
but, um, would you maybewant to go out sometime?

195
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:12,801
Yes!

196
00:10:12,807 --> 00:10:14,072
Great. Here's my number.

197
00:10:14,076 --> 00:10:15,650
Awesome!

198
00:10:16,396 --> 00:10:18,551
Oh, no, I broke the pipe organ.

199
00:10:18,557 --> 00:10:20,503
Hey, look, the deedto a cattle ranch.

200
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:33,202
So, um... how do you likeworking at the vet?

201
00:10:33,206 --> 00:10:35,483
Oh, it is so rewarding.

202
00:10:35,485 --> 00:10:36,943
Ever since I wasa little girl,

203
00:10:36,947 --> 00:10:39,162
I have loved workingwith animals.

204
00:10:39,797 --> 00:10:41,823
Did you ever make itwith one of the dogs?

205
00:10:41,827 --> 00:10:42,372
What?!

206
00:10:42,378 --> 00:10:45,231
I mean, uh, did youenjoy your appetizer?

207
00:10:45,236 --> 00:10:46,572
It hasn't come yet.

208
00:10:46,575 --> 00:10:50,921
Oh, um, I mean, did you evermake it with one of the dogs?

209
00:10:50,956 --> 00:10:52,732
No! Stupid!

210
00:10:52,738 --> 00:10:54,621
Chris, just relax.

211
00:10:54,628 --> 00:10:55,802
Um, okay.

212
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:00,411
You know, Anna,when I first saw you,

213
00:11:00,415 --> 00:11:02,522
I thought you were the mostbeautiful girl in

214
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,380
the world, and now all I want to do

215
00:11:04,387 --> 00:11:06,202
is show you my innermost self,

216
00:11:06,206 --> 00:11:07,891
but I'm afraid you'll reject me

217
00:11:07,898 --> 00:11:09,590
because you won't like wh y see,

218
00:11:09,595 --> 00:11:11,401
or thatyou'll see my scrotum, and

219
00:11:11,408 --> 00:11:12,523
see that it hasa seam on it,

220
00:11:12,528 --> 00:11:14,552
and then you'll think I'mmade up of two different guys

221
00:11:14,555 --> 00:11:15,523
that were sewn together,

222
00:11:15,526 --> 00:11:17,830
'cause that's whatI think happened, and...

223
00:11:17,937 --> 00:11:19,773
Chris, I like you.

224
00:11:23,756 --> 00:11:25,312
You don't haveto try so hard.

225
00:11:25,388 --> 00:11:26,423
I'm sorry.

226
00:11:26,425 --> 00:11:27,832
When I'm arounda pretty girl,

227
00:11:27,838 --> 00:11:31,020
I get all worked up like a kidwatching a toy commercial.

228
00:11:31,155 --> 00:11:32,493

Hey, fellas!

Um, I havea question.

248
00:12:01,695 --> 00:12:04,032
I went on a date with thisgirl

249
00:12:04,036 --> 00:12:07,683

250
00:12:07,688 --> 00:12:09,712

251
00:12:09,715 --> 00:12:11,283

252
00:12:11,288 --> 00:12:13,672
Ah, my boy wantsto know about sex.

253
00:12:13,678 --> 00:12:14,651
Came to the right place.

254
00:12:14,656 --> 00:12:16,523
Chris, what you alwayswant to remember is

255
00:12:16,525 --> 00:12:18,713
that sex isperfectly natural...

256
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:21,333
Whoa, uh, uh,sorry, Mr. Swanson.

257
00:12:21,337 --> 00:12:23,503
Um, I wasn't reallytalking to you.

258
00:12:23,508 --> 00:12:25,572
Chris, I knowa lot about sex.

259
00:12:25,577 --> 00:12:28,242
Yeah, and I'm sure youhave fond memories,

260
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,931
but I was kind ofhoping to get some advice

261
00:12:29,936 --> 00:12:32,733
from someone who isn't brokenfrom the waist down.

262
00:12:32,738 --> 00:12:33,822
I'm a father!

263
00:12:33,828 --> 00:12:36,043
You're a two-wheeledmonster!

264
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,130
That's going to bemy ring tone.

265
00:12:40,148 --> 00:12:41,322
Quagmire, call me.

266
00:12:51,297 --> 00:12:52,991
Well, I have to getto work, Chris.

267
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:54,952
I have tons and tonsof dogs to incinerate,

268
00:12:54,957 --> 00:12:57,292
but I can't wait to seeyou tomorrow night.

269
00:12:57,887 --> 00:12:59,103
Oh, God, I'mso sorry.

270
00:12:59,106 --> 00:13:00,381

271
00:13:00,476 --> 00:13:02,010

00:13:02,016 --> 00:13:03,272
Have fun at work!

273
00:13:03,288 --> 00:13:05,323
Okay. Bye, Chris.

274
00:13:06,325 --> 00:13:08,363
What do you think you're doing?What?

275
00:13:08,365 --> 00:13:11,013
You, a man, arecleaning up a mess made

276
00:13:11,018 --> 00:13:14,480
by Anna, a woman, that she, also a woman,

277
00:13:14,485 --> 00:13:17,010
spilled on you, a man.So?

278
00:13:17,017 --> 00:13:19,091
You're treating herlike a human being.

279
00:13:19,108 --> 00:13:20,743
If you want to getanywhere with a chick,

280
00:13:20,745 --> 00:13:22,622
you can't treat 'emtoo nice-like.

281
00:13:22,646 --> 00:13:24,103
Really?Trust me, Chris.

282
00:13:24,107 --> 00:13:26,653
The next time yousee this girl, treat her like crap,

283
00:13:26,656 --> 00:13:28,022
and you'll be cooler

284
00:13:28,037 --> 00:13:31,130
than a mid-'80s noveltyanswering machine message.

285
00:13:31,286 --> 00:13:32,433
MAN I'm glad you called,

286
00:13:32,435 --> 00:13:35,200
but I'm not home But I'll be back before too long

287
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,133
You gotta wait for the beep,

288
00:13:36,136 --> 00:13:38,243
you gotta leave your name You gotta leave your number

289
00:13:38,246 --> 00:13:40,052
Wait for the beep.

290
00:13:40,598 --> 00:13:41,333
It's me again!

291
00:13:41,336 --> 00:13:43,220
I just had to hear i one more time!

292
00:13:46,038 --> 00:13:47,990
Chris, is everything okay?

293
00:13:47,997 --> 00:13:50,880
You seem a little, I don't know, quiet tonight.

294
00:13:50,886 --> 00:13:52,572
Yeah, everything's fine.

295
00:13:52,686 --> 00:13:54,532
Uh, yes, can I have two tickets:

296
00:13:54,535 --> 00:13:57,570
one man and one bitchthat needs to do what I say.

297
00:13:57,577 --> 00:13:59,521
What? That's notfunny, Chris.

298
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,633
Here's your ticket.Pick that up!

299
00:14:01,637 --> 00:14:03,361
Chris, why are youacting like this?

300
00:14:03,365 --> 00:14:05,993
Pick that up and cook it into something delicious

301
00:14:05,996 --> 00:14:08,503
or knit it into somethingthat's
useful to me!

302
00:14:13,215 --> 00:14:15,862
Um, are you readyto make out now?

303
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:17,293
Why in the world wouldI want to do

304
00:14:17,297 --> 00:14:19,142
that after what you just said?

305
00:14:19,148 --> 00:14:21,321
You're obviously not theperson I thought you were!

306
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:22,981
I never wantto see you again!

307
00:14:22,986 --> 00:14:25,260
I can't believe I thoughtyou were special!

308
00:14:25,685 --> 00:14:27,032
Anna, wait!

309
00:14:27,077 --> 00:14:28,311
Oh, no!

310
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:29,763
What did I do?

311
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,352
Hey, Chris!Guess what we just did!

312
00:14:31,357 --> 00:14:33,123
Bonnie, tell him.We had sex.

313
00:14:33,128 --> 00:14:35,852
We sex!We had what Joe calls sex.

314
00:14:40,885 --> 00:14:42,733
Chris, honey,what's wrong?

315
00:14:42,927 --> 00:14:45,293
Anna took a dump on me.What?!

316
00:14:45,295 --> 00:14:47,431
Yeah, she broke up with me.

317
00:14:47,438 --> 00:14:49,790
Oh-ho, she dumped you.

318
00:14:49,797 --> 00:14:51,163
That's whatyou meant to say.

319
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:52,322
What's the difference?

320
00:14:52,328 --> 00:14:54,851
Well, what you saidfirst was...

321
00:14:54,855 --> 00:14:55,962
Well, I mean,

322
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:58,561
when-whentwo grown-ups love each other very much,

323
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,942
sometimesthey show
it by...

324
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,730
Never mind.So, so, what happened?

325
00:15:03,957 --> 00:15:04,632
don't know.

326
00:15:04,636 --> 00:15:06,631
I did everything Dad said.

327
00:15:06,688 --> 00:15:09,412
I should've known Peter had somethingto do with this.

328
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:12,150
You're notthe first person whose lifehe's screwed up.

329
00:15:16,546 --> 00:15:17,422
Knock, knock.

330
00:15:17,425 --> 00:15:18,733
Nicole? Ronald?

331
00:15:18,748 --> 00:15:20,230
Who's ready for Boggle?

332
00:15:21,175 --> 00:15:22,970
Oh, my God! No!

333
00:15:22,978 --> 00:15:24,543
Why?! Why?!

334
00:15:24,545 --> 00:15:26,511
My beautiful Nicole!

335
00:15:26,598 --> 00:15:28,940
My man Ronald,who did this?

336
00:15:28,946 --> 00:15:31,661
Oh, man, they wereso good together!

337
00:15:31,668 --> 00:15:34,230
We were just establishingour friendship.

338
00:15:34,265 --> 00:15:36,071
They were about to get engaged.

339
00:15:36,077 --> 00:15:38,661
Oh, he was going to ask meto be an usher.

340
00:15:38,678 --> 00:15:40,701
I mean, he alreadyhad enough groomsmen,

341
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:43,070
so he made me an usher,but just to think I

342
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:46,360
could be involvedin the ceremony in any way.

343
00:15:46,476 --> 00:15:49,230
You told Chris to actlike a jerk to this girl?

344
00:15:49,238 --> 00:15:51,480
Well... define "Chris."

345
00:15:51,488 --> 00:15:53,792
Peter, he's reallyupset right now.

346
00:15:53,796 --> 00:15:56,202
I mean, he caredabout this girl a lot.

347
00:15:56,207 --> 00:15:57,601
Can't you seewhat you've done?

348
00:15:57,608 --> 00:15:59,820
I don't know, I mean,I thought I was helping.

349
00:16:00,285 --> 00:16:01,261
But you may be right.

350
00:16:01,266 --> 00:16:03,420
'Cause now Chris isall sad and crying

351
00:16:03,427 --> 00:16:05,000
and fat and bad at sports.

352
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:06,343
Well, you created this mess,

353
00:16:06,356 --> 00:16:08,231
and you have to help him fix it.

354
00:16:08,237 --> 00:16:10,003
Man, parenting is more complicated

355
00:16:10,006 --> 00:16:12,471
than making a 1940s phone call.

356
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:14,060
Hello, operator?

357
00:16:14,066 --> 00:16:15,951
Crestview 4162, please.

358
00:16:15,995 --> 00:16:17,532
One moment, please.

359
00:16:34,258 --> 00:16:34,890
Hello?

360
00:16:34,896 --> 00:16:38,252
- Hello?
- Hello?

361
00:16:39,228 --> 00:16:41,221
Well, what do you know about that?

362
00:16:49,715 --> 00:16:51,441
Hey, Chris, it's me.

363
00:16:51,446 --> 00:16:53,870
- I got something for you here.
- What is it?

364
00:16:53,877 --> 00:16:56,180
I caught you a bullfrog outside.

365
00:16:56,218 --> 00:16:58,752
Poked some holes in its back
so it can breathe.

366
00:16:58,806 --> 00:16:59,950
See, look at this-

367
00:16:59,956 --> 00:17:01,063
oh, boy.

368
00:17:01,576 --> 00:17:03,083
All right, hang on, hang on.

369
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:47,040
I'm never going
to be happy again.

370
00:17:47,047 --> 00:17:48,280
I know how you feel, son,

371
00:17:48,288 --> 00:17:49,570
but you can't give up now.

372
00:17:49,575 --> 00:17:51,913
Now, let's get out there
and meet some ladies, eh?

373
00:17:51,927 --> 00:17:54,132
But I don't want to
date anyone else.

374
00:17:54,138 --> 00:17:55,291
I want Anna.

375
00:17:55,295 --> 00:17:58,571
Chris, you don't want to miss out
on experiencing your teenage years.

376
00:17:58,575 --> 00:18:00,393
If you do, you'll feel
as bad as I do

377
00:18:00,398 --> 00:18:01,811
when I miss the toilet.

378
00:18:05,425 --> 00:18:06,953
Peter Griffin!

379
00:18:13,237 --> 00:18:14,420
All right, Chris, have a seat.

380
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:15,791
Your date'll be
here any minute.

381
00:18:15,796 --> 00:18:18,951
In fact, I think she'll be
coming through that door.

382
00:18:20,255 --> 00:18:22,013
Hey, Chris. I'm Betty.

383
00:18:22,015 --> 00:18:23,273
Sorry I'm late.

384
00:18:23,275 --> 00:18:25,193
Your dad told me all about you.

385
00:18:25,197 --> 00:18:27,080
You sound like a swell fella.

386
00:18:27,087 --> 00:18:29,111
Uh... Thanks.

387
00:18:29,506 --> 00:18:30,730
So where are you from?

388
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,472
I'm from the rich part of town,

389
00:18:32,476 --> 00:18:34,013
so you know I'm a good egg.

390
00:18:34,016 --> 00:18:35,661
But I'm more interested in you.

391
00:18:35,927 --> 00:18:38,283
- Did you finish your homework today?
- What?

392
00:18:38,296 --> 00:18:41,022
You know, your dad's got
a birthday coming up.

393
00:18:41,025 --> 00:18:42,442
Have you given any thought to

394
00:18:42,446 --> 00:18:43,702
what you might be getting him?

395
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,033
How do you know when
my dad's birthday is?

396
00:18:46,035 --> 00:18:47,831
Well, that.. It doesn't matter.

397
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,951
What are you getting
your dad for his birthday?

398
00:18:49,957 --> 00:18:51,763
I don't know.
A tie.

399
00:18:51,766 --> 00:18:54,993
Ooh! I don't know if he
would want one of those.

400
00:18:54,995 --> 00:18:56,910
I think he's got enough ties.

401
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:57,882
I think he might...

402
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,883
Chris, I don'twant a tie!
Pick something else!

403
00:19:01,735 --> 00:19:03,393
Chris, this is Barbara, the girl

404
00:19:03,395 --> 00:19:05,320
from your class you used
to have a crush on.

405
00:19:05,328 --> 00:19:06,893
Now, you kids enjoy yourselves,

406
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,392
and I'll create some atmosphere.

407
00:19:08,395 --> 00:19:11,052
This is a favorite by Men At Work.

408
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:23,291
Look at me with a brand-new Hyundai.

409
00:19:27,438 --> 00:19:28,461
I don't understand, Chris.

410
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:30,271
Your blind date should
be here by now.

411
00:19:30,275 --> 00:19:31,513
She answered the ad.

412
00:19:38,748 --> 00:19:41,511
So, still no luck on the
girl front, huh?

413
00:19:41,516 --> 00:19:43,323
I know Dad's been
trying to help,

414
00:19:43,326 --> 00:19:45,861
and I'm trying to listen to him,
but nothing seems to

415
00:19:45,878 --> 00:19:46,862
be working.

416
00:19:46,865 --> 00:19:48,860
Well, I know I asked
him to help,

417
00:19:48,865 --> 00:19:51,213
but it occurs to me that
you've been taking advice

418
00:19:51,217 --> 00:19:54,293
from everyone except the
one person who matters.

419
00:19:54,296 --> 00:19:55,962
What do you want, Chris?

420
00:19:55,968 --> 00:19:58,410
All I want is to go
out with Anna again.

421
00:19:58,427 --> 00:20:00,330
Then you just need
to go talk to her

422
00:20:00,335 --> 00:20:03,190
and tell her exactly
how you feel.

423
00:20:03,197 --> 00:20:05,760
But she said she never
wants to see me again.

424
00:20:05,766 --> 00:20:07,893
Well, I'm sure you can come
up with some excuse

425
00:20:07,897 --> 00:20:09,422
to see her at the vet.

426
00:20:09,637 --> 00:20:10,780
Is there anymore coffee?

427
00:20:14,215 --> 00:20:16,922
Anna, I'm here with my dog.

428
00:20:17,168 --> 00:20:19,050
He's not feeling well.

429
00:20:19,068 --> 00:20:20,671
**** you.

430
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,741
Don't you think you'd
rather go to another vet?

431
00:20:22,748 --> 00:20:25,271
Anna, to be honest, I came here

432
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:28,391
'cause I wanted to apologize
for acting like such a jerk.

433
00:20:28,598 --> 00:20:30,082
That's not who I am.

434
00:20:30,085 --> 00:20:31,321
Oh, yeah, no, no, no.

435
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:32,593
Yeah, no, you're...you're a cool guy.

436
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:34,041
Brian, shut up!

437
00:20:34,805 --> 00:20:36,682
Look, I was just really nervous

438
00:20:36,686 --> 00:20:39,060
'cause I've never had a girlfriend before,

439
00:20:39,075 --> 00:20:41,573
and I wanted to make sure
I didn't do anything wrong.

440
00:20:41,758 --> 00:20:44,682
You know, you really hurt me, Chris.

441
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:46,583
I know. I was wrong.

442
00:20:46,615 --> 00:20:48,801
I don't want to hurt anybody, Anna.

443
00:20:49,355 --> 00:20:51,690
Please.
Just give me another chance.

444
00:20:51,698 --> 00:20:54,193
Gosh!
He doesn't look so good.

445
00:20:54,198 --> 00:20:55,120
I know.

446
00:20:55,685 --> 00:20:56,922
But you do.

447
00:21:01,018 --> 00:21:03,472
You know, I get off at 4:00.

448
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:05,890
I might just be up for a movie.

449
00:21:09,428 --> 00:21:11,772
Okay, somebody really
needs to help me here.
