00:00:36,209 --> 00:00:37,956
Peter, I need you to
pick up the dry cleaning.

13
00:00:38,003 --> 00:00:38,837
Here's the ticket.

14
00:00:38,925 --> 00:00:40,326
It's the Chinese
one over on Elm.

15
00:00:40,393 --> 00:00:42,528
All right. Well, I need my
other white shirt back anyway.

16
00:00:42,596 --> 00:00:43,996
This one's getting
kind of smelly.

17
00:00:44,064 --> 00:00:45,364
And if I wore another color,

18
00:00:45,432 --> 00:00:46,765
I think it would
just throw people.

19
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:48,234
You only have
two white shirts?

20
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:50,236
Well, I had a third one,
but it got ruined

21
00:00:50,303 --> 00:00:52,204
at that wine tasting at
Michael J. Fox's house.

22
00:00:52,272 --> 00:00:54,073
Hi. I'm Peter Griffin.

23
00:00:54,141 --> 00:00:56,609
Now, we were going to show you
the actual scene,

24
00:00:56,676 --> 00:00:58,944
but it... It would just
make us all sad.

25
00:00:59,012 --> 00:01:01,747
So, I... I'm just going to
tell you what happened.

26
00:01:01,815 --> 00:01:04,717
See, he has this disease,
and it makes him shake a lot,

27
00:01:04,784 --> 00:01:06,352
and what with all the shaking,

28
00:01:06,419 --> 00:01:08,187
he spilled his wine
all over my shirt,

29
00:01:08,255 --> 00:01:10,122
and my shirt, uh, was ruined.

30
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:12,992
So that's what that was.

31
00:01:13,059 --> 00:01:15,027
Um... I mean,
he was very nice about it.

32
00:01:15,095 --> 00:01:17,696
He said... He said,
"Send me the bill."

33
00:01:17,764 --> 00:01:21,300
Which, I mean, that's not
<i>how</i> he said it, uh, but...

34
00:01:21,368 --> 00:01:23,102
You know, we got there.

35
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,504
Anyway, I sent him the bill,
and he sent me this check.

36
00:01:25,572 --> 00:01:27,973
But, uh... It's...

37
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:29,408
I... I don't... I don't...
I don't think

38
00:01:29,476 --> 00:01:31,243
I'm going to be able
to cash this. Um...

39
00:01:31,311 --> 00:01:34,146
I don't... You'd think Tracy Pollan would...
Would be in charge

40
00:01:34,214 --> 00:01:35,548
of the checkbook, you know?

41
00:01:35,615 --> 00:01:37,349
'Cause I mean,
what else is she doing right now?

42
00:01:37,417 --> 00:01:40,052
I don't, I don't think he's got
the leverage to Rita Wilson her

43
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,254
around town anymore.
I mean, I... I... That's...

44
00:01:42,322 --> 00:01:43,656
I mean, that's
where it's gotten.

45
00:01:43,723 --> 00:01:46,258
So... Anyway,
that's what happened to my shirt.

46
00:01:46,326 --> 00:01:48,928
I'm glad we took the high road
on this one.

47
00:01:48,995 --> 00:01:50,396
Wh... What's that?

48
00:01:50,463 --> 00:01:52,831
Oh, wait, now they're telling me
they do want to show it.

49
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:55,768
I really like the finish
on this Shiraz...

50
00:01:55,835 --> 00:01:58,237
Son of a bitch!
What is your problem?

51
00:02:02,542 --> 00:02:04,977
Aw, damn.
Which one's the Chinese one?

52
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,251
That's probably it.

53
00:02:13,386 --> 00:02:15,554
(sensor makes "bing bong" sound)

54
00:02:15,622 --> 00:02:16,822

55
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:17,690

(bing bongs overlapping)

58
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,497
You stop make bing bong!
Every bing bong two cent!

59
00:02:25,565 --> 00:02:26,665
What you want?

60
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:29,301
Uh, yeah.
I'm here to pick up my cleaning?

61
00:02:30,537 --> 00:02:32,204
Aw, cool, look at that!

62
00:02:32,272 --> 00:02:34,473
Aw, this seems like it'd
be a great place to work.

63
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:35,641
But I...

64
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:38,944
I didn't go to college.

65
00:02:39,012 --> 00:02:40,079
That twenty dollar.

66
00:02:42,282 --> 00:02:43,983
Hey, uh,
I think you forgot my shirt.

67
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:46,585
- There no shirt.
- Well, no, I know you have my white shirt.

68
00:02:46,653 --> 00:02:48,087
- Can you check again?
- No need check.

69
00:02:48,154 --> 00:02:49,388
I no have your shirt.

70
00:02:49,456 --> 00:02:51,223
Listen here, Washee-Washee,
you do have my shirt.

71
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:52,358
I no have your shirt.

72
00:02:52,425 --> 00:02:53,592
You yes have my shirt!

73
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,160
- You get out my store!
- You get me shirt!

74
00:02:55,228 --> 00:02:57,296
- You go or I call police!
- You no dare call police!

75
00:02:57,364 --> 00:02:59,465
Oh, you want to play game,
fatso? You big, big...

76
00:02:59,532 --> 00:03:01,967
- 911!
- Fine! I go. But this no over.

77
00:03:02,035 --> 00:03:03,402
I take picture of Ang Lee.

78
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,671
Good! He do too many white
people movie anyway!

79
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:07,139

80
00:03:07,207 --> 00:03:08,907
(bing bongs overlapping)

81
00:03:08,975 --> 00:03:10,843
You no come back, ever!

82
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,013
I no like you American!
And all you American look alike!

83
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,881
Oh, we all look alike, do we?

84
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:18,250
Well, look who's talking!

85
00:03:21,721 --> 00:03:24,189
What do you mean we
can't go there anymore?

86
00:03:24,257 --> 00:03:26,058
Who gives a crap?
We'll get a new cleaners.

87
00:03:26,126 --> 00:03:28,527
- They're all the same.
- They are <i>not</i> all the same!

88
00:03:28,595 --> 00:03:31,830
Peter, I have been going to
Mr. Washee-Washee for ten years,

89
00:03:31,898 --> 00:03:34,033
and I am not finding
another dry cleaner.

90
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,168
Now we are going to
invite him over for dinner,

91
00:03:36,236 --> 00:03:38,037
and you are going
to apologize.

92
00:03:38,104 --> 00:03:39,972
(sighs)
All right, fine.

93
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,140
<i>MR. WASHEE-WASHEE:
Hello?</i>

94
00:03:41,207 --> 00:03:43,742
Hi, Mr. Washee-Washee,
it's Peter Griffin.

95
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,211
Um, my wife wants to invite
you over for dinner.

96
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:48,347
<i>- What you having?</i>
- Number 32?

97
00:03:48,415 --> 00:03:49,248
<i>Ooh!</i>

98
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,155
Peter, isn't there something
you'd like to say

99
00:03:56,222 --> 00:03:58,190
to Mr. Washee-Washee?

100
00:03:58,258 --> 00:03:59,358
(grumbles)

101
00:03:59,426 --> 00:04:00,559
Peter.

102
00:04:00,627 --> 00:04:02,127
Fine.

103
00:04:02,195 --> 00:04:04,897
Mr. Washee-Washee,
I'm sorry I was rude at your store.

104
00:04:04,964 --> 00:04:06,832
Is okay.
I accept your bad apology.

105
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,300
Good.
Now give me back my shirt!

106
00:04:08,368 --> 00:04:09,868
- Peter!
- I no have your shirt!

107
00:04:09,936 --> 00:04:11,570
- You yes have my shirt!
- Enough!

108
00:04:11,638 --> 00:04:13,472
You all banned from my store!

109
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,473
Bing bong.

110
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,508
Great, Peter.
Nice going.

111
00:04:16,576 --> 00:04:18,243
This dinner was
a disaster.

112
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:20,412
Eh, <i>Clash of the Titans</i>
owl was worse.

113
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,214
So you're from Greece.

114
00:04:22,282 --> 00:04:23,782
I've always wanted
to go there.

115
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:24,817
What's it like?

116
00:04:24,884 --> 00:04:26,251
(whirring)

117
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,853
(mechanical hooting)

118
00:04:27,921 --> 00:04:30,055
Yeah, I can't... I can't
understand a word he's saying.

119
00:04:30,123 --> 00:04:32,725
Yeah. I told you, Lois,
only Harry Hamlin can.

120
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:34,159
If you're going to
invite the owl

121
00:04:34,227 --> 00:04:35,661
you got to invite
Harry Hamlin.

122
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:38,664
I will not have Harry
Hamlin in this house.

123
00:04:41,868 --> 00:04:43,769
413, 413.

124
00:04:43,837 --> 00:04:45,471
I think this is it, Chris.

125
00:04:45,538 --> 00:04:48,374

He's got my shirt in there,
I can feel it.

129
00:05:02,322 --> 00:05:03,555
All right, I'm going inside.

130
00:05:14,968 --> 00:05:16,835
I knew it!

131
00:05:16,903 --> 00:05:18,504
Drop it,
or I blow you head off!

132
00:05:20,306 --> 00:05:21,807
Listen, Washee-Washee,
that's my shirt,

133
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,142
and I ain't leaving
here without it.

134

00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,144
Oh, yeah?

136
00:05:28,214 --> 00:05:29,481
Okay, it's not my shirt.

137
00:05:29,549 --> 00:05:32,551
You break in my house,
I can kill you legally.

138
00:05:32,619 --> 00:05:34,286
Fine, shoot me!
But you're going to ruin the shirt.

139
00:05:34,354 --> 00:05:35,521
Take off shirt!

140
00:05:35,588 --> 00:05:37,689
Well, it seems we're
at an impasse.

141
00:05:37,757 --> 00:05:39,291
How do you propose
we settle this?

142
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:42,127

00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,476
I was hoping to be at this
Democratic Party fundraiser.

157
00:06:30,543 --> 00:06:31,777
Oh, God, is that tonight?

158
00:06:31,845 --> 00:06:34,613
Aw... You know,
I promised Barry I'd be there.

159
00:06:34,681 --> 00:06:37,583
I... I call him "Barry,"
you probably know him as "Barack."

160
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,117
Um... Yeah.

161
00:06:39,185 --> 00:06:40,853
So what are
you doing here?

162
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,988
Ah, I'm picking up
my friend Peter.

163
00:06:43,056 --> 00:06:45,357
Are you picking up a...
boyfriend?

164
00:06:45,425 --> 00:06:49,828
No, actually. I got arrested for
protesting the Wal-Mart opening.

165
00:06:49,896 --> 00:06:51,797
Oh, yeah.
I went to the first part of that,

166
00:06:51,865 --> 00:06:54,600
but then some fireworks went off
and I ran for two miles straight.

167
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:56,168
(laughs)

168
00:06:56,236 --> 00:06:58,003
- I'm Denise.
- I'm Brian.

169
00:06:58,071 --> 00:07:00,806
Hey, would you mind if
I asked for your number?

170
00:07:00,874 --> 00:07:02,975
Who knows? Maybe we could
get arrested together.

171
00:07:03,042 --> 00:07:04,109
(laughing)

172
00:07:04,177 --> 00:07:06,845
Sure. I'd like that.

173
00:07:06,913 --> 00:07:10,249
Number 3287.

174
00:07:10,316 --> 00:07:12,184
Come on, Peter.
I'm here to take you home.

175
00:07:12,252 --> 00:07:13,952
I don't know, Brian.

176
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,455
This is the only world
I know anymore.

177
00:07:16,523 --> 00:07:18,290
Peter, you've been in there
for fifteen minutes.

178
00:07:24,397 --> 00:07:26,231
Good morning, everyone.

179
00:07:26,299 --> 00:07:28,133
Oh, crap,
he's in love again.

180
00:07:28,201 --> 00:07:30,202
I know, I know.
But this time it's for real.

181
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,671
You know, I...
I really feel like Denise is the girl

182
00:07:32,739 --> 00:07:34,239
I've waited my whole life for.

183
00:07:34,307 --> 00:07:36,441
Oh, please,
you've only known her a week.

184
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:38,076
Besides, I thought Jillian was

185
00:07:38,144 --> 00:07:39,678
the girl you waited
your whole life for.

186
00:07:39,746 --> 00:07:40,946
Well, Jillian was.

187
00:07:41,014 --> 00:07:42,581
But I'll...
I'll never get her back.

188
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:45,017
But Denise... I really think
there's something special there.

189
00:07:45,084 --> 00:07:47,519
Brian, you went to one
protest rally with her.

190
00:07:47,587 --> 00:07:48,887
It's hardly a date.

191
00:07:48,955 --> 00:07:50,322
Oh yeah? You want to see?

192
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,857
I'll call her right now
and ask her out to dinner.

193
00:07:54,727 --> 00:07:56,428
Hey, Denise?
It's me.

194
00:07:56,496 --> 00:07:58,697
Brian.

195
00:07:58,765 --> 00:07:59,798
Brian Griffin.

196
00:07:59,866 --> 00:08:01,266
STEWIE:
Oh, boy.

197
00:08:01,334 --> 00:08:03,569
Um, hey, listen, you know,
I've had such a great time

198
00:08:03,636 --> 00:08:05,537
hanging out with you,
and I was thinking...

199
00:08:05,605 --> 00:08:08,273
How about we go
on an actual date?

200
00:08:08,341 --> 00:08:09,708
Uh-huh.

201
00:08:09,776 --> 00:08:11,176
Sounds great!

202
00:08:11,244 --> 00:08:12,277
Bye.

203
00:08:12,345 --> 00:08:13,612
So?

204
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,281
Well, guess who has
a date on Saturday?

205
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:19,451
Not me.
(sobbing)

206
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,956
PETER: Put the dog out.
The dog's crying.

207
00:08:24,023 --> 00:08:25,958
Can someone put... Lois!
Can someone put the dog out?

208
00:08:26,025 --> 00:08:27,059
I'm trying to read!

209
00:08:29,128 --> 00:08:31,496
Ugh, what the hell?
What's the matter with you?

210
00:08:31,564 --> 00:08:33,165
Did an ambulance
go by or something?

211
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,371
Hey, Brian... Aw, sweet!
Morning drinking!

212
00:08:51,107 --> 00:08:53,642
Whoo, yeah!
Party!

213
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,544
Peter, I'm not getting
drunk for fun.

214
00:08:55,612 --> 00:08:58,080
I'm drinking because I'm sad.

215
00:08:58,148 --> 00:09:00,015
Because I'm never going to
meet the right woman.

216
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,551
Because I'm...
I'm going to die old and alone.

217
00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:04,153
Oh, you're
Rip Torn drinking.

218
00:09:04,221 --> 00:09:05,721
Well, you know, listen.
Instead of sitting here

219
00:09:05,789 --> 00:09:07,223
feeling sorry for yourself,

220
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,258
why don't you take Quagmire's
class on picking up chicks?

221
00:09:09,326 --> 00:09:10,559
Quagmire teaches a class?

222
00:09:10,627 --> 00:09:12,061
How come I've never
heard about this?

223
00:09:12,128 --> 00:09:14,330
'Cause Quagmire forbids us
to tell you about his life.

224
00:09:14,397 --> 00:09:16,131
As you may recall, he hates you.

225
00:09:16,199 --> 00:09:18,434
Ah, wouldn't help me anyway.
It's a hopeless situation.

226
00:09:18,501 --> 00:09:20,903
You know, if you ever want to
get anywhere with this girl,

227
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:22,838
you gotta ditch that
negative attitude.

228
00:09:22,906 --> 00:09:24,540
You're...
You're as bad as Negatron.

229
00:09:24,608 --> 00:09:26,242
Do as I command,

230
00:09:26,309 --> 00:09:29,678
and we will defeat the Autobots
once and for all!

231
00:09:29,746 --> 00:09:31,013
Nope.
Not going to work.

232
00:09:31,081 --> 00:09:34,016
Oh, come on.
What did we talk about?

233
00:09:34,084 --> 00:09:35,451
Autobots always win.

234
00:09:35,518 --> 00:09:36,752
You think Optimus
Prime's gonna be dead,

235
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,087
but then he's not dead.

236
00:09:38,154 --> 00:09:41,457
I'm taking this from a robot
that turns into a canoe?

237
00:09:41,524 --> 00:09:42,858
When there's a battle on

238
00:09:42,926 --> 00:09:44,526
a gently-moving river,
you'll want me.

239
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:52,601
Now as I said before,
I can't make you into studs.

240
00:09:52,669 --> 00:09:55,604
I can only help you bring out
your "inner stud."

241
00:09:55,672 --> 00:09:57,106
But there's a lot
of potential here.

242
00:09:58,942 --> 00:10:00,409
Now how many of you guys think

243
00:10:00,477 --> 00:10:01,644
a woman is looking
for Prince Charming?

244
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,180
Wrong! They're looking for
bastards like me!

245
00:10:05,248 --> 00:10:07,416
Well, I don't...
I don't know about that.

246
00:10:07,484 --> 00:10:10,386
Mort, how many times you been
laid since your wife died?

247
00:10:10,453 --> 00:10:11,954
Do Muriel's clothes count?

248
00:10:12,022 --> 00:10:13,489
No! You want to know

249
00:10:13,556 --> 00:10:16,091
how many times I've been laid
since last night? 60!

250
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:19,128
Why? 'Cause I'm not trying
to be a girl's Prince Charming.

251
00:10:19,195 --> 00:10:20,562
I'm trying to be
that big mistake

252
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,997
they made at the bar
last night.

253
00:10:22,065 --> 00:10:24,867
Look, what's the first thing you say
to a woman when you meet her?

254
00:10:24,935 --> 00:10:27,403
Pleased to meet you.
That's a handsome scarf pin.

255
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,904
No! You say,

256
00:10:28,972 --> 00:10:31,240
"Hi, there. How's your
relationship with your father?"

257
00:10:31,308 --> 00:10:33,442
If she says anything positive,
move along.

258
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,010
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

259
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:37,046
Brian!
What are you doing here?

260
00:10:37,113 --> 00:10:38,747
- I'm in your class.
- What? No way!

261
00:10:38,815 --> 00:10:40,182
I don't want you in here!

262
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,784
Too bad.
Here's my class receipt.

263
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:43,118
Now teach me how
to find love.

264
00:10:43,186 --> 00:10:44,586
All right. Fine.

265
00:10:44,654 --> 00:10:47,222
But you lick yourself once in
this class and you're out!

266
00:10:49,592 --> 00:10:50,659
Don't look, don't look!

267
00:10:50,727 --> 00:10:52,394
I spilled something.

268
00:10:59,936 --> 00:11:02,304
All right, time to practice
what we've learned.

269
00:11:02,372 --> 00:11:03,439
You're up, Brian.

270
00:11:03,506 --> 00:11:04,807
Now, go hit
on that fat chick.

271
00:11:04,874 --> 00:11:07,242
- What? Why?
- Do it or you get an "F".

272
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,011
All right.

273
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:10,980
Uh, excuse me.

274
00:11:11,047 --> 00:11:13,549
I was just looking you
over and I had a question.

275
00:11:13,616 --> 00:11:15,684
Are those highlights in
your hair or potato chips?

276
00:11:15,752 --> 00:11:17,286
- Highlights!
- Okay.

277
00:11:17,354 --> 00:11:20,289
Hey, will you sign this form
that says I hit on you?

278
00:11:20,357 --> 00:11:21,724
Sassy!

279
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,927
You've got me sweating
above and below my ass.

280
00:11:24,995 --> 00:11:26,295
Let's go, lover.

281
00:11:30,867 --> 00:11:33,335
Okay, what the (bleep)?

282
00:11:33,403 --> 00:11:35,137
I know, I know.

283
00:11:35,205 --> 00:11:38,007
Quagmire told us to dress
flashy so girls would notice us.

284
00:11:38,074 --> 00:11:40,142
Oh, right, peacocking.
How's the class going?

285
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,877
Well, so far so good,
I guess.

286
00:11:41,945 --> 00:11:43,178
But tonight's the real test.

287
00:11:43,246 --> 00:11:45,114
I'm gonna try out what
I've learned on Denise.

288
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:46,281
Well, good luck.

289
00:11:46,349 --> 00:11:47,516
Hey, who was that
fat chick

290
00:11:47,584 --> 00:11:48,884
sneaking out of
here this morning?

291
00:11:48,952 --> 00:11:51,854
Oh, that was someone
I met from class. Bettina.

292
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:54,123
Ooh, that's way too
fancy a name for her.

293
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,358
Her name should be "Thud" or...
or "Oof."

294
00:12:02,298 --> 00:12:05,601
You know, I have to admit, Brian,
I'm glad you called.

295
00:12:05,668 --> 00:12:06,969
I sort of missed
hanging out.

296
00:12:07,037 --> 00:12:08,170
Call me The Paw.

297
00:12:08,238 --> 00:12:09,872
That's what I go by now,
The Paw.

298
00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:12,474
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

299
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:14,376
A lot of babes here tonight.

300
00:12:14,444 --> 00:12:17,146
Shut up for a couple minutes,
I'm gonna look around.

301
00:12:17,213 --> 00:12:18,947
Uh, Brian, you're being
kind of disrespectful.

302
00:12:19,015 --> 00:12:20,249
Ah, relax, baby.

303
00:12:20,316 --> 00:12:22,251
Hey, check your phone.
I sent you something.

304
00:12:22,318 --> 00:12:24,753
(gasps)
Oh, my God! Is... Is that your...?

305
00:12:24,821 --> 00:12:27,656
Yeah. How'd you like to get hit
in the face with that?

306
00:12:27,724 --> 00:12:28,957
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna go.

307
00:12:29,025 --> 00:12:30,492
Why, you getting
more moles put on?

308
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,961
You know, I came here 'cause
I thought I'd made a mistake

309
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:34,530
by not giving you a chance,

310
00:12:34,597 --> 00:12:37,533
but it's obvious you're
just another typical jerk.

311
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,135
Denise, wait!

312
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:45,007
All right, let's see
what you guys have done

313
00:12:45,075 --> 00:12:46,275
to make yourselves look
like douchebags.

314
00:12:46,342 --> 00:12:47,676
You're a son of a bitch.

315
00:12:47,744 --> 00:12:50,212
You're teaching us all this
crap about how to get women

316
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,947
and it's all a bunch of bull!

317
00:12:52,015 --> 00:12:54,683
I came here 'cause
I wanted to get Denise back

318
00:12:54,751 --> 00:12:56,618
and instead,
you ruined my life!

319
00:12:56,686 --> 00:12:59,321
These skills aren't for women
you care about, you idiot.

320
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:01,557
This course is in getting laid,
not finding love.

321
00:13:01,624 --> 00:13:02,991
So, what's the point?

322
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:06,061
If you never find love,
then it's just meaningless sex.

323
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:08,063
How will I get the woman
of my dreams?

324
00:13:08,131 --> 00:13:09,465
Only when you're ready.

325
00:13:09,532 --> 00:13:11,400
And maybe not even then.

326
00:13:11,468 --> 00:13:14,436
You see, women are a lot like
<i>Saturday Night Live</i> sketches.

327
00:13:14,504 --> 00:13:16,004
Lots of them are awful,
some are decent,

328
00:13:16,072 --> 00:13:17,973
and a few are pretty good.

329
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,876
But then there's that one...
That one woman

330
00:13:20,944 --> 00:13:24,179
who's as amazingly perfect
as "Massive Head Wound Harry."

331
00:13:24,247 --> 00:13:27,583
For me, that woman
is Cheryl Tiegs.

332
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,251
You'd never fall
for these tricks.

333
00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:31,286
That's why I keep trying
to figure out

334
00:13:31,354 --> 00:13:33,088
how to bring you
back into my life.

335
00:13:33,156 --> 00:13:34,723
So we can make it work.

336
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,992
I still remember the day we met.

337
00:13:39,362 --> 00:13:41,263
Hey-ho, look at the man
on the unicycle.

338
00:13:41,331 --> 00:13:43,499
Look at the man on the unicycle
with a parrot on his shoulder.

339
00:13:43,566 --> 00:13:45,501
Hey-ho,
put five cents in the hat.

340
00:13:45,568 --> 00:13:47,169
That's quite a skill
you've got the.

341
00:13:47,237 --> 00:13:49,371
Well, ever since I got
discharged from the Navy,

342
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,140
I do anything I can
to make money.

343
00:13:51,207 --> 00:13:53,242
I'm thinking about getting
my pilot's license.

344
00:13:53,309 --> 00:13:55,477
Well, I think
unicycles are sexy.

345
00:13:58,581 --> 00:14:01,550
Glenn, these past few weeks
have been amazing.

346
00:14:01,618 --> 00:14:03,685
I think I'm falling
in love with you.

347
00:14:03,753 --> 00:14:05,721
I know. I feel the same way.

348
00:14:05,788 --> 00:14:07,289
If this is the kind of joy

349
00:14:07,357 --> 00:14:09,691
the '80s has in store for me,
I'm ready.

350
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:12,895
<i>But that wasn't the case.</i>

351
00:14:12,962 --> 00:14:15,497
<i>In fact, things went</i>
<i>wrong real fast.</i>

352
00:14:21,004 --> 00:14:23,939
Uh, Cheryl, don't you think
it's time for us to go now?

353
00:14:24,007 --> 00:14:25,340
Why? We just got here?

354
00:14:25,408 --> 00:14:27,876
- I'm having a good time.
- Yeah, I can tell.

355
00:14:27,944 --> 00:14:30,145
You've been talking to
John Davidson for half an hour.

356
00:14:30,213 --> 00:14:31,947
Hey, Glenn,
great to meet you.

357
00:14:32,015 --> 00:14:33,715
John Davidson,
host of <i>That's Incredible.</i>

358
00:14:33,783 --> 00:14:35,517
Oh, hey, John.
I like your work...

359
00:14:35,585 --> 00:14:37,052
Not!

360
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,921
<i>That was the first time</i>
<i>anybody ever used that.</i>

361
00:14:38,988 --> 00:14:40,355
<i>First time, I swear to God.</i>

362
00:14:40,423 --> 00:14:43,358
Glenn, I've about had it
with your petty jealousy.

363
00:14:43,426 --> 00:14:45,594
I'm starting to think this
relationship is a mistake.

364
00:14:45,662 --> 00:14:48,130
Well, maybe it is.

365
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:51,099
Wow, did you just break up
with Cheryl Tiegs?

366
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:52,668
I sure did.

367
00:14:52,735 --> 00:14:54,203
What do you think of that,
folks?

368
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,572
ALL:
That's incredible!

369
00:15:00,643 --> 00:15:04,079
Someday...
Someday we'll make it right.

370
00:15:04,147 --> 00:15:06,715
You shouldn't have tried
these tricks on Denise, Brian.

371
00:15:06,783 --> 00:15:08,550
But if you ask me,
she got lucky,

372
00:15:08,618 --> 00:15:10,285
because now she's dodged
the bullet of being

373
00:15:10,353 --> 00:15:12,087
in a relationship with
a loser like you.

374
00:15:12,155 --> 00:15:14,189
Well, you just think you know
everything, don't you?

375
00:15:14,257 --> 00:15:16,391
Y... You're like a black
woman in hindsight.

376
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:18,627
I told you.
What did I tell you?

377
00:15:18,695 --> 00:15:21,063
Didn't I tell you?
'Cause I told you.

378
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,432
Mm-hmm,
and when did I tell you?

379
00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:24,800
A long time ago.

380
00:15:24,867 --> 00:15:27,402
And what did I say would
happen when I told you?

381
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,504
Exactly what just happened.

382
00:15:33,543 --> 00:15:35,244
(doorbell ringing)

383
00:15:38,948 --> 00:15:41,583
Wha... Are... Are you...

384
00:15:41,651 --> 00:15:42,784
Cheryl?!

385
00:15:42,852 --> 00:15:44,019
Hi, Glenn.

386
00:15:44,087 --> 00:15:45,954
Oh, my God. Cheryl.

387
00:15:46,022 --> 00:15:47,422
Wha...
What are you doing here?

388
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,024
Well, you know,
it's been so many years,

389
00:15:49,092 --> 00:15:50,325
and I was in the neighborhood,

390
00:15:50,393 --> 00:15:52,394
and I thought I'd just
drop by and say hi.

391
00:15:52,462 --> 00:15:54,997
My new boyfriend I guess knows you,
and told me where you live.

392
00:15:55,064 --> 00:15:56,565
(car horn honks)

393
00:15:56,633 --> 00:15:59,501
Hey, Cheryl, get your fat ass
over here before I dump you.

394
00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:02,704
He's so bossy. I love it.

395
00:16:02,772 --> 00:16:04,740
Well, it was great
seeing you, Glenn.

396
00:16:13,049 --> 00:16:14,783
(laughing)

397
00:16:23,169 --> 00:16:24,536
(loud pounding)

398
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:25,776
QUAGMIRE:
Where is he?!

399
00:16:25,844 --> 00:16:28,245
Where's that
son of a bitch?!

400
00:16:28,313 --> 00:16:30,147
Whoa, whoa.
What's going on, Quagmire?

401
00:16:30,215 --> 00:16:31,748
You dirty bastard.

402
00:16:31,816 --> 00:16:33,350
I always knew
you were low,

403
00:16:33,418 --> 00:16:36,620
but you're nothing more than
a back-stabbing, junkyard cur.

404
00:16:36,688 --> 00:16:38,755
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
what the hell, man?

405
00:16:38,823 --> 00:16:41,792
My whole life's been
dedicated to Cheryl Tiegs!

406
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,160
Yeah, I know. So what?

407
00:16:43,228 --> 00:16:44,695
Your dog is dating her!

408
00:16:44,762 --> 00:16:45,762
No way.

409
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,431
You're banging Cheryl Tiegs?

410
00:16:47,498 --> 00:16:49,600
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

411
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:50,968
Light the beacons.

412
00:16:51,035 --> 00:16:52,669
(fanfare playing)

413
00:17:34,545 --> 00:17:37,648
Cheryl Tiegs.
Nice.

414
00:17:44,122 --> 00:17:46,178
I really like
this restaurant.

415
00:17:46,202 --> 00:17:48,304
Well, you seem to
like everything.

416
00:17:48,326 --> 00:17:50,060
Brian, you're acting
a little distant.

417
00:17:50,128 --> 00:17:51,361
Yeah, get whatever you want.

418
00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:54,798
Oh, hey guys,
fancy me running into you here.

419
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:56,533
Oh, hey, Quagmire.

420
00:17:56,601 --> 00:17:58,669
Listen, Brian, I...
I've been a real heel,

421
00:17:58,736 --> 00:18:00,904
and I'd like
to make it up to you.

422
00:18:00,972 --> 00:18:04,775
Oh, well, that's very kind of you,
but there... There's no need.

423
00:18:04,842 --> 00:18:07,077
No, no, no, no,
I... I want to. I want to.

424
00:18:07,145 --> 00:18:09,212
In fact, you know,
since you guys are already here,

425
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,448
I'd like to treat
the four of us to dinner.

426
00:18:11,516 --> 00:18:13,784
Well, sure, I...
Wait, who's the fourth?

427
00:18:13,851 --> 00:18:15,285
Oh, my new girlfriend.

428
00:18:15,353 --> 00:18:16,520
Here she is.

429
00:18:16,587 --> 00:18:19,022
- Jillian?
- Hi, Brian.

430
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,223
How are you?

431
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:21,525
Oh, he's doing great.

432
00:18:21,592 --> 00:18:23,026
Isn't that right, pal?

433
00:18:23,094 --> 00:18:25,796
Guy looks like a million bucks,
all green and wrinkly, right?

434
00:18:25,863 --> 00:18:27,230
Oh, get in here.

435
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:29,333
Ha-ha, hey, ho, ho,
whoa, heh.

436
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,235
Okay, let's, uh...
Let's have dinner, huh?

437
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:37,607
So, uh, how did you
guys get together?

438
00:18:37,675 --> 00:18:40,043
Um, he showed up at my door

439
00:18:40,111 --> 00:18:42,112
and said he was
a Federal Boob Inspector.

440
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,882
And I was gonna tell him to go away,
but he had a warrant.

441
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,417
It was a Snickers wrapper, Brian.

442
00:18:47,485 --> 00:18:48,952
I held up a Snickers wrapper.

443
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,254
But then he started saying
things to me

444
00:18:51,322 --> 00:18:53,790
that my father might say
if he were still alive,

445
00:18:53,858 --> 00:18:56,593
and I knew I liked him.

446
00:18:56,661 --> 00:18:58,462
Well, I guess you guys have
gotten pretty close, huh?

447
00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:01,098
Did Quagmire ever tell you
he was obese as a child?

448
00:19:01,165 --> 00:19:03,000
Did Brian ever tell you
he once had a tick

449
00:19:03,067 --> 00:19:05,569
on the back of his neck that he
couldn't reach with his mouth,

450
00:19:05,636 --> 00:19:07,771
and it swelled up to the
size of a ping-pong ball?

451
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:09,339
Well, it was still smaller
than that thing

452
00:19:09,407 --> 00:19:10,841
you had on your lip
for three years.

453
00:19:10,908 --> 00:19:12,509
Oh, three years?
You mean like

454
00:19:12,577 --> 00:19:14,444
the three years you
have left on this planet?

455
00:19:14,512 --> 00:19:15,846
Oh, that's nice.

456
00:19:15,913 --> 00:19:18,215
Hey, if you guys are so close,
maybe Jillian should know

457
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,083
that you teach a class
in picking up women.

458
00:19:20,151 --> 00:19:22,219
And Cheryl should know
that you took that class.

459
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,454
Does Jillian know you're half Polish,
Mr. Quagglechek?

460
00:19:24,522 --> 00:19:25,655
You son of a bitch!

461
00:19:27,325 --> 00:19:28,759
(snarling)

462
00:19:31,863 --> 00:19:34,231
Enough.
Stop it, both of you.

463
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,533
You obviously have
no respect for either of us.

464
00:19:36,601 --> 00:19:38,735
Yeah, you're acting all mean.

465
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:42,005
Now I'm glad you made me
face away during sex.

466
00:19:42,073 --> 00:19:44,541
Maybe you boys will get
it together someday,

467
00:19:44,609 --> 00:19:46,777
but it looks like that's
all you are: Boys.

468
00:19:46,844 --> 00:19:50,180
Yeah. Boys.
Yay, I helped.

469
00:19:50,248 --> 00:19:52,115
- Cheryl, wait.
- Jillian.

470
00:19:52,183 --> 00:19:54,117
I'm sorry.
I'll do anything, please.

471
00:19:58,523 --> 00:19:59,923
Meg?

472
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:02,159
Yeah, this still
happens sometimes.

473
00:20:07,632 --> 00:20:09,232
Hey.

474
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,501
- You okay?
- Yep.

475
00:20:11,569 --> 00:20:13,003
Just waiting for my car.

476
00:20:15,073 --> 00:20:18,675
Look, I'm sorry
I did what I did.

477
00:20:18,743 --> 00:20:22,079
Cheryl's great,
and I hope someday

478
00:20:22,146 --> 00:20:23,713
you get the chance
to be with her.

479
00:20:23,781 --> 00:20:26,483
No. I'm never gonna get
that chance again.

480
00:20:26,551 --> 00:20:28,585
I blew it for good, Brian.

481
00:20:28,653 --> 00:20:29,953
And you know what?

482
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:31,421
I deserve to be lonely.

483
00:20:31,489 --> 00:20:32,823
I'm no saint.

484
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,991
I dated Jillian
just to hurt you.

485
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:36,593
It's okay.

486
00:20:36,661 --> 00:20:39,262
It probably wouldn't have worked out,
like everything else.

487
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,665
Hey, you know, may...
Maybe it took us

488
00:20:41,732 --> 00:20:43,900
stealing each other's girls
to finally become friends.

489
00:20:43,968 --> 00:20:45,135
Yeah, maybe.

490
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:53,777
Oh, hey, uh, listen,
Cheryl actually drove me,

491
00:20:53,845 --> 00:20:56,113
and I spent all my cash
in the restaurant

492
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,548
even... Even... 
Even though you said you'd pay.

493
00:20:58,616 --> 00:21:01,184
So, uh, would you mind
giving me a lift home, buddy?

494
00:21:01,252 --> 00:21:04,652
