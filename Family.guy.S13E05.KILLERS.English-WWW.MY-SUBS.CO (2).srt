ANNOUNCER:
Live from New York City,

13
00:00:34,591 --> 00:00:37,692
it's the JCPenney
Thanksgiving Day Parade.

14
00:00:37,728 --> 00:00:39,294
The JCPenney parade?

15
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:40,962
Yeah, it's like
the Macy's parade,

16
00:00:40,998 --> 00:00:43,231
only without
licensed characters.

17
00:00:43,267 --> 00:00:46,234
ANNOUNCER: With the popular
balloons we all know and love--

18
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,602
Mickey Rabbit,

19
00:00:47,638 --> 00:00:48,937
Sponge Cow,

20
00:00:48,972 --> 00:00:51,907
and Clifton the Small Blue Dog.

21
00:00:51,942 --> 00:00:54,776
LOIS:
Peter, get in here!

22
00:00:54,811 --> 00:00:56,378
You want to tell me
what the hell happened

23
00:00:56,413 --> 00:00:57,913
to our Thanksgiving turkey?

24
00:00:57,948 --> 00:00:59,314
Oh, that.

25
00:00:59,349 --> 00:01:01,183
Uh, well, last night,
Brian and I

26
00:01:01,218 --> 00:01:02,817
got drunk and
ate the turkey.

27
00:01:02,853 --> 00:01:06,087
But before you get mad,
we also ate the salad.

28
00:01:06,123 --> 00:01:07,756
Damn it, how could
you guys do that?!

29
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:09,424
Boy, I must have
been really drunk.

30
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:10,592
I don't remember
any of that.

31
00:01:10,627 --> 00:01:11,660
No problem.

32
00:01:11,695 --> 00:01:13,461
Instagram
remembers for you.

33
00:01:20,504 --> 00:01:22,224
Peter, we've got a houseful
of people coming

34
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:24,005
and they're
expecting a turkey.

35
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:25,340
Well, if they're
expecting a turkey,

36
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:27,309
I'll just put on
<i>Evan Almighty</i> for them.

37
00:01:27,344 --> 00:01:28,344
(gleefully):
Zap!

38
00:01:30,447 --> 00:01:32,948
You and Brian better get
another turkey right now!

39
00:01:32,983 --> 00:01:35,250
And don't bother
coming back until you do!

40
00:01:35,285 --> 00:01:36,551
Don't worry, Lois.
We will.

41
00:01:36,587 --> 00:01:37,919
Yeah, we'll be back
with a turkey

42
00:01:37,955 --> 00:01:39,688
faster than you can
say, "Jack Robinson."

43
00:01:39,723 --> 00:01:41,289
Jack Rober...

44
00:01:41,325 --> 00:01:42,791
(slurring)

45
00:01:42,826 --> 00:01:45,794
(slurring):
Jack Row...

46
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:47,696
She had a stroke that killed
the part of her brain

47
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:49,397
that says "Jack Robinson."

48
00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:50,966
We got plenty of time.

49
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:57,405
All right, Brian,
first order of business--

50
00:01:57,441 --> 00:01:59,307
we have to decide
who gets to ride in the cart

51
00:01:59,343 --> 00:02:00,709
and who has to push it.

52
00:02:00,744 --> 00:02:02,077
Well, I'm smaller, so...

53
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,778
The decision
has been made.

54
00:02:03,814 --> 00:02:05,413
Ooh, now I want that one.

55
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:11,353
Aw, crap-- looks like
they're completely sold out.

56
00:02:11,388 --> 00:02:12,520
Yeah, sorry.

57
00:02:12,556 --> 00:02:14,789
We just sold our last
turkey to that guy.

58
00:02:16,226 --> 00:02:19,294
You are the turkey
I have chosen to pardon.

59
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:21,663
Fly free, turkey!

60
00:02:25,102 --> 00:02:27,469
Oh, Fudgsicles!

61
00:02:30,107 --> 00:02:32,307
Hey, you don't sell
turkeys here, do you?

62
00:02:32,342 --> 00:02:35,076
We've been to every grocery
store in town with no luck.

63
00:02:36,847 --> 00:02:38,613
are these little packets
of weird vitamins

64
00:02:38,649 --> 00:02:41,383
that vaguely suggest
they help you in the bedroom.

65
00:02:41,418 --> 00:02:44,753
"Performance and
stamina, for men."

66
00:02:44,788 --> 00:02:48,456
I know what that means.

67
00:02:48,492 --> 00:02:52,427
(playing "Stars and Stripes
Forever")

68
00:02:52,462 --> 00:02:54,896
Peter, enough.
Come to bed.

69
00:02:54,931 --> 00:02:56,131
Uh-uh, Lois.

70
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,333
The packet says I got to
play till I'm raw.

71
00:02:58,368 --> 00:02:59,734
(continues playing)

72
00:03:02,773 --> 00:03:04,072
Can't believe
every turkey

73
00:03:04,107 --> 00:03:06,841
within a 60-mile radius
of Quahog is sold out.

74
00:03:06,877 --> 00:03:09,010
I know. And now
we're so far from home,

75
00:03:09,046 --> 00:03:10,845
none of your

Chris, are Brian and

88

No. And why are you saying
the dog's name before Dad's?

89
00:03:40,944 --> 00:03:43,278
It's weird.
That is weird, you're right.

Well, they better
get here soon.

What? What are you
talking about?

94
00:03:51,188 --> 00:03:53,228
Well, the fat man's never
going to get back in time,

95
00:03:53,256 --> 00:03:55,790
and with him gone, that makes
you the man of the house.

Chris, Chris, slow down.

98
00:03:58,995 --> 00:04:00,562
I'm just saying,
without Peter here,

99
00:04:00,597 --> 00:04:02,697
you're going to have to be
the host of Thanksgiving.

100
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:05,734
You have to do everything
the fat man normally would.

101
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:07,535
You mean, like,
fall asleep on the toilet

102
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:10,472
and have a big red ring
on my bum for a week?

103
00:04:10,507 --> 00:04:12,273
No, no, no-- greeting
guests as they arrive.

104
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:13,875
Facilitating small talk.

105
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,077
And, of course, giving
the Thanksgiving toast.

106
00:04:16,113 --> 00:04:18,213
Boy, yesterday I'm
microwaving a cat,

107
00:04:18,248 --> 00:04:19,848
today I'm giving
a speech.

108
00:04:19,883 --> 00:04:22,817
Things move fast
around here.

109
00:04:26,323 --> 00:04:28,656
Hi, do you have any turkeys?

110
00:04:28,692 --> 00:04:30,525
Sure do.
You're looking at one.

111
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,726
(laughs):
I'm sorry.

112
00:04:31,762 --> 00:04:34,129
You have to know me
to know I'm just joking.

113
00:04:34,164 --> 00:04:35,797
Sir, the day we've had,

114
00:04:35,832 --> 00:04:38,767
we could use
a good chuckle like that.

115
00:04:38,802 --> 00:04:40,168
You folks are in luck.

116
00:04:40,203 --> 00:04:42,470
Looks like we have
one turkey left.

117
00:04:42,506 --> 00:04:43,772
Oh, thank God.

118
00:04:43,807 --> 00:04:44,906
Oh, you're telling me.

119
00:04:44,941 --> 00:04:46,541
We didn't come back
with a turkey,

120
00:04:46,576 --> 00:04:49,010
Lois would be madder than
that time she got a Capp smear.

121
00:04:49,045 --> 00:04:51,346
All right, we're just going
to take a quick Capp smear.

122
00:04:51,381 --> 00:04:53,047
Don't you mean
pap smear?

123
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,283
No, at this hospital
we obtain the sample

124
00:04:55,318 --> 00:04:58,520
using beloved British comic
strip roustabout Andy Capp.

125
00:04:58,555 --> 00:05:00,755
'Ello, luv.

126
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,023
Let's have a smear.

127
00:05:02,058 --> 00:05:03,591
I'm not letting
you do that.

128
00:05:03,627 --> 00:05:04,826
You can't even see.

129
00:05:04,861 --> 00:05:08,930
That's all right, bird.
I goes by smell.

130
00:05:11,835 --> 00:05:14,636
Brian, look,
an eight-foot basket.

131
00:05:14,671 --> 00:05:16,070
Let me just dunk
the turkey once.

132
00:05:16,106 --> 00:05:18,006
I know I can jam it.

133
00:05:20,243 --> 00:05:21,943
That's not
a regulation rim.

134
00:05:21,978 --> 00:05:23,711
Okay, you know what?
I'm in charge of the turkey.

135
00:05:23,747 --> 00:05:25,647
You're driving.

136
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:31,986
This thing on?

137
00:05:32,022 --> 00:05:33,054
Yes.

138
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:34,322
It's not making
any noise.

139
00:05:34,357 --> 00:05:35,924
It's a hybrid.
Trust me, it's on.

140
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,192
No, it's not. See?

141
00:05:37,227 --> 00:05:38,359
(whirring)

142
00:05:40,931 --> 00:05:43,565
(both screaming)

143
00:05:49,506 --> 00:05:51,406
(gasping)

144
00:05:51,441 --> 00:05:53,475
Oh, my God!

145
00:06:05,388 --> 00:06:06,921
(gasping)

146
00:06:06,957 --> 00:06:09,591
Not now! Not like this!

147
00:06:13,663 --> 00:06:15,196
(gasping, coughing)

148
00:06:15,232 --> 00:06:16,965
Peter, what the hell?!

149
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,800
You chose
a turkey over me?!

150
00:06:18,835 --> 00:06:20,168
I almost died!

151
00:06:20,203 --> 00:06:23,905
I swear to God, I thought
dogs could breathe underwater.

152
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:31,520
Great. The water completely
killed my phone.

153
00:06:31,555 --> 00:06:32,721
Oh, horrors.

154
00:06:32,756 --> 00:06:34,122
You have to spend
time with me

155
00:06:34,157 --> 00:06:35,557
without looking
at your phone.

156
00:06:35,592 --> 00:06:36,658
Here, give me yours.

157
00:06:36,693 --> 00:06:38,660
I threw mine
at a duck.

158
00:06:38,695 --> 00:06:40,495
Excuse me, can you help us?

159
00:06:40,531 --> 00:06:41,997
We're trying to get
back to Quahog.

160
00:06:42,032 --> 00:06:44,566
If you want, I can take you
as far as the bus station.

161
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:46,201
You can?
Oh, thank you so much!

162
00:06:46,236 --> 00:06:48,637
Oh, that is the nicest thing
anyone's done for me

163
00:06:48,672 --> 00:06:51,640
since my kids gave me
that Father's Day gift.

164

All right, Chris,
acting as host

167
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:08,123
will demand a higher
level of conversation.

168
00:07:08,158 --> 00:07:09,658
I suggest
as your opener--

169
00:07:09,693 --> 00:07:11,893
"Lois, everything
is delicious."

170
00:07:11,929 --> 00:07:13,862
Then that's
what I will say.

171
00:07:13,897 --> 00:07:15,730
Unless Slender Man
commands me

172
00:07:15,766 --> 00:07:17,265
to say something else.

173
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:20,669
Ugh, this is gonna be
a bigger disaster than Y2-Gay.

174

Three! Two! One!

177
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,616
I really had to poop.

178
00:07:34,651 --> 00:07:36,418
Wait, where is there
a bathroom on this bus?

179
00:07:36,453 --> 00:07:37,852
I didn't say there
was a bathroom,

180

Hitchhike? You know

00:12:44,373 --> 00:12:46,773
Internet stuff
is not real words.

317
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:48,842
Hey, look!

318
00:12:51,113 --> 00:12:52,245
There's our answer.

319
00:12:52,281 --> 00:12:54,247
We break into the zoo,
steal a turkey,

320
00:12:54,283 --> 00:12:55,916
bring it home, we're heroes.

321
00:12:56,952 --> 00:12:58,151
Peter, stop it!

322
00:12:58,187 --> 00:12:59,387
You're gonna
get yourself hurt.

323
00:12:59,421 --> 00:13:00,654
Sorry, can't hear you.

324
00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:02,389
Too busy saving
our family's Thanksgiving.

325
00:13:02,424 --> 00:13:04,157
(sighs)
Damn it.

326
00:13:04,193 --> 00:13:05,258
This is idiotic.

327
00:13:05,294 --> 00:13:06,860
You're never gonna find
a turkey in there.

328
00:13:06,895 --> 00:13:08,128
Oh, I'll find one.

329
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:09,496
I mean, you're
looking at the guy

330
00:13:09,531 --> 00:13:11,064
who found the
Fountain of Youth.

331
00:13:13,936 --> 00:13:17,304
It's very far
away from here!

332
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:23,777
Hey, Lois,
thanks for letting Kevin

333
00:13:23,812 --> 00:13:25,379
bring his girlfriend
this year.

334
00:13:25,414 --> 00:13:27,848
And I hope it's not awkward
that she's a little person

335
00:13:27,883 --> 00:13:29,649
and they viciously fight
all the time.

336
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:32,352
Why do we have to spend every
holiday with<i> your</i> family?

337
00:13:32,388 --> 00:13:34,488
Shut up!
I'm a full-size person!

338
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:35,889
I make the decisions!

339
00:13:35,924 --> 00:13:37,724
Don't you worry.
This'll quickly turn

340
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,093
into rough,
front-yard, makeup sex.

341
00:13:40,129 --> 00:13:42,896
All this fighting is
making me so damn hot.

342
00:13:46,402 --> 00:13:47,667
Oh, my God.

343
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:50,170
It looks like he's
chalking a pool cue.

344
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:51,338
Hey, scoot over.

345
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:52,739
As the oldest guy here,

346
00:13:52,775 --> 00:13:54,674
it's my duty to take
an open mouth nap

347
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,009
in the middle of the room.

348
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,677
(snoring)

349
00:13:57,713 --> 00:13:59,579
(grunts, groans)

350
00:13:59,615 --> 00:14:01,615
(snoring resumes)

351
00:14:05,921 --> 00:14:07,287
God, look at my mom.

352
00:14:07,322 --> 00:14:09,022
Dinner should've been served
half an hour ago.

353
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,057
She's clearly stalling
for time.

354
00:14:11,093 --> 00:14:12,225
Okay, everybody.

355
00:14:12,261 --> 00:14:14,494
Dinner's gonna be ready
very soon.

356
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,029
(grunting)
Uh, what?

357
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,731
Um, oh, good. (grunts)

358
00:14:17,766 --> 00:14:19,299
But before we get started,

359
00:14:19,334 --> 00:14:22,536
I thought we could all take
turns telling a long story

360
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:25,238
about how things aren't
the way they used to be.

361
00:14:25,274 --> 00:14:27,307
Daddy, would you care
to start?

362
00:14:27,342 --> 00:14:28,408
You bet I would.

363
00:14:28,444 --> 00:14:29,609
Too much candy!

364
00:14:29,645 --> 00:14:30,811
Too much candy?

365
00:14:30,846 --> 00:14:32,612
What do you mean,
too much candy?

366
00:14:32,648 --> 00:14:33,814
There's too much candy!

367
00:14:33,849 --> 00:14:35,449
There used to be four candies.

368
00:14:35,484 --> 00:14:38,151
Bulls-eyes, Yahoos,
Sweet Yarn and cigarettes.

369
00:14:38,187 --> 00:14:39,553
Now I go into a store,

370
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:41,121
I don't know whether
I'm coming or going!

371
00:14:41,156 --> 00:14:42,522
Is there anything else?

372
00:14:42,558 --> 00:14:45,225
Why don't ballplayers wear
giant woolen shirts anymore?

373
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,793
What's wrong with wool?

374
00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:48,161
It was a perfect fabric.

375
00:14:48,197 --> 00:14:50,397
You go to the ballpark,
get your bag of Bulls-eyes

376
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:53,233
and watch Hack Wilson round
the bases in a big wool shirt.

377
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:55,735
I once saw Hack hit a ball
out of the infield.

378
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:57,704
I still remember
the thud of the bat

379
00:14:57,739 --> 00:14:59,239
and the whoosh of the wool.

380
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:02,676
(sighs)
I wish things were still heavy.

381
00:15:02,711 --> 00:15:04,211
Oh, the rails are
off this thing.

382
00:15:04,246 --> 00:15:06,079
All right, Chris,
this is where you, as host,

383
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,481

Are you drunk?

386
00:15:13,422 --> 00:15:15,155
I couldn't handle
the pressure, Stewie.

387
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:18,458
We Irish,
we have a deep sadness.

Oh, come on, get up!

00:17:45,874 --> 00:17:47,273
we got ourselves
a turkey, right?

No. We've come this far.

Let's do it right.

Hey, you got a tiny head
and a big body.

What if I switched that?

We got ourselves a turkey.

00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:04,991
Yeah, but what
time is it?

444
00:18:05,027 --> 00:18:06,667
I mean, dinner has to
have started by now.

445
00:18:06,695 --> 00:18:08,094
We're never gonna make
it home on foot.

446
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,130
Maybe we don't have to.

447
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,836
We're now arriving in Quahog.

448
00:18:16,872 --> 00:18:19,272
Up on the right are the people
with the awesome trampoline,

449
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:21,241
but they don't let me
on it no more,

450
00:18:21,276 --> 00:18:23,677
'cause I bounced a kid
onto the house.

451
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,280
There were no
squeezable condiments.

452
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:28,748
Ketchup came in a can.

453
00:18:28,784 --> 00:18:31,785
And, Daddy, what about the pants
that kids today are wearing?

454
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,820
Are they properly sized?

455
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,155
Are we gonna eat soon?

456
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,389
I have an interesting factoid

457
00:18:36,425 --> 00:18:38,458
about what makes you
sleepy afterwards.

458
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:40,493
Yeah, the hell with this.
I'm starving.

459
00:18:41,963 --> 00:18:44,931
Okay, I guess we should eat.

460
00:18:47,369 --> 00:18:49,369
Well, obviously
Peter's not here.

461
00:18:49,404 --> 00:18:51,638
So it's fallen to me
to take up the mantle.

462
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:54,140
Now, I wasn't planning on
doing this today,

463
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:57,777
but when I look around at all
of these open, loving faces

464
00:18:57,813 --> 00:18:59,412
or friends and family,

465
00:18:59,448 --> 00:19:01,915
I am comfortable enough
to finally say

466
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:05,251
that I am a proud,
unashamed, active...

467
00:19:05,287 --> 00:19:08,388
Lois, we're home
and Thanksgiving is saved!

468
00:19:08,423 --> 00:19:09,689
Kidding!

469
00:19:09,725 --> 00:19:11,691
Oh, my God, where the
hell have you been?

470
00:19:11,727 --> 00:19:13,560
And what are you doing
with a live turkey?!

471
00:19:13,595 --> 00:19:16,329
A live turkey
who loves Rollerblading.

472
00:19:18,633 --> 00:19:19,999
Our dog drew that.

473
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:22,168
Peter, we can't eat
a live turkey.

474
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:24,771
Look, Lois, I still got time
to make this right.

475
00:19:24,806 --> 00:19:25,905
And I'm gonna.

476
00:19:25,941 --> 00:19:28,608
Hand me a nine iron
and show me to the backyard.

477
00:19:30,445 --> 00:19:33,513
Well, buddy, I guess this is it.

478
00:19:44,626 --> 00:19:46,526
Aah! Aah!

479
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,628
Wow, I-I...

480
00:19:48,663 --> 00:19:50,630
I read that look wrong.

481
00:19:50,665 --> 00:19:52,432
Ah, geez, I'm sorry.

482
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:54,067
I wish you didn't have to die,

483
00:19:54,102 --> 00:19:56,436
but a bunch of white people
put on sweaters.

484
00:20:01,877 --> 00:20:03,743
I couldn't do it.
What?

485
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:05,111
I'm sorry, Lois.

486
00:20:05,147 --> 00:20:06,827
I know you wanted the
perfect Thanksgiving,

487
00:20:06,848 --> 00:20:08,782
and I know I screwed
that all up for you,

488
00:20:08,817 --> 00:20:10,416
but when you
think about it,

489
00:20:10,452 --> 00:20:13,019
isn't this holiday about
being with people you love?

490
00:20:13,054 --> 00:20:15,421
I mean, does it really matter
what we eat?

491
00:20:15,457 --> 00:20:17,390
What matters
is we're all together.

492
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:19,592
Family and friends.

493
00:20:19,628 --> 00:20:21,795
And one new friend.

494
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,330
Oh, Peter, that's beautiful.

495
00:20:24,366 --> 00:20:27,200
Lois, can the turkey please
join us for dinner?

496
00:20:27,235 --> 00:20:30,270
Not as the meal,
but as our guest?

497
00:20:30,305 --> 00:20:32,071
Of course he can.

498
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:33,773
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.

499
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:35,842
(gunshot)

500
00:20:35,877 --> 00:20:38,778
(slurring):
The man of the house

501
00:20:38,814 --> 00:20:41,481
killed a turkey
for Thanksgiving!

502
00:20:42,851 --> 00:20:44,717
Well, looks like we're
having turkey after all.

503
00:20:44,753 --> 00:20:46,160
(laughter)
