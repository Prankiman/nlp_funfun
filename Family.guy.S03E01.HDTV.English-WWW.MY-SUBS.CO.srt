"It seems today that all you see

00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,350
"Is violence in movies and sex on TV

00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:12,180

good old-fashioned values

10
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,720
I'm in a rut.
Nothing thrills me any more.

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,500
I can't even think of a reason to
get off the bed in the morning.

12
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,750
- Really?
- My life is so pathetic.

13
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,700
I've seen that Behind the Music
with Leif Garrett 18 times.

14
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,060
- Hey, Leif. It's been a while.
- Too long, man.

15
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,100
I'm so sorry about everything, man. I'm so...

16
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,090
Ready for a bombshell? You saved my life.

17
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,090
But... but I was driving. I...

18
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:06,120
I was on a road to destruction, man. The
accident may have crippled me, but I'm alive.

19
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,950
Can we turn off the cameras, dude?

20
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,570
It's... it's like I'm, I don't know,
trapped in my own life.

21
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,650
Well, Brian, you may be too inwardly
focused.

22
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:18,560
Try thinking about others.
Why don't you do some volunteer work?

23
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,010
That makes sense.
Volunteer work. Thanks, Bruce.

24
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,090
You still have 13 more minutes.

25
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,830
Oh. Do I? Hm.

26
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,320
I, uh, I notice you got a new receptionist.
Nice little body on her, huh?

27
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,440
That's my daughter.

28
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,810
We could probably call this an early day,
huh?

29
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,630
Attention, everyone.

30
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,460
Due to several complaints and
two deaths related to worker fatigue,

31
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,830
I have decided to throw
a company picnic this Saturday.

32
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:54,490
- How you gettin' to the picnic?
- I don't know. I don't have a ride.

33
00:01:54,530 --> 00:02:00,350
Hey, John, you got a two-seater. Hey, Derek,
maybe you go with John, huh? Huh?

34
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,680
For the last time, I'm not gay.

35
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,970
- Thanks anyway.
- We'll get him.

36
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,870
Here. Right this way. Watch your step.

37
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,330
OK. They're in the woods.

38
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,700
The camera keeps on moving.

39
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:19,860
Uh, I think they're lookin' for some witch or
something. I don't know. I wasn't listening.

40
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,430
Nothing's happening. Nothing's happening.

41
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,720
Something about a map.

42
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,920
Nothing's happening.

43
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,290
It's over. A lot of people
in the audience look pissed.

44
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,820
Now, remember, Chris, we have to
work together so that our steps...

45
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,760
This is my favourite event:
Catch the greased-up deaf guy.

46
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,300
Go!

47
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,250
You're never gonna catch me!
You're wastin' your time!

48
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,910
Forget about it! Go do somethin' else!

49
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,700
See y'all next year!

50
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,270
- King me.
- I don't want to play any more.

51
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,880
The pain. I can't live like this, Brian.

52
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,380
I need you to pull the plug.

53
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,790
I-I can't. I...

54
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,740
Be my angel and set me free.

55
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,030
Please.

56
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,890
Oh, my God! You were really gonna do it!

57
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,300
I... But... You...

58
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,790
Nurse! This dog is trying to kill me! Nurse!

59
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,040
You are twisted, lady. You hear me?
You are screwed up in the head.

60
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,020
The winner of our final contest
will receive a very special prize.

61
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,270
A week's paid vacation!

62
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,880
Did you hear that? Oh, God,
please let it be a fart contest.

63
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,460
These are tranquilliser darts.

64
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,540
I have enough here to take down
Robert Downey Jr.

65
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,450
Robert Downey...

66
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:07,740
The last one left standing wins.
Let the game begin.

67
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,050
- All right!
- Run for your life, Peter!

68
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,130
Look at him. He runs like a Welshman.

69
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,330
Doesn't he? Doesn't he run like a Welshman?

70
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,280
- Hey, Brian.
- Hi, Joe.

71
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,070
Bonnie making chicken Marsala?

72
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:34,600
No. She made that three nights ago.
Wow! That's some nose you've got!

73
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,100
Yeah. One time it almost
got me a spokesman deal.

74
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,340
"Follow your nose. "
"Follow your nose. " "Follow your nose. "

75
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,210
Oh, I'm sorry. No, that was good.

76
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,160
I-I just didn't think you were
gonna go so cartoony with it.

77
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,490
- How would you read it?
- Oh, I don't know.

78
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:57,520
I was thinkin' of doin' it, you know, good.
Like an actor. But your way's good too.

79
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,300
We could use a nose like that at the precinct.

80
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,130
Really?

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,200
I guess it's just down to you and me, Peter.
One of us is gonna win that paid vacation.

82
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,900
I don't wanna feed Grandma bacon
while she's in the bathtub.

83
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,900
Peter, are you OK?

84
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,510
Mr Weed, I think Peter needs a doc...

85
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,960
We have a winner!

86
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,030
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

87
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,650
No drugs. She's good. He's clean.

88
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,980
That's it, except for the flight crew.

89
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,760
Hey, Brian. What's with
the Johnny Law routine?

90
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,510
Say hello to our newest narc. He's a natural.

91
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,920
Oh, yeah? How good are you?

92
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,320
You're back from Manila. You ate lumpia,
then you made love to two Filipino women.

93
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,360
- And a man.
- You mean three Filipino women.

94
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,270
No-o-o-o-o!

95
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,680
Wait a second. Got something.

96
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,320
This could be the real deal, boys. Let's do it!

97
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,000
Don't move, dirtbag!

98
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:39,700
It's coke! Yes! All right! We got 'em! This is
great. This is the rush I've been lookin' for.

99
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,150
Good work, Brian.
Uh, you still got a little, uh...

100
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,020
Oh. Oh, thanks.

101
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:54,300
Where shall we go for your week off?

102
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,460
We could all go to Purgatory
like we did last year.

103
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:02,570
This isn't bad. It's not that good,
but it's not that bad.

104
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,730
- It's so-so.
- Yeah. More or less.

105
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:11,560
Hey, Brian. If cops are pigs,
does that make you a schnozage?

106
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,590
- Did you stay up all night writing that?
- I got to bed around 2.30.

107
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:18,250
You know the street value of that cocaine?

108
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:24,780
Let's see. Four and a half kilos
uncut Nicaraguan. 1.7 mil, that area?

109
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,770
Uh, yeah. That's... that's... that's right.

110
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,560
You guys, Brian's famous!

111
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,640
- You're a hero!
- Way to go!

112
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,220
Oh, come on, stop it, you guys. It's nothing.
Oh, Lois, your toast is ready.

113
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,880
Wow! Oh, my!

114
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:43,450
- Uh, Meg's using a new conditioner.
- He's right! That's amazing!

115
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:48,030
- Time to change Stewie.
- Preposterous. I haven't... There it is.

116
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,820
All right!

117
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,810
Stop the car.

118
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:57,550
Over there.

119
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,880
Everybody freeze! This is a bust!

120
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,670
Brian, this is a Sunday-school class.

121
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:07,740
The hell it is. Pure Bogotá bullion.
This is a drug ring.

122
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,730
- But these are just kids.
- Oh, yeah? What's your name?

123
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,640
- Ricky.
- They're not kids. They're midgets.

124
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,890
Filthy drug-peddling midgets.

125
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,800
Oh, my God!

126
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,470
Look out, Brian!

127
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,460
- Nice work!
- You're a credit to the force.

128
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,840
Additional generic cop compliment, Brian.

129
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,210
Thanks. But the real hero here is God
for blessing me with this nose.

130
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,630
And a few other equally amazing
appendages.

131
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:04,190
- I better take this cocaine down to Evidence.
- Oh, I'll... I'll do that.

132
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,360
I'll catch up with you guys at the pub.

133
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,660
So it's settled. We're takin'
a cruise to the Bahamas.

134
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,750
Ah, this is gonna be great.

135
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,370
And look. It says we have our
choice of cabins - port or starboard.

136
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:27,470
Ha! Listen to me!
I sound like an old salt!

137
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,180
I must say, I've always
dreamed of a life at sea.

138
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,350
"I'm the greatest captain of the Queen's Navy

139
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,610
"And your record will stand as proof

140
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:44,240
"Be it galley or freighter,
I'm an expert navigator

141
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,400
"And you're also a world-class poof

142
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,330
"My manner, quite effete, is mistaken on the
street for a sailor who can pirouette on cue

143
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:55,990
"Well, despite your point of view
I can thrill a girl or two

144
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,790
"But I'd rather get it on with you

145
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,010
Ha-ha-ha!

146
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,550
Sorry to be tardy to the party.

147
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,310
Wow, Brian! Have you lost weight?
You gotta tell me your secret.

148
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:13,600
Here's a hint - put down the fork! Face!

149
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,140
So, how was your day?

150
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:20,110
Un-freakin'-believable. First we
nailed a bastard who had the gall

151
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:24,360
to hide his stuff in his daughter's doll.
Her doll!

152
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:28,990
Where's the line any more? I got news for ya.
It-it's not even on the radar screen.

153
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,580
The days of decency
and virtue are gone. Bam!

154
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,920
Freakin' evaporated like a dingy, stinkin' mud
puddle. One day you see your reflection in it,

155
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,760
and the next day it's a damn oil spot
on your cracked driveway

156
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,560
staring back at you, mocking you.
Blah! Blah! Blah!

157
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,690
Knowin' the perverted truths that rot in the pit
of your soul. That's how my freakin' day was.

158
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:54,110
You know what I haven't had in a while?
Big League Chew.

159
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,690
So take it from me - McGriffin, the drug dog.

160
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:03,160
If you really wanna get high,
it's as easy as being yourself.

161
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,420
Well, kids, I'm gonna pass things off now to...
Gerald, the happy and abstinent police clown.

162
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:14,170
Hey, kids! You know why I'm happy?

163
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:20,050
Cos I'm free of S... T... Ds!

164
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:28,100
- That McGriffin guy was so cool!
- Totally. I'm never doing drugs now.

165
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,980
Ahhhhh.

166
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,780
Got milk?

167
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,160
Before you go on a cruise,
you gotta build up a base tan.

168
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,200
But I heard that if you use tanning beds,
you could get something called melanoma.

169
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:49,090
Oh, that's just fancy talk
for sexified. Now, climb in.

170
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,630
- Hey, what kinda tanning booth is this?
- Those aren't tanning booths.

171
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,970
- That row is time machines.
- Oh, crap! Where the hell is he?

172
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:07,690
Hey, Dad, I'm in the Bible days, and there's
a whole stadium of people clappin' for me.

173
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,280
Oh, look, my very own lion!

174
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,450
Oh, my God!

175
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,780
Must've got the wrong hat.

176
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:20,120
And now, here's something
we hope you'll really like.

177
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,220
There's no smokin' in the terminal.

178
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,640
There's worse things than nicotine.
And I'm gonna find 'em.

179
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:38,300
Patience. It took St Patrick more
than a day to clear the Emerald Isle of snakes.

180
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:42,020
- Can the Irish crap, will you, Horowicz?
- OK.

181
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,150
- Open it!
- Agh! Let me go!

182
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,610
Help! Help!

183
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:50,570
Where's the stash? I'll do
a freakin' body-cavity search.

184
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,700
- Argh! Argh!
- Sir, we apologise.

185
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,950
There's no easy way to say this.
You have a drug problem.

186
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,760
A drug problem? What's this really about?
Jealousy? Am I stealin' your thunder?

187
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,420
- Give me your badge.
- Fine!

188
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,170
By the way, Horowicz, you should
show Joe your impression of him.

189
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:12,060
Oh, well... It's not as good as my
Irish cop. It's just a little thing I...

190
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:17,520
"I'm Joe! My legs don't work, but I make up
for it by having a very strong upper body. "

191
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,270
Well, I do say that.

192
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,940
The Old Man and the Sea. I see you're
gettin' in the mood for our cruise.

193
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:32,540
Yeah. Stupid fisherman. Sittin' out there
on a boat yammerin' to himself.

194
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,920
He doesn't even know I'm watching him.

195
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,300
Ah, splendid. Fido McCoke-Fiend is home.

196
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,170
- Everybody, this is Tina.
- What happened to you?

197
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,010
Less questions and more shut-the-hell-up.

198
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:50,180
Just because you can't feel your teeth
doesn't mean the girl can't feel your insults.

199
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,560
Hello. I'm Lois Griffin. Welcome to our home.

200
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,850
So, what? She's, like,
your mom or somethin'?

201
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:04,190
Tina, can I get you a warm washcloth to
wipe the dried blood from under your nose?

202
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:09,700
- Here's the channel Lois doesn't know about.
- Chris, look away! Meg, take Stewie upstairs.

203
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,330
Wait. That man seems to have
suffered a serious snakebite.

204
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,790
Brian, would you please ask
your new friend to leave now?

205
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:20,170
Oh, sorry. Things gettin'
too real for the Stepford wife?

206
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,720
And look at you two - Quasimodo and
Lumpy.

207
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,480
I leave more personality in
tightly-coiled piles on the lawn.

208
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,230
Oh, do me! Do me next!

209
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:32,230
Come on, baby girl. Let's go to the park.

210
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,860
- Hey, Doc. What are you doing here?
- Your family has something to say.

211
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,910
Brian, I know I don't speak up much,

212
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:49,660
and it's really hard for me to
talk about my feelings, but...

213
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:52,460
Let's start with someone
more interesting. Peter?

214
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,500
Ever since your addiction,
you've been a jerk.

215
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:59,220
I miss the old days
when you were my sidekick.

216
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:05,810
Uh... so she hated my tie until I told her it was
made out of 100 per cent Buttafuco fibre.

217
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,400
Uh, yeah, yeah.

218
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,150
Uh... yeah.

219
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,360
Yeah. Eeh. Yeah.

220
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,820
Brian, how about a little tie music?

221
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,700
"Peter's tie, Peter's tie

222
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,120
"That's because Peter's the guy!

223
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,830
All right. That's it. A little tie music.

224
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,380
Heh-hee!

225
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,120
Yeah!

226
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:34,970
Look, you-you guys got it
all wrong. I-I-I... I wa...

227
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,720
Oh, I'm so sorry, everyone!

228
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,350
Oh, God, I need help!

229
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,220
I guess now we know what kind of dog he is.

230
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,060
A melan-collie.

231
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:52,280
Nothing? Oh, wait, wait, wait.
I should have said "Chi-wah-wah".

232
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,290
I don't have to impress you.

233
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,790
Look, I'm not insensitive, Lois.

234
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:04,590
But why do we have to cancel our cruise
just cos the dog's a cokehead?

235
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:09,630
We're not going on vacation while Brian's
in rehab. We'll just have to wait till next year.

236
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,720
Aw, man!

237
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,600
I'll make it up to you.
My cousin works at Club Med.

238
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,440
Holy crap! Look at this place.

239
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,110
This is where God would come
if he had to stop doin' blow.

240
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,570
- They have tennis courts!
- And a full spa!

241
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:30,410
Wow! No wonder people do drugs!

242
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,700
Good luck, Brian. I just know
you're gonna get clean.

243
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:39,040
Shouldn't be too hard to get clean with
all these mineral baths and jacuzzis.

244
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,050
Oh, I see. The fat man makes a pun
and everyone wets themselves.

245
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:46,890
I give you gold and I get squat.
I'll be in the car.

246
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,100
That was a very productive first day, Brian.

247
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,690
Our goal here is to find your X factor -

248
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:57,020
the element in your life
that made you turn to drugs.

249
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:02,950
Just having some time away to sort things
out is gonna do wonders. Thanks, Doctor.

250
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,360
What are you doing here?

251
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,200
I'm on vacation. Oh, and if
anyone asks, I'm also on smack.

252
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:17,130
Peter, this is a detox clinic.
You can't vacation here.

253
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:20,340
Why not? This place is
way better than a cruise.

254
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,590
I whipped this speedfreak's ass
at horseshoes today.

255
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,850
This isn't a vacation for me.
I'm tryin' to get healthy.

256
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,550
Yeah, OK. All right.

257
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,390
Hey, softball this afternoon.

258
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,480
Us addicts are takin' on the pregnant
teenagers from across the lake.

259
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:38,730
OK, come on, everyone. Exercise
is an important part of recovery.

260
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:44,450
Just work with the resistance of the water.
Ten more reps. And one. And two.

261
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,500
And three.

262
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:51,080
Yeah! I'm also addicted to boobies!

263
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,180
Trade you this for your cupcake.

264
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,310
What? It was just Carpet Fresh.
I'm on your side.

265
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:12,610
I've been observing your behaviour. I don't
think you're an addict. I think you're an idiot.

266
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:18,570
Well, I don't pay you to think, hot lips.
In fact, I don't pay you at all. Count it.

267
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:21,570
I'll be keeping my eye on you.
What's your name?

268
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,950
Uh, my-my name? Uh...

269
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:26,210
Uh... uh... uh...

270
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:30,040
Pea... uh... uh... uh...

271
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,340
Tear... uh...

272
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,010
Uh... Griffin.

273
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,210
Yeah. Yeah. Peter Griffin.

274
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,310
Oh, crap.

275
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,400
I was lookin' for you. You wanna go mess
with the pregnant teens across the lake?

276
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,350
I can't. Group therapy.

277
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:53,070
I saw one of those - more borin' than when
I was a security guard for George Harrison.

278
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,670
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey! Quiet down up there!

279
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,430
You wacky Beatle.

280
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:21,810
I have made a lot of progress lately. Missing
one session wouldn't be the end of the world.

281
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,810
There you go.

282
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,320
- What do you think they put in the bug juice?
- Bugs?

283
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,440
No, they don't! Come on.

284
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,150
Shut up.

285
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:56,470
I hope you're proud of yourselves.
14 premature births.

286
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,230
Sorry. I don't usually let Peter
talk me into this kinda stuff.

287
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:03,770
You have a pre-existing relationship
with this degenerate?

288
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,360
A degenerate, am I?

289
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,780
Well, you are a fastizio.

290
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,450
See? I can make up words too, sister.

291
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:13,990
- Well, I think we've found your X factor.
- You mean Peter?

292
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:19,170
His behaviour is a negative influence on you.
With your intelligence and sensitivity...

293
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,460
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.
I made my own mistakes. All right?

294
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,590
This man took me into his home
and treated me like family.

295
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,720
- He's my best friend.
- And look where you've ended up.

296
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,810
You know, I think my therapy
here is complete.

297
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:34,770
I came here to get clean
and I did. So goodbye.

298
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:40,780
Brian, it's moments like this that make me
sad you're gonna die 50 years before I do.

299
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:48,540
"He was all coked up and we were choked up

300
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,910
"But now we're happy Brian's home,
cha-cha-cha!

301
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,290
I am serious, Lois.
You could be in show business.

302
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,130
- Hey, Meg. 18 yet?
- No.

303
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,340
- Chris, how are ya?
- I'm glad...

304
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,680
All right!

305
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,390
Brian, I feel guilty. If not for me,
you wouldn't have been exposed to that junk.

306
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:09,720
Joe, if I've learned anything
from my experience,

307
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,930
it's that we're all responsible
for our own destiny.

308
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:17,450
- And that's why I'm leaving.
- Leavin'? You can't leave.

309
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:21,200
I have to, Peter. For me. I love you all.

310
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,070
Aw!

311
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,490
Somebody say something.

312
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,910
Brian, wait!

313
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,170
Hold on a second.

314
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,380
Airport, please.
