00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,259
"Is violence in movies and sex on TV

Peter, this is ridiculous.
I know you're upset about losing your job,

11
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:41,583
but you've sat there for two weeks.

12
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:45,546
- I have not, Lois.
- He's right. It's actually been more like...

13
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:49,299
- Yeah. 13 days.
- You have to do something other than eat.

14
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:53,595
All right, all right. Brian, let's go for a walk.

15
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:05,899
Meg, sweetheart, what's wrong?

16
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:10,571
My life. That's what's wrong.
I was totally humiliated at school today.

17
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:13,615
We're gonna do an informal survey here, kids.

18
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:19,246
Would those who are going away for spring
break please move to the left of the room?

19
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:26,128
Oigan, quienes van a spring break,
pasen a la izquierda, por favor.

20
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:29,673
- Meg, what do those kids know?
- They know how to have a good time.

21
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:34,678
So do we. I'll tell you what. How about you
and I have our own little spring break?

22
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,598
We'll go to that fancy new spa
that just opened up.

23
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:41,768
Massages and facials.
It'll be great. What do you say?

24
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:46,148
I guess it couldn't be worse than last year
when we all went to Sea World.

25
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,905
And how long has this been going on?!

26
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:58,744
Lois is right. I've been out of work too long.

27
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,663
I think you should find
something you enjoy doing.

28
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:05,125
- Take those guys out there, for example.
- Where?

29
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:11,256
Oh, yeah. Now, that's a job.
Fresh sea air, working outside.

30
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,884
That's how a real New England man
makes a living.

31
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,221
- That's something to think about.
- What's that, Daddy?

32
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:20,557
That's Mercury, Jake,
the planet closest to the sun.

33
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,769
What it's doing by the wharf,
we should ask a scientist...

34
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,771
I'm a guy, you jackass!

35
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,399
Ah, yeah, that feels good.

36
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:32,319
Chris, don't forget to mist under his chins.

37
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:36,073
Oh, boy, Lois. It's a real mess down there.

38
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:39,201
I'm afraid I'm won't be able
to do this in the time I quoted.

39
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:43,163
Chris, shut the hose off for a second.
I have an announcement.

40
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:46,416
I am gonna drop this weight
and rejoin the workforce.

41
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,545
I have decided to become
a professional fisherman.

42
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:51,088
What? Why a fisherman?

43
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:54,633
It makes sense. You know
how much time I've spent on the ocean.

44
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:59,429
Wilson! What are we gonna do now?!

45
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:04,977
- Wilson! Wilson!
- My name is Voit, dumb-ass.

46
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:08,605
Hello, Doreen?
I'm still over at the Griffin job.

47
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,359
Tell Walter I won't be able
to make it to the construction site.

48
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:17,155
So... I don't know. Have him send
Frank or Glen or Harelip Steve.

49
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,783
I know, it creeps me out, too.

50
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,745
So you think I can find a boat here?

51
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,957
You wouldn't believe what we
confiscate from these crooks.

52
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:31,753
We open today's bidding with this pair
of panties confiscated from a prostitute.

53
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,256
- 50 bucks!
- She had nine STD's.

54
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:38,552
- 45 bucks.
- And when we caught her, she wet herself.

55
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:43,557
- 50 bucks.
- Will you sell anything that's not gross?

56
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,353
Please direct your attention to this photo
of a beautiful 40-foot fishing boat.

57
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,856
- Oh, man, that's perfect!
- $12,000.

58
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,984
- $13,000.
- $25,000.

59
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,904
- Sold for $25,000.
- Yes!

60
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,072
- Aw, crap!
- Thanks.

61
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:03,035
And now the actual boat itself.
Do I have an opening bid for the boat?

62
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,079
- $50,000!
- Sold for $50,000.

63
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,874
Good for you, Peter.

64
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:15,047
Congratulations.
You've bought yourself a cursed boat.

65
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,050
- Cursed?
- The last captain of that vessel lost his life.

66
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:21,178
And it weren't no accident!
His name was Salty.

67
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:24,723
And he was devoured by Daggermouth,
the man-eating bluefish.

68
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,226
You want to buy that boat?
Go ahead, take it.

69
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:30,354
Don't expect me to fish your dead body
from an angry sea

70
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,607
that gave you fair warning.

71
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:37,236
Are you up for bids, too?
You are just precious.

72
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:45,494
- Are you gonna miss me?
- Only until I go and buy a Hustler.

73
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:48,830
I left you the number for the spa.
See you in a few days.

74
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,959
Not if I strangle myself
with a seaweed wrap and die.

75
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,545
You are dark!

76
00:04:57,673 --> 00:05:00,509
You haven't told me
how you expect to pay for that boat.

77
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:03,846
There's got to be a hundred banks
that'll give me a loan.

78
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:08,642
- So, you can really give me a loan?
- I sure can.

79
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:12,396
What sets us apart from other banks
is that other banks are banks.

80
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:17,609
- Now, I trust you have collateral.
- I got three kids.

81
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:22,072
I'll take 'em. Just kidding.
Or maybe I'm not. Sign this.

82
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,992
Here you go. Good luck!

83
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:30,330
- What do you want on your thigh?
- I want a skull.

84
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:34,168
OK. I can draw Kermit the Frog.
How about a nice Kermit the Frog?

85
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:37,921
- No. I want a skull.
- OK. I'll go ahead and do Kermit the Frog.

86
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:43,677
- Mom, this is so lame.
- Come on, Meg. Try to have fun.

87
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,639
I promise after a few days you won't
remember the words "spring break".

88
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,225
Hey, how about some TV?

89
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,478
This is MTV
and we're rocking at spring break!

90
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:57,649
Hey, this is VH1
and we're rocking at spring break.

91
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:01,904
...leaving thousands injured.
For CNN, I'm Bernard Shaw,

92
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:05,991
keeping it real and kicking ass
at spring break! Whoo!

93
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:12,748
Here she is, boys. The S.S. More Powerful
than Superman, Batman, Spiderman

94
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,042
and the Incredible Hulk Put Together.

95
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:18,587
She's a fine vessel.
Welcome to the wharf. Name's Hennessey.

96
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,507
Peter Griffin.
Friends call me Peter for short.

97
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:27,262
I'll let you in on a secret, neighbour. The
best fishing is at latitude 42, longitude 71.

98
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,556
- Keep that to yourself.
- Wow, thanks.

99
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,559
I'll see you, fellas. I got some fish to catch.

100
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:41,944
Let's see, latitude 42, longitude 71.
This is it. What the hell...?

101
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,614
Papa, he killed Mordecai,
the Dancing Yiddish Clown!

102
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:48,617
Stop crying.
You just became a man. Act like one.

103
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:52,287
What's the big idea sending me
to that bar mitzvah?

104
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:57,376
Cos I don't like you! We don't need any
more fishermen crowding up this wharf!

105
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:01,129
- Fine. You want an enemy, you got one!
- Fine!

106
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,217
There we are.

107
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,928
Steve, you ever think
of growing a moustache?

108
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:16,562
Nice fish you got there, Griffin.
What are you selling? Your bait?

109
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:21,692
Nice face, Hennessey.
Yes! Me, one. You, zero.

110
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,861
Hey!

111
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,908
- Wow. So, how do you do it?
- Oh, you're very nice to ask.

112
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:33,662
First, I hang the old worm out there.
They usually go for it.

113
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:38,041
I jerk 'em around. They fight for a while.
Then they lay back and accept it.

114
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:42,129
- How about we get together later?
- OK.

115
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,715
What the hell...? Oh, dammit!

116
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:50,679
Hey, what's going on here?

117
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:53,599
Did you read the fine print
on this loan contract?

118
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:58,395
If by read, you mean
imagined a naked lady, then yes.

119
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,564
The bank's taking all our stuff.

120
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:04,526
And if you don't pay them within 48 hours,
they get the house, too.

121
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,863
Oh, boy! I get to go live at the bank!

122
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,328
Did I ever tell you if you're on birth control

123
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:18,499
and you take an antibiotic,
it makes it not work?

124
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:23,837
Because no one told me.
I thought you should know.

125
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:26,423
I don't really feel like talking right now.

126
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:30,093
Fine. I just don't understand why we had
to leave the spa so early.

127
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:35,098
I wanna go home and spend the next three
days in solitary confinement where I belong!

128
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,267
Well, I tried.

129
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:55,327
- What the hell are we doing here?
- This is where you wanted to be, right?

130
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,412
Yeah. But not with you!

131
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,998
Did you hear what happened
to that dude from UMass?

132
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:04,086
He got so drunk he fell off
his hotel balcony! He's in a coma!

133
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:07,840
- Oh, man! I want to party with him!
- You know it! Yeah!

134
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,008
- Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
- Yeah! Yeah!

135
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:15,764
- Hey, look. Meg made it, you guys.
- Yeah. And she brought her mommy.

136
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:19,518
- Oh, my God.
- Come on, Meg! Get out of the car!

137
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:23,564
Like the kids say,
up your nose with a rubber hose!

138
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:25,440
Whoo!

139
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:29,319
Hey, look, everybody. It's Spuds MacKenzie!

140
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:32,531
Aaargh!

141
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:38,370
- Well, that's the last of the furniture.
- No TV. I miss my friends.

142
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,707
John Ritter, Florence Henderson,
Alfonso Ribeiro.

143
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:46,295
- Is he the guy from Silver Spoons?
- No. He was on French Prince of Bel-Air.

144
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,756
- Fresh Prince.
- Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. I don't know if...

145
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,300
- Hey, Alfonso.
- Yeah?

146
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,385
- Were you on Silver Spoons?
- Yes.

147
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,553
There you go.

148
00:09:56,638 --> 00:10:00,809
- Come on. Just a little higher, honey.
- Mom, I don't think I can...

149
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:04,354
- Who's holding Lois?
- I don't know. Some dude named Mel.

150
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:08,734
This is Carson Daly. We're live here
at spring break. Who wants to party?!

151
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:12,905
OK, one, two, three, four, five...

152
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:15,282
We'll need cake and juice for 14 people.

153
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:19,786
Now let's go to Tom Green, who's
gonna do something really outrageous!

154
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:24,666
Does anyone out there like me yet?
Can I stop this?

155
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,880
What the hell are you doing in my house?

156
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:33,550
Your house? This is my house.
My wife and I bought it from the bank.

157
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:36,053
I still got another day to pay back the loan.

158
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,264
The bank said you're a fat deadbeat loser.

159
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,475
Fat deadbeat loser?

160
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:46,480
While I may not agree with what you say,
I'll defend to the death your right to say it.

161
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,108
There we are. It's a Van Gogh print.
Isn't it beautiful?

162
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:53,862
I've fantasised about what this house
would be like with culture.

163
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,531
- The port is good.
- Yes.

164
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:56,573
- Indeed.
- Most certainly.

165
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:57,616
- What year is it?
- '51.

166
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:58,575
- Ahh.
- Delectable.

167
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,493
- Indeed.
- Yes.

168
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:00,118
- Oh, dear!
- What is it?

169
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:01,995
- I've spontaneously combusted.
- I am sorry.

170
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,664
I've grown tired of living.

171
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:04,706
- Very good.
- For the best.

172
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:06,917
- Yes, indeed.
- Is it raining again?

173
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,922
Hey, did you hear the one about us?

174
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:16,176
- Wow. You are such a good dancer.
- Way to go on that beer bong.

175
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,679
- Yeah, no fake. No fake.
- Mom!

176
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:22,432
- Hey! What are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?

177
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:26,186
- I've been waiting out here for hours!
- What?

178
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:30,148
You were gonna pop inside real quick
and find someone who looked like me

179
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:33,485
so I could use their ID,
then you were supposed to come out

180
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,030
and give me the ID so I can get inside!

181
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:41,827
- What?
- God, it's like talking to a three-year-old!

182
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:45,164
You need to learn how
to loosen up a little, toots.

183
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:48,000
- You're loose enough for the both of us.
- What?

184
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:52,880
- Nothing.
- That's right, nothing. Don't you sass me!

185
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:56,341
Good evening. Stevenson residence.

186
00:11:56,425 --> 00:12:00,804
Chris, we've been over this a thousand times.
It's pronounced "Griffin".

187
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:04,558
- Hi, Mom!
- Hi, Chris. Put your father on.

188
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:10,189
- Hey, Dad?
- French guy says "Deodorant? What's that?"

189
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:15,611
All right. All right.
I've got one. I've got one. OK.

190
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:20,199
Two men are standing at the Pearly Gates.
Oh, God, wait. How did that one go?

191
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:24,494
It turns out they're Siegfried and Roy.
I'm no good at telling jokes.

192
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:28,957
- Dad, it's Mom.
- Oh, God. Please be Somerset Maugham.

193
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,125
- Hello?
- Peter?

194
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:33,670
- Damn!
- Calling to check in, see how you guys are.

195
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:36,381
Oh, we're fine.

196
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:39,092
- What's all that noise?
- Nothing. Nothing.

197
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:43,555
- I need you to take out the trash.
- OK, Lois! Lois, I got to go.

198
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,974
Holy crap, Brian! What am I gonna do?

199
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:49,937
Lois will be home in a coupla days
and we're getting kicked out tomorrow.

200
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,314
- What do you suggest?
- Get out your ring.

201
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,399
- That's not gonna...
- Come on!

202
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:56,610
Wonder Twin powers, activate!

203
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,738
Form of... steam!

204
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,658
We got these in a box of Frankenberry.

205
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:07,871
A jackal! Jackal! It's a jackal! It looks
like a jackal! Jackal? It's a jackal! Jackal?

206
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:10,374
- Time!
- It wasn't right the first time!

207
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:15,379
Why the hell would it be right
the next ten times?! God!

208
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:22,886
I am screwed. I'm gonna lose my house
and my boat and everything.

209
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,264
How am I gonna come up with 50 grand?

210
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:29,434
You could whore yourself out to
a thousand fat chicks for 50 bucks apiece.

211
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,980
Or 50 really fat chicks
for a thousand bucks.

212
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:38,193
What? Don't look at me like that. Fat chicks
need love, too. But they got to pay.

213
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,404
Agh! What is this?

214
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:44,241
Sea water, courtesy
of that gentleman over there.

215
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:47,369
You need 50 grand, Griffin?
I got a suggestion for you.

216
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,663
Why don't you kill Daggermouth?

217
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,834
Maybe I will, Hennessey.

218
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:57,713
You'd be buying yourself
a one-way ticket to a watery grave.

219
00:13:57,796 --> 00:14:02,718
Daggermouth is the meanest, most ruthless
creature that's ever inhabited the sea.

220
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:06,054
Legend has it he dwells out
by Fish Stench Cove.

221
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:09,892
He'll kill any man that comes near there.
I saw him once.

222
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:14,605
Sure, I'm blind in one eye, and my other eye
was infected that day from picking at it,

223
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:19,193
and I was tired, and I'd been swimming
in a pool with too much chlorine,

224
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:22,821
and my glasses were at LensCrafters,
but I seen that fish!

225
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:25,657
If there's 50 grand in it,
I don't think I got a choice.

226
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:29,077
You can whore yourself out
to a thousand fat chicks for 50 bucks.

227
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:31,788
- No, we covered that.
- You ain't got a chance.

228
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:36,084
Daggermouth killed my friend Salty,
and he was twice the fisherman you are.

229
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:38,795
And half the weight! Ooh...

230
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,715
Hey, no! No! Hot!

231
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:45,969
Lt'd be suicide to go after that fish.
There's got to be another way.

232
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:49,306
- We could have a bake sale.
- I think that's a neat idea.

233
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:52,559
No! I am not gonna let my family
live on the street.

234
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,853
Not even if it means ending up like Shamus.

235
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:58,815
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a date with destiny.

236
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:03,820
- So were you, like, in an accident or what?
- No. Me father was a tree.

237
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:09,952
What's wrong with me?

238
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:14,331
I gotta be crazy to think I can kill that
man-eating fish. What the hell am I doing?

239
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:17,876
Hey, hey, hey. Come on, Peter.
What kind of talk is that?

240
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:21,547
Yeah, you can do it.
Who's my big brave boy, huh?

241
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,049
- Me.
- Who's my big brave boy?

242
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:27,261
Me.

243
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,268
- This sucks, Mom.
- Meg, stop moping.

244
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:38,522
These are the best years of your life.
Let's get up there and live a little.

245
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:44,278
- I look like an idiot!
- No, you don't. Come on.

246
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:47,489
Just move your hips a little like this.

247
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:51,994
- Lois! Lois! Lois!
- Meg! Meg! Meg! Meg!

248
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:56,665
Meg! Meg! Meg! Meg! Meg!

249
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,710
Attagirl! Shake your moneymaker!

250
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:03,755
Meg! Meg! Meg! Meg! Meg!
Meg! Meg! Meg! Meg!

251
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:07,509
Oh, my God! It's a chick!

252
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:11,805
- Ay, Dios mio, una chica!
- All right, everybody! This party's over!

253
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:14,391
Why do you cops
always have to kill our buzz?

254
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:17,728
He used a teenage colloquialism.
Get the tear gas.

255
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,984
- Not so fast, big guy.
- What are you guys doing here?

256
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:26,278
We're gonna help you kill the fish.

257
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:31,074
- This will be dangerous. We could all die.
- Come on. You're our best friend.

258
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,911
I can remember when you saved all our butts.

259
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:35,871
Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh.

260
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:38,373
Hyah!

261
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:43,378
Too bad I didn't get there till after
the sodomy. Let's go kick some fish ass!

262
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:51,011
I can't believe
I just showed everyone my tater tots.

263
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:53,805
Worst of all,
now I'm gonna have a police record.

264
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:56,099
If you're gonna grab ahold of life,

265
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:59,353
you've gotta expect to get
your hands dirty once in a while.

266
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:02,689
- It was cool that people noticed me.
- That's the spirit.

267
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:05,400
OK, one, two, three... tuck and roll!

268
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,991
We're right on course. Give me another beer.

269
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,285
These are the precious moments.

270
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:20,499
The four of us out at sea, miles away
from civilisation, tossing back brews.

271
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:25,838
Amen to that. You guys, here's one for you.
Let's say none of us were married.

272
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:28,340
If you could have any woman,
who would it be?

273
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:30,217
- Mariel Hemingway.
- Really?

274
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:32,594
- That's not a good choice.
- She's so jagged.

275
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:36,139
I think she's very attractive
in a classical kind of way.

276
00:17:36,265 --> 00:17:38,350
But you could cut a roast on her face.

277
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:43,146
- I would go with Margaret Thatcher.
- Why the hell Margaret Thatcher?

278
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,149
Oh, so nobody here thinks power is sexy?

279
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:49,611
- Not one of you finds power sexy?
- How about you, Peter?

280
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:52,948
The chick with the three knockers
from Total Recall.

281
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:56,285
- I never saw that movie.
- One of them was papier-mâché.

282
00:17:56,368 --> 00:18:00,330
Can I change my answer...?
Of course I know it's paper! I don't care!

283
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:03,458
What's wrong with you?
What about you, Quagmire?

284
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:06,920
- Taylor Hanson.
- Taylor Hanson's a guy.

285
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:15,470
You guys are yanking me.
"Let's put one over on old Quagmire. "

286
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:18,473
No, he's actually a guy, Quagmire.

287
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:22,561
Wha... Well, this is insane!
That's impossible!

288
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:26,106
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

289
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:30,485
Oh, my God, I can't... Oh, God!
I got all these magazines!

290
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:32,654
Oh, God! Oh, God!

291
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:41,955
- This must be Fish Stench Cove.
- Now all we gotta do is find the fish.

292
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:45,083
I wonder where that fish did go.

293
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:48,629
A fish, a fish, a fishy-o!

294
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:03,227
I heard that when Daggermouth eats you,
he devours your guts first.

295
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:07,689
I heard he doesn't just eat you,
he eats your soul.

296
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:12,486
I heard that one of Shannon Doherty's eyes
is off-centre cos it's trying to escape.

297
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:15,322
Welcome, gentlemen.

298
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:18,867
- Agh!
- It's him! Quick, shoot him!

299
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:22,830
Not so fast! Perhaps I could
offer you a glass of port.

300
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:26,250
And you, a glass of starboard.
That's a nautical joke.

301
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:30,128
- I'm a fish. I'm also delightfully mad.
- Agh!

302
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:32,631
Would you mind holding still for a moment?

303
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:35,759
These antique pistols
take ten minutes to reload.

304
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:39,388
- Peter, catch!
- Ow! Don't throw stuff at me, Joe!

305
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:42,224
- Shoot him!
- Oh, yeah. Right.

306
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:51,900
My God. Isn't it amazing that that's
what we all look like on the inside?

307
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,945
- It's a robot, you idiot.
- Who are you?

308
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:59,324
- I'm Salty.
- Everybody said you were killed by the fish.

309
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:04,204
That's what I wanted. I disappeared
and spread the Daggermouth rumour myself.

310
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:08,709
- Why?
- Merchandise. T-shirts, mugs, posters.

311
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:11,712
I'm in talks with Nickelodeon
for a cartoon show.

312
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:15,465
- I'd pair him with an effeminate cat.
- I'd watch that.

313
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:17,759
- Me too.
- Sounds like a good balance.

314
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:21,305
And now I'm gonna give you
$50,000 to be on your way.

315
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:25,601
- $50,000? For what?
- To keep your mouth shut.

316
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:28,395
The longer we stay here,
the more people will question

317
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,023
how a fisherman
with no engineering background

318
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:34,151
built a sophisticated talking fish robot.

319
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:39,156
You know, honey,
I'm really sorry for how I acted.

320
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:41,658
Getting drunk and ditching you at the bar,

321
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:45,204
and letting those boys take pictures
of you sleeping.

322
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:48,624
I was so busy having fun,
I guess I kind of ruined it for you.

323
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:52,085
Uh-oh. We got company.

324
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:59,676
- Looks like your friends are back, Mom.
- Meg! Meg! Meg! Meg!

325
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:03,222
No, I think this one's all yours.

326
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:06,975
- Whoo! Yeah! You go, girl!
- One's an innie and one's an outie.

327
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:13,565
And now, back to "Daggermouth
and Boom Boom" on Nickelodeon.

328
00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:16,151
Boom Boom, did you do
your exercises today?

329
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:20,447
Yes. I did 20 laps.
And I'm about to do 20 more.

330
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:23,033
- Oh, you!
- Yipes!

331
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:29,414
Peter, I'm so glad being a fisherman
is working out for you.

332
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:33,252
I got to admit I half expected to come home,
and our stuff would be gone,

333
00:21:33,377 --> 00:21:35,462
and we'd owe somebody a lot of money.

334
00:21:35,546 --> 00:21:39,508
- How can you half expect something?
- It's just a turn of phrase.

335
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:44,012
- How do you turn a phrase?
- God, you're dumb. Thank God for that ass.

336
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:46,515
Now, come here and kiss me.

337
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:48,809
- Good night, honey.
- Good night, Lois.

338
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:51,395
- Good night, Jim and Abby.
- Good night.

339
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,817
Not now, Abby.

340
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:24,970
