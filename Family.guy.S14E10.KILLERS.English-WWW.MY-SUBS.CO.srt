Where are you going?

13

I'm going to Quagmire's
to get some hand-me-downs.

14
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,957
His dad-mom sent over
some boxes of men's clothes

Well, I'm a dirty guy, Lois.

18
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:48,732
Haven't you ever seen
my naughty,

late-night, party-line
commercials?

20

Hey, are you lonely?

21
00:00:53,038 --> 00:00:55,739
Do you like to party
with hot girls?

22
00:00:55,774 --> 00:00:59,209
What about horsing around
with fat guys?

23

Well, what are you

I'll be on the toilet,
wearing a T-shirt

26
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,916

I have to hold it

27

Wow, your dad doesn't
use this Dickie anymore?

That's crazy.

Why would anyone get rid
of a perfectly good Dickie?

31

I see what you're doing,

What do you got there?

35
00:01:30,575 --> 00:01:32,108
Some kind of home movie
from the Orient?

36
00:01:32,144 --> 00:01:33,777
No, no, this is
<i>Winter Summer.</i>

37
00:01:33,812 --> 00:01:35,845
It was a Korean soap opera
that I was in.

38
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:37,747
You were in a
Korean soap opera?

39
00:01:37,783 --> 00:01:39,883
Yeah, back when the Navy
had me stationed in Busan,

40
00:01:39,918 --> 00:01:42,218
I saw an ad in the paper
for guys over five-foot-four,

41
00:01:42,254 --> 00:01:44,054
and I was the only one
who showed up.

42
00:01:44,089 --> 00:01:45,488
Next thing I know,
I'm on TV,

43
00:01:45,524 --> 00:01:47,457
playing a guy
named American Johnny.

44
00:01:47,492 --> 00:01:49,559
Wow, I didn't even
know you could act.

45
00:01:49,594 --> 00:01:51,528
You also didn't know
I was a rock polisher.

46
00:01:51,563 --> 00:01:52,629
Take a look at that.

47
00:01:52,664 --> 00:01:54,130
Oh, my! What is that?

48
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:55,498
That's tiger eye.

49
00:01:55,534 --> 00:01:57,767

51
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:36,172
Holy crap, Quagmire,
you speak Korean?

52
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:37,474
Nah, not really.

53
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:39,275
They just told me how to sound
the words out phonetically.

54
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:41,444
So you never knew what
you were actually saying?

55
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,613
No. In fact,
at the height of the show,

56
00:02:43,648 --> 00:02:45,849
I did a whole
pro-genital-mutilation PSA

57
00:02:45,884 --> 00:02:48,351
that I really regret.

58
00:02:48,386 --> 00:02:49,352
Wow, that girl's hot.

59
00:02:49,387 --> 00:02:50,353
That's a guy.

is also tiny Kia car!

159
00:08:00,174 --> 00:08:02,307
Welcome,
American Johnny.

160
00:08:02,343 --> 00:08:04,710
We give only
best room for you.

161
00:08:04,745 --> 00:08:06,945
Would you like smoking
or chain smoking?

162
00:08:06,981 --> 00:08:09,181
Uh, smoking, I guess?

163
00:08:09,216 --> 00:08:11,083
Yes, and how many
ridiculous things

164
00:08:11,118 --> 00:08:13,151
would you like
your toilet to do?

165
00:08:13,187 --> 00:08:15,821
Do you have one that goes,
"Yum-yum-yum-yum-yum"?

166
00:08:15,856 --> 00:08:18,390
Ah, presidential suite!

167
00:08:23,197 --> 00:08:25,063
Well, Donna's
mother died.

168
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:27,032
But we should probably
head out to find

169
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:29,034
the last episode of
that Korean soap opera.

170
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:30,402
Yeah. Where's Peter?

171
00:08:30,437 --> 00:08:32,170
Oh, he went
to get plastic surgery.

172
00:08:32,206 --> 00:08:33,505
He did?

173
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,540
Yeah, Korea's the plastic
surgery capital of the world.

174
00:08:35,576 --> 00:08:37,476
Nobody here thinks
you look good unless you have

175
00:08:37,511 --> 00:08:39,945
big, round eyes
and a tiny little nose and chin.

176
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,946
Hey, guys.

177
00:08:40,981 --> 00:08:42,447
Peter, are you
all right?!

178
00:08:42,483 --> 00:08:43,916
You know what?
I feel good.

179
00:08:43,951 --> 00:08:46,051
I feel like I want
to giggle behind my hand

180
00:08:46,086 --> 00:08:48,387
at a lot of things
and hold, but not eat,

181
00:08:48,422 --> 00:08:50,088
a big ice cream cone.

182
00:08:55,129 --> 00:08:57,162
There were more birds
than videos in there.

183
00:08:57,197 --> 00:08:58,797
Yeah, and no sign
of<i> Winter Summer.</i>

184
00:08:58,832 --> 00:09:00,265
WOMAN:
Glenn?

185
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:01,700
Glenn Quagmire?

186
00:09:03,137 --> 00:09:04,369
Sujin?

187
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,277
(gasps)
It's Hee-Sun!

188
00:09:12,313 --> 00:09:13,313
From the show!

189
00:09:13,347 --> 00:09:14,347
I don't believe it.

190
00:09:14,381 --> 00:09:15,580
She's so beautiful.

191
00:09:15,616 --> 00:09:17,316
(high-pitched):
She's so beautiful!

192
00:09:17,351 --> 00:09:18,717
H-How did you find me?

193
00:09:18,752 --> 00:09:20,419
I heard that American
Johnny was back,

194
00:09:20,454 --> 00:09:21,853
so I started
following you

195
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:24,656
on the new "Where
American Johnny?" app.

196
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:26,325
I already rich from that.

197
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,293
Dance for me, Hilary Duff!

198
00:09:28,329 --> 00:09:29,795
♪ ♪

199
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,532
Ah, it's so great
to see you, Sujin.

200
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:35,734
You look just
as pretty as ever.

201
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:38,971
I've waited every day
hoping you would return.

202
00:09:39,006 --> 00:09:41,273
And I never stopped
thinking of you.

203
00:09:41,308 --> 00:09:42,274
(gasps)

204
00:09:42,309 --> 00:09:43,875
Were you guys... involved?

205
00:09:43,911 --> 00:09:45,143
We were, Peter.

206
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:47,079
Korean O-M-G!

207
00:09:47,114 --> 00:09:48,747
Sujin, we actually
came here to find

208
00:09:48,782 --> 00:09:50,248
the last episode
of<i> Winter Summer.</i>

209
00:09:50,284 --> 00:09:51,516
Would you happen to have it?

210
00:09:51,552 --> 00:09:52,517
Of course.

211
00:09:52,553 --> 00:09:53,618
(gasps)
Can we see it?

212
00:09:53,654 --> 00:09:55,520
Why, yes.
Tonight.

213
00:09:55,556 --> 00:09:57,723
Glenn, you and your friends
must come to my home

214
00:09:57,758 --> 00:09:59,524
for gross
Korean dinner.

215
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,659
Man, look at them.

216
00:10:00,694 --> 00:10:02,094
They make such
a cute couple.

217
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:04,796
Like Pac-Man
and Ms. Pac-Man.

218
00:10:07,267 --> 00:10:10,435
(Pac-Man "waka-waka"
sound effect playing)

219
00:10:14,141 --> 00:10:17,175
I'm so happy you all
could make it tonight.

220
00:10:17,211 --> 00:10:19,578
We will have many things you
will nibble at and not eat.

221
00:10:19,613 --> 00:10:21,013
Then I will give
you a pizza.

222
00:10:21,048 --> 00:10:22,547
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's great.

223
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,017
Hey, can we watch that last
episode of<i> Winter Summer</i> now?

224
00:10:25,052 --> 00:10:27,019
We will watch together
after dinner.

225
00:10:27,054 --> 00:10:30,255
In the meantime, feel free
to watch Korean pop videos.

226
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,457
(Korean pop music playing)

227
00:10:43,237 --> 00:10:46,972
What is this, and how can I make
the rest of my life about it?

228
00:10:47,007 --> 00:10:48,407
Dinner will be
ready soon.

229
00:10:48,442 --> 00:10:50,842
But, Glenn, I have
a surprise for you.

230
00:10:50,878 --> 00:10:52,511
Do you remember
Buttercup?

231
00:10:52,546 --> 00:10:53,812
Who's Buttercup?

232
00:10:53,847 --> 00:10:55,347
(purring)

233
00:10:55,382 --> 00:10:58,216
Oh, my God, I can't believe
Buttercup is still alive!

234
00:10:58,252 --> 00:11:00,252
Alive and well.

235
00:11:00,287 --> 00:11:02,687
Wait a minute,
you named a cat Buttercup?

236
00:11:02,723 --> 00:11:03,955
(laughs)

237
00:11:03,991 --> 00:11:05,857
Only Quagmire.

238
00:11:05,893 --> 00:11:08,060
And you know, Glenn,
after you moved away,

239
00:11:08,095 --> 00:11:09,528
Buttercup had kittens.

240
00:11:09,563 --> 00:11:10,796
(gasps)
What?

241
00:11:10,831 --> 00:11:11,863
That's right.

242
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:13,565
You're a grandfather.

243
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,933
(meowing)

244
00:11:14,968 --> 00:11:16,835
My God.

245
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,938
This is more pussy
than even I can handle.

246
00:11:19,973 --> 00:11:21,773
CLEVELAND:
<i>Is he gonna say "giggity"?</i>

247
00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:23,275
<i>Should I say "giggity"?</i>

248
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,044
<i>Are other people</i>
<i>allowed to say "giggity"?</i>

249
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,145
Giggity.

250
00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:28,146
What?

251
00:11:28,182 --> 00:11:30,115
Nothing. It's stupid.

252
00:11:35,189 --> 00:11:37,556
Ah, that was a great
dinner, Sujin.

253
00:11:37,591 --> 00:11:38,957
I've missed you so much.

254
00:11:38,992 --> 00:11:41,626
I'd forgotten how happy
we make each other.

255
00:11:41,662 --> 00:11:43,562
Okay, I'm done
with this sweet rice water

256
00:11:43,597 --> 00:11:45,230
that has a pine nut
floating in it.

257
00:11:45,265 --> 00:11:46,431
Nice dessert,
by the way.

258
00:11:46,467 --> 00:11:47,632
Can we watch
the thing now?

259
00:11:47,668 --> 00:11:49,134
Of course.
Here it is--

260
00:11:49,169 --> 00:11:52,070
the last episode
of<i> Winter Summer.</i>

261
00:11:52,106 --> 00:11:53,106
Oh, my God!

262
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,107
This is everything
I've dreamed of.

263
00:11:55,142 --> 00:11:58,143
Well, this, and becoming
a half-man, half-horse.

264
00:11:58,178 --> 00:12:00,078
Give up these legs?

265
00:12:00,114 --> 00:12:01,947
Don't be absurd.

266
00:12:04,318 --> 00:12:06,218
(dramatic music playing)

267
00:12:28,775 --> 00:12:30,775
(all crying)

268
00:12:30,811 --> 00:12:32,144
Why?!

269
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:34,513
Why would American
Johnny leave Korea?

270
00:12:34,548 --> 00:12:36,281
He had everything!

271
00:12:36,316 --> 00:12:38,150
Love! A family!

272
00:12:38,185 --> 00:12:39,885
Why would he go
back to his sad,

273
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,287
pathetic bachelor
life in America?!

274
00:12:42,322 --> 00:12:43,989
He's got nothing there!

275
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:46,691
Why would he ever
want to go home?!

276
00:12:46,727 --> 00:12:48,326
Okay, Quagmire,
let's go home.

277
00:12:48,362 --> 00:12:50,128
Well, you know what?

278
00:12:50,164 --> 00:12:51,730
You're right, Peter.

279
00:12:51,765 --> 00:12:53,698
American Johnny
never should've left.

280
00:12:53,734 --> 00:12:56,101
It was the only time
he was ever happy.

281
00:12:56,136 --> 00:12:57,569
What? What are you saying?

282
00:12:57,604 --> 00:13:00,505
Hey, Sin-ju,
your TV says it's 21:00.

283
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,340
What is that in real time?

284
00:13:02,376 --> 00:13:05,010
I'm saying I'm not going
back to Quahog.

285
00:13:05,045 --> 00:13:06,178
What?!

286
00:13:06,213 --> 00:13:07,946
But we've-we've
seen the last episode.

287
00:13:07,981 --> 00:13:09,648
We did what we came here to do.

288
00:13:09,683 --> 00:13:11,683
Peter, everything
you just said is true.

289
00:13:11,718 --> 00:13:13,919
I don't have anyone
waiting for me in Quahog.

290
00:13:13,954 --> 00:13:15,654
But here, I've got Sujin.

291
00:13:15,689 --> 00:13:18,056
I've got Buttercup
and our grandcats.

292
00:13:18,091 --> 00:13:19,457
I've got a family.

293
00:13:19,493 --> 00:13:22,727
I'm not gonna make the same
mistake American Johnny did.

294
00:13:22,763 --> 00:13:24,362
I'm staying here.

295
00:13:24,398 --> 00:13:27,899
KOREAN ANNOUNCER:
<i>Will Quagmire stay in Korea?</i>

296
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,101
<i>Will Peter find a new friend?</i>

297
00:13:30,137 --> 00:13:33,305
<i>Find out after this Korean</i>
<i>commercial Ashton Kutcher</i>

298
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:37,042
<i>thought no one in America</i>
<i>would ever see.</i>

299
00:13:37,077 --> 00:13:39,077
Hi. I'm Ashton Kutcher.

300
00:13:39,112 --> 00:13:41,379
Have you ever killed a dog
while driving drunk,

301
00:13:41,415 --> 00:13:44,649
and then been upset that there
was no way for your car engine

302
00:13:44,685 --> 00:13:47,652
to cook it for you
on the rest of the drive home?

303
00:13:47,688 --> 00:13:49,187
Well, those days are over,

304
00:13:49,223 --> 00:13:52,457
thanks to Dr. Lee's
Pet Engine Cooking Bag.

305
00:13:52,492 --> 00:13:55,827
Just put the dog in the bag,
place it over the engine block,

306
00:13:55,862 --> 00:13:58,096
and drive your usual
20 miles per hour

307
00:13:58,131 --> 00:13:59,464
over the speed limit.

308
00:14:01,568 --> 00:14:04,035
Mmm. Bow-wow!

309
00:14:04,071 --> 00:14:05,604
I'm Ashton Kutcher,
and remember,

310
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:08,006
Dr. Lee's Pet Engine
Cooking Bags

311
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:10,075
are not meant for babies.

312
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,110
But they can be used
for babies.

313
00:14:18,575 --> 00:14:20,208
Quagmire,
you can't stay in Korea.

314
00:14:20,243 --> 00:14:22,611
We all got lives back in Quahog.

315
00:14:22,646 --> 00:14:24,613
That's just it, Peter--
<i>you</i> have lives.

316
00:14:24,648 --> 00:14:26,681
You guys all have
wives and kids.

317
00:14:26,717 --> 00:14:29,050
And I have nothing
waiting for me back there.

318
00:14:29,086 --> 00:14:31,319
But here, I have a family.

319
00:14:31,355 --> 00:14:33,221
Plus, commercial pilots
around here can just

320
00:14:33,256 --> 00:14:35,590
fly their plane
into the ocean if they want.

321
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:37,158
Peter's right--
we can't just leave you here.

322
00:14:37,194 --> 00:14:39,094
Who am I gonna get
all my wiener jokes from?

323
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,595
You're my wiener guy.

324
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:41,930
Joe, I got them from a book.

325
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:43,598
I wish I didn't know that.

326
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:45,967
Don't peek
behind the curtain, huh?

327
00:14:46,003 --> 00:14:48,136
Sorry, guys,
you're not gonna change my mind.

328
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:51,573
I just feel like
I belong here with Sujin.

329
00:14:54,044 --> 00:14:55,310
What are you gonna do?

330
00:14:55,345 --> 00:14:57,212
It's a powerful thing
when a woman pays you

331
00:14:57,247 --> 00:14:59,280
even the slightest
bit of attention.

332
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:01,583
Yeah, God knows
I've been there.

333
00:15:01,618 --> 00:15:02,684
Welcome to Chili's.

334
00:15:02,719 --> 00:15:04,119
We're through.

335
00:15:09,726 --> 00:15:12,160
Can't believe Quagmire
isn't coming back with us.

336
00:15:12,195 --> 00:15:14,696
Donna's mother?
It was suicide.

337
00:15:14,731 --> 00:15:17,198
You guys want to check out
Brazil while we're out?

338
00:15:17,234 --> 00:15:20,001
We just got to accept that
Quagmire has made his decision.

339
00:15:20,037 --> 00:15:21,870
There's nothing
we can do about it.

340
00:15:21,905 --> 00:15:24,806
Yeah, I guess as far as
Quagmire's concerned,

341
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,775
he's totally Korean now.

342
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,444
(Korean pop music playing)

343
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:45,660
Guys, there's only one way
to get through to a Korean.

344
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:47,696
Through their music.

345
00:15:47,731 --> 00:15:49,264
Uh-huh. Yeah.

346
00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:51,299
We can try your thing.

347
00:15:55,772 --> 00:15:58,473
Eh, another show about a lizard.

348
00:15:58,508 --> 00:16:00,975
Quagmire,
you're making a mistake.

349
00:16:01,011 --> 00:16:02,177
Quahog is where
you belong.

350
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,378
That's right.

351
00:16:03,413 --> 00:16:05,013
And if you won't
listen to us,

352
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,015
maybe you'll listen
to, um... us.

353
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,983
But singing.

I know those New York Giants
jerseys weren't cheap,

396
00:18:02,866 --> 00:18:05,200
but I'm staying here,
and that's final.

397
00:18:12,576 --> 00:18:16,511
Well, I pressed our matching
beige pantsuits for tomorrow.

398
00:18:16,546 --> 00:18:18,379
Good night.

399

(screams)

400
00:18:21,885 --> 00:18:22,851
Who's that?!

401
00:18:22,886 --> 00:18:24,219
This is my grandfather.

402
00:18:24,254 --> 00:18:26,888
He is going to live with us,
in the Asian tradition.

403
00:18:26,923 --> 00:18:29,858
So will the rest of my aunts,
uncles and cousins.

404
00:18:29,893 --> 00:18:31,192
(indistinct chatter)

405
00:18:31,228 --> 00:18:32,493
They will?

406
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:33,529
Of course.

407
00:18:33,563 --> 00:18:35,496
And have you met
Great-Grandma?

408
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:37,165
I can see through her!

409
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,900
I-Is she a ghost?

410
00:18:38,935 --> 00:18:39,935
We don't know.

411
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,402
She won't answer.

412
00:18:41,438 --> 00:18:44,539
Tomorrow, you take her to
town to buy root vegetable.

413
00:18:44,574 --> 00:18:46,708
After that, you will
get psychopath haircut

414
00:18:46,743 --> 00:18:48,910
so you look
like one of us.

415
00:18:48,945 --> 00:18:50,078
(sighs)

416
00:18:50,113 --> 00:18:51,246
What's the matter, Glenn?

417
00:18:51,281 --> 00:18:53,481
You don't seem
completely emotionless.

418
00:18:53,516 --> 00:18:55,183
No, no, no, no, I am, I am.

419
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:56,384
I'm emotionless.

420
00:18:56,419 --> 00:18:58,152
Good night, Glenn.

421
00:18:58,188 --> 00:19:00,421
Oh, and just
so you know,

422
00:19:00,457 --> 00:19:04,158
three of my cousins
have night terrors.

It's crazy we're going
home without Quagmire.

What are we gonna
do without him?

429
00:19:22,545 --> 00:19:25,280
Rent his house to a sorority,
enjoy the babes?

430
00:19:25,315 --> 00:19:26,915
Huh.

431
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,853
Good-bye, Quagmire.

432
00:19:31,888 --> 00:19:34,289

Thanks again for convincing me
to come home, guys.

Yep, I thought
I wanted a family,

00:20:32,215 --> 00:20:34,482
but I love having
no responsibilities here.

I can get drunk whenever,
sleep with anyone,
