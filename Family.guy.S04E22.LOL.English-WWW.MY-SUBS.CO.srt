00:00:33,626 --> 00:00:36,159
- Chris, did you get your homework done?
- Yup.

4
00:00:36,192 --> 00:00:38,355
Chris, I know when you're lying to me,

5
00:00:38,403 --> 00:00:40,598
just like Santa Claus knows
when you're sleeping.

6
00:00:41,872 --> 00:00:43,905
- What was that?
- Hey, what the hell?!

7
00:00:44,261 --> 00:00:45,471
Uh, hey.

8
00:00:46,682 --> 00:00:48,505
- Get out of here!
- Okay, okay.

9
00:00:48,618 --> 00:00:50,860
No, Mom. I got it all done.

10
00:00:50,892 --> 00:00:55,891
For my science homework, I had to make a
shoebox diarrhea of the evolution of man.

11
00:00:55,968 --> 00:00:57,593
You mean diorama.

12
00:00:59,707 --> 00:01:02,834
Hey, Lois, I got your pregnancy test.
What the hell you need this for?

13
00:01:02,866 --> 00:01:05,683
I need it because I think
I might be pregnant.

14
00:01:05,727 --> 00:01:08,061
What?!
My God, are you sure it's yours?

15
00:01:08,097 --> 00:01:09,573
Lois pregnant?

16
00:01:09,606 --> 00:01:12,363
I didn't think the fat man still
had that kind of marksmanship.

17
00:01:12,407 --> 00:01:14,752
But that's what they said
about Lee Harvey Oswald.

18
00:01:15,217 --> 00:01:16,562
Hey, Mr. President!

19
00:01:16,638 --> 00:01:18,241
Mr. President, up here!

20
00:01:18,276 --> 00:01:19,773
I voted for you.

21
00:01:19,838 --> 00:01:22,760
Wait a minute. That guy on
the grassy knoll's got a gun.

22
00:01:22,796 --> 00:01:24,322
He's gonna shoot the President.

23
00:01:24,365 --> 00:01:26,313
Holy smokes, I've got to do something!

24
00:01:26,505 --> 00:01:30,361
All right, Lee, time to
become an American hero.

25
00:01:36,167 --> 00:01:39,213
Okay, one more minute, and
then if there are two pink lines...

26
00:01:39,248 --> 00:01:42,082
Oh, God, I hope you're not pregnant.
We can't afford another kid.

27
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:45,560
We already got Chris, Stewie,
Richie, Joanie, Greg, Marcia,

28
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:50,073
Bobby, Jan, Mike Seaver, Carol Seaver,
Boner, Urkel, Mr. Furley...

29
00:01:50,128 --> 00:01:52,471
Peter, those aren't your kids.
That's the Nick At Nite lineup.

30
00:01:52,506 --> 00:01:55,573
Blanka, Zangief,
Chun-Li, Guile, E. Honda...

31
00:01:55,605 --> 00:01:57,700
- That's Street Fighter.
- Red, blue, green.

32
00:01:57,728 --> 00:01:58,853
Those are colors.

33
00:01:59,065 --> 00:02:01,741
God, I can't believe we
weren't more careful.

34
00:02:01,808 --> 00:02:04,613
This probably happened that
night we tried role-playing.

35
00:02:04,766 --> 00:02:07,103
Oh, I need a spanking.

36
00:02:07,135 --> 00:02:09,573
I'm a bad, bad girl.

37
00:02:09,618 --> 00:02:13,912
I'm a paladin with 18 charisma
and 97 hit points.

38
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:16,510
I can use my helm of disintegration,

39
00:02:16,546 --> 00:02:22,121
and do One-D-Four damage as my half-elf
mage wields his plus five holy avenger.

40
00:02:22,178 --> 00:02:24,900
Paladins can't use the
helm of disintegration.

41
00:02:25,825 --> 00:02:28,090
Okay.
Then I'm a black guy.

42
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:30,132
Oh, thank God it's negative.

43
00:02:30,696 --> 00:02:32,521
Dodged a bullet there, huh?

44
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:34,780
Although, I got to tell you,
I was, uh, kind of getting used

45
00:02:34,816 --> 00:02:36,780
to the idea of having a
little brother or sister.

46
00:02:36,817 --> 00:02:39,182
Peter, we can't risk
these things anymore.

47
00:02:39,228 --> 00:02:40,590
You're absolutely right.

48
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,311
Lois, you're getting your tubes tied.

49
00:02:42,366 --> 00:02:45,590
Why should I get my tubes tied?
You should get a vasectomy.

50
00:02:45,648 --> 00:02:49,380
First of all, I don't know what that is,
and second of all, no freaking way.

51
00:02:49,438 --> 00:02:52,191
Peter, it's the male equivalent
of a woman getting her tube's tied,

52
00:02:52,226 --> 00:02:54,222
except it's actually a
lot quicker and safer.

53
00:02:54,265 --> 00:02:55,712
Let these guys explain.

54
00:02:55,766 --> 00:03:01,212
<i>A vasectomy's a medical procedure</i>

55
00:03:01,555 --> 00:03:07,931
<i>- One that makes you half a man
- You're half a man</i>

56
00:03:08,338 --> 00:03:13,001
<i>Remember when you
twisted up your garden hose?</i>

57
00:03:13,047 --> 00:03:16,843
<i>Well, essentially that is</i>

58
00:03:16,877 --> 00:03:21,321
<i>That is the plan</i>

59
00:03:21,385 --> 00:03:24,043
Well, I'm starting to get the picture,
but how's it done?

60
00:03:25,627 --> 00:03:27,773
<i>You make a small incision in the</i>

61
00:03:27,805 --> 00:03:29,190
<i>scrotal skin</i>

62
00:03:29,457 --> 00:03:33,292
<i>- Isolate the vas and then
- Isolate the vas, and then you</i>

63
00:03:33,317 --> 00:03:35,223
<i>Hold it in position with a</i>

64
00:03:35,265 --> 00:03:36,712
<i>towel clamp</i>

65
00:03:36,915 --> 00:03:40,262
<i>- Then you snip the fibrous tissue
- Then you snip the fibrous tissue</i>

66
00:03:40,296 --> 00:03:42,600
<i>Hey, but, you'll never
have to wear a</i>

67
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:44,132
<i>condom</i>

68
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:48,030
<i>When you do it with your wife</i>

69
00:03:48,586 --> 00:03:50,762
<i>Or anyone else you do it with</i>

70
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:52,702
<i>We promise not to tell</i>

71
00:03:52,757 --> 00:03:54,931
<i>Like that new hot chick at work</i>

72
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:59,631
<i>You know, the one who always has high
beams under her ribbed white cotton T-shirt</i>

73
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:02,842
<i>But then stares dagger sat
you for checking her out</i>

74
00:04:02,926 --> 00:04:06,781
<i>And it's like why do you wear
that if you don't want attention?</i>

75
00:04:06,837 --> 00:04:09,043
<i>But you know you
shouldn't think that way</i>

76
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:12,652
<i>Because of the sexual harassment
meeting you all had to go to</i>

77
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,562
<i>Seriously, how lame was that?</i>

78
00:04:15,608 --> 00:04:21,072
<i>And you couldn't help but notice that the female
lawyer running the seminar had a huge rack</i>

79
00:04:21,156 --> 00:04:26,112
<i>Like, ridiculously huge for someone
who has to talk about that kind of stuff</i>

80
00:04:26,146 --> 00:04:29,380
<i>Well, I guess that's the
definition of the word</i>

81
00:04:29,515 --> 00:04:32,250
<i>irony</i>

82
00:04:33,105 --> 00:04:35,252
<i>- Good-bye
- Say good-bye to manhood</i>

83
00:04:35,287 --> 00:04:37,210
<i>- Good-bye
- Say good-bye to babies</i>

84
00:04:37,255 --> 00:04:39,343
<i>- Good-bye
- Say good-bye to kids like Meg</i>

85
00:04:39,387 --> 00:04:41,463
Vacuum out your sack.

86
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:47,261
Well, guys, my vasectomy is tomorrow.

87
00:04:47,306 --> 00:04:48,842
You poor bastard.

88
00:04:48,886 --> 00:04:52,063
After all, sex is pointless
without potency.

89
00:04:52,096 --> 00:04:54,801
That's right. You take the venom out
of a cobra, and what have you got?

90
00:04:55,098 --> 00:04:56,293
You got a...

91
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:57,440
a belt.

92
00:04:57,476 --> 00:04:59,182
It's not that big a deal.

93
00:04:59,225 --> 00:05:01,802
A bunch of the guys on the
force have had vasectomies,

94
00:05:01,837 --> 00:05:03,883
and their lives haven't changed at all.

95
00:05:03,925 --> 00:05:06,743
- Would you ever have one?
- Never!

96
00:05:08,835 --> 00:05:12,382
Well, yeah, but what if me and Lois do end
up wanting another baby? It'll be too late.

97
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:16,042
You could freeze some of your
sperm at the sperm bank just in case.

98
00:05:16,078 --> 00:05:19,533
I don't know, Cleveland. It didn't work
out so great that time I froze my nuts.

99
00:05:21,635 --> 00:05:24,313
No! No!
Bad squirrel!

100
00:05:24,368 --> 00:05:25,971
Those are my nuts!

101
00:05:26,046 --> 00:05:27,453
My nuts!

102
00:05:27,647 --> 00:05:30,172
Ah, you're just a hungry
little fellow, aren't you?

103
00:05:30,227 --> 00:05:31,911
But those are my nuts.

104
00:05:32,637 --> 00:05:35,291
No! Oh, God, no!
My nuts! My nuts!

105
00:05:38,586 --> 00:05:40,532
- Hey, Brian, you want to play tag?
- No.

106
00:05:40,558 --> 00:05:41,732
- Freeze tag?
- No.

107
00:05:41,768 --> 00:05:42,810
- TV tag?
- No.

108
00:05:42,856 --> 00:05:44,830
If I can get some guys, you
want to play Red Rover?

109
00:05:44,848 --> 00:05:45,840
No. Maybe.

110
00:05:45,866 --> 00:05:47,640
You get the guys first,
we'll talk about it.

111
00:05:49,606 --> 00:05:51,741
No! Junglegym mine!

112
00:05:51,797 --> 00:05:53,801
Hey, where'd you get
the Pete Rose haircut?

113
00:05:56,728 --> 00:05:59,352
Anyone else want to feel
my Weebok in their grapes?

114
00:06:00,668 --> 00:06:02,520
Then you'll all do as I say!

115
00:06:02,727 --> 00:06:04,903
- Hi.
- Well, hello there.

116
00:06:06,088 --> 00:06:10,493
Yes, that's right, cry. Cry like Sauron
when he lost his contact lens.

117
00:06:10,548 --> 00:06:12,471
Nobody move, nobody move.

118
00:06:12,525 --> 00:06:14,223
D- Does-Does anybody see it?

119
00:06:14,258 --> 00:06:16,260
It might be stuck to a tree or a rock.

120
00:06:16,307 --> 00:06:19,243
A nyone?
Oh, I am so grounded.

121
00:06:21,606 --> 00:06:22,940
Hi, there. Peter Griffin.

122
00:06:22,977 --> 00:06:27,511
I've, uh, got an appointment to, uh,
banish a white Russian from my Kremlin.

123
00:06:27,557 --> 00:06:30,530
Well, we don't have empty rooms
right now, but if you'll have a seat...

124
00:06:30,588 --> 00:06:35,182
Yeah. Uh, I kind of, uh, warmed myself
up in the car, if you catch my drift.

125
00:06:35,235 --> 00:06:38,090
- I could put you in the storage freezer.
- That'll work.

126
00:06:38,825 --> 00:06:41,233
Nurse, I've got a splinter.

127
00:06:42,155 --> 00:06:44,001
Just come out whenever you're done.

128
00:06:45,787 --> 00:06:49,313
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

129
00:06:50,895 --> 00:06:52,351
Oh, God, I...

130
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,682
I think I feel them moving.

131
00:06:54,858 --> 00:06:57,530
Hi. My partner and I want to have a baby.

132
00:06:57,566 --> 00:07:02,541
We'd like a vial of sperm and an applicator
that looks like Jody Foster's knuckles.

133
00:07:02,576 --> 00:07:04,840
Certainly. Let me just go to the freezer.

134
00:07:06,475 --> 00:07:09,353
Mr. Griffin, you were in
there an awfully long time.

135
00:07:09,385 --> 00:07:11,641
- Are you all right?
- Yup, yup, fine, fine.

136
00:07:11,717 --> 00:07:15,773
And, uh, just so you know, everything in there
is exactly the way it was when I went in.

137
00:07:15,826 --> 00:07:17,770
There is absolutely zero chance

138
00:07:17,827 --> 00:07:20,663
that I spilled all the jars and had
to refill them with my own sperm.

139
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:21,712
Zero chance.

140
00:07:29,868 --> 00:07:31,090
It's a boy!

141
00:07:33,358 --> 00:07:36,651
Victory shall be mine!

142
00:07:42,828 --> 00:07:46,822
<i>We now return to Tony Danza
and Sylvester Stallone in...</i>

143
00:07:46,852 --> 00:07:47,701
<i>What?</i>

144
00:08:01,098 --> 00:08:02,943
Peter, we have to talk.

145
00:08:02,997 --> 00:08:05,194
We haven't had sex since your vasectomy.

146
00:08:05,246 --> 00:08:07,000
Ah, I just don't feel like it, Lois,

147
00:08:07,026 --> 00:08:09,082
seeing as how I'm not a real man anymore.

148
00:08:09,115 --> 00:08:11,731
Honey, it was just a simple operation.

149
00:08:11,777 --> 00:08:13,981
It's no reason to give
up on your sex life.

150
00:08:14,037 --> 00:08:16,613
I don't know, Lois.
I'm just not feeling it anymore.

151
00:08:16,668 --> 00:08:18,842
Besides, it gives me
time to try new things.

152
00:08:18,886 --> 00:08:21,043
Like that time I tried
wearing adult diapers.

153
00:08:21,277 --> 00:08:24,302
Hey, Lois. Hey, kids.
Oh, boy, that smells delicious.

154
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:26,133
You know, I'd love to stay
and eat with you, but,

155
00:08:26,155 --> 00:08:28,433
I got to go meet Cleveland,
Joe and Quagmire down at...

156
00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:35,583
...the bar, so, uh, just put my dinner
in the fridge, and I'll heat it up later.

157
00:08:35,628 --> 00:08:36,632
Love ya'.

158
00:08:39,968 --> 00:08:41,490
You, go get me an ice cream!

159
00:08:41,526 --> 00:08:43,831
You, clear the slide.
I'm going down in five minutes.

160
00:08:43,867 --> 00:08:46,091
You, did you get me my Cheese Whiz, boy?

161
00:08:47,338 --> 00:08:48,950
You're my boyfriend.

162
00:08:48,976 --> 00:08:50,340
Yes, dear, of course I am.

163
00:08:50,367 --> 00:08:52,310
Now where's Lloyd with our Fun Dip?

164
00:08:52,347 --> 00:08:54,453
Good God, running an
empire is harder than

165
00:08:54,476 --> 00:08:57,310
finding diversity in the
Abercrombie & Fitchcatalogue.

166
00:09:01,518 --> 00:09:04,060
- There he is! There he is right there.
- Ah! Found him!

167
00:09:04,108 --> 00:09:05,913
Oh, that was a tricky one.

168
00:09:08,237 --> 00:09:10,082
What the deuce is all the commotion?

169
00:09:10,877 --> 00:09:12,733
All right! Out of my way! Move aside!

170
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:14,672
What the hell is so bloody fascinating?

171
00:09:16,368 --> 00:09:17,201
You!

172
00:09:17,268 --> 00:09:18,881
Well, well, well.

173
00:09:18,935 --> 00:09:21,370
If it isn't my half-brother, Stewie!

174
00:09:21,415 --> 00:09:24,623
Bertram! I haven't seen you since
our microscopic encounter.

175
00:09:24,657 --> 00:09:26,853
How the deuce did you get
out of Peter's testicles?

176
00:09:26,886 --> 00:09:28,493
- He donated sperm.
- Gross.

177
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:31,642
Well, I don't mean to be a discourteous
host, but this is my playground.

178
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,873
- I rule this territory.
- My, my.

179
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,721
What an amusingly misguided view.

180
00:09:35,777 --> 00:09:39,960
Very well, then. You leave me
no choice but to declare war.

181
00:09:39,998 --> 00:09:44,171
So be it. I'll do to you what
B.C. does to comedy on a daily basis.

182
00:09:56,715 --> 00:09:58,952
Hey, boys, you having a midnight snack?

183
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:02,501
I'm just gonna grab something,
too, and go back to bed.

184
00:10:02,557 --> 00:10:04,631
Alone. Again.

185
00:10:04,845 --> 00:10:06,083
Night.

186
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:10,372
You know, Lois has gotten kind of fat
since you guys stopped having sex.

187
00:10:10,408 --> 00:10:11,920
It might be time to, uh...

188
00:10:12,056 --> 00:10:13,062
you know...

189
00:10:13,185 --> 00:10:14,262
have some sex.

190
00:10:14,306 --> 00:10:17,823
You know, at first, I didn't want to do it
'cause of the vasectomy, but now it's just...

191
00:10:18,026 --> 00:10:19,251
I mean, look at her.

192
00:10:19,296 --> 00:10:21,151
She's got elbow cleavage.

193
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:25,563
You know, that little wrinkle that fat people
get on their elbows that looks like a schwa?

194
00:10:25,595 --> 00:10:27,561
I mean, you wouldn't have
sex with her, would you?

195
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,101
- Oh, yeah, I would.
- Really?

196
00:10:29,145 --> 00:10:32,480
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, I would do everything
to her. I don't care what she looks like.

197
00:10:32,526 --> 00:10:35,470
- I would wreck that chick.
- Well, you are a trooper.

198
00:10:38,447 --> 00:10:42,602
Sorry, fat wife coming through.
Sorry, sorry, excuse me, fat wife.

199
00:10:42,738 --> 00:10:44,091
Oh, hold on a sec.

200
00:10:47,218 --> 00:10:49,762
- All right, bring her through.
- Peter, stop it.

201
00:10:49,798 --> 00:10:52,021
For God's sakes, you're embarrassing me.

202
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:55,683
Not as embarrassed as I was when
I got that job entertaining prison inmates.

203
00:10:55,737 --> 00:10:57,271
Do it again, Griffin.

204
00:10:57,327 --> 00:10:59,873
- Come on, I just did it like five...
- Do it!

205
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:03,733
My milkshake brings all the boys
to the yard and they're, like...

206
00:11:03,806 --> 00:11:05,932
it's better than yours, damn right,

207
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:10,040
it's better than yours I could
teach you, but I'd have to charge.

208
00:11:10,626 --> 00:11:14,000
Look, honey, with all due respect,
you've gained some weight recently.

209
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,760
It's five pounds at the most.
It's not a big deal.

210
00:11:16,815 --> 00:11:18,423
It's a slippery slope, Lois.

211
00:11:18,468 --> 00:11:20,573
You start with five pounds,
and then one day, boom,

212
00:11:20,618 --> 00:11:23,422
you wake up, and you're on The Practice
with sixteen rings in your ear.

213
00:11:23,468 --> 00:11:25,960
You're one to talk.
Look how fat you are.

214
00:11:26,008 --> 00:11:29,070
Lois, men aren't fat.
Only fat women are fat.

215
00:11:29,117 --> 00:11:32,313
Now, if you'll excuse me i have to
go warn the chef that you've arrived.

216
00:11:34,055 --> 00:11:35,401
He wants fat?

217
00:11:35,436 --> 00:11:36,803
I'll show him fat.

218
00:11:36,855 --> 00:11:39,130
The only reason I'm eating
anyway is because i hate him.

219
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,793
He won't touch me.

220
00:11:42,665 --> 00:11:44,163
Do you think I'm fat?

221
00:11:44,185 --> 00:11:45,893
- Only if you think I'm a serial killer.
- What?

222
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:46,543
Nothing.

223
00:11:47,955 --> 00:11:49,240
Attention, all hands!

224
00:11:49,266 --> 00:11:52,520
We're going to launch a massive air
strike against Bertram and his army.

225
00:11:52,555 --> 00:11:54,153
Behold the armada!

226
00:11:58,005 --> 00:12:01,130
It's quite simple, actually.
You press the smiling duck to take off,

227
00:12:01,165 --> 00:12:03,541
the cow with the bow tie to fire weapons,

228
00:12:03,575 --> 00:12:06,532
and the clown face is
just a clown face, enjoy it.

229
00:12:06,578 --> 00:12:08,210
Now, battle stations, everyone!

230
00:12:10,036 --> 00:12:11,481
At my signal...

231
00:12:11,515 --> 00:12:13,571
Unleash hell.

232
00:12:27,867 --> 00:12:29,491
What took you so long?

233
00:12:29,526 --> 00:12:31,220
What took you so ugly?

234
00:13:19,088 --> 00:13:21,313
- Well, now what?
- Want to play 20 Questions?

235
00:13:21,345 --> 00:13:23,161
- Sure, uh, is it a man?
- Yes.

236
00:13:23,187 --> 00:13:24,321
- Is he famous?
- Yes.

237
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:25,460
- Is he under 40?
- No.

238
00:13:25,476 --> 00:13:26,510
- Over 40?
- Yes.

239
00:13:26,527 --> 00:13:27,562
- On television?
- Yes.

240
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:28,902
- On television now.
- No.

241
00:13:28,917 --> 00:13:30,193
- In the past 20 years?
- Yes.

242
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,701
- Is it Richard Mulligan?
- Yes!

243
00:13:32,697 --> 00:13:35,720
Even till now we've been
fighting Bertram on his terms.

244
00:13:35,777 --> 00:13:38,203
Whoa. Easy, easy, girl.
Easy, easy, easy.

245
00:13:38,265 --> 00:13:39,910
But I propose an invasion.

246
00:13:39,946 --> 00:13:41,953
We've got to fight him
over there by the swing set,

247
00:13:41,968 --> 00:13:43,930
so we don't have to fight
him here at the sandbox.

248
00:13:43,977 --> 00:13:45,022
Stewie.

249
00:13:45,086 --> 00:13:46,071
What's this?

250
00:13:47,898 --> 00:13:50,231
A letter of surrender.
We did it!

251
00:13:50,308 --> 00:13:53,551
Whew. It's a good thing, too, because
I really didn't have an exit strategy.

252
00:13:53,605 --> 00:13:55,030
Yay, Stewie.

253
00:13:55,097 --> 00:13:56,972
Oh, thank you, darling, I...

254
00:13:57,107 --> 00:13:58,491
What is this, makeup?

255
00:13:58,536 --> 00:13:59,881
Are you wearing makeup?

256
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,033
Chicken pox.

257
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:09,420
Damn you, Bertram, I thought
we called no biological warfare!

258
00:14:09,446 --> 00:14:11,193
You swore on the seesaw!

259
00:14:15,797 --> 00:14:17,552
Stewie, there you are.

260
00:14:17,596 --> 00:14:19,543
Oh, my God. Your face.

261
00:14:19,577 --> 00:14:22,063
Oh, sweetie, you got the chicken pox.

262
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:23,902
- Come on, we got to get you out of here.
- No.

263
00:14:23,948 --> 00:14:26,282
No, damn you! I've go
finish what I started!

264
00:14:26,326 --> 00:14:28,763
No... My God, do you put on weight?

265
00:14:28,807 --> 00:14:31,133
You're like one of those
Memory Foam mattresses.

266
00:14:31,806 --> 00:14:33,333
Look, there's my face.

267
00:14:38,195 --> 00:14:39,691
Here you go, sweetie.

268
00:14:39,716 --> 00:14:42,643
A couple more oatmeal
baths and you'll be all better.

269
00:14:42,668 --> 00:14:44,241
No need to clean up when I'm done.

270
00:14:44,268 --> 00:14:48,230
You'll probably just slice a couple of
bananas in here and chow down, huh, porky?

271
00:14:48,635 --> 00:14:50,471
So what happened with
that kid on the playground?

272
00:14:50,497 --> 00:14:53,000
He won this round, Brian,
but I'm going back tomorrow.

273
00:14:53,045 --> 00:14:55,532
And when I've carried out my plan,
he won't know what hit him.

274
00:14:55,588 --> 00:14:57,753
Like that baseball team
that Peter coached.

275
00:14:57,866 --> 00:15:01,050
Well, kids, just when I thought we'd
never find and assistant coach,

276
00:15:01,085 --> 00:15:04,350
I ran into this drifter hanging out near
the elementary school playground.

277
00:15:04,397 --> 00:15:07,510
He's got a clown costume in his trunk,
so we know he's good with kids,

278
00:15:07,545 --> 00:15:11,353
and pictures of boys in their underwear,
so he's probably had some medical training.

279
00:15:11,425 --> 00:15:15,240
Well, I'm going to take off while he fits you
for cups in that windowless supply shed.

280
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:16,051
See ya.

281
00:15:19,225 --> 00:15:23,081
<i>This Friday on TNT, the world
premiere of Morgan Freeman in</i>

282
00:15:23,105 --> 00:15:24,190
<i>The Narrator.</i>

283
00:15:24,236 --> 00:15:26,410

285

287

288
00:15:35,848 --> 00:15:38,822

289
00:15:38,878 --> 00:15:41,581

Oh, hey, Hogzilla, you happen
to see my hot wife, Lois, around?

294
00:15:54,478 --> 00:15:58,741
No, I haven't. Maybe she's out
looking for a man who can satisfy her.

295
00:16:00,058 --> 00:16:02,881
Do me a favor when you go to
sleep, aim your butt the other way.

296
00:16:02,905 --> 00:16:04,701
Last night, for God's sake, you farted.

297
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:07,523
I felt like somebody was sticking me
with a cigarette lighter from the car.

298
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,972
- You're fat.
- Shut up and go to sleep.

299
00:16:11,415 --> 00:16:13,672
Lois, you weigh a ton. Get off me.

300
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,591
- I'm trying.
- Try harder.

301
00:16:15,645 --> 00:16:18,653
- Ow! Lois, that hurts!
- Peter, if you'll just stop for one second...

302
00:16:23,155 --> 00:16:25,003
Peter, are we having sex?

303
00:16:25,045 --> 00:16:28,013
Uh, let's check. Uh, just,
lift up that fold right there.

304
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,461
Uh... yeah.

305
00:16:32,948 --> 00:16:35,250
Lois, last night was amazing!

306
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,770
It was, wasn't it?

307
00:16:36,805 --> 00:16:39,571
Fat sex is the hottest
sex we've ever had.

308
00:16:39,618 --> 00:16:43,462
There were so many boobs, I didn't know whose
boobs I was grabbing, your boobs or my boobs.

309
00:16:43,507 --> 00:16:45,773
I know, it was amazing.

310
00:16:45,815 --> 00:16:49,010
Much better than that night you
pretended your penis was Danny Aiello.

311
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:53,281
Oh. That is so interesting, Danny Aiello.

312
00:16:53,326 --> 00:16:55,760
You've got the best Spike Lee stories.

313
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:56,743
What's that?

314
00:16:56,788 --> 00:16:58,392
You want to meet my wife?

315
00:16:58,438 --> 00:17:01,070
- Peter, stop it.
- Lois, just say hello.

316
00:17:01,118 --> 00:17:03,610
You're embarrassing me
in front of Danny Aiello.

317
00:17:03,687 --> 00:17:06,590
Now come here, my fat concubine.

318
00:17:06,635 --> 00:17:08,600
Peter, I'm not even hungry.

319
00:17:08,647 --> 00:17:10,791
I want you bigger.
I want you fatter.

320
00:17:10,846 --> 00:17:12,292
It will please me.

321
00:17:16,546 --> 00:17:21,361
With Stewart out of the picture, this
whole playground is under my control.

322
00:17:36,836 --> 00:17:38,590
I sense something.

323
00:17:38,647 --> 00:17:41,431
A presence I've not felt since...

324
00:17:42,847 --> 00:17:44,551
Stewie, you're alive!

325
00:17:44,595 --> 00:17:46,180
Yes, Bertram, I'm alive,

326
00:17:46,215 --> 00:17:49,231
and I think you'll find all your
guards quite incapacitated.

327
00:17:49,287 --> 00:17:53,212
You have an annoying habit of
turning up where you're not welcome.

328
00:17:53,236 --> 00:17:57,172
Well, when I'm done with you, you're going to
hate me more that the other vowels hate "Y."

329
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:01,671
If you'll turn to page 34 of your blue books,
you'll see our projections for next quarter,

330
00:18:01,717 --> 00:18:03,681
Okay. Okay. All right.

331
00:18:03,717 --> 00:18:05,661
You know what?
I'm in a meeting. I'll call you back.

332
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:08,533
Well, well, well, look who
decided to show up.

333
00:18:08,597 --> 00:18:10,053
So, what are we talking about here?

334
00:18:10,085 --> 00:18:12,451
- Well, before you...
- I'm sorry...

335
00:18:12,647 --> 00:18:14,300
F! What's up?

336
00:18:14,335 --> 00:18:15,820
No, no, I can talk.

337
00:18:16,115 --> 00:18:17,111
En garde!

338
00:19:13,816 --> 00:19:15,323
Any last words?

339
00:19:15,346 --> 00:19:17,610
You wouldn't kill me...
Would you?

340
00:19:19,077 --> 00:19:21,691
Thanks for helping me
dig this hole, Mr Moltisanti.

341
00:19:21,736 --> 00:19:23,520
Hey, no problem, Stewie.

342
00:19:23,578 --> 00:19:26,383
This can be a pain in the ass when
you got to do it all by yourself.

343
00:19:26,425 --> 00:19:28,832
Yeah, you're telling me.
All right, go ahead and drop it in.

344
00:19:30,007 --> 00:19:32,961
Oh, boy, that's going to be beautiful
when it reaches adulthood.

345
00:19:32,988 --> 00:19:34,733
Yeah, I love plants.

346
00:19:34,776 --> 00:19:36,903
So what happened with that kid
you were telling me about?

347
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,611
- Oh, he admitted defeat and ran off.
- What a mook.

348
00:19:42,337 --> 00:19:45,021
Oh, Peter, I love you so much.

349
00:19:45,968 --> 00:19:50,062
Oh, Lois, I have no idea if we're doing it
of if that's just the back of your knee,

350
00:19:50,095 --> 00:19:52,553
but either way it feels so good.

351
00:19:52,595 --> 00:19:55,720
Ow. Peter, you're on my arm. It hurts.

352
00:19:56,086 --> 00:19:58,142
My chest hurts, too.

353
00:19:58,178 --> 00:20:00,021
Oh, my God, Peter...

354
00:20:00,048 --> 00:20:02,030
I think I'm having a heart attack.

355
00:20:02,056 --> 00:20:06,142
- Me, too, sweetie, me, too.
- No, Peter, I'm really having a heart attack.

356
00:20:06,176 --> 00:20:07,751
Oh, my God, you're serious?

357
00:20:07,787 --> 00:20:10,151
We should get you to the hospital.
All right, hold-hold on a sec...

358
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:11,593
All right, almost done, almost done...

359
00:20:11,615 --> 00:20:14,040
- Peter!
- Almost done, almost done, almost done.

360
00:20:14,075 --> 00:20:14,973
Okay, let's go.

361
00:20:17,036 --> 00:20:20,470
Well, it was a tough job removing all
that fat to get to your heart, Mrs Griffin,

362
00:20:20,496 --> 00:20:22,143
but you came through it beautifully.

363
00:20:22,176 --> 00:20:25,072
Honey, I'm sorry I tried to make
you into something you're not.

364
00:20:25,105 --> 00:20:27,540
I love you no matter what size you are.

365
00:20:27,647 --> 00:20:31,773
Although, I gotta admit, I'm gonna miss
eating cereal out of the dimples on your ass.

366
00:20:32,126 --> 00:20:35,791
Well, Mrs. Griffin, you rest up for
a few days and you'll be just fine.

367
00:20:35,848 --> 00:20:37,150
Thank you, Doctor.

368
00:20:37,198 --> 00:20:40,553
I realize now that eating is not
the way to solve my problems.

369
00:20:40,585 --> 00:20:43,063
- You hear that, Meg?
- For your information, Mom.

370
00:20:43,145 --> 00:20:45,081
I don't eat to solve my problems.

371
00:20:45,157 --> 00:20:46,371
I cut myself.

372
00:20:46,396 --> 00:20:47,513
Is that better?

373
00:20:47,608 --> 00:20:50,093
Chris, we all love your hat.

374
00:20:50,126 --> 00:20:51,702
Thanks, Mom.

375
00:20:51,746 --> 00:20:54,620
Hey, Doc, what did you
do with my Mom's fat?

376
00:20:54,668 --> 00:20:56,741
Oh, it's right here in
this storage closet.

377
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,520
It's exactly what it looks like.
