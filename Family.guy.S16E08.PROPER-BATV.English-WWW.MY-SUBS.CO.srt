11
00:00:35,743 --> 00:00:36,986
Hey, Meg. What are you up to?

12
00:00:36,987 --> 00:00:39,520
Not much. Just finished
an angel food cake.

13
00:00:39,521 --> 00:00:42,460
Might go out to the trash, see
if there's any possums to kiss.

14
00:00:42,461 --> 00:00:44,078
I was just out there.

15
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:47,463
Oh, come on, it's your senior year.

16
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,533
Somebody must be having
a party or something.

17
00:00:49,534 --> 00:00:50,680
Well, there's one.

18
00:00:50,681 --> 00:00:52,753
But... I wasn't invited.

19
00:00:52,754 --> 00:00:54,089
Well, so what? Go crash it.

20
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,624
Nah. Not my style.

21
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:59,229
And what do you care? Do you
want the TV or something?

22
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:03,102
What? No, no. I want... I
want to see you have fun.

23
00:01:03,103 --> 00:01:05,768
Come on, you should go, you
know? Let loose a little.

24
00:01:05,769 --> 00:01:07,803
You know what? You're right.

25
00:01:07,804 --> 00:01:09,759
Maybe I<i> will</i> give it a shot.

26
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,321
Yeah. How awkward could it be?

27
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:12,908
Can't be worse than waving at someone

28
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:14,761
who doesn't wave back at you.

29
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:20,267
- No, not<i> you.</i>
- Oh. Sorry.

30
00:01:20,268 --> 00:01:22,084
In fact, everyone<i> but</i> you.

31
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:23,753
Hi, everyone but him!

32
00:01:23,754 --> 00:01:25,253
Hi!

33
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:32,497
Lou, I like you a lot, but I-I
think that's the last tape

34
00:01:32,498 --> 00:01:34,976
of you having sex with your
girlfriend I want to see.

35
00:01:34,977 --> 00:01:36,169
Suit yourself.

36
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,500
All right, I got to get
over to my mom's wake.

37
00:01:38,501 --> 00:01:39,836
Oh, right, yeah. Crap.

38
00:01:39,837 --> 00:01:40,970
Ugh. Sorry again.

39
00:01:40,971 --> 00:01:42,938
- Oof. Cancer.
- Car accident.

40
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:44,774
No, I know, I just, I'm...

41
00:01:44,775 --> 00:01:47,009
saying it feels like
everyone's getting cancer.

42
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,128
You know, Bowie.

43
00:01:53,983 --> 00:01:57,138
Time to get<i> creepay...</i>

44
00:01:59,506 --> 00:02:01,574
Huh. Kid family.

45
00:02:11,984 --> 00:02:13,987
What a scumbag.

46
00:02:17,907 --> 00:02:18,974
Aw...

47
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,644
Because I'm working all day!

48
00:02:22,645 --> 00:02:25,847
Oh, yeah? Well, here's what I
think of your stupid work!

49
00:02:25,848 --> 00:02:27,316
Don't you do that!

50
00:02:27,317 --> 00:02:29,069
Fiona, don't you...

51
00:02:31,437 --> 00:02:33,155
Is that Principal Shepherd?

52
00:02:33,156 --> 00:02:36,059
Wow, that looks like a
rocky relationship.

53
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,078
"Rocky relationship."

54
00:02:40,213 --> 00:02:41,781
Ha-ha!

55
00:02:44,751 --> 00:02:46,936
Oh, come on, Brian.

56
00:02:46,937 --> 00:02:48,439
Don't comment or like it.

57
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,073
It's a hard lesson, but
one he has to learn.

58
00:03:03,286 --> 00:03:06,628
All right, ladies, time to mingle.

59
00:03:07,191 --> 00:03:10,025
Hey. You guys talking
<i>Big Bang</i> over here?

60
00:03:10,026 --> 00:03:11,426
<i>Big Bang Theory?</i>

61
00:03:11,427 --> 00:03:13,762
No? Any Bangers over here?

62
00:03:13,763 --> 00:03:15,131
No?

63
00:03:15,132 --> 00:03:16,698
Well, I've tried everything.

64
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:19,201
We just don't have anything
in common with these guys.

65
00:03:19,202 --> 00:03:23,624
Maybe... we don't need
anything in common with them.

66
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:28,877
Meg, come on, don't go crazy.

67
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:30,564
Damn, that's hot!

68
00:03:32,465 --> 00:03:34,083
That was just lucky.

69
00:03:34,084 --> 00:03:35,769
Oh, yeah?

70
00:03:39,506 --> 00:03:42,779
Wow! Meg's so good at
casually tossing bottles

71
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,665
over her shoulder so they land upright!

72
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,208
And that's very popular right now,

73
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:48,430
because we've run out
of things on Earth.

74
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:51,088
Meg, that was amazing!

75
00:03:51,089 --> 00:03:53,357
What can I say? I'm full of surprises.

76
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,505
Like the end of<i> The Usual Suspects.</i>

77
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:04,932
He was gay the whole time!

78
00:04:11,454 --> 00:04:13,022
Okay, they're obviously home.

79
00:04:13,023 --> 00:04:16,092
You'd have to be dumb to
try to rob<i> that</i> place.

80
00:04:18,295 --> 00:04:19,718
Oh, yes!

81
00:04:28,655 --> 00:04:30,657
I hate the guy, but he's good.

82
00:04:38,698 --> 00:04:39,881
Oh, my God.

83
00:04:39,882 --> 00:04:42,718
What the... what the hell
is going on over there?

84
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:44,953
Did he...

85
00:04:44,954 --> 00:04:46,252
<i>Hello.</i>

86
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:48,457
Hey, Stewie, it's me. You got a second?

87
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,791
<i>Brian? Hang on.</i>

88
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:51,460
<i>Hey, keep it down, you screwballs.</i>

89
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:53,528
<i>Here, let me just go
somewhere a little quieter.</i>

90
00:04:53,529 --> 00:04:56,198
Oh, yeah, right.<i> I'm</i> the screwball.

91
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:58,301
You and friends say "screwball" a lot.

92
00:04:58,302 --> 00:05:00,737
That's what happens when you
run with a screwy crowd.

93
00:05:00,738 --> 00:05:03,122
- What's up with you?
- Stewie, I think...

94
00:05:03,123 --> 00:05:05,574
I think Principal
Shepherd killed his wife.

95
00:05:05,575 --> 00:05:07,008
What? What are you talking about?

96
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:09,177
I think I saw him getting
rid of her body.

97
00:05:09,178 --> 00:05:11,313
And carrying a bag with
something heavy in it.

98
00:05:11,314 --> 00:05:13,882
And... and there was red
liquid dripping from it.

99
00:05:13,883 --> 00:05:15,417
Okay, I've got to see this for myself.

100
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:17,052
Don't do anything. I'm coming over.

101
00:05:17,053 --> 00:05:18,487
Hey, listen, you-you don't think...

102
00:05:18,488 --> 00:05:20,522
you don't think you could
snag a couple of rolls

103
00:05:20,523 --> 00:05:21,731
of toilet paper, could you?

104
00:05:23,998 --> 00:05:26,161
- Stewie?
- <i>I'm here. I just wanted you</i>

105
00:05:26,162 --> 00:05:28,681
<i>to have to sit with those
words for a minute.</i>

106
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:33,835
Kids, dinner's ready!

107
00:05:33,836 --> 00:05:34,903
"Dinner's ready."

108
00:05:34,904 --> 00:05:36,204
Shut up.

109
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:39,258
Little of the old schnappster
ought to get me right.

110
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:42,544
'Ey... Chrissay!

111
00:05:42,545 --> 00:05:45,273
Well, that's delightfully informal, Meg.

112
00:05:45,274 --> 00:05:46,900
How the heck are ya?

113
00:05:49,768 --> 00:05:51,887
So, what are you kids doing in school?

114
00:05:51,888 --> 00:05:54,520
I got in trouble for saying
something "insensitive"

115
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,891
to trans kids.

116
00:05:55,892 --> 00:05:57,626
- What'd you say?
- Well, a few them started

117
00:05:57,627 --> 00:06:00,028
this a cappella group, and
they're all kind of chubby.

118
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:04,299
So I said, "You guys should call
yourselves the Trans Fats."

119
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,068
Meg, you'll sit next to me this evening.

120
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:08,336
But, Dad...

121
00:06:08,337 --> 00:06:10,205
I'm sorry, Chris. You've
fallen out of favor.

122
00:06:10,206 --> 00:06:11,538
Perhaps forever.

123
00:06:16,795 --> 00:06:18,647
Oh, Stewie, thank God you're here.

124
00:06:18,648 --> 00:06:20,782
There's a seagull in your hallway.

125
00:06:20,783 --> 00:06:21,950
Listen, what are we gonna do

126
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,552
about this Principal Shepherd thing?

127
00:06:23,553 --> 00:06:26,755
Look, all you know is that the
guy was carrying a wet bag.

128
00:06:26,756 --> 00:06:28,390
It doesn't mean he killed his wife.

129
00:06:28,391 --> 00:06:30,426
You're building this whole theory...

130
00:06:30,427 --> 00:06:31,660
What is that noise?

131
00:06:31,661 --> 00:06:33,128
It's a news alert.

132
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:36,498
"Fiona Shepherd, wife of James
Woods High School principal

133
00:06:36,499 --> 00:06:39,167
John Shepherd, has been
reported missing."

134
00:06:39,168 --> 00:06:41,830
Oh, my God, maybe he<i> did</i> do it.

135
00:06:41,831 --> 00:06:44,028
You know, there are some
bad people in this world.

136
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,273
Hey, you don't got to tell<i> me</i> that.

137
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:47,342
I learned that in Fight Club.

138
00:06:47,343 --> 00:06:49,911
All right, Stewie, what's the
first rule of Fight Club?

139
00:06:49,912 --> 00:06:51,681
G-string underwear.

140
00:06:51,682 --> 00:06:53,915
No. It's "don't talk about Fight Club."

141
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,436
Oh. Well, I really blew it.

142
00:07:03,008 --> 00:07:05,361
Hey-o! What's up in this piece?

143
00:07:05,362 --> 00:07:07,095
You're getting home late.

144
00:07:07,096 --> 00:07:09,331
Yeah. We were hanging out
in the woods, and...

145
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:13,969
this one girl pushed another girl over

146
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,837
while she was peeing.

147
00:07:15,838 --> 00:07:17,839
They fought, and then the cops came.

148
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,140
Meg, this is important.

149
00:07:19,141 --> 00:07:21,176
Did she fall in the pee?

150
00:07:21,177 --> 00:07:22,645
I can smell your breath.

151
00:07:22,646 --> 00:07:24,313
You've been drinking, haven't you?

152
00:07:24,314 --> 00:07:27,849
No! Geez, Mom, get off my back.

153
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,466
Peter, I think she's doing booze.

154
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:31,698
What should we do?

155
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:33,321
Lois, she's just being a teenager.

156
00:07:33,322 --> 00:07:36,387
We don't know she's, like, for
sure, definitely been drinking.

157
00:07:36,388 --> 00:07:38,159
I found this in her room.

158
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,861
My little girl's a drunk!

159
00:07:39,862 --> 00:07:43,546
Oh, my God, where did we go wrong?

160
00:07:49,155 --> 00:07:50,605
Meg, we need to talk.

161
00:07:50,606 --> 00:07:52,974
What, Mom? But I know
what you're gonna say,

162
00:07:52,975 --> 00:07:54,842
and I know how you're gonna say it.

163
00:07:54,843 --> 00:07:56,144
- Oh, really?
- Yep.

164
00:07:56,145 --> 00:07:57,712
I don't want you drinkin'

165
00:07:57,713 --> 00:07:59,815
or your life's gonna
go down the crappah.

166
00:07:59,816 --> 00:08:01,616
That's not bad.

167
00:08:01,617 --> 00:08:03,685
I-I mean, I sound nothing like that,

168
00:08:03,686 --> 00:08:05,688
but it's a fun character. Heh.

169
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:06,819
But this is serious.

170
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,821
Alcoholism runs in our family.

171
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,457
Hey, I'm just glad <i>something</i>
runs in this family.

172
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,593
I don't mean to...

173
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,464
I-I don't mean to laugh,
okay? But that was funny.

174
00:08:17,465 --> 00:08:19,065
Mom, I'm just having fun.

175
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:21,901
I'm finally known as something
other than "the chubby girl

176
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:23,603
who put the lunch lady in a headlock."

177
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:25,671
And besides, Dad's the one

178
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,440
who pushed me into going to that party.

179
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:29,490
Oh, he did, did he?

180
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:32,444
Son of a bitch. What was that?

181
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:35,113
I don't know. Someone must've
messed something up.

182
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,316
Listen, you need to talk
to Meg about her drinking.

183
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:38,617
What? Why me?

184
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:39,918
Because you're the one who told her

185
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,820
to start going to these parties.

186
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,288
Okay, fine.

187
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,491
I guess it's just something
I got to deal with.

188
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:47,778
Like the flush of a high-powered toilet.

189
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,638
So, you plan on going
back at that banana, huh?

190
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,973
So the bastard killed his wife,

191
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,709
and then reported her missing.

192
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,828
I-I got to... I got to call the cops.

193
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,181
- Quahog Police.
- Joe, Joe, it's Brian.

194
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:10,782
Listen, I have to tell you something.

195
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:12,362
I-I'm pretty sure

196
00:09:12,363 --> 00:09:14,103
Principal Shepherd killed his wife.

197
00:09:14,104 --> 00:09:16,723
That's a serious accusation.
Do you have any proof?

198
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:18,791
I have something better than proof,

199
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:21,627
rank suspicion born out of
boredom and loneliness.

200
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:24,162
Sorry, that's just not
enough for us to go on.

201
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:27,602
You must be pretty tired from
thinking about all this.

202
00:09:27,603 --> 00:09:30,105
- You ever get bags under your eyes?
- What?

203
00:09:30,106 --> 00:09:33,057
I've been using this eye cream,
it's done wonders for me.

204
00:09:33,058 --> 00:09:35,463
It's made by a company
called Rodan and Fields.

205
00:09:35,464 --> 00:09:36,630
Have you heard of them, Brian?

206
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:39,211
- Yeah, I-I think, uh...
- Oh, they make terrific stuff.

207
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:40,812
In fact, I was such a fan,

208
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,748
I became a sales consultant
for the company.

209
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,349
Listen, Joe, I got to run.

210
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,352
I'm hosting a little
get-together tomorrow night,

211
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:48,588
If you want to stop by.
There's gonna be pizza

212
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:52,025
and soft drinks, then a man's
gonna talk about the whole line.

213
00:09:52,026 --> 00:09:54,694
Can I go ahead and
confirm your attendance?

214
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:56,194
Well, that was no help.

215
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:58,230
What if I go over there and
try to find some evidence

216
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,865
- that he did it?
- All right, fine.

217
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:00,933
But you have to be careful.

218
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,701
Don't worry, he won't have any idea.

219
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,002
I'll be more discreet

220
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,723
than a guy standing by
himself in the ocean.

221
00:10:08,725 --> 00:10:10,877
- Hey, are you peeing?
- No.

222
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:13,946
- Are you pooping?
- I'm just trying to enjoy the day.

223
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,747
Why don't you go bother that guy?

224
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:18,535
Summer's blown by, huh?

225
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:23,589
So, your mom says you've been drinking.

226
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,190
Yeah, like, a little bit, but...

227
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:26,858
but it's nothing you
have to worry about.

228
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,795
Look, I-I was young, too, you know.

229
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:32,198
I-I remember going to parties,
walking up with a six pack.

230
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:35,269
You're so excited to get there,
you start jogging a little.

231
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,769
Your friends are all there, and
they're so happy to see you,

232
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,404
they're practically cheering your name.

233
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:42,240
And then "Mony Mony" comes
on at just the right time.

234
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,742
And everyone's dancing,

235
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,646
and-and Laura Hallston's jugs
are just slamming into you.

236
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:48,381
You don't have a care in the world,

237
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:51,316
and if all of it came to an end
right then and there, so be it.

238
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,051
Well, you're my daughter,

239
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,887
and I don't want any of that for you.

240
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:59,242
Hey, you want to see where I was
sitting when you were born?

241
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:05,064
Yeah, I still think about Laura a lot.

242
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:07,300
You were already drinking
tonight, weren't you?

243
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:09,090
A little.

244
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:11,403
Well, I can't talk to a
drunk person if I'm sober.

245
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,739
Hey, Jerome, can I get a beer, please?

246
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,045
But now<i> I'm</i> starting to sober up,

247
00:11:16,046 --> 00:11:18,911
so I'm gonna need one to
keep an even playing field.

248
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:20,946
All right, but it stays between us.

249
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:22,481
And what if they card you?

250
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,768
Don't worry. I got it covered.

251
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,754
Wow. That's really good.

252
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:31,975
Right?! Jerome, make it two!

253
00:12:23,344 --> 00:12:25,410
All right, he's gone.

254
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,847
Now, if I give the word, you've
got to get out of there, okay?

255
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:29,715
Got it.

256
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,349
Oh, my God!

257
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,752
What? What is it?

258
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,319
He sleeps in a bunk bed!

259
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,055
Are you kidding me?! Who is this guy?!

260
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:38,405
Wait a second. Is that...?

261
00:12:38,406 --> 00:12:40,058
Bri, I'm gonna put you down for a sec.

262
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,636
Stewie, no! Don't.

263
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:49,334
Stewie, get out of there!

264
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,170
Stewie! Stewie!

265
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:53,272
Got to get his attention.

266
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,627
Man, just short.

267
00:13:00,263 --> 00:13:02,599
Oh, God.

268
00:13:14,778 --> 00:13:16,556
Domino's.

269
00:13:16,557 --> 00:13:17,671
Oh, good.

270
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,867
Medium pie, ten wings.

271
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:22,868
Is the blue cheese dressing in there?

272
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:24,436
Thanks a lot. Have a good one.

273
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,664
Mmm.

274
00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:42,613
He got out! Ha, ha! Yes, Stewie!

275
00:13:54,818 --> 00:13:56,268
Oh, crap.

276
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:57,969
Oh, my, that was close.

277
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,906
Stewie, he saw you! He saw
you leaving his apartment!

278
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:03,008
Oh. Well... so what?

279
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,128
He doesn't know what we're doing.

280
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:10,933
What? What is it?

281
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,985
Well, that's...

282
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,754
that's not good.

283
00:14:26,794 --> 00:14:28,355
Dad? Dad, wake up!

284
00:14:28,356 --> 00:14:30,223
- Huh? What happened?
- I don't know!

285
00:14:30,224 --> 00:14:32,027
We must have stolen
this boat last night.

286
00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:34,046
I-I have no idea where the hell we are!

287
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:37,726
Oh, no, my cell phone's dead!

288
00:14:37,727 --> 00:14:39,901
I got a little bit of juice left,

289
00:14:39,902 --> 00:14:41,804
so we can either A, call someone,

290
00:14:41,805 --> 00:14:43,606
maybe they answer, maybe they can help,

291
00:14:43,607 --> 00:14:47,142
or B, we can definitely switch faces.

292
00:14:47,143 --> 00:14:49,744
Look at you! Look at me!

293
00:14:49,745 --> 00:14:51,212
That's what this is!

294
00:14:51,213 --> 00:14:53,634
Oh, we're gonna die.

295
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:00,315
Dad, what are we gonna do?

296
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,751
You think it's too early to tie
our shirts around our heads

297
00:15:02,752 --> 00:15:04,352
to show we're going insane?

298
00:15:04,353 --> 00:15:06,355
I mean it, Dad. This is serious.

299
00:15:06,356 --> 00:15:08,091
I did pants instead.

300
00:15:08,092 --> 00:15:10,592
Ugh! I don't feel so hot.

301
00:15:10,593 --> 00:15:11,894
What is wrong with me?

302
00:15:11,895 --> 00:15:14,096
Have you taken a break since
you started drinking?

303
00:15:14,097 --> 00:15:15,564
Not until right now.

304
00:15:15,565 --> 00:15:18,034
Do you feel like lying on the
couch, rubbing your eyes,

305
00:15:18,035 --> 00:15:19,959
while listening to Lou
Reed's "Perfect Day"?

306
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,034
Yes!

307
00:15:21,035 --> 00:15:23,506
Then I'll tell you what's wrong
with you. You got a hangover.

308
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:25,107
What can you do for a hangover?

309
00:15:25,108 --> 00:15:27,075
Well, Meg, so I don't have to think

310
00:15:27,076 --> 00:15:28,410
about my throbbing headache,

311
00:15:28,411 --> 00:15:30,746
I try to think of something
else, like a riddle.

312
00:15:30,747 --> 00:15:33,716
Like, how would you
describe Chris O'Donnell?

313
00:15:33,717 --> 00:15:37,019
Huh. He's not tall or short.

314
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,221
And he's not fat or thin.

315
00:15:39,222 --> 00:15:41,923
Well, he's not handsome or ugly.

316
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:45,428
And he's not young or old.

317
00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:47,462
He's not loud or quiet.

318
00:15:47,463 --> 00:15:50,766
Uh, he's not memorable,
but-but I know who he is.

319
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:52,801
Thanks, Dad!

320
00:15:52,802 --> 00:15:54,636
I feel so much better.

321
00:15:54,637 --> 00:15:56,060
But you know who doesn't?

322
00:15:56,061 --> 00:15:57,396
Chris O'Donnell.

323
00:15:57,397 --> 00:15:58,824
Bye, dildo.

324
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,575
Oh, no. Hard shoes on linoleum.

325
00:16:08,576 --> 00:16:09,849
That's a principal!

326
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,915
Brian, a lot of people
live in this building,

327
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:14,322
and you can't tell it's a
principal just from a walk.

328
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,495
Excuse me? May I have
your attention, please?

329
00:16:19,496 --> 00:16:21,648
Okay, that's probably a principal.

330
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,769
Hey. How are you today?

331
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,303
What can I do for you?

332
00:16:28,304 --> 00:16:29,738
What do you want from me?

333
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,673
Listen, it's... it's-it's
not what you think.

334
00:16:31,674 --> 00:16:33,175
Then what is it?

335
00:16:33,176 --> 00:16:36,311
Well... I'm, um... I'm
actually doing a documentary

336
00:16:36,312 --> 00:16:37,779
about some of the finest principals

337
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,414
in the country, and...

338
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,016
Ow! Continue.

339
00:16:41,017 --> 00:16:44,319
"Finest principals in
the country" and...

340
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,154
Brian!

341
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:48,491
Stewie! Help me!

342
00:16:48,492 --> 00:16:50,258
<i> How did I get here?</i>

343
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,361
<i>Well, to answer that, you'd
have to go back a little while.</i>

344
00:16:53,362 --> 00:16:54,530
<i> We're not doing that!</i>

345
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,969
We found this in a Dumpster

346
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,605
behind Principal Shepherd's building.

347
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:04,472
That's it. That's-that's the bag!

348
00:17:04,473 --> 00:17:06,192
I guarantee his wife's in there.

349
00:17:09,846 --> 00:17:12,048
Ha! What's the matter,
rook? Too heavy for you?

350
00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:13,982
I've actually been a cop for years.

351
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,315
I have tummy cancer.

352
00:17:15,316 --> 00:17:17,838
Oh. Weird way to say that.

353
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,557
What the hell? Bu-But I saw...

354
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:22,824
Yeah, well, what is all this?

355
00:17:22,825 --> 00:17:24,126
Principal Shepherd,

356
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:26,561
I think you've got
some explaining to do.

357
00:17:26,562 --> 00:17:28,989
Look, I tried to tell you,
I didn't kill my wife.

358
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,650
She just texted me today
that she's moved out

359
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,336
and she's banging my cousin,

360
00:17:33,337 --> 00:17:35,404
Pat Sajak's accountant, by the way.

361
00:17:35,405 --> 00:17:37,072
It's a weird time to name drop.

362
00:17:37,073 --> 00:17:39,007
And the food, well,
I've been stealing it

363
00:17:39,008 --> 00:17:40,876
from the high school to make ends meet.

364
00:17:40,877 --> 00:17:43,345
My life's "kinda brute,"
as the kids say.

365
00:17:43,346 --> 00:17:45,080
Sounds like you've had a rough day.

366
00:17:45,081 --> 00:17:48,416
No wonder you've got those
bags under your eyes.

367
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:52,821
Have you ever heard of a company
called Rodan and Fields?

368
00:17:54,924 --> 00:17:58,426
Ugh. Are all hangovers this bad?

369
00:17:58,427 --> 00:18:01,496
Yup, that's the deal you
make with the gods of fun.

370
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,598
Every 72 hours, you lose a day.

371
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:06,067
Dad, you're so sunburnt.

372
00:18:06,068 --> 00:18:08,503
I can't move because it hurts too bad.

373
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,105
Ugh. This is awful.

374
00:18:10,106 --> 00:18:12,707
We don't even know if
anyone's looking for us.

375
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,609
Look, don't worry. We're gonna be okay.

376
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,578
This is why you shouldn't drink.

377
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:18,847
Booze is nothing but trouble,
and you don't need it.

378
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,882
You got a good brain in your head.

379
00:18:20,883 --> 00:18:24,252
Thanks, Dad, and if this is what
drinking makes you feel like,

380
00:18:24,253 --> 00:18:25,854
you don't have to worry about it.

381
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,089
I am done with booze.

382
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:30,025
Aw, I'm glad to hear that.

383
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,927
And I'm sorry I pushed it on you.

384
00:18:31,928 --> 00:18:34,262
I just... I just wanted to watch TV.

385
00:18:34,263 --> 00:18:36,564
I don't want to see you
waste opportunities

386
00:18:36,565 --> 00:18:38,401
'cause you were out partying.

387
00:18:38,402 --> 00:18:39,902
That's what I did.

388
00:18:39,903 --> 00:18:41,904
You just worry about being you.

389
00:18:41,905 --> 00:18:43,405
Don't worry, Dad.

390
00:18:43,406 --> 00:18:45,540
I'll never be anything like you.

391
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,460
That's my girl.

392
00:18:48,493 --> 00:18:50,997
Dad, look!

393
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,402
Oh, my God. Meg, we're saved!

394
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,724
Thank God you found us.

395
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,793
We're so glad you picked us up...

396
00:19:04,794 --> 00:19:06,795
- Chris O'Donnell?
- That's right.

397
00:19:06,796 --> 00:19:09,565
And I hope you like turbulence, dildos.

398
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,466
<i> The actual Chris O'Donnell</i>

399
00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:14,002
<i>is not a Coast Guard helicopter pilot.</i>

400
00:19:14,003 --> 00:19:16,346
<i>We assume he's probably too short.</i>

401
00:19:21,148 --> 00:19:22,912
Oh, my God. Brian, are you okay?

402
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:24,280
Yeah, I'm fine.

403
00:19:24,281 --> 00:19:25,647
Annie, are you okay?

404
00:19:25,648 --> 00:19:28,283
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?

405
00:19:28,284 --> 00:19:29,784
What happened to her?

406
00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:31,119
She was hit by, uh...

407
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,954
She was struck by a smooth criminal.

408
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:34,622
That was fun, Mom.

409
00:19:34,623 --> 00:19:37,259
We don't get to do a lot of
that kind of stuff together.

410
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,295
Listen, Brian, we want
you to come home again.

411
00:19:40,296 --> 00:19:43,698
Oh, so the Twitter pariah
is finally welcome home?

412
00:19:43,699 --> 00:19:46,635
No, but the school board hero dog is.

413
00:19:46,636 --> 00:19:48,471
It was all over the papers.

414
00:19:48,472 --> 00:19:51,940
You saved the school $206 from
all the food they recovered

415
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,808
from Principal Shepherd's fridge.

416
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:56,511
So... you really want me to come home?

417
00:19:56,512 --> 00:19:58,613
They're still gonna serve that food?

418
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,743
Of course we do.

419
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:03,519
Hey, where's everyone else?

420
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,954
Oh, my God. Peter, what happened?

421
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,422
<i> What happened? A fair question.</i>

422
00:20:08,423 --> 00:20:10,658
<i>And to answer it, we
have to go back a ways.</i>

423
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:13,045
<i>- Stop doing that thing!</i>
- Aw.

424
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:19,143
Brian, I got to say, it's great
to have you home again, buddy.

425
00:20:19,144 --> 00:20:20,645
Well, it's great to be here.

426
00:20:20,646 --> 00:20:21,980
Living on my own was fun,

427
00:20:21,981 --> 00:20:24,082
but I couldn't stop thinking
about all the stuff

428
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,616
I was missing being away from you guys.

429
00:20:25,617 --> 00:20:27,585
Did you ever finish that banana, Brian?

430
00:20:27,586 --> 00:20:30,688
And, Meg, I hope you learned
your lesson about drinking.

431
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:34,127
Yeah, I think I'd rather
live my life as a loser

432
00:20:34,128 --> 00:20:36,101
than feel bad once in a while.

433
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:38,954
Well, I hope you know
that you're<i> our</i> loser.

434
00:20:38,955 --> 00:20:40,716
Thanks, Mom.

435
00:20:47,957 --> 00:20:50,509
<i> If my life were better here,</i>

436
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:54,497
<i>would I stop searching
for it... up there?</i>

437
