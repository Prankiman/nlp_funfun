<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

2
00:00:04,866 --> 00:00:08,165
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

3
00:00:08,201 --> 00:00:11,915
<i>But where are those
good old-fashioned values</i>

4
00:00:11,951 --> 00:00:14,919
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

5
00:00:14,954 --> 00:00:18,323
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

6
00:00:18,357 --> 00:00:21,691
<i>Lucky there's a man who
positively can do</i>

7
00:00:21,727 --> 00:00:23,318
<i>All the things that make us</i>

8
00:00:23,362 --> 00:00:24,962
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

9
00:00:24,998 --> 00:00:30,335
<i>He's... a... Fam... ily... Guy!</i>

11
00:00:40,199 --> 00:00:42,200
Whoa, whoa, easy, boy, easy.

12
00:00:42,234 --> 00:00:44,702
I-It's just Stewie in a kitty costume.

13
00:00:44,737 --> 00:00:47,171
I'm a calico, and my name is Humphrey.

14
00:00:47,206 --> 00:00:49,307
He got his face painted
at a birthday party.

15
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,542
It was the only thing
this little guy could do.

16
00:00:51,577 --> 00:00:53,344
He was too light
for the caterpillar slide,

17
00:00:53,378 --> 00:00:55,012
too short for the <i>piñata</i>,

18
00:00:55,047 --> 00:00:57,348
and too scared to touch
the animals in the petting zoo.

19
00:00:57,382 --> 00:00:59,584
- Half of them had erections.
- Half of them had erections.

20
00:00:59,618 --> 00:01:00,952
The pony was magnificent.

21
00:01:00,986 --> 00:01:04,188
The pony was magnificent.

22
00:01:04,223 --> 00:01:06,257
- Oh, what do we have here?
- Hey, back off!

23
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:07,458
That's my goodie bag.

24
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,261
Ugh. An eraser.

25
00:01:10,295 --> 00:01:12,997
Raisins in an unsealed sandwich bag.

26
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,699
Oh, a parachute guy.

27
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:17,268
Uhp, he's already tangled.

28
00:01:17,302 --> 00:01:19,036
This day started off so great.

29
00:01:19,071 --> 00:01:21,339
It was awash in cake and pony boners.

30
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:23,574
Now all I have is this dumb whistle.

31
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:24,675
Doesn't even work.

32
00:01:26,845 --> 00:01:28,246
Ow! What the hell?!

33
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,081
Oh, it's a dog whistle.

34
00:01:32,084 --> 00:01:34,252
I've always wondered
what that sounds like to you.

35
00:01:36,021 --> 00:01:38,556
<i>Dog whistle! Dog whistle!</i>

36
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,992
<i>Where are you, dog?!</i>

37
00:01:41,026 --> 00:01:42,226
- Give me that!
- Hey.

38
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:43,594
Oh, what, you want it? Here, take it.

39
00:01:43,629 --> 00:01:45,029
Give it back.

40
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,331
- Give me it.
- No. It's mine now.

41
00:01:47,366 --> 00:01:50,101
In fact, I'm gonna put it
where you can never reach it.

42
00:01:50,135 --> 00:01:51,269
No!

43
00:01:51,303 --> 00:01:53,704
Good luck, shrimp.

44
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:57,809
I can't believe the nerve of that dog.

45
00:01:57,843 --> 00:01:59,811
Teaching me a lesson about size?

46
00:01:59,845 --> 00:02:02,246
I'm not even that small.

47
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:03,981
Tiny Tom Cruise?

48
00:02:04,016 --> 00:02:06,250
Oh, hey, little guy.
Forgot my sunglasses.

49
00:02:06,285 --> 00:02:08,753
Hey, what's with
your gay character names lately?

50
00:02:08,787 --> 00:02:10,655
Stacee Jaxx? Jack Reacher?

51
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:12,223
I mean, who are you playing next?

52
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,692
All right, try to make this sound gay:

53
00:02:14,726 --> 00:02:17,261
next up, I play Headmaster Bates Mann.

54
00:02:17,296 --> 00:02:18,896
- Anything else?
- Actually, yes.

55
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:22,033
After that, I'll be taking
the role of Major Dixon Butts,

56
00:02:22,067 --> 00:02:24,235
then Senator Rod Clutcher.

57
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:35,947
I'm too small, am I, Brian?

58
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:38,482
Well, we'll just see
who's the bigger man.

59
00:02:38,517 --> 00:02:42,486
"Brian, sorry I got testy.
Let's bury the hatchet.

60
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:44,779
"If you're free, I'd love to hear about

61
00:02:44,815 --> 00:02:46,178
any new writing projects
you're working..."

62
00:02:46,179 --> 00:02:48,826
Oh, at least wait for me to send it.

63
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,897
Hey, Stewie, I got your text.
What am I working on?

64
00:02:52,931 --> 00:02:54,932
What am I <i>not</i> working on?

65
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:57,301
Well, first off, I got this
screenplay for Tom Cruise,

66
00:02:57,336 --> 00:03:00,371
about the queen's private
secretary, Sir Gaylord Hummer.

67
00:03:00,405 --> 00:03:02,006
Well, actually, he might do that.

68
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,410
But, Brian, I'm more interested
in <i>short</i> stories.

69
00:03:26,298 --> 00:03:28,900
Well, hello there, little guy.

70
00:03:28,934 --> 00:03:30,468
What the hell did you do to me, Stewie?

71
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,737
Well, Brian, you seemed
to enjoy belittling me,

72
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:34,572
so I decided to belittle you.

73
00:03:34,606 --> 00:03:36,674
I've simply shrunken down
your molecular structure.

74
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,376
It was easy, really.

75
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,946
Like taking candy,
or a whistle, from a baby.

76
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,714
You dick. Undo this.

77
00:03:43,749 --> 00:03:45,349
This is perfect.

78
00:03:45,384 --> 00:03:47,118
I think my excitement is best expressed

79
00:03:47,152 --> 00:03:49,820
by Jean-Claude Van Damme in this scene.

80
00:04:01,934 --> 00:04:04,135
All right, you've made
your point. I'm sorry.

81
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:06,103
I'm sorry I couldn't hear that,
it's too high-pitched.

82
00:04:06,138 --> 00:04:07,505
- You're what?
- I'm sorry.

83
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,340
- For what?
- For calling you a shrimp.

84
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,142
- And?
- What do you mean "and"?

85
00:04:11,176 --> 00:04:13,177
Come on, you know what I want.

86
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,346
And... all four chairs

87
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,982
would totally turn for you on <i>The Voice.</i>

88
00:04:18,016 --> 00:04:19,984
Anything else?

89
00:04:20,018 --> 00:04:22,386
And the way you salute
and point is very casual

90
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:24,522
and free of affectation.

91
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:27,024
Hey, thanks, Bri.
I'll go switch you back.

92
00:04:36,535 --> 00:04:38,336
Stewie!

93
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,704
You know, I'm really flattered you think

94
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,973
all four <i>Voice</i> chairs would turn around.

95
00:04:42,007 --> 00:04:44,408
My dream order would be Adam, Blake,

96
00:04:44,443 --> 00:04:46,444
Alicia Keys, and then Kelly Clarkson,

97
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:48,746
whose chair I imagine would turn last,

98
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,416
'cause she's, uh... she's a bigger gal.

99
00:04:52,451 --> 00:04:54,118
Help!

100
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,054
Oh, crap.

101
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:59,090
Don't worry, Brian, I'll save you!

102
00:04:59,124 --> 00:05:01,392
But I'm a millennial,
so first I have to watch

103
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,961
a YouTube instructional video
on how to do it.

104
00:05:03,996 --> 00:05:05,396
<i>What's going on, guys?</i>

105
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,164
<i>I'm Corey, and today I'm gonna teach you</i>

106
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,166
<i>how to get your friend
out of a rat hole.</i>

107
00:05:09,201 --> 00:05:11,235
<i>Now, before we get started,
don't forget to subscribe</i>

108
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,903
<i>to my channel, Corey's World.</i>

109
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,573
<i>And, guys, I'll get to
as many comments as I can,</i>

110
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,241
but I can't get to all of them.

111
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,076
<i>And don't forget to check out
my other videos,</i>

112
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,578
<i>like "How to Play Guitar."</i>

113
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,613
Uh, Brian, this might be a while.

114
00:05:22,647 --> 00:05:24,815
<i>What's going on, guys? I'm Corey.</i>

115
00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:32,965
Brian! Hang in there, buddy.

116
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,467
Hurry up! Get this rat away from me!

117
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,503
I'll shrink myself down
and come get you.

118
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,305
But in the meantime, they say

119
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,907
if you put your finger in
a rat's butt, that disables it.

120
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,578
It didn't work. Now he's just angry.

121
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,513
Try wetting your finger first.

122
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:50,683
Just get in here!

123
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:04,196
Hey, come on, guy.
Hey, you don't want to do this.

124
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:14,974
I'll have what she's having.

125
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,678
Please tell me that's not the finger

126
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,313
you stuck in a rat's butt.

127
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:24,016
No. It... I don't-I don't
remember which one it was.

128
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,818
Yeah, that was the finger.

129
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:28,988
All right, let's get back
to the machine.

130
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:30,990
Look at all this shag carpet.

131
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:32,992
This is like our Vietnam movie.

132
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:35,127
I miss Jenny.

133
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:38,230
- What is that?
- That's Forrest. Forrest Gump.

134
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:40,399
- Yeah, I-I don't think so.
- Shh.

135
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:43,002
What is that?

136
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:45,838
It ain't a box of chocolates.

137
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,441
Vacuum cleaner!

138
00:06:55,315 --> 00:07:00,052
I hate my life and nobody
can hear me say it right now!

139
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:18,470
Oh, my God, this is disgusting!

140
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:20,172
I just hope she's done vacuuming.

141
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,740
Okay, everyone,

142
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,376
dump your toenails in the hall,
I'm vacuuming.

143
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:26,512
Oh, God.

144
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:35,087
That was close.

145
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:51,303
Oh, my God, we're in the trash outside!

146
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:54,573
We've got to get down from here.
Quick, pass me that baggie.

147
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,448
How am I supposed to get down?
That was the only baggie.

148
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,882
Use either the tampon strings

149
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,719
or the discarded dental floss
and rappel down.

150
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,856
Which one did you go with?

151
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,625
Neither. I was hoping to kill myself.

152
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:19,198
Two days of mail at once, nobody knows.

153
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:22,057
Don't go over two. Don't get greedy.

154
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,104
Uhp, got a bat in the cave.

155
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:27,106
All right, I figure if we can just...

156
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,907
What's going on? An eclipse?

157
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:31,543
- Ah! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Holy crap! What is that?!

158
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,479
- Gross! Oh!
- What is on us? Oh!

159
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,683
Ah! Snot rocket!

160
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,752
Oh, my God, it's so disgusting!

161
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:41,754
Get it off! Get it off!

162
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:44,590
- Are you guys eating that?
- Uh, what?

163
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:47,593
Are you eating this pile of boogers?

164
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:50,529
- Uh, no.
- Can I eat it?

165
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,965
Yeah, please. We're stuck.

166
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:56,368
Dude, dude, you got to get down
here, by the big trash can.

167
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:58,370
Dude, dude, dude, just get here.

168
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:04,543
- Brian, we've got to get up to my room.
- Yeah, but how?

169
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,912
We'll just climb the lattice
on the front of the house.

170
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:11,316
- When did we get that?
- Well, every '80s movie had one,

171
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,752
so the fat man thought
we should have one, too.

172
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:17,256
Wow. Okay, great.

173
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,158
You know, it's funny,
you said "every '80s movie,"

174
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,959
but I can't think of a single one.

175
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:23,128
<i>- Ferris Bueller's Day Off?
- I don't think so.</i>

176
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,597
But the lattice thing
sounded right when you said it.

177
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:28,100
I-I feel like '80s movies
were wall-to-wall lattices.

178
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,969
<i>- Sixteen Candles?
- Hmm... no, no.</i>

179
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:33,105
I mean, she was being ignored
most of the movie.

180
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,673
Who'd be climbing into her window?

181
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,675
Ah, good point. <i>Risky Business?</i>

182
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:37,976
No. Hookers don't climb.

183
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,378
Oh, I know, <i>Home Alone.</i>

184
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,013
<i>Home Alone</i> must've had a lattice.

185
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,182
Maybe, but that was 1990.

186
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:45,084
Eh, it feels like an '80s movie.

187
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,152
You know, it was probably
greenlit in the '80s,

188
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:48,720
when lattices were still a thing.

189
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,389
Oh, wow, here we are.

190
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:58,564
All right, Brian, at this size,
this is a two-man job.

191
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,732
While I adjust the settings,
you go over there

192
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,702
and hit the tiny button to fire it up.

193
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:19,284
Wait a minute.

194
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:21,720
This doesn't feel right.
What button did you hit?

195
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,755
That one. The tiny button.

196
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,625
Wait, did you hit the tiny button

197
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,227
or the button that says "tiny"?

198
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:29,728
I hit the button that says "tiny."

199
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,430
- You said, "Hit the tiny button."
- Exactly!

200
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,899
I didn't say, "Hit the big
button that says 'tiny, '"

201
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,234
I said, "hit the tiny button."

202
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:37,002
The one you pressed
is going to shrink us down

203
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:38,470
to microscopic size!

204
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,405
Well, why would you make
the tiny button big?

205
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,142
I had to make it big enough
to write "tiny" on it!

206
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,347
Well, what the hell do we do now?!

207
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:49,781
I don't...

208
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,517
I-I'm still thinking
about that lattice thing.

209
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:53,051
I want to say <i>Parenthood?</i>

210
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:56,355
<i>Parenthood.</i> Yes.
I feel like <i>Parenthood</i> is right.

211
00:11:17,663 --> 00:11:19,130
It's beautiful.

212
00:11:19,165 --> 00:11:21,733
Ah, I just wish my hot
girlfriend were here to see it.

213
00:11:21,767 --> 00:11:23,568
Oh, yeah? Yeah, you have a girlfriend?

214
00:11:23,602 --> 00:11:27,705
- What's her name?
- Girly... Friendston.

215
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,375
"Girly Friendston"? Nice try, Stewie.

216
00:11:30,409 --> 00:11:32,377
Why won't he answer my texts?

217
00:11:32,411 --> 00:11:34,379
Girly, your piano teacher's here.

218
00:11:34,413 --> 00:11:36,981
- Oh, Mom, do I have to?
- Girly Friendston,

219
00:11:37,016 --> 00:11:39,317
you stop mooning over
that boyfriend of yours

220
00:11:39,351 --> 00:11:42,220
and get down here this instant.

221
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:52,397
Hi. I'm the exterminator.

222
00:11:52,431 --> 00:11:55,600
An ex-Terminator?
So you used to be a Terminator?

223
00:11:55,634 --> 00:11:58,570
- No. I kill rats and bugs.
- And Sarah Connor.

224
00:11:58,604 --> 00:12:01,673
- No, Peter. We have a rat.
- My stuff's in my truck.

225
00:12:01,707 --> 00:12:03,808
I'll be back.

226
00:12:03,842 --> 00:12:05,143
See that, Lois?

227
00:12:05,177 --> 00:12:06,978
There's more Terminators around
than you think there are.

228
00:12:16,021 --> 00:12:17,989
I hope he can terminate

229
00:12:18,023 --> 00:12:21,059
some of the bad attitudes
on our kids, huh?

230
00:12:21,093 --> 00:12:23,228
Yeah.

231
00:12:29,001 --> 00:12:31,236
What's that sound?

232
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,804
Oh, my God! Look!

233
00:12:47,686 --> 00:12:49,954
Holy crap, what the hell
were those things?!

234
00:12:49,989 --> 00:12:51,122
Dust mites.

235
00:12:51,156 --> 00:12:53,891
One of the most dominant species
of the micro world.

236
00:12:53,926 --> 00:12:55,260
Why did they just attack like that?

237
00:12:55,294 --> 00:12:56,661
Because they're jerks.

238
00:12:56,695 --> 00:12:59,464
Aah! Who the hell are you?

239
00:12:59,498 --> 00:13:01,432
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you,
little buddies.

240
00:13:01,467 --> 00:13:03,368
My name's Vernon. I'm a water bear.

241
00:13:03,402 --> 00:13:05,770
A water bear? What's a water bear?

242
00:13:05,804 --> 00:13:07,772
They're predominantly
water-dwelling, eight-legged

243
00:13:07,806 --> 00:13:09,540
segmented micro animals.

244
00:13:09,575 --> 00:13:12,610
They're also known as
a moss piglet or a tardigrade.

245
00:13:12,645 --> 00:13:15,246
You can call me tardy,
but I'm always on time.

246
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:17,248
Ha-ha. Yeah.

247
00:13:26,859 --> 00:13:29,827
Well, here she is. Home sweet home.

248
00:13:29,862 --> 00:13:31,863
Everybody, we've got guests!

249
00:13:35,534 --> 00:13:38,202
You'll see that we have quite
the diverse cast of characters.

250
00:13:38,237 --> 00:13:40,305
I'm the country water bear.

251
00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:43,308
"Yee-haw" is what I say.

252
00:13:43,342 --> 00:13:45,443
Flagellum? I don't even know them.

253
00:13:45,477 --> 00:13:47,011
I'm the black one.

254
00:13:47,046 --> 00:13:50,615
And I'm Patrick Stewart as a water bear.

255
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:52,884
I can't believe there's
this whole universe

256
00:13:52,918 --> 00:13:55,687
hidden here in your rug...
where everyone speaks English.

257
00:13:55,721 --> 00:13:57,055
Okay, Brian, take the ride.

258
00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:00,625
Here, have a sip of water.

259
00:14:01,827 --> 00:14:04,762
What the...? Hey, cut it out!

260
00:14:04,797 --> 00:14:06,831
You have water? Water is life.

261
00:14:06,865 --> 00:14:08,833
Yeah, we need water bad.

262
00:14:08,867 --> 00:14:12,370
And I'm the gay one, but I'm
not, like, doing the gay voice.

263
00:14:12,404 --> 00:14:14,472
Listen, Stewie and I come from a place

264
00:14:14,506 --> 00:14:17,008
where water flows like... well, water.

265
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:18,843
That's right.
And we need to get back there.

266
00:14:18,877 --> 00:14:20,678
And if you guys help us,

267
00:14:20,713 --> 00:14:23,681
we'll make sure you never
want for water again.

268
00:14:23,716 --> 00:14:24,849
What do you say?

269
00:14:24,883 --> 00:14:26,884
All right!

270
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:28,319
Patrick Stewart!

271
00:14:32,358 --> 00:14:34,959
- Well, what'd you find?
- I'll be honest.

272
00:14:34,993 --> 00:14:37,995
I think this is a conversation
best had over dinner.

273
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,932
Oh. Okay.

274
00:14:40,966 --> 00:14:42,667
So what's going on with the house?

275
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:44,736
I don't like talking business
at the table.

276
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:48,106
- Let's just enjoy our wine.
- You're right. I'm sorry.

277
00:14:49,908 --> 00:14:51,342
Your wife's asleep.

278
00:14:51,377 --> 00:14:53,111
Sometimes she fakes it
so I can't hump her,

279
00:14:53,145 --> 00:14:54,946
but this seems legit.

280
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:58,082
So, uh, shouldn't we talk about
what you found at our house?

281
00:14:58,117 --> 00:15:01,652
I don't know. It's so late.
I have a crazy idea.

282
00:15:01,687 --> 00:15:03,688
Should we talk about it over a nightcap?

283
00:15:03,722 --> 00:15:05,656
Uh, sure, I guess.

284
00:15:07,659 --> 00:15:09,694
I'm a little chilly.

285
00:15:09,728 --> 00:15:12,563
Oh, well, I-I guess I don't need this.

286
00:15:15,134 --> 00:15:18,770
Sir? Sir, I asked you what
you found out about the house.

287
00:15:18,804 --> 00:15:21,739
What? Oh. You're gonna
have to tent the house.

288
00:15:21,774 --> 00:15:24,375
All right. Thanks for your work.
You're very professional.

289
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,778
Yeah, that's me. Professional.

290
00:15:26,812 --> 00:15:28,613
Always professional.

291
00:15:29,715 --> 00:15:31,949
And alone.

292
00:15:50,035 --> 00:15:52,136
What the hell is this giant wall?

293
00:15:52,171 --> 00:15:54,739
We're here, Brian. That's your laptop.

294
00:15:54,773 --> 00:15:57,442
If we get inside, I can remotely
hack into the shrink ray.

295
00:16:02,948 --> 00:16:04,949
Oh, my God! It's the dust mites!

296
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:10,788
Oh, no! Water Bear Consuela,
can you stop them?

297
00:16:10,823 --> 00:16:13,925
No, no. I only clean Wednesday.

298
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:17,795
- Can't you just clean today?
- No, no. Wednesday.

299
00:16:23,135 --> 00:16:24,569
Here's the micro board.

300
00:16:24,603 --> 00:16:27,672
I just need to reroute the circuits.

301
00:16:32,644 --> 00:16:35,313
All right. The laptop is now
linked to the shrink ray.

302
00:16:35,347 --> 00:16:37,982
The only problem is that
I can't activate it from here.

303
00:16:38,016 --> 00:16:39,517
We still somehow have to press

304
00:16:39,551 --> 00:16:41,252
the return button on the keyboard.

305
00:16:41,286 --> 00:16:44,088
But at this size, there's no way
I can do it alone.

306
00:16:44,122 --> 00:16:46,257
Wait. I've got an idea.

307
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:49,060
Well, you better act quickly.

308
00:16:51,697 --> 00:16:54,065
Guys! Follow me up this way!

309
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:01,172
Why is there a tiny lattice
inside this computer?

310
00:17:01,206 --> 00:17:04,208
I guess Steve Jobs was
really into '80s movies.

311
00:17:15,554 --> 00:17:17,021
Brian, wait for my signal.

312
00:17:18,023 --> 00:17:19,190
Hold.

313
00:17:20,292 --> 00:17:22,126
Hold.

314
00:17:23,996 --> 00:17:25,062
Hold.

315
00:17:29,201 --> 00:17:31,802
- Now!
- You-you never told me what to do.

316
00:17:31,837 --> 00:17:32,870
- Jump!
- Why?

317
00:17:32,905 --> 00:17:35,873
- Trust me.
- Aah!

318
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,059
My God! It worked!

319
00:17:55,093 --> 00:17:56,427
Stewie, you're a genius!

320
00:17:56,429 --> 00:18:00,197
Oh, no.

321
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:04,235
Run!

322
00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:06,504
Okay. All the gas bombs are set up.

323
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:09,073
Time to blow all those vermin
to kingdom come.

324
00:18:09,107 --> 00:18:10,675
Can I press the button?

325
00:18:10,709 --> 00:18:14,645
Hmm, perhaps that's a question
best pondered over dinner?

326
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,948
You-you can just press it. Go ahead.

327
00:18:24,723 --> 00:18:26,490
Aah! Poison gas!

328
00:18:26,525 --> 00:18:28,593
They must've gotten
an exterminator for the rat!

329
00:18:47,312 --> 00:18:49,580
Tiny Tom Cruise?

330
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,069
Thank you, Tiny Tom Cruise.
How can we ever repay you?

331
00:19:12,104 --> 00:19:13,771
Well, you could make a sizable donation

332
00:19:13,805 --> 00:19:15,139
to the Church of Spaceship Beep Boop.

333
00:19:15,173 --> 00:19:16,707
You mean the Church of...

334
00:19:16,742 --> 00:19:18,309
Yeah, kidnapping, torture,
extortion, that's the one.

335
00:19:18,343 --> 00:19:19,977
And we won't get in trouble

336
00:19:20,012 --> 00:19:22,213
because we didn't use the actual name.

337
00:19:22,247 --> 00:19:23,581
<i>What did he just say?</i>

338
00:19:23,615 --> 00:19:27,151
<i>We are about love and
spaceships and beep boop!</i>

339
00:19:27,185 --> 00:19:29,253
<i>Get my lawyer on the phone!</i>

340
00:19:29,287 --> 00:19:32,156
- You have children in there?!
- Oh, yeah, three.

341
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,025
Should-should we have mentioned that?

342
00:19:37,829 --> 00:19:41,832
Meg, Chris, come to the light.

343
00:19:41,867 --> 00:19:44,035
Meg, no. Don't do it.

344
00:19:44,069 --> 00:19:45,636
Don't go to Prince!

345
00:19:45,671 --> 00:19:47,805
Come to the purple light, Meg.

346
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,640
Come taste infinity.

347
00:19:49,675 --> 00:19:51,542
Don't listen to him, Meg.

348
00:19:51,576 --> 00:19:55,513
But he's so talented
and he's got so many drugs.

349
00:19:55,547 --> 00:19:57,548
Alan Thicke is here, too.

350
00:19:57,582 --> 00:20:00,351
Hey, guys. Come on in. It's a hoot.

351
00:20:00,385 --> 00:20:02,953
I'm coming, Alan Thicke.

352
00:20:02,988 --> 00:20:04,355
No!

353
00:20:04,389 --> 00:20:07,224
Google my CrystaLight
aerobics competition.

354
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:09,260
It's ridiculous.

355
00:20:15,975 --> 00:20:18,076
I hope Vernon and the gang survived.

356
00:20:18,111 --> 00:20:19,578
That gas was pretty powerful.

357
00:20:19,612 --> 00:20:22,013
Well, let's take a look.

358
00:20:28,315 --> 00:20:31,251
They're okay.
Let's deliver on our promise.

359
00:20:31,285 --> 00:20:33,653
A little water for our little friends.

360
00:20:40,327 --> 00:20:43,229
- Oh, hell no!
- Set country music!

361
00:20:43,264 --> 00:20:45,832
Oh, my gay God.

362
00:20:48,436 --> 00:20:51,438
Ah, they're dead. Now I'm sad.

363
00:20:51,472 --> 00:20:54,074
Cheer me up, Jean-Claude Van Damme.

364
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:04,349
