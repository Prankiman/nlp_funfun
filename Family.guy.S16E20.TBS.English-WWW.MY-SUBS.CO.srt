- Peter, you're not even dressed.
- For what?

12
00:00:38,322 --> 00:00:40,490
Chris's class is performing
a rock and roll choir.

13
00:00:40,491 --> 00:00:42,325
They've been practicing for months.

14
00:00:42,326 --> 00:00:44,327
"For months," or "four months"?

15
00:00:44,328 --> 00:00:46,163
For months. Three months.

16
00:00:46,164 --> 00:00:47,831
Not long enough. Pass.

17
00:00:47,832 --> 00:00:49,366
I just wish we were doing songs

18
00:00:49,367 --> 00:00:52,169
that weren't so hard to sing as a group.

00:01:11,389 --> 00:01:12,556
All right, <i>Stripes.</i>

29
00:01:12,557 --> 00:01:14,191
Ah, this was hilarious.

30
00:01:14,192 --> 00:01:16,126
All right, Bill Murray's driving a cab.

31
00:01:16,127 --> 00:01:18,061
Still driving a cab.

32
00:01:18,062 --> 00:01:20,197
Shot of the town.

33
00:01:20,198 --> 00:01:23,033
Going over a bridge.

34
00:01:23,034 --> 00:01:24,634
Traffic's neither heavy nor light.

35
00:01:24,635 --> 00:01:26,303
Get in the Army!

36
00:01:26,304 --> 00:01:28,305
I hope you don't plan
on just lying on the couch

37
00:01:28,306 --> 00:01:30,240
and watching TV all weekend.

38
00:01:30,241 --> 00:01:32,108
That's exactly what I plan to do.

39
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:34,244
It's a free premium channel
preview weekend.

40
00:01:34,245 --> 00:01:35,812
Even Cinemax.

41
00:01:35,813 --> 00:01:38,548
One of the shows is actually
two boobs fighting.

42
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:40,450
Sadly, there's still no penetration.

43
00:01:40,451 --> 00:01:42,452
Well, just expect me to do

44
00:01:42,453 --> 00:01:44,921
a lot of sour-faced,
arms-folded head shaking.

45
00:01:46,257 --> 00:01:47,958
Well, in return,

46
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:50,260
you'll get a lot of
beaten-down husband eye-rolls.

47
00:01:56,567 --> 00:01:57,968
One of the neighbors called about

48
00:01:57,969 --> 00:02:00,837
a passive-aggressive domestic dispute.

49
00:02:00,838 --> 00:02:02,505
Ooh, is that <i>Stripes?</i>

50
00:02:02,506 --> 00:02:05,008
Eh, he's not in the Army yet.

51
00:02:06,844 --> 00:02:08,345
Peter, this is ridiculous.

52
00:02:08,346 --> 00:02:09,980
You've been lying here all weekend.

53
00:02:09,981 --> 00:02:12,415
I'm not bringing you any more food.

54
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,484
I don't need you to.
I got a thousand dollar credit

55
00:02:14,485 --> 00:02:17,020
from Uber Eats 'cause
that driver pinched my bottom.

56
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:20,290
Okay, well if you don't get up,
I won't have sex with you.

57
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:22,459
And that will be different how...?

58
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,828
And I'm still married to you because...?

59
00:02:25,997 --> 00:02:29,199
Guys, second time this week.

60
00:02:33,771 --> 00:02:35,505
Peter, you got to come outside.

61
00:02:35,506 --> 00:02:37,340
We found a used condom on the sidewalk.

62
00:02:37,341 --> 00:02:39,542
That's a bigger deal
than regular garbage.

63
00:02:39,543 --> 00:02:41,611
Ribbed. A woman was pleased with it.

64
00:02:41,612 --> 00:02:42,779
You got to see this, Peter.

65
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,947
A used condom.

66
00:02:43,948 --> 00:02:45,048
Just right out here.

67
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:46,616
And there's panties nearby.

68
00:02:46,617 --> 00:02:47,684
Joe, you're a cop.

69
00:02:47,685 --> 00:02:48,785
What do you think happened here?

70
00:02:48,786 --> 00:02:50,120
I'll tell you what happened.

71
00:02:50,121 --> 00:02:51,788
Somebody did it.

72
00:02:51,789 --> 00:02:53,657
Yeah!

73
00:02:53,658 --> 00:02:55,492
Peter, come out here and high five us

74
00:02:55,493 --> 00:02:57,294
over the sex someone else had.

75
00:02:57,295 --> 00:02:58,962
Someone had sex?

76
00:02:58,963 --> 00:03:01,731
I got to touch another guy's
hand to celebrate.

77
00:03:14,845 --> 00:03:17,948
Oh, <i>now</i> he gets to the Army.

78
00:03:20,518 --> 00:03:22,686
Hmm. I've seen this before.

79
00:03:22,687 --> 00:03:25,155
It's from Ethan Allen,
if I'm not mistaken.

80
00:03:25,156 --> 00:03:27,357
- Am I gonna be okay?
- You'll be fine.

81
00:03:27,358 --> 00:03:29,592
Here's a video to help you understand.

82
00:03:33,164 --> 00:03:36,866
<i>Hi, I'm Oliver Platt, and I'm
currently fused to this chair.</i>

83
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:38,435
<i>But how does it happen?</i>

84
00:03:38,436 --> 00:03:40,103
<i>When a fat guy's sweaty skin</i>

85
00:03:40,104 --> 00:03:41,604
<i>presses against couch fabric</i>

86
00:03:41,605 --> 00:03:43,373
for an extended period of time,

87
00:03:43,374 --> 00:03:46,509
<i>the fabric fibers
fuse together with the skin.</i>

88
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,013
<i>The longer you stay sedentary,
the stronger the bond.</i>

89
00:03:50,014 --> 00:03:51,381
<i>My advice: relax.</i>

90
00:03:51,382 --> 00:03:52,949
<i>It's not the end of the world.</i>

91
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,352
<i>Being fused to furniture
hasn't stopped me</i>

92
00:03:55,353 --> 00:03:57,187
<i>from being an adult with a child's name.</i>

93
00:03:57,188 --> 00:04:00,190
<i>And having thicker hair than a werewolf.</i>

94
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:02,859
The procedure is called
"Rip You Off Real Fast."

95
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,861
Very painful. Ready?

96
00:04:04,862 --> 00:04:07,097
Actually, I've decided
to keep the couch on me.

97
00:04:07,098 --> 00:04:08,865
Really? Are you sure?

98
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:10,433
Oh, yeah. This is nothing.

99
00:04:10,434 --> 00:04:11,968
I've been in uncomfortable
situations before.

100
00:04:11,969 --> 00:04:14,804
Like, whenever I meet famous people.

101
00:04:14,805 --> 00:04:17,774
Hey, what's up? I'm Snoop Dogg,
know what I'm saying?

102
00:04:17,775 --> 00:04:19,376
I do.

103
00:04:19,377 --> 00:04:22,212
<i>But you don't, Peter, you don't.</i>

104
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,650
How is it? Is-a good?

105
00:04:27,651 --> 00:04:28,752
Eh, it's a little tight.

106
00:04:28,753 --> 00:04:30,320
A little tight in-a the couch?

107
00:04:30,321 --> 00:04:32,088
Yeah, it's a little tight in the couch.

108
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:33,556
Hey, what's it like going through life

109
00:04:33,557 --> 00:04:34,958
holding needles in your lips?

110
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,393
Is-a not easy.

111
00:04:36,394 --> 00:04:38,061
Some-a time-a the needle,
they poke-a my lip,

112
00:04:38,062 --> 00:04:39,629
and I say-a, "Mamma mia!"

113
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,498
Well, you still got
James Brolin coming in here,

114
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:42,599
autographing your photos.

115
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,767
That's kind of cool.

116
00:04:43,768 --> 00:04:45,068
You want to know something, a-Peter?

117
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:46,436
He no come in here.

118
00:04:46,437 --> 00:04:49,005
I take-a the photo
from the dry cleaner's.

119
00:04:49,006 --> 00:04:50,473
Mamma mia, what a day.

120
00:04:50,474 --> 00:04:51,975
And now to say good night

121
00:04:51,976 --> 00:04:55,078
to all-a my celebrity pictures
on-a the wall.

122
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:57,013
<i>Buona notte, Christopher Plummer.</i>

123
00:04:57,014 --> 00:05:00,116
Sleep-a with the angels,
Sherman-a Hemsley.

124
00:05:00,117 --> 00:05:02,752
See you when-a the sun shine, Ken Ober.

125
00:05:02,753 --> 00:05:06,156
And now, to say good night
to my favorite-a celebrity,

126
00:05:06,157 --> 00:05:08,691
James-a Brol... mamma mia!

127
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:10,527
Who steal-a my James Brolin?

128
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:13,096
I take-a that photo from the bakery.

129
00:05:13,097 --> 00:05:15,532
Pasta fazool,
what a good day in-a the bakery.

130
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:17,333
You take-a good care of the place

131
00:05:17,334 --> 00:05:19,302
while I'm-a gone, William-a Katt.

132
00:05:19,303 --> 00:05:24,240
That goes a-double for you,
James-a Brol... mamma mia!

133
00:05:28,045 --> 00:05:29,979
Uh, hey, Mom?

134
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,616
Was I always able to see the
living room from the kitchen?

135
00:05:33,617 --> 00:05:35,318
I've had enough of this.

136
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:37,787
That stupid couch
is messing up our house.

137
00:05:37,788 --> 00:05:39,622
If Peter won't let
Dr. Hartman remove it,

138
00:05:39,623 --> 00:05:41,224
we're doing it ourselves.

139
00:05:41,225 --> 00:05:43,827
I put an Ambien in his beer,
so he's out cold.

140
00:05:43,828 --> 00:05:46,062
I saw you put Ambien in <i>your</i> beer, too.

141
00:05:46,063 --> 00:05:48,731
Every adult has
to take Ambien every night

142
00:05:48,732 --> 00:05:51,367
to even have a prayer at sleep.

143
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:56,973
All right, kids,
we're gonna use these scissors

144
00:05:56,974 --> 00:05:59,809
to separate your father from the couch.

145
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,711
I can't tell skin from couch.

146
00:06:01,712 --> 00:06:03,213
Well, err on the skin side.

147
00:06:03,214 --> 00:06:05,014
I love this couch.

148
00:06:05,015 --> 00:06:06,916
It's from Ethan Allen, you know.

149
00:06:10,387 --> 00:06:12,222
Wha...?

150
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,823
W-What-what's going on?

151
00:06:13,824 --> 00:06:16,493
Peter, enough is enough,
that couch is coming off.

152
00:06:16,494 --> 00:06:18,394
We're sick of your shenanigans.

153
00:06:18,395 --> 00:06:20,730
How dare you?

154
00:06:20,731 --> 00:06:23,166
I work my ass off to bring home
the bacon for this family,

155
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:25,034
and all you can say is,
"We don't want bacon,

156
00:06:25,035 --> 00:06:26,669
we want actual money!"

157
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,506
Well, I don't have money,
I spent it all on bacon!

158
00:06:29,507 --> 00:06:31,341
Peter, put yourself in our shoes.

159
00:06:31,342 --> 00:06:34,010
I can't. My feet swelled up
too much from all the bacon.

160
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:35,879
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to sleep

161
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,614
on the couch on the couch.

162
00:06:57,601 --> 00:06:59,636
Chris, give me a hand with this.

163
00:06:59,637 --> 00:07:01,271
All right, you ready?

164
00:07:01,272 --> 00:07:03,973
All right, one, two, three.

165
00:07:03,974 --> 00:07:05,575
- Okay, uh, easy, easy, easy...
- Uh... uh...

166
00:07:05,576 --> 00:07:07,410
- Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.
- Okay, all right.

167
00:07:07,411 --> 00:07:08,811
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

168
00:07:08,812 --> 00:07:10,280
- Stop, stop.
- What? What?

169
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:12,248
- No, no, no, no, no. Twist it.
- What? I am.

170
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:14,150
Just look down, all right?
Just-just look at me,

171
00:07:14,151 --> 00:07:15,985
look what I'm doing. All right,
see the way I'm twisting it?

172
00:07:15,986 --> 00:07:18,321
- Okay, ju... No, no, no, no, no.
- Okay. Wait... what?

173
00:07:18,322 --> 00:07:20,456
You know what? All right, just...
Hang... just put-put it down.

174
00:07:20,457 --> 00:07:22,559
- Put it down. Just drop it, drop it.
- All right. All right.

175
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,129
All right, let's... Let's just
hang on and figure this out.

176
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,231
All-all right, okay.

177
00:07:28,232 --> 00:07:30,066
All right. Okay. I-I got it.
I know what we're gonna...

178
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:31,668
Okay, okay. All right, y-you...
We... here's what we're gonna do,

179
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:33,303
We're gonna take the cushions off,

180
00:07:33,304 --> 00:07:35,405
unscrew the legs, take the mattress out,

181
00:07:35,406 --> 00:07:37,273
and this whole thing's
gonna be a lot simpler.

182
00:07:37,274 --> 00:07:39,642
It's easier than we're making it.

183
00:07:39,643 --> 00:07:41,611
This isn't working.

184
00:07:41,612 --> 00:07:43,346
You know what? Just give me a push.

185
00:07:54,592 --> 00:07:56,092
I have some bad news.

186
00:07:56,093 --> 00:07:58,761
Ethan survived,
but Allen didn't make it.

187
00:07:58,762 --> 00:08:00,663
- What about Peter?
- Oh, him.

188
00:08:00,664 --> 00:08:02,665
He's in what we call a comma.

189
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,000
Now, where's his chart?

190
00:08:04,001 --> 00:08:06,836
Ah, here it is. "Griffin coma Peter."

191
00:08:06,837 --> 00:08:08,838
Will he ever recover?

192
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,540
How long is he gonna be like this?

193
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:13,042
Please tell me he's gonna be okay...

194
00:08:25,456 --> 00:08:26,723
Oh, God.

195
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,067
God?

196
00:08:38,068 --> 00:08:39,135
Yes.

197
00:08:39,136 --> 00:08:40,670
And no Trump questions.

198
00:08:40,671 --> 00:08:42,338
Okay.

199
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,742
I have nothing else to ask you.

200
00:08:51,987 --> 00:08:54,989
I can't believe I'm stuck
in an elevator with God.

201
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,792
Although, I guess you are
everywhere, and in all places.

202
00:08:57,793 --> 00:08:59,060
No, you're thinking of Kevin Hart.

203
00:08:59,061 --> 00:09:00,261
Ha! I know, right?

204
00:09:00,262 --> 00:09:01,329
I-In every movie.

205
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,397
Him and The Rock.

206
00:09:02,398 --> 00:09:03,664
Oh, I love The Rock.

207
00:09:03,665 --> 00:09:05,233
No, no, no, I love The Rock, too.

208
00:09:05,234 --> 00:09:07,769
He's just-he's just in a lot of stuff.

209
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,437
You know, his real name
is Dwayne Johnson.

210
00:09:09,438 --> 00:09:10,705
Yeah, I know.

211
00:09:10,706 --> 00:09:12,273
We have <i>Us Weekly</i> on Earth, too.

212
00:09:12,274 --> 00:09:14,242
Wait, why are you here?

213
00:09:14,243 --> 00:09:15,643
Shouldn't you be up in heaven?

214
00:09:15,644 --> 00:09:16,744
There was an issue.

215
00:09:16,745 --> 00:09:18,413
Uh, a-a few angels came forward.

216
00:09:18,414 --> 00:09:20,581
I don't remember things
exactly as they do,

217
00:09:20,582 --> 00:09:24,018
but I respect their experience.

218
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:25,820
How did I get here?

219
00:09:25,821 --> 00:09:27,622
Well, you had a couch
attached to your back,

220
00:09:27,623 --> 00:09:30,291
and you fell down the stairs
and hit your head pretty hard.

221
00:09:30,292 --> 00:09:31,793
Am I in a <i>Leftovers?</i>

222
00:09:31,794 --> 00:09:32,960
Is this a <i>Leftovers?</i>

223
00:09:32,961 --> 00:09:34,462
I don't know what that is.

224
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,532
It was an HBO show starring
a bottle of hair dye.

225
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,334
Man, this thing is really stuck.

226
00:09:40,335 --> 00:09:42,870
Hey, can you use
your God powers to get us out?

227
00:09:42,871 --> 00:09:44,372
No, they don't really work in elevators.

228
00:09:44,373 --> 00:09:45,606
Kind of like a cell phone.

229
00:09:45,607 --> 00:09:46,774
I don't have a signal.

230
00:09:46,775 --> 00:09:47,809
I have a cell phone.

231
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:48,943
It's silver.

232
00:09:48,944 --> 00:09:50,912
That's rad, Peter.

233
00:09:52,781 --> 00:09:56,184
I always dreamed of being stuck
in an elevator with Tom Brady.

234
00:09:56,185 --> 00:09:57,718
That makes two of us.

235
00:09:57,719 --> 00:09:59,854
Can I ask you my Tom Brady questions?

236
00:09:59,855 --> 00:10:02,023
I wouldn't deign to speak for Tom Brady.

237
00:10:02,024 --> 00:10:04,559
Understood, understood.

238
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,728
- Hey, do atheists go to hell?
- No.

239
00:10:07,729 --> 00:10:09,730
How about people who say
they are not religious,

240
00:10:09,731 --> 00:10:11,466
but they are spiritual?

241
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:13,167
Straight to hell,
to the boiler room of hell.

242
00:10:13,168 --> 00:10:15,002
All the way down.

243
00:10:15,003 --> 00:10:16,337
Sometimes, I pull them out

244
00:10:16,338 --> 00:10:17,705
just so they think everything
is gonna be okay,

245
00:10:17,706 --> 00:10:19,373
but then, I put them right back in.

246
00:10:19,374 --> 00:10:21,075
Good, good.

247
00:10:21,076 --> 00:10:22,910
That makes me happy.

248
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:26,247
Um, God, here's something
you might be able to tell me.

249
00:10:26,248 --> 00:10:27,849
Will Taylor Swift and Katy Perry

250
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,819
ever reconcile their differences?

251
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,154
What are you looking for?

252
00:10:33,155 --> 00:10:34,989
Oh, I'm sorry,
I'm looking for the gay guy

253
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,390
who can answer that one.

254
00:10:38,327 --> 00:10:41,195
Some people say we're just
a computer simulation

255
00:10:41,196 --> 00:10:43,030
run by a higher species.

256
00:10:43,031 --> 00:10:45,199
- Is that true?
- It is.

257
00:10:47,703 --> 00:10:49,237
My guy sucks.

258
00:10:49,238 --> 00:10:51,272
Want to trade guys for a little while?

259
00:10:51,273 --> 00:10:53,207
Oh, never mind.

260
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:56,511
I'll stick with this pile
of crap I already have.

261
00:10:56,512 --> 00:11:00,181
All right, can you name every
<i>SNL</i> actor alphabetically?

262
00:11:00,182 --> 00:11:02,416
- Alphabetically by last name?
- Yes.

263
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:04,519
- And no featured players?
- Yeah, okay.

264
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,889
Fred Armisen, Dan Aykroyd,
Morwenna Banks, Vanessa Bayer...

265
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,358
Jon Lovitz, Norm Macdonald,
Gail Matthius...

266
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:11,692
Gail Matthius, good pull.

267
00:11:11,693 --> 00:11:13,561
Michael McKean, Mark McKinney...

268
00:11:13,562 --> 00:11:17,064
Nancy Walls, Kristen Wiig,
and Sasheer Zamata.

269
00:11:17,065 --> 00:11:19,534
Wow. Now do <i>Kids in the Hall.</i>

270
00:11:19,535 --> 00:11:21,369
That was five guys, Peter.

271
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,004
- Name 'em.
- I can't.

272
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,140
Does reincarnation exist?

273
00:11:26,141 --> 00:11:27,441
It does.

274
00:11:27,442 --> 00:11:29,544
As past human lives or as animals?

275
00:11:29,545 --> 00:11:31,379
- Both.
- Who have I been?

276
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,214
- You were Henry the Eighth.
- Wow!

277
00:11:33,215 --> 00:11:36,083
Let me finish. You were Henry,
the eighth guy to have sex

278
00:11:36,084 --> 00:11:38,219
with Rock Hudson
at one of his pool parties.

279
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,221
Aww.

280
00:11:40,222 --> 00:11:42,657
How many more shows is
John Stamos gonna get?

281
00:11:42,658 --> 00:11:46,594
- Zero.
- Good. That's... That's good.

282
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,733
Are you real?

283
00:11:52,734 --> 00:11:54,402
Do you think I'm real, Peter?

284
00:11:54,403 --> 00:11:57,572
I like to believe there's
something bigger than me

285
00:11:57,573 --> 00:11:59,240
out there keeping a watch out.

286
00:11:59,241 --> 00:12:01,142
Different people think different things.

287
00:12:01,143 --> 00:12:02,910
I'm kind of like a nanny cam.

288
00:12:02,911 --> 00:12:04,946
The idea that I <i>may</i> exist is enough

289
00:12:04,947 --> 00:12:06,914
for some people to behave better.

290
00:12:06,915 --> 00:12:10,585
When I used to ask my mom
what God was, she would say,

291
00:12:10,586 --> 00:12:13,754
"God is love." I always liked that.

292
00:12:13,755 --> 00:12:15,156
That's nice, Peter.

293
00:12:15,157 --> 00:12:17,592
God and love are very similar concepts.

294
00:12:17,593 --> 00:12:19,760
- They come from the same place.
- Tatooine?

295
00:12:19,761 --> 00:12:23,431
Ha! I always forget
you're such a <i>Star Wars</i> guy.

296
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,268
Man, when are they gonna fix
this elevator?

297
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:30,871
It's not broken. I just haven't
decided where it's going yet.

298
00:12:34,109 --> 00:12:36,544
What's a "mezzanine"?

299
00:12:36,545 --> 00:12:38,946
- It's like a loge.
- What's a "loge"?

300
00:12:38,947 --> 00:12:40,781
Oh, hey, what's with all the questions?

301
00:12:40,782 --> 00:12:43,050
Yeah, you don't know either.

302
00:12:43,051 --> 00:12:44,518
W-Wait, hold on.

303
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:48,055
- Am I... Am I dead?
- Yes.

304
00:12:48,056 --> 00:12:50,191
Oh, my God!

305
00:12:50,192 --> 00:12:52,526
Since you're now a ghost,
would you like to do pottery

306
00:12:52,527 --> 00:12:54,462
while straddling present-day Demi Moore?

307
00:12:54,463 --> 00:12:56,631
- Pass.
- Yeah.

308
00:12:56,632 --> 00:12:58,666
Not getting a lot of takers
for that one.

309
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:00,534
I feel like the bones in her back

310
00:13:00,535 --> 00:13:02,470
would hurt my tummy.

311
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,849
Am I... Am I really dead?

312
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,030
Well, if you weren't dead,

313
00:13:09,031 --> 00:13:10,998
would you feel nothing when I do <i>this?</i>

314
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,833
Ah! Son of a bitch!

315
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,268
Oh, you know what?
That's right, it takes a day.

316
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:15,569
M-My bad. Sorry.

317
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,071
Tomorrow I do that, you feel nothing.

318
00:13:17,072 --> 00:13:18,406
But trust me, you're dead.

319
00:13:18,407 --> 00:13:20,374
But I can't be. Hold on, give me a sec.

320
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:26,781
I can't be dead.
I have a family who needs me.

321
00:13:26,782 --> 00:13:28,382
Actually, Peter, from what I've seen,

322
00:13:28,383 --> 00:13:30,952
I think your family would be
better off without you.

323
00:13:30,953 --> 00:13:32,787
What? What do you mean?

324
00:13:32,788 --> 00:13:34,355
Well, you're an inattentive husband

325
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:35,690
and a terrible parent.

326
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:37,391
Oh, says Father of the Year.

327
00:13:37,392 --> 00:13:39,360
Oh, please. He played that
for all it was worth.

328
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:41,028
"Why has thou forsaken me?"

329
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,763
You know what? I did him a favor.

330
00:13:42,764 --> 00:13:44,532
Okay, well, th-there's a lot
to unpack there.

331
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,801
But come on, God, you gotta
give me another chance.

332
00:13:46,802 --> 00:13:49,603
I'll show you how good a husband
and father I can be.

333
00:13:49,604 --> 00:13:52,039
Are you asking for a second chance?

334
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,607
I-I guess so.

335
00:13:53,608 --> 00:13:56,544
Huh. No one's ever done that.

336
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:58,212
You know what? You're on.

337
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,047
I'll give you one day to prove to me

338
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,983
that your family is better off
with you alive.

339
00:14:01,984 --> 00:14:05,119
I'll return you to your life
before you were in a coma.

340
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,254
Thanks, God! I know I can do it.

341
00:14:07,255 --> 00:14:09,290
I've faced bigger challenges.

342
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,093
Like when I recorded that
Russian language album.

343
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,998
♪

344
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:35,016
♪ <i>Vodka!</i> ♪

345
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:44,325
Okay, kids. I know how you
always wanted kittens,

346
00:14:44,326 --> 00:14:46,193
so guess what I brought home?

347
00:14:46,194 --> 00:14:48,262
This very pregnant, about-to-burst,

348
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:50,031
distended-nipples street cat.

349
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:55,269
Peter, you can't bring home a feral cat.

350
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,338
She doesn't want to be
around people right now.

351
00:14:57,339 --> 00:14:59,607
She needs a quiet space
to have her kittens.

352
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,475
Yeah, so everyone gather 'round close.

353
00:15:01,476 --> 00:15:03,944
Her name is Sophie,
and she's fully dilated.

354
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,780
Chris!

355
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:08,282
She doesn't like that, but
I understand the instinct.

356
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:10,818
Now, we all need to do our part
to help with the birth.

357
00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:12,453
Meg, boil some water.

358
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:13,988
Brian, get some clean rags.

359
00:15:13,989 --> 00:15:15,389
Chris, blankets.

360
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,158
Stewie, Band-Aids for me.

361
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:19,126
Isn't it nice that we're
spending this time together

362
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,628
as a family?

363
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:23,931
Let's go spend it in the ER.

364
00:15:30,906 --> 00:15:33,841
Well, look at us.
Out for a fun family dinner.

365
00:15:33,842 --> 00:15:36,644
If anyone's watching, they'd
say, "Look at that family."

366
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:38,312
Look how happy they are."

367
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:40,581
Well, the kids do love Fuddruckers.

368
00:15:40,582 --> 00:15:42,516
Yeah, getting to design
any burger you want?

369
00:15:42,517 --> 00:15:45,052
Your only limit is your imagination.

370
00:15:45,053 --> 00:15:46,587
What kind you make there
for yourself, Chris?

371
00:15:46,588 --> 00:15:47,988
- Plain.
- Plain?

372
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,590
What do you mean "plain"?

373
00:15:49,591 --> 00:15:51,992
It's a plain burger.
That's how I like them.

374
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,495
That's not a burger,
that's just a meat sandwich.

375
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:56,831
At least Meg went wild
and got a beige burger.

376
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:58,332
No, I got chicken.

377
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,868
What? Here? This is Fuddruckers.

378
00:16:00,869 --> 00:16:02,937
What... what part of Fuddruckers
don't you understand?

379
00:16:02,938 --> 00:16:04,238
All of it.

380
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:05,406
All right, let's start this again.

381
00:16:05,407 --> 00:16:06,774
You're all gonna get up,

382
00:16:06,775 --> 00:16:08,909
go back up to that
toppings bar, and go nuts.

383
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,911
But it tastes good like this.

384
00:16:10,912 --> 00:16:13,380
It's not supposed to taste good.
It's supposed to look crazy.

385
00:16:13,381 --> 00:16:14,548
What the hell are you doing?

386
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:16,450
I'm cutting it. It's easier to eat.

387
00:16:16,451 --> 00:16:18,018
It's not supposed to be easy to eat.

388
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,887
Half of it is supposed
to fall onto your plate

389
00:16:19,888 --> 00:16:22,256
when you squeeze it, and the
rest goes onto your shirt.

390
00:16:22,257 --> 00:16:23,591
How's everything going over here?

391
00:16:23,592 --> 00:16:25,192
Terrible! Go away!

392
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:27,394
See, look, now I have to be
even more ridiculous

393
00:16:27,395 --> 00:16:29,396
to make up for what you guys
aren't doing.

394
00:16:29,397 --> 00:16:32,299
Silverware? Put them on.
Salt shaker? Whatever.

395
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,368
Ice from soda, get on that burger.

396
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:35,970
Peter, people are staring.

397
00:16:35,971 --> 00:16:38,105
Yeah, they're saying,
"Look at the creative guy.

398
00:16:38,106 --> 00:16:39,874
"Look at King Fuddrucker over there.

399
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,575
"Usually you put a burger on a tray.

400
00:16:41,576 --> 00:16:43,978
This guy's putting a tray
on a (BLEEP) burger!"

401
00:16:43,979 --> 00:16:45,479
Are you through, Peter?

402
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,214
Not yet, I'm not. Give me the car keys.

403
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:50,184
- Peter...
- Give me... the car keys.

404
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:56,290
That's Fuddruckers.

405
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:58,959
Peter, you've opened the trunk.

406
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,928
People are pulling things
out of our car.

407
00:17:00,929 --> 00:17:03,430
Good. That's also Fuddruckers...
Get used to it.

408
00:17:03,431 --> 00:17:05,833
And prepare to fish my teeth
out of my stool.

409
00:17:05,834 --> 00:17:08,402
- Peter, enough.
- You guys clearly don't get it.

410
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:11,071
I'm sure when you explain
what we're supposed to get,

411
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:12,406
we'll get it.

412
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:17,678
Those poor kids. Those poor babies.

413
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,947
Hey, Chris, what do you got there?

414
00:17:19,948 --> 00:17:21,315
A plain burger.

415
00:17:21,316 --> 00:17:23,217

Yeah. We all saw that, Peter.

Come on, kids. Let's go inside.

429

Before you go,
there's something I want to say.

If anything were to happen to me, Lois,

it kills me that I'll never see
you become a man... loving twink.

Is anyone gonna stop him?

00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:51,171
And, Chris, whenever you're
feeling defeated,

441

Peter, what's going on?
Why are you saying these things?

Sorry. W-Why don't you guys go inside?

447
00:19:07,122 --> 00:19:09,256
I'm gonna stay out here and

I'm supposed to get her

453
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,308
a week from Thursday,
but I may be moving that up.

454
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:30,277
I suppose you know why I'm here.

455
00:19:30,278 --> 00:19:32,313
Yeah. I guess so.

456
00:19:32,314 --> 00:19:34,248
It's weird. For the first seven days,

457
00:19:34,249 --> 00:19:36,784
all I did was create things,
but since then,

458
00:19:36,785 --> 00:19:38,319
it's just killing, killing, killing.

459
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,953
Well, go ahead and do it.

460
00:19:39,954 --> 00:19:41,889
My family would be better off
without me.

461
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,725
I'm a terrible husband
and a terrible father.

I should never have questioned you.

You were right about everything.

Say that again.

465
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:54,335
You were right about everything.

466
00:19:54,336 --> 00:19:56,503
That's all I needed to hear.

467
00:19:58,673 --> 00:19:59,973
That's what religion is.

468
00:19:59,974 --> 00:20:01,742
It's not about being good or bad.

469
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:05,346
It's just blind subservience
to an imaginary being.

470
00:20:05,347 --> 00:20:07,247
So, I'm not gonna die?

471
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,949
Nope, not for another four years.

472
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,250
Thank you, God!

473
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:13,821
Bless you, my child... pornography fan.

474
00:20:13,822 --> 00:20:15,189
You did it to me.

475
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,691
- Can I use that one on my son?
- Sure.

476
00:20:19,127 --> 00:20:21,428
Hey, Chris, you like
pictures of naked children

477
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:23,030
because you're gross and weird.

478
00:20:23,031 --> 00:20:25,032
Ah, he screwed it up.

479
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,671
And I'm sorry about Fuddruckers.

480
00:20:32,672 --> 00:20:34,072
It won't happen again.

481
00:20:34,073 --> 00:20:37,342
Because nothing means more to me
than my family.

482
00:20:37,343 --> 00:20:40,779
Oh, Peter. That's wonderful.
What helped you come around?

483
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,448
Well, Lois, let's just say
the big man upstairs

484
00:20:43,449 --> 00:20:46,017
put in a hard day's work today.

485
00:20:46,018 --> 00:20:49,387
Well, looks like quitting time.

486
00:20:49,388 --> 00:20:51,556
Good night, Kirk Cameron.

487
00:20:51,557 --> 00:20:53,525
See you tomorrow, Gene Rayburn.

488
00:20:53,526 --> 00:20:57,696
See you when the sun rises,
James Bro... Mamma mia!

489
00:20:57,697 --> 00:21:00,697
