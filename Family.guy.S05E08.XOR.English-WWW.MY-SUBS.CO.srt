00:00:01,338 --> 00:00:05,892
<i>Family Guy
Barely Legal</i>

2
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:35,582
<i>And now back to Romancing the Stone.</i>

3
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:38,902
The only way they're not going to kill
my sister is if we give them the stone.

4
00:00:38,903 --> 00:00:40,834
Well, they're going to be
looking everywhere.

5
00:00:40,835 --> 00:00:42,589
We'll have to hide it in my chin.

6
00:00:43,215 --> 00:00:46,416
Uh-oh, here they come.
You'd better get in there, too.

7
00:00:48,912 --> 00:00:50,107
Good God,

8
00:00:50,105 --> 00:00:53,580
Joan Wilder's sister is being
held hostage in Cartagena,

9
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:57,276
and there's not a policeman in sight.
I guess it's up to me.

10
00:00:57,284 --> 00:00:59,903
- Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.
- And I'm Diane Simmons.

11
00:00:59,908 --> 00:01:03,543
Our top story : Mayor West has dispatched
the entire Quahog police force

12
00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:08,060
to Cartagena, Columbia, to assist in the
rescue of fictional 1984 movie character,

13
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,241
Elaine Wilder. More on that later.

14
00:01:10,245 --> 00:01:12,461
Now let's go to
Ollie Williams' Cooking Corner.

15
00:01:12,467 --> 00:01:13,880
- What are you making, Ollie?
- Eggo!

16
00:01:13,888 --> 00:01:15,402
Thanks, Ollie. And now this.

17
00:01:19,227 --> 00:01:21,403
Lois, can you come out here for a second?

18
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,962
Lois, can you run inside
and get me some oranges

19
00:01:24,965 --> 00:01:26,592
or whatever it is these things eat?

20
00:01:26,596 --> 00:01:28,490
Peter, what is that?

21
00:01:28,497 --> 00:01:32,183
This would be a giraffe, Issac Newton.
I stole it from the zoo.

22
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:34,140
What with Mayor West sending
all the cops away,

23
00:01:34,148 --> 00:01:35,662
everybody can do whatever they want.

24
00:01:35,675 --> 00:01:38,153
Peter, I don't care what
Mayor West has done.

25
00:01:38,158 --> 00:01:39,901
You can't just break the law.

26
00:01:39,908 --> 00:01:41,772
Sure, I can.
I've been doing it all week.

27
00:01:41,786 --> 00:01:45,300
Like yesterday, I started a lovable
gang of cockney pickpockets.

28
00:01:45,308 --> 00:01:48,340
All right, boys,
the best targets are old, rich people.

29
00:01:48,348 --> 00:01:49,833
There's one now. Go get him.

30
00:01:50,316 --> 00:01:53,981
Oh, no, there's no police here
to help me!

31
00:01:54,068 --> 00:01:57,752
I hope you don't find the money
strapped to my thigh.

32
00:01:57,798 --> 00:02:00,923
Peter, you take that thing back
where it belongs immediately.

33
00:02:00,926 --> 00:02:04,183
All right, I guess we gotta go
back to the zoo, Allison Janney.

34
00:02:04,188 --> 00:02:05,642
Allison Janney?

35
00:02:05,838 --> 00:02:08,840
<i>Oh, good morning, honey.
That feels really good.</i>

36
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:11,192
<i>What...? Hey! Hey! Hey!
What the hell?!</i>

37
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,953
<i>You're not the same giraffe
from last night. Get out of here.</i>

38
00:02:17,215 --> 00:02:18,991
What the hell?

39
00:02:19,177 --> 00:02:22,101
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

40
00:02:22,307 --> 00:02:26,641
I gotta stop taking my baths
during Peter's shenanigans.

41
00:02:31,308 --> 00:02:32,302
Hello.

42
00:02:32,305 --> 00:02:33,953
Oh, hey, Jillian. What's up?

43
00:02:33,956 --> 00:02:37,430
Brian, are you coming over
to watch Laguna Beach tonight?

44
00:02:37,436 --> 00:02:39,192
Uh, what time does it start?

45
00:02:39,196 --> 00:02:41,620
10:00 Eastern and Specific time.

46
00:02:41,627 --> 00:02:43,933
What?
What did you say? Specific time?

47
00:02:43,938 --> 00:02:45,910
- Don't you mean Pacific Time?
- No.

48
00:02:45,918 --> 00:02:47,833
I think it's called Specific time.

49
00:02:47,836 --> 00:02:50,122
They mean it starts specifically at 10:00.

50
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:52,343
Stewie, are you on the line?

51
00:02:52,888 --> 00:02:55,283
- Yes.
- Jillian, I'll talk to you later.

52
00:02:59,226 --> 00:03:02,300
Uh... so... Meg.

53
00:03:03,735 --> 00:03:05,452
How was school?

54
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:06,742
Horrible.

55
00:03:06,758 --> 00:03:09,820
There's a dance Friday night
and no one wants to go with me.

56
00:03:09,828 --> 00:03:12,340
Even my backup guy had plans.

57
00:03:12,346 --> 00:03:13,443
Hi, Jimmy.

58
00:03:13,445 --> 00:03:15,752
Um, I heard you didn't
have a date to the dance,

59
00:03:15,756 --> 00:03:18,050
and I was wondering if
you'd like to go with me.

60
00:03:18,057 --> 00:03:20,173
Oh, uh, I, uh...

61
00:03:20,476 --> 00:03:21,703
H-Hang on.

62
00:03:24,328 --> 00:03:26,632
I'd love to go, Meg, but...

63
00:03:26,636 --> 00:03:29,993
I have to go to my little
brother's funeral that night.

64
00:03:29,995 --> 00:03:32,522
Aw, I'm sure you'll find someone
to go with you.

65
00:03:32,528 --> 00:03:33,652
No, I won't.

66
00:03:33,655 --> 00:03:35,822
I'm so fat and gross.

67
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:39,231
I should just kill myself.

68
00:03:40,268 --> 00:03:41,192
That's...

69
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:43,571
- Come on.
- I'm gonna do it.

70
00:03:43,648 --> 00:03:47,083
I'm gonna kill myself 'cause
no one will go with me.

71
00:03:50,548 --> 00:03:52,842
Meg, stop it.

72
00:03:53,678 --> 00:03:55,122
Come on.

73
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,801
All right, all right, Meg,
look, what if I...

74
00:03:57,957 --> 00:04:01,060
what if I drove you and
walked in with you

75
00:04:01,068 --> 00:04:03,722
- or whatever?
- Brian, will you go with me?!

76
00:04:03,738 --> 00:04:06,022
- Are you going to kill yourself if I don't?
- Yeah.

77
00:04:06,028 --> 00:04:08,292
Well, then my hands are pretty much tied.

78
00:04:08,306 --> 00:04:10,583
Oh, Brian, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

79
00:04:10,628 --> 00:04:13,851
I have to buy a new dress.
All the ones I have make me look fat.

80
00:04:15,536 --> 00:04:17,660
The story on everyone's mind

81
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:21,613
continues to be the absence
of police officers in Quahog.

82
00:04:21,617 --> 00:04:24,872
Sir, as a citizen,
how has this affected you?

83
00:04:24,886 --> 00:04:28,272
The police are gone?
Oh, my God, we're finally safe!

84
00:04:28,275 --> 00:04:32,193
<i>Freedom you see has got
our hearts singing so joyfully</i>

85
00:04:32,195 --> 00:04:36,122
<i>Just look about, you owe it
to yourself to check it out</i>

86
00:04:36,178 --> 00:04:39,682
<i>Can't you feel a brand-new day?</i>

87
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:43,601
<i>Can't you feel a brand-new day?</i>

88
00:04:43,796 --> 00:04:47,683
<i>Can't you feel a brand-new day?</i>

89
00:04:47,848 --> 00:04:51,732
<i>Can't you feel a brand-new day?</i>

90
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:56,372
Hey, Joe, where you been?
We haven't seen you in days.

91
00:04:56,376 --> 00:04:59,520
Ever since Mayor West
deployed the police to Cartagena,

92
00:04:59,527 --> 00:05:01,313
I've been working nonstop.

93
00:05:01,316 --> 00:05:03,333
The only reason I didn't have
to go myself

94
00:05:03,338 --> 00:05:06,000
is that South America isn't
wheelchair accessible.

95
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:09,590
Hey, you guys, we should help Joe out.
We could be cops, right, Joe?

96
00:05:09,607 --> 00:05:14,360
Well, we have started an emergency
training program at the Police Academy,

97
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:17,143
but I'm not sure that you're cut out
for the job.

98
00:05:17,158 --> 00:05:19,170
Come on, we'll be great cops.

99
00:05:19,177 --> 00:05:21,973
Besides, it's bound to go better than
my deep-sea training.

100
00:05:21,978 --> 00:05:24,902
Well, we've got long time
in this decompression chamber.

101
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,782
You guys mind if I turn on the radio?

102
00:05:26,788 --> 00:05:27,790
Peter, don't!

103
00:05:28,648 --> 00:05:31,060
- Oh, nice going, jackass.
- Look what you did.

104
00:05:31,645 --> 00:05:35,232
Excuse the hell out of me for trying to
brighten your day with music, all right?

105
00:05:35,236 --> 00:05:37,673
- You idiot, use your brain.
- You're an idiot.

106
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:44,323
Stop, stop, stop.

107
00:05:44,338 --> 00:05:46,521
Oh, man, we're going to need
some butter or something.

108
00:05:50,005 --> 00:05:53,493
Oh, Brian, it is so nice of you
to take Meg to this dance.

109
00:05:53,505 --> 00:05:56,200
- It really mean sa lot to her.
- You got any weed?

110
00:05:56,207 --> 00:05:57,721
I put it in your coat pocket.

111
00:05:57,727 --> 00:06:01,873
Here she is. Brian, I present to you
your polished turd for the evening.

112
00:06:01,876 --> 00:06:03,263
How do I look, Brian?

113
00:06:04,446 --> 00:06:06,160
You sure do, Meg.

114
00:06:06,728 --> 00:06:09,111
FYI, the carpet matches the drapes

115
00:06:09,115 --> 00:06:11,081
in color and length.

116
00:06:14,147 --> 00:06:15,761
Well, Brian, here we go.

117
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:18,121
Oh, this is going to be so much fun.

118
00:06:24,215 --> 00:06:26,433
God, this is going to be a long night.

119
00:06:26,435 --> 00:06:29,562
Oh, Brian, let's dance.
This song kicks ass.

120
00:06:39,538 --> 00:06:43,080
Man, I got to tell ya,
I can see why you'd be insecure, Meg.

121
00:06:43,085 --> 00:06:46,202
Some of these chicks are unbelievable.

122
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,143
Brian, can I ask you something?

123
00:06:48,145 --> 00:06:50,860
Are you drinking so much
because you don't want to be here?

124
00:06:50,867 --> 00:06:53,411
No, no, Meg. It's-that's...
My...

125
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:55,621
God, look at these chicks.

126
00:06:55,626 --> 00:06:58,100
You know, the best thing
about these girls is,

127
00:06:58,105 --> 00:07:01,060
even if you're terrible,
they don't know the difference.

128
00:07:01,077 --> 00:07:03,661
You know, Meg,
there's no dogs allowed here,

129
00:07:03,665 --> 00:07:06,682
so you're going to have to leave.
But Brian can stay.

130
00:07:07,197 --> 00:07:10,920
You know, Connie, I think I have a
theory about why you're such a bitch.

131
00:07:10,926 --> 00:07:12,951
- Excuse me?
- Brian, let's just go.

132
00:07:12,955 --> 00:07:15,393
No, no, no, no. Now hang on...
hang on, Meg, hang on.

133
00:07:15,396 --> 00:07:16,521
You see, Connie,

134
00:07:16,527 --> 00:07:18,670
you're popular because
you developed early

135
00:07:18,678 --> 00:07:20,472
and started putting out when you were 12.

136
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:22,620
But now you can't stand
to look at yourself in the mirror

137
00:07:22,707 --> 00:07:24,033
because all you see is a whore.

138
00:07:24,037 --> 00:07:26,911
So, you pick on Meg to avoid
the inevitable realization

139
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:29,420
that once your body's used up by age 19,

140
00:07:29,425 --> 00:07:32,170
you're going to be a worn-out,
chalky-skinned burlap sack

141
00:07:32,177 --> 00:07:35,540
that even your step dad won't want.
How's that? Am I in the ballpark?

142
00:07:37,203 --> 00:07:39,116
Brian, that was amazing.

143
00:07:39,114 --> 00:07:41,233
No one's ever stood up for me like that.

144
00:07:41,238 --> 00:07:43,913
Hey, no problem.
She's a... she's a skank.

145
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:48,530
You know, you don't deserve all
the crap you get, Meg, you know that?

146
00:07:48,827 --> 00:07:50,881
Thanks, Brian.

147
00:08:00,797 --> 00:08:03,402
Sorry, that was the booze, not you.

148
00:08:04,236 --> 00:08:06,012
You gonna eat that?

149
00:08:08,836 --> 00:08:13,150
Oh, yes, the day can begin.
Good morning, Brian.

150
00:08:13,156 --> 00:08:16,783
Now we can do this one of two ways.
I can bust your balls to pieces right now,

151
00:08:16,785 --> 00:08:18,883
or we can spread it out
over the course of the day.

152
00:08:18,885 --> 00:08:20,591
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Well, I do.

153
00:08:20,595 --> 00:08:22,720
So tell me everything
that happened at the dance.

154
00:08:22,725 --> 00:08:24,570
- Morning, cutie.
- Uh, hey.

155
00:08:25,017 --> 00:08:27,380
I had so much fun last night, Brian.

156
00:08:27,388 --> 00:08:29,780
I thought maybe we could go
get some coffee later.

157
00:08:29,785 --> 00:08:31,152
I-I don't think so.

158
00:08:31,157 --> 00:08:33,490
Oh, come on, who's a good boy?

159
00:08:33,497 --> 00:08:36,293
Who's a good boy, huh?
Who's a good boy?

160
00:08:36,297 --> 00:08:37,001
Me.

161
00:08:37,028 --> 00:08:40,763
- Oh, yes, yes, yes, who's a good boy?
- I am. I'm a good boy.

162
00:08:40,768 --> 00:08:43,351
But... no, no, no, look, look...
I got stuff to do today.

163
00:08:43,358 --> 00:08:45,723
- All right? Sorry.
- We should hook up anyway.

164
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:47,233
I'll bug you later.

165
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:52,171
Well, she seems to have taken
a shine to you, Brian.

166
00:08:52,175 --> 00:08:55,580
With a little encouragement, you might get
her to put her cankles behind her ears.

167
00:08:55,585 --> 00:08:56,801
Stewie, shut up.

168
00:08:57,466 --> 00:08:59,891
Who the hell is texting me at 8:00 a.m.?

169
00:09:01,868 --> 00:09:05,742
Wait a minute.
Something did happen last night.

170
00:09:05,817 --> 00:09:09,053
Look, it's not that big a deal,
all right? We just... we just...

171
00:09:09,477 --> 00:09:11,053
made out a little.

172
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,533
Tell me about it! Go.

173
00:09:13,538 --> 00:09:16,760
It didn't mean anything.
I had a few too many and...

174
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:18,523
it's not even worth going into.

175
00:09:18,526 --> 00:09:21,483
This is even a bigger jackpot
than when the Emperor figured out

176
00:09:21,485 --> 00:09:24,042
the formula
for great Star Wars dialogue.

177
00:09:24,057 --> 00:09:26,983
Something, something, something...

178
00:09:26,988 --> 00:09:29,300
dark side.

179
00:09:29,697 --> 00:09:32,290
Something, something, something...

180
00:09:32,296 --> 00:09:33,823
complete.

181
00:09:50,455 --> 00:09:54,532
Well, this is it.
Our first day of Police Academy IV.

182
00:09:54,616 --> 00:09:56,833
Welcome to the Police Academy.

183
00:09:56,835 --> 00:09:59,912
We're going to start by learning
how to do a cavity search.

184
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:02,850
Peter, you will be the police officer
and Quagmire,

185
00:10:02,855 --> 00:10:05,113
you will be the suspect.
Begin.

186
00:10:05,115 --> 00:10:07,760
Sir, I suspect you are
in possession of drugs,

187
00:10:07,768 --> 00:10:11,172
and I'm going to have to give you
a full cavity search. Drop your pants.

188
00:10:12,895 --> 00:10:16,060
Uh, Peter, you don't have
to pull your pants down.

189
00:10:16,068 --> 00:10:19,310
- Oh, sorry. I'm still learning.
- All right, start the search.

190
00:10:29,178 --> 00:10:31,140
I think that's everything.

191
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:32,941
You want me to double-check?

192
00:10:36,877 --> 00:10:38,570
Hi, honey.

193
00:10:38,635 --> 00:10:39,600
What?

194
00:10:39,607 --> 00:10:41,700
I was thinking about our kiss last night.

195
00:10:41,705 --> 00:10:44,953
I never knew how flat and wide
your tongue was.

196
00:10:44,955 --> 00:10:46,071
Yeah...

197
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,600
You know, I thought about
how you stood up for me at the dance,

198
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,330
and all the nice things you said.

199
00:10:50,337 --> 00:10:53,152
We should totally be
boyfriend and girlfriend.

200
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:56,492
Well, Meg, uh, you know what's strange?

201
00:10:56,498 --> 00:10:58,970
I-I-I think I might be gay.

202
00:10:59,017 --> 00:11:03,242
I saw this penis on the Internet today
and I thought to myself :

203
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:04,561
"Well, that's..."

204
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:07,753
- "that's just fine."
- I'm going to the mall later.

205
00:11:07,758 --> 00:11:10,863
Maybe you can come and help me
pick out some underwear.

206
00:11:11,447 --> 00:11:14,260
I don't think that's gonna
be a possibility. I have...

207
00:11:14,268 --> 00:11:15,950
plans, um...

208
00:11:15,965 --> 00:11:18,843
with Chris.
Chris and I have plans this afternoon.

209
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:21,002
- We do?
- Yeah, we're doing that thing.

210
00:11:21,006 --> 00:11:22,282
We're doing...

211
00:11:22,286 --> 00:11:24,781
what you usually do
on a Thursday afternoon.

212
00:11:24,787 --> 00:11:25,760
Masturbate?

213
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:27,562
That's it.
That's what we're going to do together.

214
00:11:27,565 --> 00:11:32,393
Well, maybe back to back, but
I gotta tell you I'm not 100% on this.

215
00:11:32,595 --> 00:11:35,270
Oh, there's the cute prom couple.

216
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,521
Hi, Mom. Is it cool if Brian and I
go to the mall this afternoon?

217
00:11:38,526 --> 00:11:40,392
Actually, I thought I was pretty clear...

218
00:11:40,396 --> 00:11:42,241
Oh, of course it's okay.

219
00:11:42,257 --> 00:11:45,642
Ever since that dance,
you two have become such good friends.

220
00:11:45,647 --> 00:11:48,493
- Who would have thought?
- Oh, we're more than friends, Mom.

221
00:11:48,498 --> 00:11:52,081
- Last night at the dance, Brian...
- Last night, we decided to be best friends.

222
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,901
Right, Meg? Come on.
Let's go to the mall. We'll get ya...

223
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:57,153
get ya a big ol' pretzel.

224
00:11:57,165 --> 00:11:58,752
I want a pretzel, too!

225
00:11:59,115 --> 00:12:02,741
<i>Brian, I'm ready? You in or out?</i>

226
00:12:10,638 --> 00:12:13,263
Everyone, this is Brian.

227
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:16,592
- Oh, this is Brian.
- He does look like Ben Affleck.

228
00:12:16,597 --> 00:12:19,330
- He looks just like Ben Affleck.
- Is that Ben Affleck?

229
00:12:19,347 --> 00:12:21,550
- Hey.
- So, how did you guys meet?

230
00:12:21,556 --> 00:12:23,781
I'm, uh, a friend of her dad's.

231
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:26,470
- Ooh, he's older.
- He's cute.

232
00:12:26,476 --> 00:12:28,920
- Do you have a brother?
- Makeup and stickers and ponies

233
00:12:28,925 --> 00:12:30,451
and mySpace.com.

234
00:12:30,455 --> 00:12:33,181
Brian's the first serious boyfriend
I've ever had.

235
00:12:33,188 --> 00:12:35,610
Uh, Meg, can I talk to you
for a second?

236
00:12:36,948 --> 00:12:41,181
Look, this has gone a little too far.
I like you. I think you're great, but

237
00:12:41,187 --> 00:12:43,213
what happened at the dance was...

238
00:12:43,215 --> 00:12:45,382
I mean, that kiss was just a mistake.

239
00:12:45,386 --> 00:12:47,061
Oh, no. Did I do something wrong?

240
00:12:47,068 --> 00:12:48,942
Was it because
I didn't sniff your butt first?

241
00:12:48,945 --> 00:12:52,660
What? No! I mean, yes, that's how
I would know you're interested, but

242
00:12:52,675 --> 00:12:57,003
Meg, the fact is that you and I are friends,
and that's the way it needs to stay.

243
00:12:57,015 --> 00:12:59,772
Besides, I have a girlfriend.
I'm dating Jillian.

244
00:12:59,827 --> 00:13:02,653
All right, Brian. I understand.

245
00:13:02,706 --> 00:13:05,640
Good. I'm gonna grab Stewie,
and then we can go.

246
00:13:06,195 --> 00:13:09,731
What's that, Brian?
Oh, you were just kidding.

247
00:13:09,735 --> 00:13:12,911
I know you were.
I love you, too, Brian.

248
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:16,961
And you love me.
You do love me, Brian.

249
00:13:21,428 --> 00:13:23,772
- Hey, Brian
- Oh, Meg, hey.

250
00:13:23,778 --> 00:13:27,011
Hey, listen, I hope you're feeling all
right about out little talk the other day.

251
00:13:27,026 --> 00:13:29,401
You know, about us being
just friends and all.

252
00:13:29,405 --> 00:13:32,382
Yeah. No, I'm fine, I'm fine.
And...

253
00:13:32,385 --> 00:13:36,021
hey, look, I wanted to thank you
for being so great to me.

254
00:13:36,026 --> 00:13:40,283
- So, I baked you a pie.
- Oh, wow. Hey, that looks delicious.

255
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:42,711
Mmm, oh, this is good.
What's in there?

256
00:13:42,716 --> 00:13:45,842
Well, there's some apples
and some cinnamon

257
00:13:45,847 --> 00:13:48,101
- and my hair.
- What?

258
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:50,102
My hair's in the pie, Brian.

259
00:13:50,108 --> 00:13:52,163
And now it's inside of you.

260
00:13:52,305 --> 00:13:55,543
Part of me is inside of you, Brian.

261
00:13:55,925 --> 00:13:57,840
Do you feel me, Brian?

262
00:13:58,107 --> 00:14:01,083
Do you feel me inside of you?

263
00:14:03,686 --> 00:14:06,571
Ooh, you got some pie, huh?
Can I have a piece?

264
00:14:06,575 --> 00:14:09,492
- Uh, sure.
- Let me have some of that Cool "Hwhip?"

265
00:14:09,496 --> 00:14:12,301
- What'd you say?
- You can't have a pie without Cool Hwhip.

266
00:14:12,316 --> 00:14:14,240
- Cool Hwhip?
- Cool Hwhip, yeah.

267
00:14:14,246 --> 00:14:16,283
- You mean Cool Whip.
- Yeah, Cool Hwhip.

268
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:17,762
- Cool Whip.
- Cool Hwhip.

269
00:14:17,768 --> 00:14:19,161
- Cool Whip.
- Cool Hwhip.

270
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,721
You're saying it weird. Why are you
putting so much emphasison the "H"?

271
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,553
What are you talking about?
I'm just saying it, Cool Hwhip.

272
00:14:23,558 --> 00:14:26,090
You put Cool Hwhip on pie.
Pie tastes better with Cool Hwhip.

273
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:27,301
- Say "whip."
- Whip.

274
00:14:27,305 --> 00:14:29,022
- Now say Cool Whip.
- Cool Hwhip.

275
00:14:29,028 --> 00:14:30,450
- Cool Whip.
- Cool Hwhip.

276
00:14:30,467 --> 00:14:31,710
- Cool Whip.
- Cool Hwhip.

277
00:14:31,715 --> 00:14:33,001
You're eating hair!

278
00:14:35,018 --> 00:14:38,682
Well, Lois, I am now a graduate
of the Quahog Police Academy.

279
00:14:38,685 --> 00:14:40,833
And an official on-duty cop.

280
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:45,542
I can't believe I'm married
to a big, scary police officer.

281
00:14:45,547 --> 00:14:47,971
Just keep your eyes on the eggs, ma'am.

282
00:14:48,985 --> 00:14:50,933
Yes, officer!

283
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:55,572
- You are such a dirty cop.
- Don't break those yolks, ma'am.

284
00:14:55,975 --> 00:14:58,300
- Oh, my God, Lois, I hit you!
- I know.

285
00:14:58,308 --> 00:15:00,662
Now stick your finger in there
and twist it!

286
00:15:03,997 --> 00:15:06,700
Hey, uh, Lois, can I talk to you
for a second?

287
00:15:06,718 --> 00:15:08,783
I think we may have
a problem with Meg.

288
00:15:08,797 --> 00:15:11,902
You're telling me.
She's been locked in her room all day.

289
00:15:11,908 --> 00:15:13,792
Who knows what she's doing
up there.

290
00:15:24,098 --> 00:15:28,691
Yeah, well, the thing is, Meg is
becoming a little enamored with me,

291
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:31,781
and I'm kind of losing control
of the situation.

292
00:15:31,785 --> 00:15:34,562
Oh, she's just grateful
you took her to the dance.

293
00:15:34,568 --> 00:15:37,570
Well, uh, I think
it's more than that. Uh...

294
00:15:37,705 --> 00:15:40,570
So, here's the thing, and don't get mad.

295
00:15:40,578 --> 00:15:43,580
And that part I can't stress enough.
That's a great shirt, by the way.

296
00:15:43,585 --> 00:15:47,343
Um, I may have made out with Meg.

297
00:15:49,328 --> 00:15:50,760
Okay, I had that coming.

298
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:53,962
What the hell is wrong with you,
you sick bastard?!

299
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:56,572
- Look, I was drinking...
- Oh, what a shock!

300
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,122
Look, the short version is,

301
00:15:59,128 --> 00:16:01,511
this morning, she made me
eat the hair in her pie.

302
00:16:01,568 --> 00:16:04,132
No, it's not what you think.
Stewie had some, too.

303
00:16:04,188 --> 00:16:06,543
- Stop punching me!
- Look, Brian,

304
00:16:06,546 --> 00:16:08,830
I don't know what the hell happened
between you two,

305
00:16:08,836 --> 00:16:12,290
but you'd better go upstairs
and straighten it out right now.

306
00:16:12,616 --> 00:16:16,143
This is even worse than when you ate
that bubblegum out of the garbage.

307
00:16:16,367 --> 00:16:19,333
Brian, did you get
into the garbage last night?

308
00:16:19,337 --> 00:16:20,972
Uh, no. Why?

309
00:16:20,977 --> 00:16:23,641
- Don't lie to me, Brian.
- I'm not lying.

310
00:16:27,806 --> 00:16:30,251
Uh, Meg, you got a minute?

311
00:16:34,317 --> 00:16:35,961
What the hell?

312
00:16:36,017 --> 00:16:38,652
- I made that for you, Brian.
- Meg!

313
00:16:38,688 --> 00:16:42,373
Look, you obviously didn't hear me
yesterday, so I'll explain it again.

314
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:45,113
And here to assist me is headmaster
of the New York School

315
00:16:45,117 --> 00:16:47,303
For The Hard of Hearing,
Mr. Garret Morris.

316
00:16:47,318 --> 00:16:49,711
Meg, we're not boyfriend and girlfriend.

317
00:16:49,728 --> 00:16:53,113
We're not boyfriend and girlfriend!

318
00:16:53,115 --> 00:16:55,151
I will never be attracted to you.

319
00:16:55,158 --> 00:16:59,100
I will never be attracted to you!

320
00:16:59,107 --> 00:17:01,301
You're acting like a psycho bitch.

321
00:17:01,306 --> 00:17:04,780
You're acting like a psycho bitch!

322
00:17:04,787 --> 00:17:07,133
Good night and have
a pleasant tomorrow.

323
00:17:07,138 --> 00:17:10,921
Good night and have a pleasant tomorrow!

324
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,403
I won't be ignored, Brian.

325
00:17:16,506 --> 00:17:18,712
Mm, I like your ass.

326
00:17:32,127 --> 00:17:33,313
Joe, I gotta tell you,

327
00:17:33,316 --> 00:17:35,922
this whole cop thing ain't as exciting
as I thought it was gonna be.

328
00:17:35,927 --> 00:17:37,852
When do we get to shoot some bad guys?

329
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,790
Guys, it's not all about action.

330
00:17:39,795 --> 00:17:42,211
It's about staying vigilant
until you're needed.

331
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,962
- What are you doing?
- I'm watching Bonnie undress.

332
00:17:44,967 --> 00:17:47,070
- Bonnie's your wife.
- I know.

333
00:17:47,077 --> 00:17:50,401
I like to watch her strip and pretend
she's a woman who I've never met,

334
00:17:50,405 --> 00:17:53,290
but who looks just like Bonnie
and lives in my house.

335
00:17:53,298 --> 00:17:55,513
Get naked, you strange whore!

336
00:17:55,517 --> 00:17:58,772
Peter, I haven't seen Meg or Brian
since last night.

337
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,722
I think something may have happened.

338
00:18:00,728 --> 00:18:04,842
Mom, is it bad if I saw Meg tie up
Brian last night,

339
00:18:04,857 --> 00:18:07,551
put him in the trunk of his car
and then drive away?

340
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:10,161
What?!
Chris, why didn't you say anything?!

341
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:12,131
I dropped the ball. I'm sorry.

342
00:18:12,136 --> 00:18:16,400
I have just been buried in paperwork
for the past 72 hours.

343
00:18:16,405 --> 00:18:20,353
Oh, my God, Brian was right.
Meg really must be obsessed with him.

344
00:18:20,357 --> 00:18:21,872
Peter, we got to find them.

345
00:18:21,878 --> 00:18:23,592
Don't worry, Lois, we're the police,

346
00:18:23,597 --> 00:18:26,533
and we'll do our very best
to find Brian and girl Chris.

347
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:32,332
I'm really having
a great time tonight, Brian.

348
00:18:32,337 --> 00:18:34,822
I can't believe you went
to all this trouble.

349
00:18:34,828 --> 00:18:37,762
- Well, you know me.
- Oh, I do, Brian.

350
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:39,802
I know you so well.

351
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:42,860
- So, are you ready?
- For what?

352
00:18:42,868 --> 00:18:45,031
For the fun we're gonna have, Brian.

353
00:18:45,035 --> 00:18:47,131
We're gonna have fun tonight.

354
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,833
Good, old-fashioned,

355
00:18:49,846 --> 00:18:52,583
all-American fun.

356
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,191
Listen, Meg,

357
00:18:54,197 --> 00:18:57,252
I'm not gonna lie to you here.
I'm a little uncomfortable.

358
00:18:57,258 --> 00:19:00,750
Oh, just relax. We're gonna be here
for a "hwhile."

359
00:19:00,755 --> 00:19:03,940
- Well, I don't know if... Wait, what?
- We're gonna be here for a hwhile.

360
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,292
- A hwhile?
- Yeah, a hwhile.

361
00:19:06,297 --> 00:19:07,983
- You mean, a while.
- A hwhile.

362
00:19:07,988 --> 00:19:09,343
- A while.
- A hwhile.

363
00:19:09,345 --> 00:19:10,712
- A while.
- A hwhile.

364
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:12,863
- A while.
- Brian, you're acting "wheird."

365
00:19:12,868 --> 00:19:14,813
Come on. That one doesn't even
have an "H" in it.

366
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:18,932
- Don't move, dirtbag!
- Holy crap, what the hell is this?

367
00:19:18,938 --> 00:19:20,983
Brian, she's a teenager!

368
00:19:20,988 --> 00:19:23,543
Yeah, Brian, you're doing the
same thing that Mia Farrow did

369
00:19:23,547 --> 00:19:26,270
to that Oriental guy that Woody Allen
brought home from the circus.

370
00:19:26,276 --> 00:19:28,943
Peter, hold on to that thought,
because I'm going to explain to you

371
00:19:28,948 --> 00:19:31,423
when we get home all the things
that are wrong with that statement.

372
00:19:31,426 --> 00:19:34,191
But first, Meg, you need to let Brian go.

373
00:19:34,198 --> 00:19:38,081
- But, Mom, I love him!
- Honey, you're just confused.

374
00:19:38,087 --> 00:19:39,652
I'm not confused!

375
00:19:39,655 --> 00:19:42,570
I've never been more certain
about anything in my life!

376
00:19:42,588 --> 00:19:43,853
I need him!

377
00:19:43,857 --> 00:19:46,730
Meg, I know that's what
you think right now, but you're...

378
00:19:46,736 --> 00:19:49,321
Oh, God, I wish
I could make you understand.

379
00:19:49,327 --> 00:19:52,890
- You don't know what you need.
- I know what she needs.

380
00:19:52,896 --> 00:19:54,382
- You do?
- You bet.

381
00:19:54,388 --> 00:19:57,303
Bring her by my house around
8:30 tonight. I'll take care of her.

382
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:02,622
Hi, Mr. Quagmire.
Mom said I should come over here.

383
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:06,031
Have a seat, Meg.
Soon it'll all become clear.

384
00:20:10,788 --> 00:20:13,362
Excuse me, while I get a
little more comfortable.

385
00:20:14,617 --> 00:20:17,770
Meg, I've watched you grow up
from a playful little girl

386
00:20:17,805 --> 00:20:19,813
into a very special young woman.

387
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:23,523
Now you probably just think of me as
square old Mr. Quagmire from next door,

388
00:20:23,527 --> 00:20:25,700
but I've been around the block
a few times,

389
00:20:25,705 --> 00:20:27,981
learned a couple things,
and I can tell you this,

390
00:20:27,988 --> 00:20:30,210
there's no reason to grow up too fast.

391
00:20:30,216 --> 00:20:32,940
Teenage girls are exposed
to so much these days.

392
00:20:32,947 --> 00:20:35,341
I can see why a relationship
looks glamorous,

393
00:20:35,347 --> 00:20:37,123
but you've got all the time in the world

394
00:20:37,128 --> 00:20:39,880
and a lot of wonderful experiences
ahead of ya.

395
00:20:39,888 --> 00:20:41,923
Hang on. I want to give you something.

396
00:20:42,727 --> 00:20:45,833
This book helped me
when I was about your age.

397
00:20:47,237 --> 00:20:50,111
It let me know that as long
as I kept on rolling,

398
00:20:50,118 --> 00:20:52,833
I'd find that one person
who would make me whole.

399
00:20:52,848 --> 00:20:55,913
- Thanks, Mr. Quagmire.
- You don't have to thank me.

400
00:20:55,918 --> 00:20:58,283
Now get on out of here,
you little scamp.

401
00:21:01,546 --> 00:21:05,481
- All right, ladies, you ready for action?
- We sure are, Glen.

402
00:21:05,486 --> 00:21:08,691
- Do you have the "hwhip"?
- Got it right here... wait. What?

403
00:21:09,345 --> 00:21:10,712
Hello, I'm Tom Tucker.

404
00:21:10,715 --> 00:21:13,733
Coming up at 11:00,
Quahog police return to active duty

405
00:21:13,738 --> 00:21:16,730
after giving up the search for fictitious
Romancing The Stone character

406
00:21:16,736 --> 00:21:17,910
Elaine Wilder.

407
00:21:17,918 --> 00:21:20,821
Plus, in national news,
America's scoutmasters are asking :

408
00:21:20,828 --> 00:21:23,012
"Why are the kids so shy in the shower?"

409
00:21:23,018 --> 00:21:25,972
And in entertainment,
is Annette Benning made of leather?

410
00:21:25,978 --> 00:21:28,400
A local tanner has a
surprising revelation.

411
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:30,521
- We'll have all this and what else, Ollie?
- Sports!

412
00:21:30,528 --> 00:21:32,573
And sports. Join us at 11:00.
