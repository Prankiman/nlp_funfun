Peter, you awake?

38
00:01:42,321 --> 00:01:44,439
It's a beautiful day.

39
00:01:44,473 --> 00:01:46,274
Um, yeah, I'm just glad
I didn't die

40
00:01:46,308 --> 00:01:48,092
from the weird
sleep-breathing thing I have.

41
00:01:56,552 --> 00:01:58,903
You know, Peter, since
it's Valentine's Day

42
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:00,738
I was thinking
let's do something

00:02:00,773 --> 00:02:02,273
we've never
done before.

44
00:02:02,307 --> 00:02:03,991
Release the virus?

45
00:02:04,026 --> 00:02:06,828
No, I was thinking we could
spend the whole day in bed.

46
00:02:06,862 --> 00:02:08,529
Oh, that's a great idea.

47
00:02:08,564 --> 00:02:12,433
Permission to begin a day of
epic lovemaking, sexy lady.

48
00:02:12,468 --> 00:02:14,635
Permission
granted, sir.

51
00:02:18,974 --> 00:02:20,675
Yeah, you slut.

52
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:23,594
Doth the magistrate know
what you're doing tonight?

53
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:24,862
Good.

54
00:02:24,897 --> 00:02:28,416
Now, undo the top six buttons
of your 100-button shoes.

55
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,373
Wow, Meg,
you look nice.

56
00:02:35,407 --> 00:02:36,607
You got a date?

57
00:02:36,642 --> 00:02:39,010
Yeah, I totally hit it
off with this great guy

58
00:02:39,044 --> 00:02:40,964
in the Internet, and we're
finally going to meet.

59
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:43,081
Okay, remember to ask
questions about him.

60
00:02:43,115 --> 00:02:46,184
Seem interested.
Listen. Giggle.

61
00:02:46,218 --> 00:02:47,468
Swallow.

62
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,620
Oh, my God,
that's him.

63
00:02:51,507 --> 00:02:52,473
Toby?

64
00:02:52,508 --> 00:02:53,624
Meg?

65
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:56,027
Hi. Wow, you look just
like your picture.

66
00:02:56,061 --> 00:02:58,529
You don't look
anything like yours.

67
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:03,835
Yeah, that's a candid
from a summer job I had.

68
00:03:03,869 --> 00:03:05,636
Well, you're much
prettier in person.

69
00:03:05,671 --> 00:03:06,637
Shall we go?

70
00:03:06,672 --> 00:03:07,672
Yeah, sure.

71
00:03:07,706 --> 00:03:09,107
Don't wait up, boys.

72
00:03:10,726 --> 00:03:11,759
I like him.

73
00:03:11,794 --> 00:03:13,177
Really? He seems
kind of lame.

74
00:03:13,212 --> 00:03:14,729
But, I guess
every girl

75
00:03:14,763 --> 00:03:16,497
has her own version
of Prince Charming.

76
00:03:16,532 --> 00:03:18,099
I'm in love with Paul.

77
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:19,567
I'm in love
with John.

78
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:20,635
You know what?

79
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:22,370
I'm in love
with Ringo.

80
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:23,421
What?

81
00:03:23,455 --> 00:03:24,522
Um, I said...

82
00:03:24,556 --> 00:03:25,890
I don't-I don't know
what I said.

83
00:03:25,924 --> 00:03:27,892
Sounded like you said you
were in love with Ringo.

84
00:03:27,926 --> 00:03:30,428
Um, I don't...
I don't think so.

85
00:03:30,462 --> 00:03:32,830
Pretty sure you said
"I'm in love with Ringo."

86
00:03:32,865 --> 00:03:33,965
Here I am.

87
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:35,266
Are Paul and John
out there?

88
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,151
Nope, just Ringo.

89
00:03:43,742 --> 00:03:45,443
Oh, you're still here?

90
00:03:45,477 --> 00:03:47,278
Yeah, after
a wonderful night

91
00:03:47,312 --> 00:03:49,063
I-I thought we could
get some breakfast.

92
00:03:49,114 --> 00:03:51,716
Clearly, you're not
familiar with how this works.

93
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,311
See, you're supposed
to be already gone.

94
00:03:53,335 --> 00:03:54,368
There's no breakfast.

95
00:03:54,403 --> 00:03:56,087
Here, let me help you
to the door.

96
00:03:59,408 --> 00:04:01,192
You're a jerk,
Glenn Quagmire.

97
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,411
One of these days, you're
going to get what you deserve.

98
00:04:03,428 --> 00:04:04,879
You better put
something warm on.

99
00:04:04,913 --> 00:04:07,748
You got an icicle
forming down there.

100
00:04:08,984 --> 00:04:11,169
Dumb broad left her
electric tampon warmer.

101
00:04:26,134 --> 00:04:28,119
What the hell?

102
00:04:28,153 --> 00:04:29,620
That's weird.

103
00:04:29,655 --> 00:04:31,556
Why do I look like a chick
in that mirror?

104
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,615
Ah, what's wrong with you,
Holder-Downer 5000?

105
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:41,799
That's just for women.

106
00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:45,570
Hold it together, Quagmire.

107
00:04:45,604 --> 00:04:47,688
You probably just had
one too many drinks last night.

108
00:04:48,757 --> 00:04:49,974
Son of a bitch.

109
00:04:56,532 --> 00:04:57,765
Ah, hey, Joe.

110
00:04:57,799 --> 00:04:59,867
God, I thought
I was in trouble for a minute.

111
00:04:59,902 --> 00:05:01,736
Hey, toots, you know
why I pulled you over?

112
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,604
You were going too
sexy in a 35 zone.

113
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,972
I'll need to see
your driver's license.

114
00:05:05,007 --> 00:05:06,007
What?

115
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,542
Joe, what the hell's
wrong with you?

116
00:05:07,576 --> 00:05:08,559
It's me, Quagmire.

117
00:05:08,594 --> 00:05:10,595
Glenda Vajmire.

118
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:12,663
Well, how would you
like to spend four hours

119
00:05:12,698 --> 00:05:15,533
desperately trying to
give me a muscular soldier?

120
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:16,751
What the hell,
you weirdo?

121
00:05:17,786 --> 00:05:19,153
I'm just having fun.

122
00:05:19,187 --> 00:05:22,173
In fact, as I say to all
the ladies, giggity-giggity.

123
00:05:22,207 --> 00:05:23,874
You don't say that.
I say that.

124
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:25,042
You're a bad person.

125
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:34,936
Hey, Stewie,
what are you doing?

126
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,971
Well, Brian, in honor
of Valentine's Day

127
00:05:37,005 --> 00:05:38,706
I thought why not
go back in time

128
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,608
to that summer of love
in the '60s

129
00:05:40,642 --> 00:05:41,909
that everyone's always
talking about.

130
00:05:41,944 --> 00:05:43,177
Oh, cool.

131
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:45,529
Hey, you think you might be
able to get me some acid?

132
00:05:45,547 --> 00:05:47,064
I'll get you rolled-up
newspaper on the snout

133
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:48,215
is what I'll get you.

134
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,084
Very. Bad. Dog.

135
00:05:57,593 --> 00:06:00,928
Well, here we are, Rupert:
Quahog's summer of love.

136
00:06:00,963 --> 00:06:05,132
♪

137
00:06:09,071 --> 00:06:11,706
Ball, please.

138
00:06:17,228 --> 00:06:18,779
Hello.

139
00:06:18,814 --> 00:06:19,981
Oh, this must be yours.

140
00:06:20,015 --> 00:06:21,349
Thanks.

141
00:06:21,383 --> 00:06:23,784
My God, she's incredible.

142
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:26,520
Rupert, I must bring her
back to the present

143
00:06:26,555 --> 00:06:28,122
and raise her to be my wife.

144
00:06:29,074 --> 00:06:32,209
Oh, God, I bet that diaper
is soaking wet.

145
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:35,830
I can't let her get away.

146
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,233
Oh, hi.

147
00:06:39,267 --> 00:06:42,536
Oh, hey, um, I just
came to say, um...

148
00:06:42,571 --> 00:06:45,806
you know, in a couple of years
something's going to come along

149
00:06:45,841 --> 00:06:46,841
called Sesame Street.

150
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,776
And I know the name
makes it sounds Asian,

151
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,212
but it's not, and it's
going to blow your mind.

152
00:06:51,246 --> 00:06:52,546
Oh, the hell with it.

153
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:54,482
The real reason I ran
over here is because

154
00:06:54,516 --> 00:06:57,284
I wanted to do this.

155
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:00,738
There's my little Lois.

156
00:07:00,772 --> 00:07:01,806
What?

157
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,873
Lois?!

158
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:04,608
Come on, honey.
Hop in Daddy's car.

159
00:07:04,643 --> 00:07:05,943
You can crawl around
on the floor

00:07:05,977 --> 00:07:07,611
while I drink, smoke,
and drive us home.

161
00:07:21,076 --> 00:07:22,343
Oh, my God, Stewie,
what happened?

162
00:07:22,377 --> 00:07:24,045
None of your
business what happened.

163
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,113
Geez, you kiss your mother
with that mouth?

164
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:35,506
Do you like Coldplay?

165
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,174
Uh, am I a dull
white guy?

166
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:38,542
Yes, I like Coldplay.

167
00:07:38,577 --> 00:07:41,645
God, Toby, I can't believe
how much we have in common.

168
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,948
It's like we were meant
to find each other.

169
00:07:43,982 --> 00:07:45,032
I know.

170
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:46,150
To us.

171
00:07:46,184 --> 00:07:47,785
Meg, if you were
any more beautiful,

172
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:49,186
that'd be neat.

173
00:07:51,223 --> 00:07:53,657
So, what should be do next...

174
00:08:00,532 --> 00:08:01,866
Oh, my God!

175
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,868
Toby, what happened?

176
00:08:03,902 --> 00:08:06,437
Oh, I just harvested
your kidney.

177
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:08,205
Look at the
size of this scar.

178
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,075
Sorry. It's my first day
on this job.

179
00:08:11,109 --> 00:08:12,877
Well, where did
you work before?

180
00:08:12,911 --> 00:08:13,978
Circuit City.

181
00:08:14,012 --> 00:08:15,980
So, I haven't worked
in, like, two years.

182
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,664
Toby, I can't believe
you took my kidney.

183
00:08:24,698 --> 00:08:25,965
You bastard!

184
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,033
Sorry, Meg.

185
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:28,401
Black market organs
are big money

186
00:08:28,435 --> 00:08:30,403
and I promised my bosses
a fresh kidney.

187
00:08:30,437 --> 00:08:31,938
No hard feelings.

188
00:08:31,972 --> 00:08:32,939
Wait!

189
00:08:32,973 --> 00:08:35,241
You also made
a promise to me.

190
00:08:35,275 --> 00:08:37,610
You promised we'd spend
Valentine's Day together.

191
00:08:37,644 --> 00:08:39,345
The whole day.

192
00:08:39,396 --> 00:08:41,731
And I'm not letting you
break that promise.

193
00:08:41,765 --> 00:08:43,900
Well, I guess a deal's a deal.

194
00:08:43,934 --> 00:08:45,134
Okay.

195
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,539
By the way, did you know
you had a tiny conjoined twin

196
00:08:49,573 --> 00:08:50,573
attached to your hip?

197
00:08:52,142 --> 00:08:53,209
Is it worth anything?

198
00:08:53,243 --> 00:08:54,343
It is to me.

199
00:08:54,378 --> 00:08:55,811
I've been using it
as a bookmark.

200
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,454
Peter, what's all this?

201
00:09:04,488 --> 00:09:06,756
Oh, Quagmire loaned me this book
called the <i>Kama Sutra.</i>

202
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,790
It's Indian.

203
00:09:07,824 --> 00:09:09,208
And who has better sex

204
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:11,477
than people who don't
use toilet paper?

205
00:09:11,512 --> 00:09:14,230
I don't know, Peter.
That doesn't sound very sexy.

206
00:09:14,264 --> 00:09:15,348
What are you
talking about?

207
00:09:15,382 --> 00:09:16,499
Bombay is sperm city.

208
00:09:16,517 --> 00:09:18,317
<i>Slumdog Millionaire?</i>

209
00:09:18,352 --> 00:09:21,020
More like
<i>Scumdog Put-it-there.</i>

210
00:09:21,055 --> 00:09:23,890
Peter, these candles are
getting wax all over the floor.

211
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:25,508
That's okay. Isn't
Consuela coming today?

212
00:09:25,526 --> 00:09:28,745
No, she spends Valentine's Day
with her husband.

213
00:09:39,757 --> 00:09:41,874
Wait, but she's sneaking
<i>out</i> of the U.S.

214
00:09:41,909 --> 00:09:43,209
This is Arizona.

215
00:09:43,243 --> 00:09:45,461
You can shoot a Mexican
for using a water fountain.

216
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,118
Oh, I fix later.

217
00:09:57,341 --> 00:09:59,342
Happy Valentine's
Day, Juan.

218
00:09:59,376 --> 00:10:01,244
And to you, <i>mi amor.</i>

219
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:03,579
One minute, I
freshen up first.

220
00:10:06,517 --> 00:10:08,484
Okay.

221
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,721
<i>Sí, sí, sí...</i> oh, yeah.

222
00:10:21,148 --> 00:10:22,248
Hi.

223
00:10:22,282 --> 00:10:25,918
Oh, hey, um, I think I might
have the wrong address.

224
00:10:25,953 --> 00:10:27,820
I'm looking for
Mr. Herbert's house.

225
00:10:27,855 --> 00:10:29,288
No, you're at
the right house.

226
00:10:29,323 --> 00:10:31,257
I'm his grandniece,
Sandy.

227
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,526
Wow, my name
is Chris, too.

228
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,929
Oh, hey, there, Chris,
happy Valentine's Day.

229
00:10:36,964 --> 00:10:40,500
Hope cupid brings you
a saggy old bag of treats.

230
00:10:40,534 --> 00:10:43,436
Hey, Mr. Herbert, I'm just here
to collect for the newspaper.

231
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,238
Here you go.

232
00:10:45,272 --> 00:10:49,142
Oh, hang now, Chris.
Your fly's up again.

233
00:10:49,176 --> 00:10:50,743
Thanks, Mr. Herbert.

234
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,431
He's so hot.

235
00:10:55,465 --> 00:10:56,833
I'd love to talk to him,

236
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:58,734
but I just don't know
what I would say.

237
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:00,770
Oh, I know all
the things to say.

238
00:11:00,804 --> 00:11:02,305
Maybe I can
help you out.

239
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:03,506
You'd do that for me?

240
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,607
Sure.

241
00:11:04,641 --> 00:11:06,609
Right after my
favorite show.

242
00:11:06,643 --> 00:11:08,077
<i>Coming up next:</i>

243
00:11:08,111 --> 00:11:11,514
To Catch a Predator
Who's Proud of Being a Predator.

244
00:11:11,548 --> 00:11:12,782
Good evening, sir.

245
00:11:12,816 --> 00:11:14,283
I'm Chris Hansen
with <i>Dateline.</i>

246
00:11:14,318 --> 00:11:16,652
Do you know the boy you were
coming here to meet tonight

247
00:11:16,687 --> 00:11:19,021
is only 13 years old?

248
00:11:19,056 --> 00:11:20,556
No, I drove
900  miles

249
00:11:20,591 --> 00:11:22,358
for a 14-year-old.

250
00:11:25,429 --> 00:11:27,330
So what seems
to be the trouble?

251
00:11:27,364 --> 00:11:29,015
Dr. Hartman,
something's wrong with me!

252
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:30,683
Everyone's treating me
like I'm a broad!

253
00:11:30,717 --> 00:11:32,084
I-I don't know
what's going on!

254
00:11:32,119 --> 00:11:34,320
I recognize that
hysterical tone of voice.

255
00:11:34,354 --> 00:11:35,688
Sounds like someone's
having their monthly.

256
00:11:35,722 --> 00:11:38,257
All right, sweetie,
let me just spit on my hand,

257
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:39,308
and we'll get started.

258
00:11:39,326 --> 00:11:41,360
Ah! Get away from me,
you creep!

259
00:11:43,714 --> 00:11:45,164
My God!

260
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:47,066
There was nothing wrong
with my mirror!

261
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,819
Everyone sees me as a woman!
Oh, no!

262
00:11:49,853 --> 00:11:52,488
This is the universe giving me
what I deserve

263
00:11:52,522 --> 00:11:54,657
for being such a pig
all the time!

264
00:11:54,675 --> 00:11:57,643
From now on,
I'm gonna do things differently.

265
00:11:57,678 --> 00:11:59,946
Men are jerks!
Let's swear off of them

266
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,464
and find comfort in each other!

267
00:12:01,498 --> 00:12:03,132
Com here, you guys!

268
00:12:09,873 --> 00:12:10,923
So, what's with you?

269
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:11,958
No Valentine's Day plans?

270
00:12:11,992 --> 00:12:12,992
No.

271
00:12:13,026 --> 00:12:14,510
I've had it
with Valentine's Day.

272
00:12:14,544 --> 00:12:15,928
I'm sick of all of it.

273
00:12:15,963 --> 00:12:17,563
Okay, I'm putting on
my friend hat.

274
00:12:17,598 --> 00:12:18,965
What's the matter?
Let me in.

275
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:20,399
I don't know.
It's just...

276
00:12:20,434 --> 00:12:22,501
How come it's so hard
to meet the right woman?

277
00:12:22,536 --> 00:12:24,904
I think maybe it's just time
for me to give up.

278
00:12:24,955 --> 00:12:26,756
Come on, Brian.
You can't give up.

279
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,190
Everything could
change in a moment.

280
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:30,026
That's what happened with
the Kennedy assassination.

281
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,929
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
Despite our best efforts,

282
00:12:32,963 --> 00:12:35,531
the Texas School Book Depository
Awareness Council has failed

283
00:12:35,565 --> 00:12:37,166
in its mission to generate
public awareness

284
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,701
of the Texas School
Book Depository.

285
00:12:38,735 --> 00:12:40,503
So at the end of the day,

286
00:12:40,537 --> 00:12:41,904
we'll be shutting
down operations

287
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:43,472
and laying
everyone off.

288
00:12:43,507 --> 00:12:46,375
Sir, I think you're
gonna want to see this!

289
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:49,495
♪ Let's fall in love

290
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:52,081

in love? ♪

291
00:12:52,115 --> 00:12:54,367

00:12:59,506 --> 00:13:02,525

00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:06,145

299
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,883
Oh, Brian,
there you are.

300
00:13:27,918 --> 00:13:29,184
Look, I've been
thinking about

301
00:13:29,202 --> 00:13:30,219
your situation
with women,

302
00:13:30,253 --> 00:13:32,254
and I believe
I've come up with a way

303
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:34,457
to get to the source
of the problem. Follow me.

304
00:13:34,491 --> 00:13:35,825
What's going on?

305
00:13:37,027 --> 00:13:38,427
Oh, my God.

306
00:13:40,864 --> 00:13:41,964
Stewie, what the hell?!

307
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:43,449
These are all
my ex-girlfriends!

308
00:13:43,483 --> 00:13:45,551
Well, I thought they could
provide some insights

309
00:13:45,585 --> 00:13:47,053
that might improve
your love life.

310
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:48,454
Ladies, as you may have guessed,

311
00:13:48,488 --> 00:13:50,656
you are here
because you have all dated

312
00:13:50,691 --> 00:13:52,258
this great guy.

313
00:13:52,292 --> 00:13:53,893
Yet, somehow, things
didn't work out.

314
00:13:53,927 --> 00:13:56,028
My objective is
to figure out why.

315
00:13:56,063 --> 00:13:57,263
I don't know.

316
00:13:57,297 --> 00:13:58,731
The word "self-absorbed"
comes to mind.

317
00:13:58,765 --> 00:14:00,132
And pretentious.

318
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:01,133
Definitely pretentious.

319
00:14:01,168 --> 00:14:03,336
And he's got a big eggo.

320
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,237
Okay, we seem
to have a theme going here.

321
00:14:05,272 --> 00:14:06,739
Oh, come on!
You're all just mad

322
00:14:06,773 --> 00:14:08,040
because I didn't
wanna be with you!

323
00:14:08,075 --> 00:14:09,608
I think Brian's
a wonderful man.

324
00:14:09,643 --> 00:14:11,344
He's just having
a difficult time

325
00:14:11,378 --> 00:14:13,379
coming to terms
with his own sexuality.

326
00:14:13,413 --> 00:14:15,214
Shut up, Ida.
She's my favorite.

327
00:14:15,248 --> 00:14:16,248
He's insecure.

328
00:14:16,283 --> 00:14:17,416
And a blowhard.

329
00:14:17,451 --> 00:14:19,068
And he's got a tiny penis!

330
00:14:20,587 --> 00:14:22,605
Yeah, that was pretty clear
by the survey.

331
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,106
Okay, now who wants
more wine?

332
00:14:24,141 --> 00:14:25,091
This is great.

333
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,575
We should do this
every Saturday.

334
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,778
No, no, we're not gonna
do this every Saturday!

335
00:14:28,812 --> 00:14:30,346
What's wrong?
We're just being honest.

336
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,797
Oh, oh, you want honest?!

337
00:14:31,832 --> 00:14:33,466
You're an old bag.
You're blind.

338
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,600
Your vomit tastes weird.

339
00:14:34,634 --> 00:14:35,968
You don't even know
why you're here.

340
00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:37,536
You chose to be
on <i>The Hills.</i>

341
00:14:37,571 --> 00:14:39,205
You still have
bits of penis left,

342
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:40,439
and you can never get wet.

343
00:14:41,858 --> 00:14:43,859
And you, you're more
of a woman

344
00:14:43,894 --> 00:14:46,445
than anyone else
in this room!

345
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:50,316
Get him!

346
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:02,711
Oh, honey, I'm so excited
to finally meet your girlfriend.

347
00:15:02,746 --> 00:15:03,979
Here she comes now.

348
00:15:04,014 --> 00:15:06,015
Yoo-hoo, baby!

349
00:15:06,049 --> 00:15:07,900
Oh, no!

350
00:15:14,058 --> 00:15:17,527
</i><i>The Final Episode.</i>

351
00:15:17,561 --> 00:15:18,795
So, that's it?
That's it.

352
00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:20,063
This is so much easier.

353
00:15:20,097 --> 00:15:22,165
I don't know why
I didn't do this years ago.

354
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:24,267
What do you want me
to do with the body?

355
00:15:24,301 --> 00:15:26,236
I don't care.
Throw it in the garbage.

356
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,037
Do you want any
of his oversized mallets?

357
00:15:28,072 --> 00:15:29,439
I <i>will</i> take a mallet.

358
00:15:31,075 --> 00:15:32,675
Ah, I gotta take this.

359
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,743
Who's calling?

360
00:15:33,777 --> 00:15:35,011
My ex-girlfriend.

361
00:15:35,045 --> 00:15:36,846
She calls me drunk
every Valentine's Day.

362
00:15:36,881 --> 00:15:38,114
Hey, Samantha.

363
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:41,784
Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry.
I still love Lois.

364
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:44,154
Oh, come on. You would have
been a great mom.

365
00:15:44,188 --> 00:15:46,089
She had cervical cancer
five years ago.

366
00:15:46,123 --> 00:15:48,558
She's basically a boob
on a leg at this point.

367
00:15:48,592 --> 00:15:49,826
Well, that's something.

368
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,427
You're in a book club?

369
00:15:51,462 --> 00:15:53,363
Those are tough
to get into.

370
00:15:53,397 --> 00:15:55,315
What? Well,
I didn't even know

371
00:15:55,349 --> 00:15:57,650
the Fine Young Cannibals
were still together.

372
00:15:57,685 --> 00:15:58,952
Eight-city tour?

373
00:15:58,986 --> 00:16:00,987
Well, I don't know
if I can make eight,

374
00:16:01,021 --> 00:16:02,455
but I can certainly do six.

375
00:16:02,489 --> 00:16:03,456
What <i>about</i> Lois?

376
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:04,941
She's totally out
of the picture.

377
00:16:04,975 --> 00:16:06,543
We've done everything
but sign the papers.

378
00:16:06,577 --> 00:16:09,045
Samantha, Samantha,
I will see you in Binghamton.

379
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:11,497
And now I want you to go
and take a picture of yourself

380
00:16:11,531 --> 00:16:13,933
because it will be
your last day alone.

381
00:16:13,968 --> 00:16:15,835
Geez, what's not clear
about "Get lost"?

382
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,404
By the way, my attendance
at home is gonna be spotty

383
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:19,772
over the next few weeks.

384
00:16:22,526 --> 00:16:26,079
And, well, prize pumpkin
from the county fair,

385
00:16:26,113 --> 00:16:29,949
that's why I'm naming you
my Chief of Police.

386
00:16:29,984 --> 00:16:33,603
Mayor West, there's
something you need to see!

387
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:41,511
My God! My wife is
seeing another mayor!

388
00:16:41,545 --> 00:16:42,979
I'm sorry, sir.

389
00:16:43,013 --> 00:16:46,499
Don't be. Because
I'm going to win her back.

390
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:49,969
I trust you'll take care
of things here in my absence.

391
00:16:51,255 --> 00:16:52,655
Officer down!

392
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:57,527
I hereby declare
this public park

393
00:16:57,561 --> 00:17:01,581
and future homosexual
meeting spot... open!

394
00:17:01,615 --> 00:17:03,900
Unhand that woman,
you bastard!

395
00:17:03,934 --> 00:17:05,568
Adam!

396
00:17:05,603 --> 00:17:09,072
Well, well, well, if it isn't
Mayor "Guns For Toys" West.

397
00:17:09,106 --> 00:17:11,674
The chair recognizes
your face!

398
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:13,726
<i>En garde!</i>

399
00:17:18,249 --> 00:17:19,349
Is the park open?

400
00:17:19,383 --> 00:17:20,700
Not yet!

401
00:17:24,922 --> 00:17:27,390
You call that kissing a baby?!

402
00:17:30,811 --> 00:17:32,562
That's how you kiss a baby.

403
00:17:36,784 --> 00:17:39,819
I hereby declare this
Stabby Eye Day!

404
00:17:41,989 --> 00:17:44,674
Oh, Adam, I'm so sorry!

405
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,309
Carol, I love you

406
00:17:46,343 --> 00:17:47,877
and I can't live
without you.

407
00:17:47,911 --> 00:17:50,580
Please, never let this happen
again.

408
00:17:50,614 --> 00:17:51,814
I won't, Adam.

409
00:17:51,849 --> 00:17:55,385
You're the only mayor for me.

410
00:17:55,419 --> 00:17:58,554
Hey-ey, Carol.
I almost didn't recognize you

411
00:17:58,589 --> 00:18:01,457
without my special sauce
all over your face.

412
00:18:07,431 --> 00:18:10,066
Is somebody out there?

413
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,634
Chris, it's me!

414
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:13,269
Uncle Herbert's
grandniece, Sandy!

415
00:18:13,304 --> 00:18:15,605
Oh, hi, Sandy. What's up?

416
00:18:15,639 --> 00:18:17,273
What do I say?

417
00:18:17,308 --> 00:18:18,941
You say,
"Chris, I wanted

418
00:18:18,976 --> 00:18:21,277
to come see you
because, well..."

419
00:18:21,312 --> 00:18:25,114
Chris, I wanted to come
see you because, well...

420
00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:26,983
I'm kind of a
lonely old man.

421
00:18:27,017 --> 00:18:28,284
Really?

422
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:31,354
Now, I know I'm not much
to look at,

423
00:18:31,388 --> 00:18:33,256
and ever since I got banned
from the arcade,

424
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,524
I don't know what I'm doing.

425
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:35,792
But if you're up for it,

426
00:18:35,826 --> 00:18:38,127
I'd like to spend some time
with you.

427
00:18:38,162 --> 00:18:39,746
Okay. Sure, Sandy!

428
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,814
I'll come right down!

429
00:18:41,849 --> 00:18:42,865
Thanks, Uncle Herbert.

430
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,101
I don't know how
I could ever repay you.

431
00:18:45,135 --> 00:18:47,637
Well, there
is one thing.

432
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:54,427
Also, if I gave you
a sandwich,

433
00:18:54,461 --> 00:18:57,497
do you think you could
get Chris to fart on it?

434
00:19:00,684 --> 00:19:03,770
Well, guess
I better be going.

435
00:19:03,804 --> 00:19:05,671
I gotta get this heart
to Madonna.

436
00:19:05,706 --> 00:19:08,574
Oh, my God! Madonna needs
a heart transplant?

437
00:19:08,609 --> 00:19:10,543
No, she just doesn't want
other people

438
00:19:10,577 --> 00:19:12,145
to have them
for some reason.

439
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:14,647
But before I go... Here.

440
00:19:14,681 --> 00:19:17,050
For me?

441
00:19:17,084 --> 00:19:18,534
My kidney!

442
00:19:18,569 --> 00:19:19,936
I wanted you to have it.

443
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:23,056
Oh, Toby, I love it!
Thank you.

444
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,958
This has been the best
Valentine's Day ever.

445
00:19:33,984 --> 00:19:35,418
Oh, Peter, it was fun

446
00:19:35,452 --> 00:19:37,186
spending the day
in bed with you.

447
00:19:37,221 --> 00:19:38,788
It sure was, Lois.

448
00:19:38,822 --> 00:19:41,023
Happy Valentine's Day.

449
00:19:44,411 --> 00:19:46,679
Hey, Lois,
remember our wedding?

450
00:19:46,713 --> 00:19:48,581
Yeah, I sure do.

451
00:19:48,615 --> 00:19:50,116
Remember the dance?

452
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,684
Of course I do, Peter.

453
00:19:51,718 --> 00:19:53,119
Who was that
half-Persian chick

454
00:19:53,153 --> 00:19:54,587
who was dancing
with your cousin?

455
00:19:54,621 --> 00:19:56,222
I think her name
was Flora.

456
00:19:56,256 --> 00:19:57,323
Yeah... yeah.

457
00:19:57,357 --> 00:19:59,242
Okay, all right,
I'm ready! I'm ready!

458
00:19:59,276 --> 00:20:01,043
What?
Shut up for ten minutes

459
00:20:01,078 --> 00:20:03,379
and pretend we're in the back
behind the speakers.

460
00:20:05,082 --> 00:20:08,050
