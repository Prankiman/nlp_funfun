1
00:00:34,094 --> 00:00:36,343
Oh, Peter, you're selling your anvil?

2
00:00:36,344 --> 00:00:39,061
Yeah, I've had a lot of good times
with this thing.

3
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:43,868
Ooh! A dollar!

4
00:00:44,525 --> 00:00:47,329
- Hey there, Chris.
- Hi, Mr. Herbert.

5
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,886
- Selling your old hand-me-downs?
- Yep.

6
00:00:49,887 --> 00:00:52,831
You got anything you used
to wear in the summertime?

7
00:00:52,835 --> 00:00:56,170
- Just these old shorts.
- Sweet Jesus.

8
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:59,404
- Give you a dollar for this.
- Sold.

9
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:06,051
Brian, where's Rupert?
I just left him here to watch my things.

10
00:01:06,668 --> 00:01:08,697
- What?
- Uh, nothing, I haven't seen him.

11
00:01:08,699 --> 00:01:12,021
It's not like him to wander off.
Rupert? Rupert!

12
00:01:12,127 --> 00:01:14,191
Oh, no. What if he's been kidnapped?

13
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,632
- Well, let's just calm down...
- I've got to save him, Brian.

14
00:01:16,637 --> 00:01:19,392
What if he's dead?
I don't think I can handle a funeral.

15
00:01:20,868 --> 00:01:24,030
Of all the souls I have
encountered in my travels,

16
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:25,513
his was the most...

17
00:01:26,638 --> 00:01:27,752
human.

18
00:01:28,037 --> 00:01:29,601
Orders... hup!

19
00:01:58,967 --> 00:02:01,591
Holy crap.
Evel Knievel gloves!

20
00:02:01,596 --> 00:02:04,050
I bet I could do a wheelie with these!
How much for the gloves?

21
00:02:04,056 --> 00:02:05,663
- Peter, those are yours.
- Ten bucks.

22
00:02:05,665 --> 00:02:08,741
Two. Seven. Four. $5.50. Ten. Sold!

23
00:02:08,745 --> 00:02:12,283
Sucker. I would've gone
to $15, easy. I am so stupid.

24
00:02:12,725 --> 00:02:14,082
Awesome!

25
00:02:14,478 --> 00:02:17,680
Peter, you can't drive the car over that.
You're gonna get hurt.

26
00:02:17,696 --> 00:02:20,882
Lois, I don't come down to Burger King
and tell you how to do your job.

27
00:02:20,888 --> 00:02:24,591
- Peter, I don't work at Burger...
- I don't work at burgaga... I'm busy.

28
00:02:24,795 --> 00:02:28,451
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have some death to defy.

29
00:02:38,628 --> 00:02:42,502
This is just like what happened with
Matthew Broderick, except no one's dead.

30
00:02:47,407 --> 00:02:49,390
- Hey, Joe.
- Good morning, Peter.

31
00:02:49,398 --> 00:02:52,281
- I'm here to revoke your driver's license.
- What?! Why?!

32
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:55,050
We got reckless driving,
disturbing the peace,

33
00:02:55,058 --> 00:02:57,670
plus the driver of one of
the other cars was a virgin

34
00:02:57,676 --> 00:03:00,462
whose hymen was busted
by the airbag, so rape.

35
00:03:00,466 --> 00:03:03,102
Okay, well, I guess
you can take my license.

36
00:03:03,105 --> 00:03:04,443
'Course it's all the way up here.

37
00:03:04,448 --> 00:03:06,152
Peter, knock if off. Give it to me.

38
00:03:06,155 --> 00:03:07,991
Give me the damn license.

39
00:03:08,005 --> 00:03:11,092
This is in poor taste, Peter.
You're starting to piss me off.

40
00:03:11,105 --> 00:03:13,403
You're starting to piss me off!

41
00:03:17,008 --> 00:03:20,493
Aw, man, this sucks. I got no license.
I can't go anywhere.

42
00:03:20,505 --> 00:03:23,470
Well, this is your own fault, Peter,
and if you want my opinion,

43
00:03:23,475 --> 00:03:26,302
a little time away from the bar
will do you some good.

44
00:03:26,486 --> 00:03:29,263
I'll show her.
I'll just go to another bar.

45
00:03:29,268 --> 00:03:31,142
<i>We now return to Cheers.</i>

46
00:03:31,255 --> 00:03:34,290
<i>- Norm!
- And Peter! Yeah!</i>

47
00:03:34,307 --> 00:03:36,493
How's life in the fast lane, Mr. Peterson?

48
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,741
- Griffin.
- I can't find the on-ramp, Woody.

49
00:03:38,757 --> 00:03:40,201
He was talking to me, Norm.

50
00:03:40,206 --> 00:03:42,560
Quit stealing my punch lines,
you fat drunk.

51
00:03:42,835 --> 00:03:46,613
That show stopped being funny after
Kirstie Alley ate Shelley Long.

52
00:03:46,615 --> 00:03:50,633
Ah, man, now I can't even watch TV.
What the hell am I gonna do all day?

53
00:03:50,635 --> 00:03:53,021
That's all right, that's okay.
I don't need TV.

54
00:03:53,027 --> 00:03:55,141
I'll just make my own sitcom in my head.

55
00:03:55,147 --> 00:03:58,123
And I'll give it
an upbeat '80s sitcom theme.

56
00:04:01,095 --> 00:04:03,981
<i>This time around, I'm staying at home.</i>

57
00:04:03,988 --> 00:04:07,190
<i>And things are gonna get better.</i>

58
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:10,203
<i>Settlin' in, lovin' my wife.</i>

59
00:04:10,205 --> 00:04:13,333
<i>But then I got that letter.</i>

60
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,321
<i>My Black Son, My Black Son.</i>

61
00:04:16,386 --> 00:04:19,642
<i>Now each day my heart is getting bigger.</i>

62
00:04:19,707 --> 00:04:24,230
<i>Don't even remember sleeping
with that lady, but I did.</i>

63
00:04:24,268 --> 00:04:27,260
<i>My Black Son. He's coming to stay.</i>

64
00:04:27,337 --> 00:04:32,400
<i>My Black Son. He's making each day...</i>

65
00:04:32,596 --> 00:04:34,392
<i>The best that he can.</i>

66
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,340
<i>Also he's a ninja.</i>

67
00:04:41,275 --> 00:04:43,490
Why have you brought me
to the toy store, Brian?

68
00:04:43,505 --> 00:04:45,090
I'm buying you another Rupert.

69
00:04:45,105 --> 00:04:46,593
Hey, this one's cute, huh?

70
00:04:46,606 --> 00:04:49,392
And if we buy it,
they save a real gorilla in the wild.

71
00:04:49,406 --> 00:04:52,893
And if we don't, they kill one.
Wow, these guys are playing hardball.

72
00:04:52,907 --> 00:04:56,693
You can't just take some Korean-made
velveteen primate and call it Rupert.

73
00:04:56,706 --> 00:05:00,202
Now come on, this is all time we could
be using to find Rupert's kidnappers.

74
00:05:00,285 --> 00:05:03,491
Look, I, uh...
I may as well come clean with you.

75
00:05:03,505 --> 00:05:05,393
Rupert wasn't kidnapped.

76
00:05:05,406 --> 00:05:08,101
I accidentally sold him at the yard sale.

77
00:05:08,405 --> 00:05:10,203
You son of a bitch!

78
00:05:17,387 --> 00:05:19,991
Come on, Stewie, I'm really sorry.
It was an accident.

79
00:05:20,008 --> 00:05:22,591
Damn you, Brian.
How could you sell Rupert?

80
00:05:22,607 --> 00:05:25,993
What you've done is more horrible
than sex with Sharon Stone.

81
00:05:26,006 --> 00:05:27,790
Wow, that was great!

82
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:29,690
One minute I'm filling up at Chevron,

83
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,892
and the next I'm having sex
with Sharon Stone.

84
00:05:31,905 --> 00:05:34,502
Yeah. Now comes the best part.

85
00:05:42,356 --> 00:05:46,492
- Get out of the fridge, Peter.
- There is no Peter, only Zuul.

86
00:05:46,505 --> 00:05:48,291
I said get out of the fridge!

87
00:05:48,305 --> 00:05:51,491
All right, all right! Geez, Lois,
I'm just trying to amuse myself,

88
00:05:51,505 --> 00:05:53,291
since I don't have a damn
driver's license.

89
00:05:53,295 --> 00:05:56,793
Peter, it's getting a little annoying
having you around the house all the time.

90
00:05:56,808 --> 00:06:00,173
So you'll be happy to know
I got you your own personal driver.

91
00:06:00,175 --> 00:06:03,540
My own driver?! Holy crap,
that's awesome! Where is he?

92
00:06:03,548 --> 00:06:05,950
- She's right here, Peter.
- Meg?!

93
00:06:05,957 --> 00:06:09,163
Yeah, Dad. I don't mind driving you
around till you get your license back.

94
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,593
What?!
Lois, this is the best you could do?!

95
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:14,592
Well, it was either Meg
or a talking monkey smoking a cigar,

96
00:06:14,605 --> 00:06:16,493
but I didn't you'd like that.

97
00:06:16,505 --> 00:06:18,893
I've already accepted another job.

98
00:06:18,906 --> 00:06:21,990
Lois, you picked the opposite
thing that I would like.

99
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,891
It's all right.
I would've driven you bananas.

100
00:06:24,905 --> 00:06:27,502
Oh, oh, and he makes jokes.
Nice going, Lois.

101
00:06:28,248 --> 00:06:29,600
Dad, are you ready?

102
00:06:32,965 --> 00:06:35,783
- What exactly are you trying to do?
- It's very simple, Brian.

103
00:06:35,788 --> 00:06:38,892
I've taken DNA from the dollar bill
you were paid for Rupert.

104
00:06:38,908 --> 00:06:41,822
Now to check that DNA
against the federal database.

105
00:06:41,915 --> 00:06:43,290
Ooh, we have a match!

106
00:06:43,308 --> 00:06:46,392
Stanford Cordray, 89 Spooner Street.

107
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:48,702
That's only a few blocks away.
Let's go!

108
00:06:54,316 --> 00:06:55,802
Hello? Hello?

109
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:00,382
It can't be.
This house is deserted.

110
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:04,791
He moved. He's gone.
Rupert's gone.

111
00:07:04,808 --> 00:07:07,602
Wait a minute, look!
The moving truck.

112
00:07:08,408 --> 00:07:09,800
We're not too late.

113
00:07:13,136 --> 00:07:16,302
- Can I help you, gentlemen?
- Follow that truck.

114
00:07:16,746 --> 00:07:18,890
Didn't you hear me?
I said, "Follow that truck. "

115
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:22,811
Oh, I heard you.
What I didn't hear was, "Please. "

116
00:07:22,816 --> 00:07:24,461
<i>Please follow the truck.</i>

117
00:07:27,616 --> 00:07:31,770
I always enjoy traveling companions.
Let's play 20 questions.

118
00:07:31,775 --> 00:07:34,141
Am I Bo Bice? Yes, I am.

119
00:07:34,145 --> 00:07:37,231
Well played, worthy adversary.

120
00:07:41,725 --> 00:07:44,571
We're gaining on him!
I'm coming, Rupert!

121
00:07:47,538 --> 00:07:51,042
- I'm sorry, but I can go no further.
- What?! Why not?!

122
00:07:51,048 --> 00:07:53,882
If I enter Connecticut,
I'm entering every state

123
00:07:53,888 --> 00:07:56,032
that Connecticut's ever been with.

124
00:07:56,038 --> 00:07:58,121
Good luck, brave travelers.

125
00:08:00,665 --> 00:08:03,513
No! We were so close!

126
00:08:07,715 --> 00:08:11,543
I say, what a bit of serendipity.
Now we've got that fellow's address.

127
00:08:11,545 --> 00:08:13,812
Let's see...
"Aspen, Colorado. "

128
00:08:13,816 --> 00:08:16,390
Well, you can forget that.
We're not going all the way to Aspen.

129
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,932
What?!
But I can't leave Rupert to perish.

130
00:08:18,936 --> 00:08:20,742
For the rest of my life,
I'll be as lonely

131
00:08:20,745 --> 00:08:23,671
as Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell
after the rapture.

132
00:08:23,696 --> 00:08:26,320
Damn it, Jerry, why are
we the only ones still here?

133
00:08:26,328 --> 00:08:28,542
I don't know, we hated
all the right things.

134
00:08:28,606 --> 00:08:31,102
- Now there's nothing left to hate.
- I'm gonna hate that rock.

135
00:08:31,116 --> 00:08:33,380
- No, I'm gonna hate that rock.
- Let's both hate that rock.

136
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,323
- I hate you.
- I hate you, too.

137
00:08:39,127 --> 00:08:41,190
Look, Stewie,
don't you think, at some point,

138
00:08:41,197 --> 00:08:42,841
you're gonna have to let Rupert go?

139
00:08:42,846 --> 00:08:45,152
I mean, you are getting a
little old to have a teddy bear.

140
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:46,970
- Brian, I'm one!
- Still? What?

141
00:08:46,973 --> 00:08:50,262
Look, I'm not going to Colorado.
I'm turning around and going home.

142
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:53,551
Fine, then, I'll go by myself.
See you from the back of my milk carton.

143
00:08:53,558 --> 00:08:56,877
Want that on your conscience, Brian?
Try explaining this to Lois.

144
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:00,721
You'll wind up in a Dumpster with a
bunch of slow, unadoptable greyhounds.

145
00:09:00,725 --> 00:09:03,132
Don't joke about that.
That's like the Holocaust to us.

146
00:09:03,138 --> 00:09:05,620
Yeah, well, when greyhounds
start running The New York Times

147
00:09:05,637 --> 00:09:07,693
and the World Bank,
I'll be more inclined to believe you.

148
00:09:07,698 --> 00:09:09,100
Now, are you coming or not?

149
00:09:09,485 --> 00:09:10,482
Fine.

150
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:18,103
<i>Take to the highway
Won't you lend me your name...</i>

151
00:09:18,105 --> 00:09:19,991
- Who sings that song?
- James Taylor.

152
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:21,370
Yeah, let's keep it that way.

153
00:09:22,627 --> 00:09:26,162
This sucks. Can you believe
I'm stuck with Meg driving me around?

154
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:28,353
Dad, it's just you and me in the car.

155
00:09:28,357 --> 00:09:29,673
Don't remind me.

156
00:09:29,677 --> 00:09:31,532
It's bad enough
I got a suspended license,

157
00:09:31,535 --> 00:09:34,213
I gotta ride around town
with Stinky McPoop-Pants.

158
00:09:34,217 --> 00:09:37,361
- I want apple juice.
- Dad, you left your apple juice at home.

159
00:09:37,365 --> 00:09:39,183
I want apple juice!

160
00:09:39,695 --> 00:09:42,453
- You want to watch SpongeBob?
- Yes.

161
00:09:42,718 --> 00:09:44,350
With apple juice.

162
00:09:50,495 --> 00:09:52,153
SpongeBob.

163
00:09:57,327 --> 00:10:00,423
Thanks for the ride, Bandit.
Good luck tapping some of that

164
00:10:00,426 --> 00:10:04,410
hot, hot Sally Field tail.

165
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:07,070
Knock it off. I don't like it
any more than you do.

166
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:09,652
Where the hell are we?

167
00:10:12,216 --> 00:10:14,513
Oh, this is history right here, Brian.

168
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:17,380
Gettysburg. Billy Yanks. The 20th Maine.

169
00:10:17,385 --> 00:10:18,963
So many lives lost.

170
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:21,243
All in pursuit of the ideal that no man

171
00:10:21,248 --> 00:10:23,740
should be subjugated
because of the color of his skin.

172
00:10:23,746 --> 00:10:26,043
These boys paid the ultimate price here.

173
00:10:26,047 --> 00:10:28,263
For equality. For humanity.

174
00:10:28,577 --> 00:10:30,933
- You're welcome.
- I'm sorry?

175
00:10:30,936 --> 00:10:33,341
I'm just sayin', make it
worth our while, you know?

176
00:10:33,345 --> 00:10:36,801
We wrote a pretty big check
for you folks here, so, um...

177
00:10:36,807 --> 00:10:40,083
You know, whatever. It's fine. It's fine.
Doesn't matter. Just, uh... I...

178
00:10:40,085 --> 00:10:42,393
Just hope you're making the best
of what we gave you here.

179
00:10:42,397 --> 00:10:44,973
I would say that,
given the events that preceded it,

180
00:10:44,975 --> 00:10:48,071
the couple hundred years or so,
maybe we're about even.

181
00:10:48,076 --> 00:10:49,863
Yeah, no, no. We gave more.

182
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,520
Hey, Cleveland,
who would you rather do:

183
00:10:55,526 --> 00:10:59,642
Queen Latifah or Halle Berry,
but she's been dead for six hours?

184
00:10:59,645 --> 00:11:02,381
Aw, man.
That's a tough one.

185
00:11:02,388 --> 00:11:05,000
God, will you guys
just shut up back there?!

186
00:11:07,148 --> 00:11:09,892
Aah! Gross!
Would you stop it? Stop it!

187
00:11:10,585 --> 00:11:12,680
Hey, guys, check this out.

188
00:11:15,288 --> 00:11:18,070
Hey, Meg, don't be such a hothead.

189
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:19,033
What?!

190
00:11:19,037 --> 00:11:21,940
Hey, Meg, you sure look hot today.

191
00:11:21,946 --> 00:11:22,940
What?!

192
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:25,340
Hey, Meg, I lit your scalp on fire.

193
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,283
Don't worry, I'll put it out.

194
00:11:34,546 --> 00:11:37,261
What the hell is your problem,
you dumb bimbo?!

195
00:11:38,956 --> 00:11:40,840
Oh, oh, God, stop!

196
00:11:48,277 --> 00:11:51,523
Meg, that was awesome.

197
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:58,820
If we wanna get to Aspen, we're gonna
have to get over those mountains somehow.

198
00:12:00,936 --> 00:12:03,672
Excuse me, uh, how much is it
to rent a helicopter?

199
00:12:03,677 --> 00:12:06,483
It's ten bucks an hour.
But there's a $100,000 deposit.

200
00:12:06,488 --> 00:12:08,540
Oh, God.
Looks like we're walking.

201
00:12:08,546 --> 00:12:12,232
Wait a minute, it says here
you accept cash, check or a jaunty tune.

202
00:12:12,238 --> 00:12:14,470
Well, this rental agreement
was drafted back

203
00:12:14,475 --> 00:12:16,842
when musicals were culturally relevant.

204
00:12:16,848 --> 00:12:19,170
Unfortunately, that's no longer the case.

205
00:12:19,175 --> 00:12:22,381
Well, I can prove to you
that's a whole lot of nonsense.

206
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:28,561
<i>You may think that song and dance
is dated boring and dry.</i>

207
00:12:28,568 --> 00:12:33,051
<>But you might just learn to
like it if you give it a try.

208
00:12:33,058 --> 00:12:37,020
<i>You could laugh and sing and dance
as gaily as an elf.</i>

209
00:12:37,026 --> 00:12:41,581
<i>But just in case you don't believe me,
ask the man himself.</i>

210
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,790
Mr. Kelly?
Will you show us?

211
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:45,641
- I'll show you.
- Let's do it.

212
00:12:45,706 --> 00:12:48,191
<i>- Good. One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.</i>

213
00:12:48,197 --> 00:12:50,141
<i>- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.</i>

214
00:12:50,146 --> 00:12:52,221
<i>- La, la, la, la, la, la.
- La, la, la, la, la, la.</i>

215
00:12:52,225 --> 00:12:54,402
- You see?
- It's easy.

216
00:14:27,435 --> 00:14:29,611
Look at me! I'm dancing!

217
00:14:44,828 --> 00:14:47,231
Okay, you can have the helicopter.

218
00:14:51,235 --> 00:14:55,410
Brian, be careful 'cause the mountains
are the same color as the sky.

219
00:14:55,425 --> 00:14:56,151
What?

220
00:14:56,158 --> 00:15:00,102
I said, be careful 'cause the mountains
are the same color as the...

221
00:15:02,885 --> 00:15:06,181
- What the hell was that?
- I'm practicing my comedy crash.

222
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:08,373
Well, keep it down
'cause I'm trying to...

223
00:15:34,156 --> 00:15:38,381
Imagine the dance I'm gonna have
to do to get our security deposit back.

224
00:15:44,546 --> 00:15:47,281
Oh, my God! Brian, look!

225
00:15:47,445 --> 00:15:49,663
It's Aspen. We made it.

226
00:15:49,668 --> 00:15:52,471
Well, looks like you're gonna be
reunited with Rupert after all.

227
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:55,653
And just in time, too.
I can't keep my teeth from chattering.

228
00:15:56,658 --> 00:15:57,713
Isn't that fun?

229
00:15:57,716 --> 00:16:00,810
I got these at Jack's Joke Shop
in South Attleboro, Massachusetts.

230
00:16:00,817 --> 00:16:03,080
Remember, if it ain't funny,
it ain't worth Jack.

231
00:16:04,116 --> 00:16:05,100
Bitch.

232
00:16:07,805 --> 00:16:10,702
Aw, you should've seen what
our amazing, freakin' daughter

233
00:16:10,705 --> 00:16:12,860
did to that guy, Lois.
She kicked his ass.

234
00:16:12,868 --> 00:16:16,841
- It was like what life did to Dana Plato.
- Meg, how could you do that?!

235
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:18,821
You should call that man and apologize.

236
00:16:18,826 --> 00:16:21,342
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't you talk to her like that.

237
00:16:21,345 --> 00:16:23,723
Meg's as cool as the
other side of the pillow.

238
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,730
- Billy Dee Williams.
- Hello, Peter.

239
00:16:28,735 --> 00:16:33,382
Welcome to the cool side of the pillow.
You've had a hard day.

240
00:16:33,387 --> 00:16:37,730
Rest that weary head of yours
and drift on off to dreamland.

241
00:16:38,928 --> 00:16:41,620
Works every time.

242
00:16:42,438 --> 00:16:45,321
Well, this is the place.
Looks pretty fancy.

243
00:16:47,638 --> 00:16:50,892
- Can I help you?
- Uh, yes, my name's Brian, um...

244
00:16:50,896 --> 00:16:52,831
Look, to make a long story short,

245
00:16:52,838 --> 00:16:56,860
I accidentally sold you a teddy bear
back in Rhode Island, and...

246
00:16:56,965 --> 00:16:59,001
I kind of need it back.

247
00:17:00,795 --> 00:17:04,031
- Rupert! It's, it's Rupert!
- Stanford, who is it?

248
00:17:04,038 --> 00:17:06,060
It's nothing, dear, I'll handle it.

249
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:09,282
I'm sorry, but that bear belongs
to Timmy. Now, please leave.

250
00:17:11,415 --> 00:17:14,103
Wait, wait. How about a ski off?

251
00:17:14,175 --> 00:17:15,903
- What...?
- You heard me.

252
00:17:15,906 --> 00:17:19,240
First one down the mountain wins.
If I win, I get Rupert.

253
00:17:19,245 --> 00:17:21,732
Interesting. What do I get if I win?

254
00:17:21,738 --> 00:17:24,253
- My dog.
- Hmm. What can he do?

255
00:17:26,065 --> 00:17:29,701
If you put peanut butter anywhere
on your body, he'll lick it off.

256
00:17:30,646 --> 00:17:32,563
Anywhere.

257
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:35,191
Well, I did go to Choate.

258
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,522
All right, it's a deal.

259
00:17:36,607 --> 00:17:40,191
<i>She's the kind of girl
who's not too shy.</i>

260
00:17:40,197 --> 00:17:43,831
<i>And I can tell I'm her kind of guy.</i>

261
00:17:43,836 --> 00:17:47,683
<i>She danced close to me
like I hoped she would.</i>

262
00:17:47,686 --> 00:17:50,761
<i>She danced for me
like I hoped she would.</i>

263
00:17:50,766 --> 00:17:55,751
<i>Somethin' tells me
I'm into somethin' good...</i>

264
00:18:00,366 --> 00:18:03,170
You know, Dad, it's been really great
hanging out with you.

265
00:18:03,176 --> 00:18:06,170
I know there's probably a million
things you'd rather be doing.

266
00:18:06,177 --> 00:18:09,071
Are you kidding, Meg?
I've had more fun with you than I did

267
00:18:09,077 --> 00:18:12,403
going to see Lost in Translation
with Cleveland and Quagmire.

268
00:18:13,297 --> 00:18:17,400
- What do you think he whisper to her?
- I'll bet it was just right.

269
00:18:17,445 --> 00:18:20,301
Look, I know sometimes
I give you a hard time.

270
00:18:20,305 --> 00:18:23,093
You know, calling you names,
reading your diary,

271
00:18:23,098 --> 00:18:25,361
farting in your cereal
when you go to get milk

272
00:18:25,366 --> 00:18:28,793
and then laughing: "Ha-ha ha!
She doesn't know she's eating my fart. "

273
00:18:28,806 --> 00:18:31,562
But, you know, Meg,
I'm starting to realize

274
00:18:31,565 --> 00:18:35,432
- I got a really wonderful daughter.
- Thanks, Dad.

275
00:18:35,437 --> 00:18:39,351
Peter, good news. Your suspension is up.
You can have your license back.

276
00:18:39,355 --> 00:18:41,651
You... you mean it? I'm free?

277
00:18:41,657 --> 00:18:44,440
No more getting driven around?
Aw, sweet!

278
00:18:44,527 --> 00:18:47,373
So, I guess this means
you don't need me anymore.

279
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,091
You'll probably go back to
treating me like crap, huh?

280
00:18:50,097 --> 00:18:52,980
Well, maybe just to keep up
appearances in front of the family.

281
00:18:52,986 --> 00:18:55,892
You know, peer pressure and all that.
But from now on, Meg,

282
00:18:55,896 --> 00:18:58,712
you and me are secret best friends.

283
00:18:58,718 --> 00:19:00,970
Who wants a glass of fresh lemonade?

284
00:19:00,977 --> 00:19:01,891
Not me!

285
00:19:01,895 --> 00:19:05,100
What I want is a fresh glass
of better daughter!

286
00:19:18,065 --> 00:19:20,393
Stewie, do you really think
you can beat this guy?

287
00:19:20,406 --> 00:19:22,960
Trust me, Brian, I've got
a few tricks up my sleeve.

288
00:19:32,407 --> 00:19:35,891
Oh, no, if only I had rockets in my skis.

289
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,570
Oh, wait, I totally have rockets
in my skis.

290
00:19:44,307 --> 00:19:48,001
And now I just sit back,
relax and watch my progress.

291
00:19:53,408 --> 00:19:56,290
- Tea, sir?
- Oh, thank you, Crone.

292
00:19:56,306 --> 00:19:58,190
You're so pleasant.

293
00:19:58,205 --> 00:20:00,590
Would you like to check
on the race, sir?

294
00:20:00,607 --> 00:20:02,002
Yes, why not.

295
00:20:13,865 --> 00:20:16,092
Well, that's it, I suppose.

296
00:20:16,107 --> 00:20:18,493
Listen, I'm, I'm really sorry, Stewie.

297
00:20:18,507 --> 00:20:21,593
- I know how much Rupert meant to you.
- I don't know, Brian,

298
00:20:21,607 --> 00:20:23,690
maybe this is a sign that you were right.

299
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:26,402
Maybe I am getting too old for Rupert.

300
00:20:26,705 --> 00:20:29,701
I guess I've just got to let him go.

301
00:20:30,307 --> 00:20:32,592
That's very grown up of you, Stewie.

302
00:20:32,605 --> 00:20:36,593
Hey, dog, let's go.
My dad won you fair and square.

303
00:20:36,605 --> 00:20:38,812
You're not really gonna
live with them, are you?

304
00:20:38,825 --> 00:20:39,641
No.

305
00:20:39,646 --> 00:20:41,460
You're not really over Rupert are you?

306
00:20:41,465 --> 00:20:43,033
- No.
- That's what I thought.

307
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:44,800
Oh, Crone.

308
00:20:49,528 --> 00:20:51,691
- How are we gonna get out of here?
- You still got the starting gun?

309
00:20:51,706 --> 00:20:52,893
- Yeah.
- Give it to me.

310
00:20:54,808 --> 00:20:57,912
Get out of the fucking car! Get out
of the fucking car right now, man!

311
00:20:57,915 --> 00:20:59,793
- Oh, Jesus!
- Get out of the fucking car.

312
00:20:59,806 --> 00:21:01,192
Do it! I don't give a fuck!

313
00:21:01,206 --> 00:21:03,701
I'll fucking kill you!
Get out of this fucking car!

314
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:08,093
- Did we just carjack someone?
- We sure did, Brian.

315
00:21:08,106 --> 00:21:09,600
We sure did.
