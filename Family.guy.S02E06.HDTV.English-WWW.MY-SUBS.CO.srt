00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,800
"It seems today that all you see

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,200
"is violence in movies and sex on TV

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,900
"But where are those good,
old-fashioned values

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,500
"on which we used to rely?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,800
"Lucky there's a family guy

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,500
"Lucky there's a man who'll
positively tell you

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,200
"all the things that make us

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,600
"laugh 'n' cry

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,700
"He's a family guy"

10
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,700
- I'm Morley Safer.
- I'm Mike Wallace.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,800
- I'm Ed Bradley.
- I'm Lesley Stahl.

12
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,900
And one of you is hung like an elf.

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,500
I feel so naughty.
Lois, what are you doing?

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,900
Neither of us is drunk.

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,400
Knock it off!

16
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,600
Oh, my God! I found a lump!
A breast lump!

17
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,500
The important thing is to stay calm.
It's probably nothing, honey.

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,500
That's easy for you to say.
You get to keep both your cans.

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,700
Peter, don't talk like that!
You'll see a doctor tomorrow and...

20
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,200
No. I'm not gonna see a doctor, Lois.

21
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,200
The healthiest thing we can do is just
ignore this and pretend it doesn't exist.

22
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,100
Just like we do with the squid.

23
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,300
Earthquake.
Truck going by.

24
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,100
I'm gonna be fine.
Nothing to worry about.

25
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,100
Morning.

26
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,500
Give it to me straight, Doc.
How long do I have?

27
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,100
Mr. Griffin, I'd say you have
about a month to live.

28
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,600
But what the hell do I know?
I've been sued by every patient I ever had.

29
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,400
Look at the size of this file.

30
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,800
This is... Wow.

31
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,100
Let's just wait for the test results.

32
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,300
Finish up, honey.
Then I'll put you down for a nice nap.

33
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,300
No! I shall put you down
for a nap, Mother!

34
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,600
Blast!

35
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,400
I'm so worried about your father.

36
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,700
You mean because
he's a borderline alcoholic?

37
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,000
No. Mommy's made peace with that.

38
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,400
Because he's got a lump on his booby.

39
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,100
Chris, that's a terrible word, "booby."

40
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,300
Mom, Debbie Miller's dad had a lump
on his breast, and he turned out okay.

41
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,700
Really? Who's Debbie Miller?

42
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,300
A girl I just made up.

43
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,900
Look. Here they are. My family.

44
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,000
Guys, I don't say this often enough,
but I'm gonna die.

45
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,600
Oh, my God.
High five! Anyone?

46
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,900
Anyone?

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,700
You can't die! Who's gonna take me
to the Father-Son dance?

48
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,400
Listen, I've had a good life.

49
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,800
You can always be proud of your father
and all of his accomplishments.

50
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,800
Accomplishments?
Go to your room.

51
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,500
Peter, there's no way you could die.

52
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,100
You're the most important character
in this family.

53
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,700
I'll take this one.
But I won't pay a cent over $60.

54
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,200
Sir, that casket costs $1,000.

55
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,700
Okay, $70.
What?

56
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,100
$2,000.
That's twice the cost!

57
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,900
$40.
What?

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,900
He doesn't know how to haggle.

59
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,600
Peter, what's going on?

60
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,200
I'm selling all my worldly goods,
so you'll have some cash when I'm dead.

61
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,000
Yeah, a lot of memories here.
Look, my first bike.

62
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,300
Boy, I had so much fun playing with that.

63
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,900
More tea, Mr. Bike?

64
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,800
Peter, this is ridiculous.
You're going to be fine.

65
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,800
Dad, the doctor called.
Your test results are in.

66
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,900
This doesn't look very good.
No, this doesn't look very good at all.

67
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,800
My nephew drew my portrait.
It doesn't look a thing like me.

68
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,400
Look at the nose. It's all...

69
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,600
Will you just tell us about Peter's tests?

70
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,700
Okay. Mr. Griffin,
all your tests came back negative.

71
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,900
As it turns out, the lump on your chest
was just a fatty corpuscle.

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,300
Fatty corpuscle? Wait a minute.
How the hell can a dead comedian...

73
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,300
...from the silent movie era
be lodged in my left bosom?

74
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,000
Mr. Griffin, I'm saying you're fine.

75
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,400
I'm fine? What?
Are you coming on to me now?

76
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,600
Peter, he's not coming on to you.
He's trying to tell you that you're healthy.

77
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,700
Can't it be both?

78
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,400
My sweetie is okay.

79
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,800
Better than okay, Lois.
From now on, I'm gonna appreciate...

80
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,200
...all the little things in life,
like you and the kids.

81
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,100
Is this the price of my bill
or my phone number?

82
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,800
Your phone number.

83
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,700
It's still pretty pricey!
Peter, who cares how much it is?

84
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,000
You've just got the most important
bill of all, a clean bill of health.

85
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,200
Jeez, Lois. How long you been waiting
to crack out that gem?

86
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,900
This sucks, Brian.
Why should I have to pay this?

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,400
- There's nothing wrong with me.
- Too bad you're not dying.

88
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,600
Wait a second. That's it!
They can't make a dead guy pay his bill.

89
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,400
All I gotta do is write "deceased"
right here where it says "name."

90
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,200
And where it says "sex,"
I'll write, "No, thanks. I'm dead."

91
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,900
It's bulletproof.

92
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,500
But you promised
the fat one would perish.

93
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,900
I know. Isn't it wonderful, honey?
Your father is alive and well...

94
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,400
...and we can be a family for a good long...

95
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,700
Who are you?

96
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,500
I'm Calista Flockhart. Who the
hell do you think I am? I'm Death.

97
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,800
Which one of you is Peter Griffin?

98
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,200
He is.

99
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,100
Come on, man.
Which one of you is Peter Griffin?

100
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,900
This is Peter Griffin.

101
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,700
That's a good one.

102
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,300
Why are you...

103
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,200
No, wait.
I'm not finished holding my sides.

104
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,200
Why are...

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Why...

106
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,200
Why are you here?
The doctor said Peter was okay.

107
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,400
The doctor!
I guess he must know, right?

108
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,800
I mean, he's a doctor and everything,
and I'm just Death!

109
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,900
Excuse me. Hello!
I'm Stewie. Big fan.

110
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,900
Death, you made a mistake.
I'm not supposed to be dead.

111
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,800
I made a mistake? What's this?

112
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,800
Peter, is that your handwriting?

113
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,700
How did you get that?

114
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,600
Your HMO emailed it to me.

115
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,100
I know my doctor was hitting on me,
but you don't have to call him names.

116
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,900
I don't care what that says!
You can't take my husband!

117
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Mother! Where are your manners?
Don't argue with our guest!

118
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,700
Won't you join us for dinner?
Oh, no. I don't want to impose.

119
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,100
Is that turkey?
Yes, Death.

120
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,800
We were in the middle of a turkey dinner
to celebrate Peter's good health.

121
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,900
Do you mind?

122
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,100
Mind? Of course not.
It would be an honor.

123
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,900
No, it would be a privilege. Oh, dear.
Listen to me prattling on like a schoolgirl.

124
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,000
Come, come.
You, heat up some gravy for our guest!

125
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,400
My last helping of white meat
was drier than Oscar Wilde.

126
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,300
How did you do that?

127
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,900
Let's just say,
when I was younger...

128
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,300
...I did some films
I'm not particularly proud of.

129
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,900
That does it for me.

130
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,800
Wait! You can't go.

131
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,500
After dinner,
we usually go into the living room...

132
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,800
...and live for another 40 or 50 years.

133
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,800
40 or... Let's go.

134
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I guess this is good-bye.
Meg, you're the man of the family now.

135
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,000
Be strong.

136
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,900
Daddy.

137
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,700
Stewie, I guess I'm not gonna be here
to see you become a man.

138
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,700
Yes. I think we all know
what that's going to be like.

139
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,900
A 20-minute call to Larchmont?
Who do we know in Larchmont?

140
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,600
My sister-in-law.

141
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,800
Yes, right. Right. Carol. Yes.
That's right. How is Carol?

142
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,500
- Brian.
- Oh, God.

143
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,600
- Daddy, can I come with you?
- Ask your mother.

144
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,400
No, you can't go with him!

145
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,600
- Oh, Peter.
- Lois.

146
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,800
Okay, that's good. Come on now.

147
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,300
Hey, Death, you got a file on me?
Yeah, it's in the car, I think.

148
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,300
Does it mention that I ran two weeks
of Junior Varsity track?

149
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,400
Let's not do this. I caught Flo Jo.
You don't think I can catch you?

150
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,700
My ankle!

151
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,400
Yeah, listen,
don't help or anything. I'm totally fine.

152
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,500
Damn Irish.

153
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,700
Yeah. That felt good,
dropping me on the couch like that.

154
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,400
Here's some Tylenol.
Great. Tylenol. I asked for Advil.

155
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,300
But, you know, whatever. That's good.

156
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,000
I got a B-plus in Health.
Is there anything I can do?

157
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,700
Why don't you boil some water
and rip up some sheets there, Einstein.

158
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,300
It's a sprained ankle.

159
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,300
I have to stay off it for a while.
Not here.

160
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,400
Why?
You tried to kill me!

161
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,200
Besides, how are we supposed
to explain you to Mr. Roper?

162
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,500
It's okay, Death.
You just worry about feeling better.

163
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,000
What the hell are you doing?

164
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,400
Peter, don't you see?
As long as he's here, you can't die.

165
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,100
Go on.
That's it.

166
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,500
Wait a minute.
So no matter what I do, I won't die?

167
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,500
Make yourself at home, Death.

168
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,100
I'm going out for a while.
Wait.

169
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,200
You can't tell anyone I'm here.
For if humanity discovers...

170
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,400
...l'm no longer lurking in the shadows,
consequences will be dire.

171
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,800
Go on.
That's it.

172
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,000
What the hell do you see in him?

173
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,200
What the hell do you see in him?

174
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,100
Peter, where are you going?

175
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,900
Lois, 10 minutes ago,
I was staring Death in the face.

176
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Now that I've been given another chance...

177
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,200
...l'm gonna do the one thing
I've always dreamed of doing.

178
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,300
I'm gonna jump off this building.

179
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,700
Could you repeat that, please, Peter?
I believe I had something crazy in my ear.

180
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,800
Hold the phone.

181
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You took me away from
a Swedish girlie-girl...

182
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,400
...and her paralyzed,
but trusting, cousin for this?

183
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,100
- $1,000 says I live.
- $1,000, huh?

184
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,400
- What the hell?
- Okay.

185
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,100
Look at that. I beat my loogie.

186
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,300
It's your turn, Death.

187
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,900
I know I should find this ironic,
but I'm just bored as hell.

188
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,200
How old is this TV?

189
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,800
You can probably get
the DuMont Network on this thing.

190
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,900
Peter is a good man
and a wonderful father.

191
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,100
Here it comes.

192
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,600
Could you please find it in your heart
to spare him?

193
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,400
After all, it isn't really his time.

194
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,700
What did you use
for this cocoa, crap?

195
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,000
If you want me to make it again...
Sorry, my fault.

196
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,900
I just assumed you were gonna make it
with milk, not crap!

197
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,700
I'll be right back.

198
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,500
I brought you a magazine.
Glamour, great.

199
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,700
I can learn how to please my man.
Go get me an Entertainment Weekly.

200
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,900
I hear it's got a great picture of me
sneaking up on Tom Snyder.

201
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,400
Victory is mine!

202
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,800
Wow. I should really
watch where I'm going.

203
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,600
What the deuce?

204
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,100
Of course!

205
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,800
It seems with Death incapacitated,
my matricidal efforts are futile.

206
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,800
I must do all I can to accelerate
his convalescence.

207
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,500
"Knick-knack paddywhack,
give a dog a bone"

208
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,800
I can't believe you drank 300 bottles
of beer without succumbing...

209
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,400
...to alcohol poisoning.

210
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
Peter, are you a witch?

211
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,400
Yeah. But don't tell anyone.
The consequences could be dire!

212
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,000
You guys, I bet I can go up to each one
of those scary-looking bikers and say:

213
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,500
"Aren't you Richard Simmons?"

214
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,400
- Peter, no!
- Now you're being brainless.

215
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,300
Aren't you Richard Simmons?

216
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,900
Aren't you Richard Simmons' best friend,
Richard Simmons?

217
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Shut up!

218
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,300
That feels good.

219
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,400
Actually, kid, I kind of fell into this gig.
I really wanted to be a wood nymph.

220
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,500
Man, the second Dad found out,
he started in with the whole:

221
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,300
"I have no son. I have no son,"
and Mom just stood there.

222
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,700
Yes. Mothers can be quite
the botheration, can't they?

223
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,900
That's why we've got to get you well.

224
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,400
- What was that?
- Nothing!

225
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,300
Stewie, leave Death alone.

226
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,300
He's okay.
He reminds me a lot of me at that age.

227
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,100
I hope his teen years go better than mine.
Boy, talk about awkward.

228
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,400
Oh, Sandy! Sandy!

229
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,500
Sandy? Not again.

230
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,700
I'm gonna be a virgin forever.

231
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,300
Or am I?

232
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,700
Can we please talk about Peter?

233
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,900
He has so much to live for, Death.
He loves his children and me...

234
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,700
Okay. I'll spare his life.

235
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,800
But you owe me, if you get my drift.

236
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,200
What the hell are you doing?
I was talking about another fruit cup.

237
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,500
Not bad, though.

238
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,300
Peter,
Death just agreed to let you live.

239
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,000
Oh, man. This really is my night.
I get to live, and I'm on TV.

240
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,000
Our top story tonight,
the rules of death no longer apply.

241
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,300
That's right, Tom.

242
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:37,300
Our own Asian reporter, Trisha Takanawa,
filed this report, all by herself!

243
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm here with Peter Griffin,
the man who claims he withstood...

244
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,900
...a barrage of bullets and did not die.

245
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,300
Peter, are you saying
that if I shoot you in the head...

246
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,400
...with this Channel 5 pistol,
you'll be completely unharmed?

247
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,500
Why don't you give it a shot?

248
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,400
Okay, here goes.

249
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,800
What have I done?

250
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,300
You're awful.

251
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,200
- Fascinating story, Tom.
- It sure is, Diane.

252
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,300
And since the laws of death
no longer apply, I can do this.

253
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,300
That's right, Tom.

254
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,900
And now it's time for sports.

255
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,600
The whole world is laughing
at me. This is high school all over again.

256
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,300
Well, I'll show them! I'll show all of them!
Oh, my God, that hurts!

257
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,200
You're not killing anyone tonight, mister!
Not on that ankle.

258
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,300
This is all your fault.
And there's only one solution.

259
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,200
You have to go out there and do my job.

260
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,000
You have to be Death!

261
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,700
Boy, this doesn't leave much
to the imagination.

262
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,400
Death, there is no way
Peter can do your job.

263
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,100
He could never kill anyone.

264
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,100
Yeah! I've thought about it,
like in church and stuff...

265
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,700
...but I don't think I could ever do
what you do.

266
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,100
So you're better than me?

267
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,400
I'm tired of always being the bad guy.
What I do has to be done.

268
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,300
He's right. You've disturbed
the natural order.

269
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,800
People need to be able to die.

270
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,100
No!

271
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,200
- Actually, I think I'm gonna be okay.
- Oh, Jack.

272
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,000
Now we can get married
and everything you promised.

273
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,400
Yeah, about that...

274
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,700
...I was pretty sure I was gonna die...

275
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,600
...because there's this girl in New York,
and it's getting kind of serious.

276
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,200
But thanks for letting me draw you naked.

277
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,900
I still can't believe you let me do that!

278
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,300
You're saying the only way to make
the world right is for me to kill someone?

279
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,700
You could kill Lois.
No. One death isn't gonna do it.

280
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,400
You have to do something that will
get everyone's attention, something huge.

281
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,300
How about if you blow up the earth?

282
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,700
Too huge.
But you're thinking. I like that.

283
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,200
You could kill any girls
who are prettier than me.

284
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,200
That would just leave England.
Wait. I have it.

285
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,200
I'm a genius.
You'll kill the kids from Dawson's Creek!

286
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,000
I knew it! As soon as that show
came on the air, I said:

287
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,400
"I'm gonna be the one
who has to kill these kids."

288
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,500
It's true. He did say it.
Hot, young celebrities.

289
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,100
It's perfect!

290
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,400
The kids are on their way to LA
to renegotiate their contracts.

291
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:24,300
But their plane is gonna be making
a little stopover in Rhode Island.

292
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,000
If you go now, you'll catch them.
No way.

293
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,600
I'm not doing your dirty work.
There's no way I'm getting on that plane.

294
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,600
Absolutely no way, and that's final.

295
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,300
See? I'm still here.

296
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,800
There's nothing you can say
that'll change my mind.

297
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,800
You kill them, or I kill you.

298
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,700
Crap!

299
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,300
Nice plant.

300
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,300
Note to self, do not go to the bathroom.

301
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,900
James,
your last movie killed at the box office.

302
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,500
Your Q-rating's through the roof.

303
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,300
It's time we ditched the WB
and concentrate on features.

304
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,200
I don't know who you are,
but just because you're sitting...

305
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,300
...across from me doesn't mean
you can give me career advice.

306
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,000
- Will you sign my ass?
- You have a pen?

307
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,100
Hello, Death?
Guess where I'm calling from?

308
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,300
A plane!
That's great.

309
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,400
Are those kids on board?
Yeah.

310
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,500
About that,
I don't think I can go through with it.

311
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,300
Peter, listen, without death,
the world would be a terrible place.

312
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,900
Imagine a world
where Hitler was still alive.

313
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,600
Today on Hitler,
we'll be talking with Christian Slater.

314
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,200
Now, they tell me in your next movie,
we get to see your butt.

315
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,000
Yes, you do.
Can we see it right now?

316
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,400
All right.
He's going to do it!

317
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,300
If you're going to be in L.A.
And would like tickets to Hitler...

318
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,900
...call 213-du werdest
eine Krankenschwester brauchen!

319
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Peter, all you gotta do is sit there.
The plane is gonna crash in LA.

320
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,200
Pilot error. Big mess. Everybody dies.

321
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,100
Jeez, everybody?
Except you.

322
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,900
Hold on, I'm getting another call. Brenda?

323
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,300
It's still me.
Brenda?

324
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,500
Yes? Just kidding, it's still me.

325
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,600
We now begin our final approach
into Los Angeles International.

326
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,700
If you look out the window,
you'll see the San Fernando Valley...

327
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,900
...where my brother Gary makes
a very nice living directing porn.

328
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,900
We'll be on the ground in 10 minutes.

329
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,200
"We like being alive,
we like being alive

330
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,600
"We like being, oh, we like being,
oh, we like being alive"

331
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,300
I guess it's their time.

332
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,700
Boy, for a teacher,
you sure make love good.

333
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,300
Actually, it's "well," Pacey.
You mean to say, I make love "well."

334
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,000
- You're good to go again, right?
- Yeah.

335
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,500
Peter? Hello? Peter,
are you there? I can hear you breathing?

336
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,300
Yeah, I'm here. And you can forget it.
I've changed my mind.

337
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,400
I don't care if you do kill me,
I'm not gonna kill those kids.

338
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,200
If they die, I'll have nothing
to watch on Wednesdays...

339
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,600
...other than the fine programs on Fox.

340
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,000
Open up in there!

341
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,000
What are you doing? You're not a pilot.
I know every pilot in the world!

342
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,200
I'm here to keep you from making an error.
A pilot error.

343
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,100
Jeez, I probably should've worn mittens!

344
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,300
Nice going, fat...

345
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,000
I was just trying to save your lives.
But now you're all gonna die.

346
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,500
- No one can land this plane.
- I can.

347
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,100
Thank God! It's Karen Black!

348
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,200
She landed a busted plane in Airport '75?

349
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,100
It was a movie in the '70s.

350
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,900
You damn kids with your music.

351
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,400
Both of the pilots were killed.

352
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,400
Fortunately for the other passengers,
actress Karen Black...

353
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,200
...star of such films as Nashville
and Five Easy Pieces, was on board.

354
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:58,300
Hats off to Miss Black for proving
once again that, given the opportunity...

355
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,500
...actresses over 50 can land large aircraft.

356
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,100
Karen Black. What an obscure reference!

357
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,600
What the hell? I told you to waste
the Dawson's Creek kids.

358
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,800
You're missing
the important thing here.

359
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,900
You said you wanted everyone to know
the rules of death apply.

360
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,500
Now the whole world does.
I guess so.

361
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,300
My ankle's starting to feel better.
I should probably get out of your hair.

362
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,900
But you just got here!

363
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,800
We can stay in touch, can't we?
What's your e-mail?

364
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,100
Mine is "loismustdie," all one word,
"@yahoo.com."

365
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,900
Wait a second. Death?

366
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I used to fear you,
but now I'm glad we met.

367
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,100
Because you've given me a great gift.
The complete Boz Scaggs.

368
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,500
How did you know?
I just had a feeling.

369
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,600
We're gonna miss you, Death.
Don't worry.

370
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,900
I'll be back really, really soon.

371
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Is he joking?

372
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,400
Okay, see you later.
