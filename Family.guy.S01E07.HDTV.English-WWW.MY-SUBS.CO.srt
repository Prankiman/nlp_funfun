Mary, have you seen Nicholas?

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,800
He's up in his room sulking, Dad.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,500
Yeah. He's still upset
because Abby threw out his baseball cards.

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,900
Maybe I should make him a sandwich.

I'm on to you. Your pathetic attempts to
hinder my work have not gone unnoticed.

You prance about this house

But will you be prancing
when there's nothing to prance about?

38

I don't get it.

I think I'm a little sweaty.

...Quahog remains in the sweltering grip
of a freak heat wave.

I don't think you should use
the word "freak".

53
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,900
Some people might find it offensive.

- Why bother? I'm just a freak!

Good point.

Chris, that's a terrible word! "Nipple."

61

I'll chalk that up to the heat, mister.

Am I to strut about all day like
a beggar child on the streets of Calcutta?

Fetch me something linen to throw on
before I call Child Services!

- Really?

70

If you won, we could use that money
for a new air conditioner.
