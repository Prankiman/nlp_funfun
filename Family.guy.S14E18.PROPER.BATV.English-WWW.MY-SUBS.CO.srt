ANNOUNCER: We now return
to <i>The Price is Right,</i>

13
00:00:35,937 --> 00:00:37,937
now with male models.

14
00:00:37,973 --> 00:00:42,208
Let's look at this beautiful
new car, presented by Ken.

15
00:00:42,244 --> 00:00:43,977
♪ ♪

16
00:00:44,012 --> 00:00:45,445
I don't want it.

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,714
Peter, what the hell
happened to my underwear?

18
00:00:47,749 --> 00:00:49,215
They're all stretched out.

19
00:00:49,251 --> 00:00:50,216
Oh, sorry about that.

20
00:00:50,252 --> 00:00:51,418
Me and the guys
were using them

21
00:00:51,453 --> 00:00:54,120
to shoot crab apples
at Old Man McCratchen's truck.

22
00:00:55,223 --> 00:00:56,723
We don't want
raisins on Halloween,

23
00:00:56,758 --> 00:00:58,391
we want candy!

24
00:00:58,427 --> 00:01:00,560
Hey, Quagmire, aren't you
gonna get in on this?

25
00:01:00,595 --> 00:01:03,997
I, uh, kind of got my own
game going on over here.

26
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,804
All right, I'm off to
get more underwear.

27
00:01:10,839 --> 00:01:12,572
We'll meet back
here at 2:00.

28
00:01:12,607 --> 00:01:13,807
Chris, do you
remember your job?

29
00:01:13,842 --> 00:01:16,309
To try and get my shoes
sucked into the escalator

30
00:01:16,344 --> 00:01:17,610
so we can sue the mall.

31
00:01:17,646 --> 00:01:18,845
That's right, sweetie.

32
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,347
I heard they're paying
50 grand a toe now.

33
00:01:22,617 --> 00:01:25,885
(train whistle blows)

34
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:27,620
Ah, the train.

35
00:01:27,656 --> 00:01:29,389
Now that was
the way to travel.

36
00:01:29,424 --> 00:01:30,590
You remember that, Chris?

37
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:31,625
Not at all.

38
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,193
When did we go
and get ourselves

39
00:01:33,228 --> 00:01:35,428
in such a big damn hurry?

40
00:01:35,464 --> 00:01:38,398
Hi, uh, I'll take two tickets
for the Ladybug Express, please.

41
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:40,233
Sorry, the train is
just for children.

42
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:41,668
Well, what about
that guy in the front?

43
00:01:41,703 --> 00:01:42,669
He's a grown-up.

44
00:01:42,704 --> 00:01:43,704
He's the conductor.

45
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:45,238
I don't see no orchestra.

46
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:47,006
That's a different
kind of conductor.

47
00:01:47,042 --> 00:01:48,742
Okay, well,
if he's the conductor,

48
00:01:48,777 --> 00:01:50,009
why don't he have
electrical tape

49
00:01:50,045 --> 00:01:51,211
wrapped around
him for safety?

50
00:01:51,246 --> 00:01:53,079
Also, a different
kind of conductor.

51
00:01:53,115 --> 00:01:54,848
All right, thanks for
joking around with me.

52
00:01:54,883 --> 00:01:56,683
We're gonna go check out
the rest of the mall.

53
00:02:00,088 --> 00:02:01,187
So, I'm thinking
about getting

54
00:02:01,223 --> 00:02:03,523
my ears pierced,
you know, big black gauges.

55
00:02:03,558 --> 00:02:05,825
Then, I can just work
at a bike shop forever.

56
00:02:05,861 --> 00:02:06,893
Take the pressure off.

57
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:07,994
That's a terrible idea.

58
00:02:08,029 --> 00:02:09,095
'Cause my lobes
are so nice,

59
00:02:09,131 --> 00:02:10,296
I know, that's what
everybody says.

60
00:02:10,332 --> 00:02:12,332
Wow, check it out.

61
00:02:12,367 --> 00:02:14,801
Biracial slam piece,
dead ahead.

62
00:02:16,838 --> 00:02:18,271
What's going on
with you, man?

63
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:19,405
That's a human being.

64
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:20,507
Sorry, sorry,

65
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:22,475
my buddy sent me a
bunch of Romanian porn,

66
00:02:22,511 --> 00:02:23,943
and now every girl
I look at I imagine

67
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:25,211
throwing onto a table.

68
00:02:25,247 --> 00:02:27,947
Yeah, that wasn't really
the backpedal I expected.

69
00:02:27,983 --> 00:02:29,849
Excuse me, uh, Shelby?

70
00:02:29,885 --> 00:02:30,984
Hi, I'm Brian.

71
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:32,185
Hey, I bet lots
of millionaires

72
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,254
come in here and hit on
you all the time, huh?

73
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:35,289
(chuckles)
Do we?

74
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:36,556
Do we-do we do that a lot?

75
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:38,391
Yeah, I guess it
happens sometimes.

76
00:02:38,426 --> 00:02:39,692
Did you want to
look at something?

77
00:02:39,728 --> 00:02:40,994
Already am.

78
00:02:41,029 --> 00:02:42,462
Hey, can I try that on?

79
00:02:42,497 --> 00:02:43,463
Good taste.

80
00:02:43,498 --> 00:02:44,864
That's our nicest
men's ring.

81
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,467
Uh, better see if it'll
come off when I ski Aspen.

82
00:02:49,938 --> 00:02:52,105
Yeah, yeah,
that works, that works.

83
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,507
I know I'm a nerd,
but I have, like,

84
00:02:54,543 --> 00:02:56,242
a thing for rich guys.

85
00:02:56,278 --> 00:02:57,343
I'll take the ring,

86
00:02:57,379 --> 00:02:59,579
and I'll take your number.

87
00:02:59,614 --> 00:03:00,580
Here you go.

88
00:03:00,615 --> 00:03:02,248
Call me.

89
00:03:02,284 --> 00:03:03,283
What the hell
are you doing?

90
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:04,751
That ring is $10,000.

91
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:06,119
Relax, Stewie.

92
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:09,856
All I have to do
is bring the ring back

93
00:03:09,891 --> 00:03:11,057
when she's not working.

94
00:03:11,092 --> 00:03:12,592
I'll get a refund
and she'll never know.

95
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:14,794
It's a perfect scam,
like Teddy Roosevelt

96
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,496
getting to be
on Mount Rushmore.

97
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:18,731
I won the
Revolutionary War.

98
00:03:18,767 --> 00:03:20,767
I won the Civil War.

99
00:03:20,802 --> 00:03:23,136
I gained possession of Guam!

100
00:03:26,174 --> 00:03:28,007
(dramatic action music
playing on video game)

101
00:03:28,043 --> 00:03:29,075
There you are.

102
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,144
We were supposed
to meet an hour ago.

103
00:03:31,179 --> 00:03:32,278
Yeah, I'm almost done.

104
00:03:32,314 --> 00:03:33,947
I'm playing a really cool
new video game.

105
00:03:33,982 --> 00:03:35,715
<i>Michael Douglas's Munch Out.</i>

106
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,883
Nah...

107
00:03:36,918 --> 00:03:39,452
Nom-nom-nom-nom-nom-nom.

108
00:03:39,487 --> 00:03:40,553
Come on, Peter.

109
00:03:40,589 --> 00:03:41,554
It's time to go home.

110
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,555
Not now, Lois.

111
00:03:42,591 --> 00:03:43,656
I'm making ladies feel good.

112
00:03:43,692 --> 00:03:45,658
Peter, I've been
on my feet all day.

113
00:03:45,694 --> 00:03:46,926
Let's go.

114
00:03:46,962 --> 00:03:48,895
I'd stop, but
Catherine Zeta Jones' big hands

115
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,029
are on the back of my head.

116
00:03:50,065 --> 00:03:51,564
You know what?
Forget this.

117
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,565
We're leaving.

118
00:03:52,601 --> 00:03:54,000
You find your
own way home.

119
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:55,001
(video game beeps)

120
00:03:55,036 --> 00:03:56,569
What?
Throat cancer?

121
00:03:56,605 --> 00:03:59,873
But all I did was drink Scotch,
smoke cigars, and this.

122
00:03:59,908 --> 00:04:01,441
All right, we can go, Lois.

123
00:04:01,476 --> 00:04:02,476
Lois?

124
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,350
Mort?!

125
00:04:09,384 --> 00:04:10,917
Oh, hey, how do you
like my blowout?

126
00:04:10,952 --> 00:04:14,020
I'm pulling down so
much chotch, it's insane.

127
00:04:14,055 --> 00:04:16,890
I don't... I-I'm... Yuck.

128
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:19,059
Lois?

129
00:04:21,096 --> 00:04:22,128
Oh, no!

130
00:04:22,163 --> 00:04:24,163
I'm alone and lost in the mall!

131
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:27,033
I haven't been this scared
since the silence of the lamb.

132
00:04:27,068 --> 00:04:29,435
Hey, um...

133
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:30,837
let's move in together.

134
00:04:33,742 --> 00:04:35,408
Say something!

135
00:04:38,246 --> 00:04:39,746
...and I turned around,
and I don't know

136
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:41,915
what happened to my wife,
and now I'm all alone

137
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,283
and I'm just so scared.

138
00:04:43,318 --> 00:04:44,284
Okay.

139
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:46,052
Do you want to go
look for your wife,

140
00:04:46,087 --> 00:04:48,054
or you want me to
finish the makeover?

141
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:49,889
I guess we might
as well finish up here.

142
00:04:49,925 --> 00:04:53,226
When I find her,
I want her to go, "Wow."

143
00:04:56,264 --> 00:04:57,463
Lois?

144
00:04:57,499 --> 00:04:58,665
Lois!

145
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,433
MAN:
Lois!

146
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:01,801
Lois!

147
00:05:01,836 --> 00:05:03,703
Is your wife named Lois, too?

148
00:05:03,738 --> 00:05:06,039
No, but I figured if
she's banging a guy like you,

149
00:05:06,074 --> 00:05:07,106
I got a shot.

150
00:05:07,142 --> 00:05:08,241
Lois!

151
00:05:08,276 --> 00:05:09,709
Hey, what're you-- Lois!

152
00:05:09,744 --> 00:05:10,744
Lois!

153
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:12,078
Lois!

154
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:16,749
W-wait, hang on
a second, Shelby,

155
00:05:16,785 --> 00:05:18,451
I can't hear
you over my brokers.

156
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:19,752
Buy! Sell!

157
00:05:19,788 --> 00:05:21,287
Buy! Buy!

158
00:05:21,323 --> 00:05:23,623
SHELBY:
Wow, buying <i>and</i> selling?

159
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:24,691
Yeah, yeah.

160
00:05:24,726 --> 00:05:25,858
Well, I'll see you Saturday.

161
00:05:25,894 --> 00:05:27,193
I better go;
my helicopter's here.

162
00:05:27,228 --> 00:05:29,462
Fa-doo, fa-doo,
fa-doo, fa-doo, fa-doo.

163
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:30,563
Are you still--

164
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:31,597
by the way, you have no idea

165
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:32,598
what a helicopter sounds like--

166
00:05:32,634 --> 00:05:34,334
are you still keeping
up this charade?

167
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:35,401
Yeah, but it's perfect.

168
00:05:35,437 --> 00:05:36,477
Shelby's already off work,

169
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:37,570
so I'll just grab the ring

170
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:39,572
and we can bring it back
before they close.

171
00:05:41,609 --> 00:05:44,010
Huh, I know I left
the ring right here.

172
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:45,611
If you're referring to the ring

173
00:05:45,647 --> 00:05:47,780
that I thought was a lug nut,
I ate it.

174
00:05:47,816 --> 00:05:48,781
What?!

175
00:05:48,817 --> 00:05:49,916
Why would you eat a lug nut?

176
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,517
I was dared.
By who?!

177
00:05:51,553 --> 00:05:52,518
By myself.

178
00:05:52,554 --> 00:05:54,153
I have low self-esteem.

179
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:55,922
We should check in
on this guy more.

180
00:05:55,957 --> 00:05:57,423
Oh, my God,
this can't be happening!

181
00:05:57,459 --> 00:05:58,992
Chris, that was a diamond ring!

182
00:05:59,027 --> 00:06:00,760
Do you know how expensive
that was?!

183
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:02,228
I'm sorry, Brian!

184
00:06:02,263 --> 00:06:04,964
But don't worry, it'll come out
of my body sooner or later.

185
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
He's right.

186
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:07,300
I ate a dime once.

187
00:06:07,335 --> 00:06:09,135
It became a manhole cover
for, like, three days,

188
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,303
but then, pow!

189
00:06:10,338 --> 00:06:12,238
Okay, yeah, yeah,
we just-we just got to force

190
00:06:12,273 --> 00:06:13,439
Chris to poop, that's all.

191
00:06:13,475 --> 00:06:15,875
Yay! Like at a sleep-over!

192
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,477
I love you.

193
00:06:17,512 --> 00:06:19,512
You're loved.

194
00:06:23,485 --> 00:06:25,125
MALE ANNOUNCER:
Attention: the Quahog Mall

195
00:06:25,153 --> 00:06:27,053
will be closing
in five minutes.

196
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:28,521
Well, I've looked everywhere.

197
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:29,989
Maybe she left.

198
00:06:30,025 --> 00:06:33,426
Paul Blart, if you're out there,
I could sure use a miracle.

199
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:36,996
(magical chords play)

200
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:43,002
(train whistle blows)

201
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:44,604
Choo-choo!

202
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,873
All aboard the Ladybug Express!

203
00:06:46,908 --> 00:06:48,574
But be careful, Peter.

204
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,377
If this train slows to less
than 50 miles an hour,

205
00:06:51,413 --> 00:06:53,746
then Sandra Bullock
has to marry a neo-Nazi

206
00:06:53,782 --> 00:06:55,214
and act like
she didn't know about it,

207
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,717
and then overcompensate
by adopting a black kid.

208
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,820
Aah! Help!

209
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:02,088
(screaming)

210
00:07:02,123 --> 00:07:03,089
Holy crap!

211
00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:04,090
(screams)

212
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:07,193
(Peter screaming)

213
00:07:07,228 --> 00:07:09,295
Wait! Don't close the mall!

214
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,364
Like an actual Amtrak train,

215
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:13,366
this is dangerously
out of control!

216
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:15,334
That's legally defensible,
by the way.

217
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,704
On your screen is a list
of actual rail disasters.

218
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,842
♪ A chug-a chug-a motion like
a railroad train, now ♪

219
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:25,278
♪ <i>Come on baby,</i>
<i>do the Loco-motion!</i> ♪

220
00:07:31,128 --> 00:07:32,626
Good morning, I'm Tom Tucker.

221
00:07:32,726 --> 00:07:35,227
Coming up, the secret
to remaining upbeat

222
00:07:35,262 --> 00:07:36,628
after getting
an elderly waitress.

223
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:39,698
But we begin with breaking news
from the Quahog Mall,

224
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:43,368
where a local fat man was stuck
overnight on a child's train.

225
00:07:43,404 --> 00:07:45,070
We now go live
to the newest member

226
00:07:45,105 --> 00:07:47,939
of the Channel Five news team,
Dallas Portland.

227
00:07:47,975 --> 00:07:48,940
Thanks, Tom.

228
00:07:48,976 --> 00:07:50,042
Yes, quite an ordeal

229
00:07:50,077 --> 00:07:51,977
for Quahog's Peter Griffin.

230
00:07:52,012 --> 00:07:55,213
So, Mr. Griffin, you were going
around in circles for 12 hours.

231
00:07:55,249 --> 00:07:56,815
Are you suffering
any ill effects

232
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,317
from the centrifugal force?

233
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:02,321
The wind on my skin
is like "knifes."

234
00:08:03,324 --> 00:08:04,523
(phone keys beeping)

235
00:08:04,558 --> 00:08:05,524
Oh, my God, Bonnie,

236
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:07,159
are you watching
the news right now?

237
00:08:07,194 --> 00:08:09,428
Yes, I'm so sorry
about Peter.

238
00:08:09,463 --> 00:08:10,896
Oh, I'm sure he'll be fine.

239
00:08:10,931 --> 00:08:13,398
But did you see that
sweet, new piece of ass,

240
00:08:13,434 --> 00:08:14,599
Dallas Portland?

241
00:08:14,635 --> 00:08:15,867
Oh, I don't know.

242
00:08:15,903 --> 00:08:18,804
Why don't you ask my
index and middle finger?

243
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,839
I thought this
was a recovery day.

244
00:08:20,874 --> 00:08:22,908
No days off, bro.

245
00:08:27,014 --> 00:08:29,181
Peter, move,
we need the TV.

246
00:08:29,216 --> 00:08:30,982
Is this...
is this a coven?

247
00:08:31,018 --> 00:08:32,484
No, we're watching the news.

248
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,819
Now get out of the way.

249
00:08:33,854 --> 00:08:36,121
We had a bottle of wine
and a joint at Bonnie's house,

250
00:08:36,156 --> 00:08:37,689
and we want to watch
Dallas Portland

251
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,224
before the buzz wears off.

252
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:41,727
You chicken-heads
are out of control.

253
00:08:42,763 --> 00:08:44,463
Yoga for men?

254
00:08:44,498 --> 00:08:46,898
Yes, says the
inventor of Bro-ga.

255
00:08:46,934 --> 00:08:49,201
I'm here in his studio
above the Petco to see

256
00:08:49,236 --> 00:08:52,070
if I want to "nama-stay"
for the whole class.

257
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:53,872
(women laughing)

258
00:08:53,907 --> 00:08:55,874
I guess he's handsome <i>and</i> funny.

259
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:58,310
Oh, feel like I'm cheating
on Tom Bergeron.

260
00:08:58,345 --> 00:08:59,978
That's who you're
all excited about?

261
00:09:00,013 --> 00:09:02,013
That chiseled Adonis
with eyes the color

262
00:09:02,049 --> 00:09:03,448
of summer's first
blueberry?

263
00:09:03,484 --> 00:09:05,117
I don't know
about none of that,

264
00:09:05,152 --> 00:09:07,018
but look at that bulge
in his shorts.

265
00:09:07,054 --> 00:09:08,253
I've never seen a bulge

266
00:09:08,288 --> 00:09:10,555
in the front of
a man's pants before.

267
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,757
You see that, Peter?

268
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:13,825
That's the right amount
of leg hair.

269
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:14,960
My leg hair's fine.

270
00:09:14,995 --> 00:09:17,662
I have what they call,
"The Irish Wisp."

271
00:09:22,703 --> 00:09:24,669
Why are we at a
health food store?

272
00:09:24,705 --> 00:09:26,037
Well, we got to get
that ring out of you,

273
00:09:26,073 --> 00:09:27,372
and this is a place
where people buy

274
00:09:27,408 --> 00:09:29,374
disgusting cereals
to help them poop.

275
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,076
Well, which one
should we buy?

276
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:32,310
I don't know, let's ask.

277
00:09:32,346 --> 00:09:34,679
Are there any gray-haired
lesbian art teachers

278
00:09:34,715 --> 00:09:37,382
who can help us select
a fiber cereal?

279
00:09:37,418 --> 00:09:38,650
This won't take long,

280
00:09:38,685 --> 00:09:41,420
we know your large dogs
are tied up outside.

281
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,555
(women chattering)

282
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,990
There's too many of them!

283
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:46,065
We've got to start a chant

284
00:09:46,093 --> 00:09:47,559
so they'll file out
into the street!

285
00:09:47,594 --> 00:09:51,062
All sex is rape!
All sex is rape!

286
00:09:51,098 --> 00:09:54,633
PROTESTORS: All sex is rape!
All sex is rape!

287
00:09:54,668 --> 00:09:56,201
When I first joined this cause,

288
00:09:56,236 --> 00:09:58,270
I was just trying
to get this guy to poop,

289
00:09:58,305 --> 00:10:01,206
but now we're this close
to getting sex outlawed

290
00:10:01,241 --> 00:10:02,441
in the United States.

291
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,276
(crowd cheers)

292
00:10:09,016 --> 00:10:11,483
So, Peter, where are
your boyfriends tonight?

293
00:10:11,518 --> 00:10:12,751
I don't know.
Where are yours?

294
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:14,386
What the (bleep)
did you just say?!

295
00:10:14,421 --> 00:10:16,288
I'm-I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sor... I-I'm just...

296
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:17,789
I'm not myself tonight.

297
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,124
Lois and all
of her friends

298
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,692
are drooling over
that new news guy.

299
00:10:20,727 --> 00:10:22,594
That Dallas Portland's a jerk.

300
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:24,362
TOM:
Don't even say that name.

301
00:10:24,398 --> 00:10:25,597
Tom Tucker?!

302
00:10:25,632 --> 00:10:26,765
What are you doing here?

303
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,200
Getting out of that wind storm

304
00:10:28,235 --> 00:10:30,202
that screwed up my hair
and loosened my tie,

305
00:10:30,237 --> 00:10:31,703
but also trying to forget

306
00:10:31,738 --> 00:10:33,572
how mad I am at Dallas Portland.

307
00:10:33,607 --> 00:10:34,873
You and me both, pal.

308
00:10:34,908 --> 00:10:36,274
That Dallas guy sucks.

309
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,609
Why, what's your
problem with him?

310
00:10:37,644 --> 00:10:39,945
Eh, my wife's been creaming
her spinach over him.

311
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,213
Yeah, tell me about it.

312
00:10:41,248 --> 00:10:43,448
Since he arrived,
our ratings have skyrocketed.

313
00:10:43,484 --> 00:10:46,251
They're grooming Dallas,
which means I'm on my way out.

314
00:10:46,286 --> 00:10:47,252
What?

315
00:10:47,287 --> 00:10:48,687
We can't let that happen.

316
00:10:48,722 --> 00:10:50,856
If that guy becomes the anchor,
every night is gonna be...

317
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:52,390
Hey!

318
00:10:52,426 --> 00:10:54,593
Sorry, I still get a little
dizzy from the train,

319
00:10:54,628 --> 00:10:56,695
but if Dallas Portland's
on TV every night,

320
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,697
my life's gonna be
a living hell.

321
00:10:58,732 --> 00:10:59,931
You and me both.

322
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,534
Without the news, I...
I don't know who I am...

323
00:11:02,569 --> 00:11:03,902
but what can you do?

324
00:11:03,937 --> 00:11:05,303
He's the flavor of the month.

325
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:07,606
But wait a minute,
maybe if we work together,

326
00:11:07,641 --> 00:11:09,241
we can solve both our problems.

327
00:11:09,276 --> 00:11:10,242
What do you mean?

328
00:11:10,277 --> 00:11:11,576
Well, if he's
the hot, young thing

329
00:11:11,612 --> 00:11:14,045
and everybody loves him,
all we got to do is make you

330
00:11:14,081 --> 00:11:16,014
hotter and
younger and thing-er!

331
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:17,349
And then they
won't need him.

332
00:11:17,384 --> 00:11:18,483
Well, how we supposed
to do that?

333
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:19,751
Just trust me.

334
00:11:19,786 --> 00:11:21,853
When I set my mind to something,
anything's possible.

335
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,189
That's how I got
myself on <i>The Voice.</i>

336
00:11:24,224 --> 00:11:25,557
(crying):
I'm doing this for my mother,

who taught me to sing
when I was only seven.

338
00:11:28,295 --> 00:11:31,763
She was my biggest inspiration,
and she was...

339
00:11:31,798 --> 00:11:35,233
taken from me when I was 12...

340
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:37,602
in a fatal car accident.

341
00:11:39,006 --> 00:11:41,606
She was my rock...

Yes.

You need to get

Excuse me, is this the line

You know what restaurant

379
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,320
Ah, almost time
for the news.

380
00:13:35,355 --> 00:13:36,321
Mind if I join you?

381
00:13:36,356 --> 00:13:37,656

hated the news.

Okay.

385
00:13:42,896 --> 00:13:45,430
Good evening, Quahog,
I'm Dallas Portland.

386
00:13:45,465 --> 00:13:46,698
And I'm T-Homie...

387
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:50,201
with the news
in your mouth!

388
00:13:50,237 --> 00:13:51,903
What the hell's he doing?

389
00:13:51,938 --> 00:13:53,438
He's crushing it.

390
00:13:53,473 --> 00:13:56,641
Okay, Tom, uh,
our top story tonight:

391
00:13:56,677 --> 00:13:59,110
a burst water pipe
in the pediatric unit

392
00:13:59,146 --> 00:14:01,479
of Quahog General
results in the tragic

393
00:14:01,515 --> 00:14:04,115
drowning deaths
of four children and one nurse.

394
00:14:04,151 --> 00:14:05,884
News bomb! (laughs)

395
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,152
I know what you're
thinking, right?

396
00:14:07,187 --> 00:14:08,453
"He's so random."

397
00:14:08,488 --> 00:14:09,621
Boy, I never realized

398
00:14:09,656 --> 00:14:12,057
how young and hip
Tom Tucker is.

399
00:14:12,092 --> 00:14:14,626
Dallas Portland should just
pack it up and go home.

400
00:14:14,661 --> 00:14:15,894
What are you talking about?

401
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:17,095
Wait, wait, quiet, quiet.

402
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,464
Tom's about to tattoo
the word, "Coachella"

403
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:20,732
on the bridge of his nose.

404
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:22,000
Is that a thing?

405
00:14:22,035 --> 00:14:23,768
Uh, I don't know, Grandma,
sit back and wa--

(both screaming)

407
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,037
He got his eye!
Oh, God!

408
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,305
What's wrong
with you, Dallas?

409
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,741
Never seen a guy so
young and cool before?

410
00:14:29,776 --> 00:14:30,742

411

effective immediately.

415
00:14:40,854 --> 00:14:42,821
Holy crap! They fired him?

416
00:14:42,856 --> 00:14:43,856
Oh, my God!

417
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,890
Oh, well, now

428
00:15:07,754 --> 00:15:10,455
Tom Tucker to try
all that nonsense on TV?

429
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,024
You realize you cost
that man his job.

430
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,292
Well, how was
I supposed to know?

431
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:16,728
Katie Couric went on TV
and stuck a tube up her butt

432
00:15:16,763 --> 00:15:17,829
and they threw her a parade.

433
00:15:17,864 --> 00:15:19,464
That was a colonoscopy!

434
00:15:19,499 --> 00:15:21,199
This is kind of
your fault, you know.

435

I mean, you're the

over that Dallas Portland.

437
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,603
I was just trying to get
that guy off the air.

438
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:27,372
Peter, that's ridiculous.

439
00:15:27,407 --> 00:15:30,308
He's just some pretty boy
who doesn't mean anything.

440
00:15:30,343 --> 00:15:32,377
It's like when you watch
<i>Mad Men</i> for that chick

441
00:15:32,412 --> 00:15:33,812
you said was like a fat me.

442
00:15:33,847 --> 00:15:35,780
I said a young, fat you.

443
00:15:35,816 --> 00:15:38,550
The point is,
you've ruined that man's life.

444
00:15:38,585 --> 00:15:40,018
(sighs)
You're right.

445
00:15:40,053 --> 00:15:41,119
Poor Tom.

446
00:15:41,154 --> 00:15:42,887
Thanks to me,
he's fallen even

447
00:15:42,923 --> 00:15:44,656

we're talking about.

452

That's what <i>I'm</i>
talking about.

453
00:15:57,771 --> 00:15:59,337
I don't know
what else to do.

454
00:15:59,372 --> 00:16:00,538
We've tried everything.

Brian, the jeweler
closes at 6:00.

456
00:16:02,242 --> 00:16:04,109
You don't have much time left
to return that ring.

457
00:16:04,144 --> 00:16:05,110
You're right.

458
00:16:05,145 --> 00:16:06,478
Well, we have no choice.

459
00:16:06,513 --> 00:16:08,513
We'll just have to take
a bumpy ride to the mall

460
00:16:08,548 --> 00:16:09,781
and hope for a miracle.

461
00:16:09,816 --> 00:16:11,883
You know, Brian,
this wouldn't have happened

462
00:16:11,918 --> 00:16:13,318
if you were just
honest with women

463
00:16:13,353 --> 00:16:14,819
and had an ounce
of integrity.

464
00:16:14,855 --> 00:16:16,020
Don't pull rank on me.

465
00:16:16,056 --> 00:16:18,189
You ate a ring,
you worthless tub of crap.

466
00:16:18,225 --> 00:16:19,190
Yeah?

467
00:16:19,226 --> 00:16:20,458
Well, who's gonna be
fishing through

468
00:16:20,494 --> 00:16:23,261
a tub of crap soon,
you unemployed buttmunch?

469
00:16:23,296 --> 00:16:25,196
Whoa, whoa,
let's calm down, guys.

470
00:16:25,232 --> 00:16:27,665
Shut up,
you unemployed buttmunch!

471
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:30,068
Okay, he found
a burn he likes.

472
00:16:36,443 --> 00:16:37,942
What the hell do you want?

473
00:16:37,978 --> 00:16:39,077
I'm here to say...

474
00:16:39,112 --> 00:16:41,112
I'm sorry about
what happened.

475
00:16:41,148 --> 00:16:42,547
Let me make it up to you.

476

I'm the one who made
you lose your job.

477

I'll find you a new one.

478
00:16:45,752 --> 00:16:46,752
Don't bother.

00:16:46,787 --> 00:16:47,886
I'm washed up.

480
00:16:47,921 --> 00:16:50,421
Everyone saw what I did,
and besides, I...

481
00:16:50,457 --> 00:16:52,323
I can't do anything else.

482
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:54,425
I was born to be a newsman.

483
00:16:54,461 --> 00:16:56,761
This just out: me!

484
00:16:56,797 --> 00:16:58,429
That-that happened?

485
00:16:58,465 --> 00:16:59,597
Is that for real?

486
00:16:59,633 --> 00:17:01,032
That's nuts, but still,

487
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:02,801
I-I want to help you
get back on your feet.

488
00:17:02,836 --> 00:17:03,802
Go home, Peter.

489
00:17:03,837 --> 00:17:05,069
You've already done enough.

490
00:17:05,105 --> 00:17:06,571
Thanks to you,
it's over for me,

491
00:17:06,606 --> 00:17:08,339
like Billy Zane.

492
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,440
Billy, you're through.

493
00:17:09,476 --> 00:17:11,009
You haven't done
anything in ten years.

494
00:17:11,044 --> 00:17:12,277
Yes, I have.

495
00:17:12,312 --> 00:17:14,379
I was in those electronic
cigarette commercials.

496
00:17:14,414 --> 00:17:15,747
That was Stephen Dorff.

497
00:17:15,782 --> 00:17:17,482
Aw.

498
00:17:21,688 --> 00:17:23,454
How we doing on time?
Less than a minute.

499
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,756
How you feeling, Chris?

500
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:27,192
No different, except I have
to poop from all this running.

501
00:17:27,227 --> 00:17:28,227
What? That's great!

502
00:17:28,261 --> 00:17:29,427
There's a bathroom
down that hall!

503
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:31,129
No time!
They're closing the gate!

504
00:17:31,164 --> 00:17:34,632
(suspenseful
action music playing)

505
00:17:41,741 --> 00:17:42,707
BRIAN:
<i>Hey, Shelby.</i>

506
00:17:42,742 --> 00:17:43,875
SHELBY:
<i>Brian?</i>

507
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,743
CHRIS (groaning):
<i>It's coming!</i>

508
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:47,879
(splat)
SHELBY: <i>Oh, my God!</i>

509
00:17:47,914 --> 00:17:49,848
BRIAN: <i>Yes, um, I'd like to make</i>
<i>a return, please...</i>

510
00:17:49,883 --> 00:17:51,983
<i>and maybe take you to dinner?</i>

511
00:17:52,018 --> 00:17:54,886
SHELBY: <i>Brian, I don't care</i>
<i>that I was diarrhea'd on.</i>

512
00:17:54,921 --> 00:17:57,422
<i>I care that you weren't honest.</i>

513
00:17:57,457 --> 00:17:59,290
STEWIE: <i>I care that</i>
<i>I was diarrhea'd on.</i>

514
00:17:59,326 --> 00:18:01,459
<i>I care a great deal.</i>

515
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:08,633
Sorry I let you down, Tom.

516
00:18:08,668 --> 00:18:10,134
Oh, my God, look!

517
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:11,302
Up on the roof!

518
00:18:13,173 --> 00:18:14,439
Holy crap!

519
00:18:14,474 --> 00:18:16,841
Doritos Tacos is only
for a limited time?

520
00:18:17,878 --> 00:18:19,310
And oh, no!

521
00:18:19,346 --> 00:18:21,579
Tom Tucker's gonna jump!

522
00:18:21,615 --> 00:18:23,615
(sirens wailing)

523
00:18:27,854 --> 00:18:29,420
Tom, I got here as
fast as I could.

524
00:18:29,456 --> 00:18:31,155
So-so, what's-what's
going on?

525
00:18:31,191 --> 00:18:32,290
It's over for me, Peter.

526
00:18:32,325 --> 00:18:34,192
If I can't anchor
the local news,

527
00:18:34,227 --> 00:18:35,827
I have no reason to live.

528
00:18:35,862 --> 00:18:37,929
Look, Tom, Tom, before
you do anything crazy,

529
00:18:37,964 --> 00:18:39,364
you should know one thing:

530
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:42,066
I have that exact
same bathrobe.

531
00:18:42,102 --> 00:18:44,168
Hey, Tom, the camera's
gonna be on you in a second.

532
00:18:44,204 --> 00:18:45,737
Before you jump,
could you just hand me

533
00:18:45,772 --> 00:18:48,373
this microphone, like you're
passing me the torch?

534
00:18:48,408 --> 00:18:49,874
What the hell
are you doing here?

535
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:50,875
What am I doing?

536
00:18:50,911 --> 00:18:52,377
Getting an interview
with a crazed jumper

537
00:18:52,412 --> 00:18:53,444
on the brink of suicide.

538
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,545
This is huge.

539
00:18:54,581 --> 00:18:56,180
Wait a second.

540
00:18:56,216 --> 00:18:57,582
You heard wrong, Dallas.

541
00:18:57,617 --> 00:18:59,784
There's a jumper here,
but it ain't Tom.

542
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:01,085
It's me.
What?!

543
00:19:01,121 --> 00:19:02,086
That's right.

544
00:19:02,122 --> 00:19:03,588
Tom was just trying
to talk me down,

545
00:19:03,623 --> 00:19:05,556
and if there's
a news story here,

546
00:19:05,592 --> 00:19:08,559
the only one I'm giving
it to is Tom Tucker.

547
00:19:08,595 --> 00:19:10,795
Here.

548
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,463
Roll it.

549
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:14,632
Good evening, Quahog.

550
00:19:14,668 --> 00:19:16,200
This is Tom Tucker
atop a roof,

551
00:19:16,236 --> 00:19:19,404
where a local crazy person
is preparing to end it all.

552
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:20,405
Bonnie!

553
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,607
Tom Tucker's back on the news!

554
00:19:22,642 --> 00:19:23,908
Oh, here you are.

555
00:19:23,944 --> 00:19:24,909
Tom Tucker's back...

556
00:19:24,945 --> 00:19:26,110
I know.

557
00:19:26,146 --> 00:19:28,513
Honey, I'm back on TV.

558
00:19:28,548 --> 00:19:30,281
No, Billy,
that's Tom Tucker.

559
00:19:30,317 --> 00:19:31,749
Aw.

560
00:19:31,785 --> 00:19:33,584
What's going on?

561
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,954
Don't worry about it,
just get those pants off.

562
00:19:35,989 --> 00:19:38,489
Oh, your hair is amazing.

563
00:19:38,525 --> 00:19:41,426
Tell us, crazy person,
why are you doing all this?

564
00:19:41,461 --> 00:19:42,627
I'll tell you why.

565
00:19:42,662 --> 00:19:45,396
I'm doing this because
I ruined a guy's life...

566
00:19:45,432 --> 00:19:46,898
and I feel awful about it.

567
00:19:46,933 --> 00:19:50,301
It's the only thing I can think
of to make things right.

568
00:19:51,972 --> 00:19:54,839
Well, whoever this guy is,
I'm sure he appreciates

569
00:19:54,874 --> 00:19:56,174
what you're trying
to do for him.

570
00:19:56,209 --> 00:19:58,609
I think I speak for all
our viewers when I say,

571
00:19:58,645 --> 00:20:00,144
don't do this.

572
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,512
Please.

573
00:20:01,548 --> 00:20:03,047
Come down off
this ledge with me.

574
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,682
You got it.

575
00:20:04,718 --> 00:20:08,052
If that's what the most trusted
newsman in Quahog wants.

576
00:20:10,023 --> 00:20:10,989
Aah! Pigeon!

577
00:20:11,024 --> 00:20:11,990
(Tom yells)

578
00:20:12,025 --> 00:20:13,124
(Tom thuds, groans)

579
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:14,125
It's fine.

580
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,160
He landed on people.

581
00:20:20,843 --> 00:20:22,977
Well, I'm glad your
crazy stunt worked out

582
00:20:23,012 --> 00:20:25,079
and Tom Tucker is back
at Channel Five.

583
00:20:25,114 --> 00:20:26,080
Yeah, apparently,

584
00:20:26,115 --> 00:20:27,314
when he interviewed me
up on that roof,

585
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,817
the ratings were so huge,
they made him anchor again.

586
00:20:29,852 --> 00:20:31,352
That's great
to hear, because...

587
00:20:31,387 --> 00:20:34,188
MAN (distant):
Lois! Lois!

588
00:20:34,223 --> 00:20:35,723
I-Is somebody
calling my name?

589
00:20:35,758 --> 00:20:37,558
Lois!

590
00:20:37,593 --> 00:20:38,692
I don't think so, no.

591
00:20:38,728 --> 00:20:40,261
Lois, I'm rich!

592
00:20:40,296 --> 00:20:42,296
Now I think I do
hear something.

593
00:20:42,331 --> 00:20:43,898
I should probably
go see what he wants.

594
00:20:43,933 --> 00:20:48,068
I know I'm a nerd, but I have,
like, a thing for rich guys.

595
00:20:50,273 --> 00:20:53,073
Oh, boy, she's getting
in his helicopter.

596
00:20:53,109 --> 00:20:54,275
Fa-doo, fa-doo,
fa-doo, fa-doo,

597
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,410
fa-doo, fa-doo,
fa-doo, fa-doo, fa-doo...

598
00:20:56,445 --> 00:20:59,413
Well, I'm big enough
to admit when I'm wrong.

599
00:20:59,448 --> 00:21:01,916
(jazzy instrumental version
of theme song playing)
