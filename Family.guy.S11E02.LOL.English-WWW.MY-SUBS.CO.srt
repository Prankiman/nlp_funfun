Oh, Stewie,
how exciting!

13
00:00:37,389 --> 00:00:39,507
Your first visit to
a real fire station!

14
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:42,610
Yeah, you kids always loved your
first trip to the fire station.

15
00:00:42,644 --> 00:00:43,928
You remember when we took Meg?

16
00:00:47,783 --> 00:00:50,451
Welcome to the Quahog
Fire Department, folks.

17
00:00:50,486 --> 00:00:51,786
I'm Captain Beckman.

18
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:52,954
Let me know if you
have any questions

19
00:00:52,988 --> 00:00:54,121
that I can
answer for you.

20
00:00:54,156 --> 00:00:55,623
JOE:
What's up, nerds?

21
00:00:55,657 --> 00:00:58,860
You waiting for some guy to
fall asleep with a cigarette?

22
00:00:58,894 --> 00:01:00,461
Lazy fire turds!

23
00:01:00,496 --> 00:01:02,129
Have another donut, pig!

24
00:01:02,164 --> 00:01:04,198
We got guns! You got hoses!

25
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:05,900
See you on the softball field!

26
00:01:11,306 --> 00:01:14,292
Over here is our kitchen,
where we make all our meals.

27
00:01:14,326 --> 00:01:16,027
And upstairs
is where we sleep.

28
00:01:16,061 --> 00:01:17,828
What about your
wives and families?

29
00:01:17,863 --> 00:01:20,531
Sometimes we don't see them
for long periods of time.

30
00:01:20,566 --> 00:01:22,466
Well, that sounds
awfully lonely.

31
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:24,835
Like being an NBA player
on the road.

32
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,938
Baby, I miss my wife so much.

33
00:01:26,972 --> 00:01:28,773
Thanks for understanding
that we can't do anything.

34
00:01:28,807 --> 00:01:30,174
I just want to cuddle.

35
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:31,576
Oh, you're so sweet.

36
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,344
I'm just doing
what a man should do.

37
00:01:33,378 --> 00:01:35,880
Respecting the sacred
institution of marriage.

38
00:01:35,914 --> 00:01:37,949
And now, straight to sleep.

39
00:01:37,983 --> 00:01:40,551
ANNOUNCER: <i>This message brought</i>
<i>to you by the NBA.</i>

40
00:01:40,586 --> 00:01:42,220
<i>Let's all pretend this happens.</i>

41
00:01:42,254 --> 00:01:44,722
Hey, Chris, you think it's safe
to drink from a fire hose?

44
00:01:50,913 --> 00:01:52,129
Nice job, Chris.

45
00:01:52,164 --> 00:01:53,664
You got my shirt wet.

46
00:01:53,699 --> 00:01:55,233
Now, few people realize

47
00:01:55,267 --> 00:01:57,835
that until 1928
there were no hoses,

48
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:00,805
and you actually had to fight
fires with your bare hands.

49
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:02,840
I will now give
a demonstration.

50
00:02:07,763 --> 00:02:08,763
(grunts)

51
00:02:10,832 --> 00:02:12,984
Whoa, scrappy little blaze, huh?

52
00:02:13,018 --> 00:02:15,036
Oh, my God,
the fire's got a gun!

53
00:02:18,006 --> 00:02:19,774
What the (bleep) was that?

54
00:02:19,808 --> 00:02:21,809
(making driving noises)

55
00:02:23,378 --> 00:02:24,512
Come on, Stewie.
We're going.

56
00:02:24,546 --> 00:02:25,746
Just a moment, Brian.

57
00:02:25,781 --> 00:02:27,081
I'm pretending
I'm a fireman.

58
00:02:27,115 --> 00:02:28,783
I love playing pretend.

59
00:02:28,817 --> 00:02:31,469
My name's Peter
and I work in the brewery.

60
00:02:31,503 --> 00:02:32,903
Now I'm gonna put on my pants

61
00:02:32,938 --> 00:02:34,472
and go talk
to my coworkers at...

62
00:02:34,506 --> 00:02:36,040
These pants have
stool in them.

63
00:02:39,995 --> 00:02:43,264
Well, I hope everyone had a fun
afternoon at the firehouse.

64
00:02:43,298 --> 00:02:44,699
I sure did, Mom!

65
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:47,885
I can't wait for the
next family outing!

66
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:51,389
Aw, thanks, Mike.

67
00:02:51,423 --> 00:02:52,823
I hate fire stations.

68
00:02:52,858 --> 00:02:54,825
(man's voice): No problem, man.
(sniffing)

69
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,927
Is that alcohol
on your breath?

70
00:02:56,962 --> 00:02:58,179
Yeah, maybe.

71
00:02:58,213 --> 00:03:00,715
You're playing this
too fast and loose, Mike!

72
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,470
Ooh, ooh, is
that the mail?

73
00:03:06,505 --> 00:03:08,139
Yeah.
Is there anything in there for me?

74
00:03:08,173 --> 00:03:09,540
I want to see if
there's a response

75
00:03:09,574 --> 00:03:11,208
to all those fan letters
I've been writing.

76
00:03:11,243 --> 00:03:13,244
PETER:
<i>Dear Cary Elwes,</i>

77
00:03:13,278 --> 00:03:15,980
<i>I have been meaning to</i>
<i>contact you for some time.</i>

78
00:03:16,014 --> 00:03:19,050
<i>I have never been able to</i>
<i>figure out if you are famous.</i>

79
00:03:19,084 --> 00:03:20,951
<i>You were a big deal</i>
<i>in one thing,</i>

80
00:03:20,986 --> 00:03:23,788
<i>but you were wearing</i>
<i>a mask for most of it.</i>

81
00:03:23,822 --> 00:03:26,290
<i>Do you consider your</i>
<i>career a disappointment?</i>

82
00:03:26,325 --> 00:03:29,193
<i>Or rather, did you exceed</i>
<i>your own expectations?</i>

83
00:03:29,227 --> 00:03:31,462
<i>Yours truly, Peter Griffin.</i>

84
00:03:31,496 --> 00:03:34,765
<i>P.S. You were in</i>
Robin Hood: Men in Tights.

85
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,634
<i>Did you know that?</i>

86
00:03:36,668 --> 00:03:38,803
Hey, there's something here
from the Nielsen Company.

87
00:03:39,838 --> 00:03:41,472
"Dear Griffin family,

88
00:03:41,506 --> 00:03:44,342
"You have been specially
selected from amongst millions

89
00:03:44,376 --> 00:03:47,244
"of American households
to be a Nielsen family,

90
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:50,881
"and as such, to have your
TV viewing habits monitored

91
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:53,818
in order to measure
television ratings."

92
00:03:53,852 --> 00:03:57,088
Oh, kids, this came
all the way from Delaware.

93
00:03:57,122 --> 00:03:58,522
What does all
that mean?

94
00:03:58,557 --> 00:04:00,975
Well, Meg, it sounds like
they want us to be part of

95
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:03,310
a select group of people that
helps determine what's on TV.

96
00:04:03,328 --> 00:04:04,762
We're gonna be a Nielsen family?

97
00:04:04,796 --> 00:04:05,763
That's awesome!

98
00:04:05,797 --> 00:04:07,798
(somber, sad music plays)

99
00:04:09,634 --> 00:04:10,735
I think... uh...

100
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:12,603
I think that's
the wrong music.

101
00:04:12,637 --> 00:04:15,206
(victorious fanfare plays)

102
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,774
There you go.

103
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,738
Now, this Nielsen box will keep
track of everything you watch,

104
00:04:26,773 --> 00:04:29,074
which helps us generalize
the viewing habits

105
00:04:29,108 --> 00:04:30,642
of millions of Americans.

106
00:04:30,677 --> 00:04:32,077
Ah, yes.

107
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:34,146
And what was that beginning,
middle and end part again?

108
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,514
Um...

109
00:04:35,548 --> 00:04:38,784
this Nielsen box will keep track
of everything you watch,

110
00:04:38,818 --> 00:04:40,886
which helps us generalize
the viewing habits

111
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,387
of millions of Americans.

112
00:04:42,422 --> 00:04:44,506
Is there any way you can
describe that to me

113
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,024
using colorful puppets
of some sort?

114
00:04:48,044 --> 00:04:51,346
The Nielsen box will monitor
your viewing habits!

115
00:04:51,381 --> 00:04:52,681
(scratchy laugh)

116
00:04:52,715 --> 00:04:56,351
I don't like the left puppet.
His chin is scary.

117
00:04:57,954 --> 00:04:59,821
Well, thanks
for your cooperation.

118
00:04:59,856 --> 00:05:01,923
If you have any questions,
please call me.

119
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,659
And welcome
to the Nielsen family.

120
00:05:03,693 --> 00:05:06,261
Thank you very much.

121
00:05:06,295 --> 00:05:07,713
Well, isn't this exciting.

122
00:05:07,747 --> 00:05:09,881
I know, I can't believe
we're a Nielsen family!

123
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,800
I never get picked
for anything.

124
00:05:15,922 --> 00:05:17,939
(people screaming)

125
00:05:28,351 --> 00:05:29,484
All right, everyone.

126
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:31,053
Time to do
our Nielsen duty.

127
00:05:31,087 --> 00:05:32,387
So, what are we gonna watch?

128
00:05:32,422 --> 00:05:33,822
Boobs!
<i>Project Runway!</i>

129
00:05:33,856 --> 00:05:36,058
<i>The Good Wife!</i>
That black version of our show!

130
00:05:36,092 --> 00:05:38,093
You know, guys, this
is a real opportunity

131
00:05:38,127 --> 00:05:39,594
to promote quality
programming.

132
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:40,979
I think we should
watch PBS.

133
00:05:41,013 --> 00:05:42,981
Yeah, you're real
passionate about PBS.

134
00:05:43,015 --> 00:05:46,118
You donated once five years ago
and they sent you a mug.

135
00:05:46,152 --> 00:05:48,620
And now the mug's so old
that the "P" has been worn off

136
00:05:48,654 --> 00:05:49,971
so it just says "B.S."

137
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:52,641
It's libtards like you that are
screwing up our country.

138
00:05:52,675 --> 00:05:55,477
(knock at door)

139
00:05:55,511 --> 00:05:57,479
Tom Tucker?
What are you doing here?

140
00:05:57,513 --> 00:05:59,147
Well, I heard you're
the new Nielsen family.

141
00:05:59,182 --> 00:06:01,349
Just hoping you plan to watch
the Channel Five News.

142
00:06:01,384 --> 00:06:03,151
I don't know.
I've missed so many.

143
00:06:03,186 --> 00:06:04,786
It's gonna take me
forever to catch up.

144
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:06,722
Well, we'd sure love
to have you as a viewer.

145
00:06:06,756 --> 00:06:07,956
Is there anything we can do

146
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,402
to make the news
more appealing to you?

147
00:06:09,427 --> 00:06:10,492
Maybe.

148
00:06:10,493 --> 00:06:12,194
I guess you could
lose the moustache.

149
00:06:12,228 --> 00:06:13,395
Lose my moustache?

150
00:06:13,429 --> 00:06:15,397
Well, gosh, I...
I don't know.

151
00:06:15,431 --> 00:06:16,898
My birthmark
makes it kind of tough.

152
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:19,267
Always caused me problems
at my old job.

153
00:06:19,302 --> 00:06:21,703
And that'll do it for us here
at Channel 12 News.

154
00:06:21,738 --> 00:06:23,305
Make sure you turn
those clocks ahead.

155
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:24,639
Good night, St. Louis.

156
00:06:24,674 --> 00:06:25,841
Yeah, I don't know,

157
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,576
I was never that crazy
about the moustache.

158
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,811
Well, I suppose I could lose it
and just use more makeup.

159
00:06:29,846 --> 00:06:31,213
Yeah, that'd be cool.

160
00:06:31,247 --> 00:06:33,548
And maybe a festive hat would
make things more festive.

161
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,650
All right, this is good.
Any other suggestions?

162
00:06:35,685 --> 00:06:37,185
Yeah, can you end each show

163
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,688
by trying to pull-start
a very cold chain saw?

164
00:06:39,722 --> 00:06:40,956
Well, that shouldn't
be a problem.

165
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,491
All right, thank you
for being so candid.

166
00:06:42,525 --> 00:06:43,759
Hey, thanks for listening.

167
00:06:43,793 --> 00:06:45,861
I know how hard it is
to take criticism.

168
00:06:46,896 --> 00:06:48,263
Hey, nice boots, Griffin.

169
00:06:48,297 --> 00:06:50,499
They sell men's shoes
where you got those?

170
00:06:50,533 --> 00:06:52,434
PETER: <i>You made a commitment</i>
<i>to these boots, Peter.</i>

171
00:06:52,468 --> 00:06:54,069
<i>These boots are the new you,</i>

172
00:06:54,103 --> 00:06:55,403
<i>and no one will shake that.</i>

173
00:06:55,438 --> 00:06:58,206
Yee-haw, ride 'em, cowgirl!

174
00:06:58,241 --> 00:07:00,008
PETER: <i>Okay, you can take</i>
<i>the boots off at lunch.</i>

175
00:07:00,042 --> 00:07:01,676
<i>Go to the gym.</i>
<i>Have a workout.</i>

176
00:07:01,711 --> 00:07:03,178
<i>Come back in your sneakers.</i>

177
00:07:03,212 --> 00:07:05,247
<i>If anyone asks, you forgot</i>
<i>the boots in your locker.</i>

178
00:07:05,281 --> 00:07:06,681
<i>Just make it to lunch.</i>

179
00:07:06,716 --> 00:07:08,550
Those boots are
made for walkin'.

180
00:07:08,584 --> 00:07:10,085
Up to guys' butts.

181
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:12,254
(laughing)

182
00:07:12,288 --> 00:07:14,055
Hey, fellas.
Hey.

183
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,593
TOM TUCKER:
Good evening, Quahog.

184
00:07:18,628 --> 00:07:20,495
Tonight, Channel Five
mourns the loss

185
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:21,797
of a dear colleague.

186
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:23,265
My moustache.

187
00:07:23,299 --> 00:07:25,567
And as per the wishes
of my moustache,

188
00:07:25,601 --> 00:07:28,103
his ashes were sprinkled
off the coast of Acapulco

189
00:07:28,137 --> 00:07:29,271
where he was born.

190
00:07:29,305 --> 00:07:30,939
Well, that'll do it for us here.

191
00:07:30,973 --> 00:07:32,274
Thanks for watching
Channel Five,

192
00:07:32,308 --> 00:07:34,309
the most trusted name in news.

193
00:07:36,712 --> 00:07:38,914
Ah, crap.

194
00:07:38,948 --> 00:07:40,949
Oh, come on.

195
00:07:42,785 --> 00:07:44,953
Let's go, Tom.

196
00:07:44,987 --> 00:07:46,521
Work, damn it!

197
00:07:46,556 --> 00:07:47,589
What the hell?

198
00:07:47,623 --> 00:07:48,924
What's going on
with the news?

199
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,126
This is terrible!
Yeah, has he lost his mind?

200
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,561
Well, I'll be damned.

201
00:07:52,595 --> 00:07:54,763
If I knew he was gonna do
all that stuff I told him,

202
00:07:54,797 --> 00:07:56,097
I would've told him
more stuff.

203
00:07:56,132 --> 00:07:57,299
What?

204
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,301
Peter, you told him
to do this crap?

205
00:07:59,335 --> 00:08:00,836
Yeah, he came to my house
when he found out

206
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,904
I was a Nielsen family,
asked what I wanted to see.

207
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:04,472
Hey, hey, you know
what would be cool?

208
00:08:04,507 --> 00:08:06,808
If he did the news with
a family of prairie dogs,

209
00:08:06,843 --> 00:08:08,443
and whenever he said
something sad,

210
00:08:08,477 --> 00:08:10,545
they'd pop their heads up,
all concerned.

211
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,247
Peter, you sure that's
such a good idea?

212
00:08:12,281 --> 00:08:14,482
People rely on the local news
to provide them with

213
00:08:14,517 --> 00:08:17,285
several stories a year on how
saltwater taffy is made.

214
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,221
Yeah, if you're
a Nielsen family,

215
00:08:19,255 --> 00:08:21,156
it seems like you
should maybe be

216
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,657
a little more thoughtful
with your choices.

217
00:08:22,692 --> 00:08:23,825
What are you talking about?

218
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,060
I'm just having a little fun.

219
00:08:25,094 --> 00:08:26,528
For God's sakes,
I've just been handed

220
00:08:26,562 --> 00:08:28,196
the coolest freaking toy
on the planet.

221
00:08:28,231 --> 00:08:31,566
Well, you know, except for
Hungry Hungry Alec Baldwins.

222
00:08:33,436 --> 00:08:36,171
Hey, I'm not... I'm not
even touching the lever.

223
00:08:40,977 --> 00:08:43,478
Chilling news
from Long Island Sound,

224
00:08:43,512 --> 00:08:45,747
as a four-passenger prop plane
on its way to East Hampton

225
00:08:45,781 --> 00:08:47,816
spun into the surf
off Montauk Point.

226
00:08:48,651 --> 00:08:51,019
There were no survivors.

227
00:08:51,053 --> 00:08:53,521
Oh, that's so great, I just
called him on the way home!

228
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:56,091
Peter, I'm not sure this
is entirely responsible.

229
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,425
I don't see what
the big deal is.

230
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,027
I was just trying
to make the show better.

231
00:08:59,061 --> 00:09:00,929
Hell, I wish I could do it
with all the shows.

232
00:09:00,963 --> 00:09:02,664
Yeah, well, you only have
one Nielsen box.

233
00:09:02,698 --> 00:09:04,432
You don't have the clout
to affect national shows.

234
00:09:04,467 --> 00:09:05,667
Damn it.

235
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:07,068
I guess that means
I'll never get to see

236
00:09:07,103 --> 00:09:09,104
an episode of <i>Superman</i>
where Clark Kent and Lois Lane

237
00:09:09,138 --> 00:09:10,672
finally get together.

238
00:09:10,706 --> 00:09:11,973
Lois, I love you,

239
00:09:12,008 --> 00:09:15,243
and I want there to be
no more secrets between us.

240
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:16,912
I am Superman.

241
00:09:16,946 --> 00:09:18,246
Oh, my God.

242
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:20,115
The only thing that can
kill me is kryptonite.

243
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:21,650
Or latex.

244
00:09:21,684 --> 00:09:22,817
Or lambskin.

245
00:09:22,852 --> 00:09:24,552
What about polyurethane?
All that.

246
00:09:24,587 --> 00:09:25,553
All that stuff.

247
00:09:25,588 --> 00:09:27,555
(knock at door)

248
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,857
Hi, folks.

249
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:30,926
Just thought I'd stop by
and make sure your equipment

250
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,061
is working properly and see
if you have any questions.

251
00:09:33,095 --> 00:09:34,729
Yeah, is something wrong
with our remote?

252
00:09:34,764 --> 00:09:36,498
No matter how low
I turn the volume,

253
00:09:36,532 --> 00:09:38,500
Aziz Ansari is always
shouting at me.

254
00:09:38,534 --> 00:09:40,168
What did I do?

255
00:09:40,202 --> 00:09:41,970
Thank you.
I think we're good.

256
00:09:42,004 --> 00:09:43,471
Everything seems
to be going well.

257
00:09:43,506 --> 00:09:44,539
Okay, great.

258
00:09:44,573 --> 00:09:46,074
Well, I'm just gonna
change out the card

259
00:09:46,108 --> 00:09:48,376
on your unit real quick
and I'll be on my way.

260
00:10:00,356 --> 00:10:01,656
Well, we're all set.

261
00:10:01,691 --> 00:10:02,691
Thanks for your time.

262
00:10:02,725 --> 00:10:04,059
No, thank you, pal.

263
00:10:04,093 --> 00:10:05,427
And hey, you've been
working hard.

264
00:10:05,461 --> 00:10:07,095
Why don't you take the
rest of the day off?

265
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:09,431
Here's two tickets to Sandra
Bernhard's one-woman show.

266
00:10:09,465 --> 00:10:10,632
Wow, thanks!

267
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:11,800
Yeah, and they're
great seats.

268
00:10:11,834 --> 00:10:13,168
They're right in
the gap of her teeth.

269
00:10:13,202 --> 00:10:14,736
Social media?

270
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,404
More like a social disease.

271
00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:17,405
(audience laughs)

272
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,374
Ha! That's funny!

273
00:10:23,412 --> 00:10:25,714
Peter, what the hell's
going on here?

274
00:10:25,748 --> 00:10:28,149
Lois, we're no longer
one Nielsen family.

275
00:10:28,184 --> 00:10:30,051
We're 100.

276
00:10:30,086 --> 00:10:31,386
More boxes, more power.

277
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,221
And I got some ideas
to make TV better.

278
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,358
(phone rings)

279
00:10:36,392 --> 00:10:38,193
Hello, <i>Mad Men</i>
production office.

280
00:10:38,227 --> 00:10:39,327
Yeah, Peter Griffin here.

281
00:10:39,362 --> 00:10:40,829
Could I speak with
Jon Hamm, please?

282
00:10:40,863 --> 00:10:42,097
One moment.

283
00:10:42,131 --> 00:10:43,098
(phone rings)

284
00:10:43,132 --> 00:10:44,766
Hello?
Hello, Jon Hamm?

285
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,034
Peter Griffin,
Nielsen family.

286
00:10:46,068 --> 00:10:47,569
Listen, did I catch
you at a good time,

287
00:10:47,603 --> 00:10:50,071
or are you and the critics busy
sucking each other's butts?

288
00:10:50,106 --> 00:10:51,206
Excuse me?

289
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,707
Look, your show
is really boring.

290
00:10:52,742 --> 00:10:54,009
But don't worry,
I got some ideas

291
00:10:54,043 --> 00:10:55,143
on how you
can jazz it up.

292
00:10:55,177 --> 00:10:56,978
Listen, I don't need
your suggestions, pal.

293
00:10:57,013 --> 00:10:59,581
I've been a big celebrity
for a year and a half now.

294
00:10:59,615 --> 00:11:01,149
Okay, if that's
how you're gonna be.

295
00:11:01,183 --> 00:11:02,751
We'll see how
this plays out.

296
00:11:02,785 --> 00:11:05,053
Lois, we're not watching
<i>Mad Men</i> no more.

297
00:11:07,623 --> 00:11:09,557
(phone ringing)

298
00:11:09,592 --> 00:11:10,558
Hello?

299
00:11:10,593 --> 00:11:12,160
Look, I may have been
a little rash.

300
00:11:12,194 --> 00:11:13,828
Our ratings
have dropped 50%.

301
00:11:13,863 --> 00:11:15,930
Whatever suggestions
you have, I'll listen.

302
00:11:18,034 --> 00:11:19,401
And so, gentlemen,
in baseball,

303
00:11:19,435 --> 00:11:21,536
three strikes
and you're out.

304
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,338
But three Lucky Strikes...

305
00:11:23,372 --> 00:11:25,473
and you're in.

306
00:11:25,508 --> 00:11:26,674
Nice try, Don.

307
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:28,109
But I'm afraid
we're going to have

308
00:11:28,144 --> 00:11:29,444
to take our business
elsewhere.

309
00:11:29,478 --> 00:11:31,579
Oh? don't think so.

310
00:11:34,984 --> 00:11:37,452
(playing <i>Star Wars</i> theme)

311
00:11:40,856 --> 00:11:42,624
What the hell was that?

312
00:11:42,658 --> 00:11:44,092
I'll tell you
what it was, Lois.

313
00:11:44,126 --> 00:11:45,260
It was awesome.

314
00:11:45,294 --> 00:11:46,928
And wait'll
you see <i>Breaking Bad.</i>

315
00:11:46,962 --> 00:11:49,431
I don't know what it was,
but now it's on roller skates.

316
00:11:51,634 --> 00:11:53,568
Hi, NBC,
this is Peter Griffin.

317
00:11:53,602 --> 00:11:55,470
Listen, you guys
are doing a great job.

318
00:11:55,504 --> 00:11:59,240
If anybody knows what America
wants in the '90s, it's NBC.

319
00:11:59,275 --> 00:12:01,176
But I just have
one small request:

320
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,179
I like Dateline, but I really
hate waiting two hours

321
00:12:04,213 --> 00:12:05,780
to find out who the killer is.

322
00:12:05,815 --> 00:12:08,316
ANNOUNCER: <i>Tonight on</i> Dateline,
<i>a woman murdered.</i>

323
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,018
<i>Was it her ex-boyfriend?</i>

324
00:12:10,052 --> 00:12:11,519
<i>Yes, it was.</i>

325
00:12:11,554 --> 00:12:12,620
I knew it.

326
00:12:12,655 --> 00:12:15,023
I knew it was the ex-boyfriend.

327
00:12:18,427 --> 00:12:20,028
"Sleep tight, truck.

328
00:12:20,062 --> 00:12:22,464
"Sleep tight, firefly.

329
00:12:22,498 --> 00:12:24,799
"Sleep tight, chair.

330
00:12:24,834 --> 00:12:27,168
Sleep tight, bird."

331
00:12:27,203 --> 00:12:28,303
You see that, Peter?

332
00:12:28,337 --> 00:12:29,571
You see the bird?

333
00:12:29,605 --> 00:12:30,772
Bird.

334
00:12:30,806 --> 00:12:32,507
Okay, we'll, uh,
pick up the rest tomorrow.

335
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:35,710
Uh, now, I'm just gonna vamp for
a while with some random noises.

336
00:12:35,744 --> 00:12:37,345
Hee-hee!

337
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:39,514
Heya, heya, heya.

338
00:12:39,548 --> 00:12:41,549
(grumbling, groaning)

339
00:12:41,584 --> 00:12:42,917
Uh-heh, uh-heh...

340
00:12:42,952 --> 00:12:45,186
(gibbering)

341
00:12:48,057 --> 00:12:49,023
Okay, good night, Peter.

342
00:12:49,058 --> 00:12:50,091
Good night, Dave.

343
00:12:50,126 --> 00:12:51,459
LETTERMAN:
And, uh, here's Paul

344
00:12:51,494 --> 00:12:53,061
to play you to sleep
with a lullaby.

345
00:12:53,095 --> 00:12:54,562
PAUL (off-key):
♪ Hey, lullaby... ♪

346
00:12:54,597 --> 00:12:55,930
♪ Oh, lullaby ♪

347
00:12:55,965 --> 00:12:57,799
♪ Hey, you, lullaby... ♪

348
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:58,833
Stop, no, stop.

349
00:12:58,868 --> 00:12:59,834
Stop.

350
00:12:59,869 --> 00:13:01,536
I forgot, he's terrible.

351
00:13:04,573 --> 00:13:07,609
TV ANNOUNCER: <i>We now return to</i>
Cops With Banana Guns.

352
00:13:07,643 --> 00:13:10,011
Freeze!

353
00:13:10,045 --> 00:13:12,080
Is that...
is that a banana?

354
00:13:12,114 --> 00:13:13,481
Don't worry
about what it is.

355
00:13:13,516 --> 00:13:15,250
I'm still a cop.

356
00:13:15,284 --> 00:13:16,518
Whoa, hold on.

357
00:13:16,552 --> 00:13:18,520
All-All right, just...
just take it easy.

358
00:13:18,554 --> 00:13:20,622
This can go
a couple of ways.

359
00:13:20,656 --> 00:13:22,857
What the hell
did Peter do to <i>Cops?!</i>

360
00:13:22,892 --> 00:13:25,326
Bonnie!
Come push me out in a huff!

361
00:13:30,266 --> 00:13:31,699
Peter, what is this show?

362
00:13:31,734 --> 00:13:34,035
It's called <i>Creeping Up</i>
<i>on the Kardashians.</i>

363
00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:35,770
See that guy with the
ponytail in the background?

364
00:13:35,804 --> 00:13:37,939
He sneaks up and
scares the girls

365
00:13:37,973 --> 00:13:39,407
while they're
starting businesses

366
00:13:39,441 --> 00:13:40,875
or getting
their fat waxed.

367
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,143
(all scream)

368
00:13:42,178 --> 00:13:43,244
What the hell?!

369
00:13:44,947 --> 00:13:46,414
(crowd clamoring)

370
00:13:46,448 --> 00:13:48,550
There they are!
That's the Nielsen family!

371
00:13:48,584 --> 00:13:50,051
You ruined television!

372
00:13:50,085 --> 00:13:52,320
Now it's just
a big, old, silly mess!

373
00:13:52,354 --> 00:13:54,656
Oh, God! An angry mob!

374
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:57,592
I've got to swallow all my
valuables and get out of here!

375
00:14:09,438 --> 00:14:11,005
Did you see the mob?

376
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,140
Did I see the mob?

377
00:14:12,174 --> 00:14:13,575
Why else am I here?

378
00:14:17,152 --> 00:14:19,120
(clamoring)

379
00:14:19,154 --> 00:14:21,522
Oh, my God, Peter,
they're really angry!

380
00:14:21,557 --> 00:14:23,190
Say something!

381
00:14:23,225 --> 00:14:24,275
W-Wait.
What the hell's going on?

382
00:14:24,309 --> 00:14:25,693
What do you mean,
I ruined television?

383
00:14:25,727 --> 00:14:27,762
You put a real cougar
on <i>Cougar Town,</i>

384
00:14:27,796 --> 00:14:29,230
and now that cougar's dead

385
00:14:29,264 --> 00:14:31,999
because Courtney Cox ripped it
apart with her teeth and claws!

386
00:14:32,034 --> 00:14:35,703
You turned <i>Anderson Cooper 360</i>
into <i>Anderson Cooper 720!</i>

387
00:14:35,737 --> 00:14:37,238
He's turning around too much!

388
00:14:37,272 --> 00:14:39,640
You converted <i>The Biggest Loser</i>
to the metric system!

389
00:14:39,675 --> 00:14:41,642
Now it feels like
they're not losing enough!

390
00:14:41,677 --> 00:14:43,144
Aw, the hell with you guys!

391
00:14:43,178 --> 00:14:45,746
You're just jealous 'cause I get
to say what's on TV now!

392
00:14:45,781 --> 00:14:47,848
I am a Nielsen god!

393
00:14:49,851 --> 00:14:51,852
(cheering)

394
00:14:54,256 --> 00:14:55,456
Sorry, y'all.

395
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:58,059
That's the first time
I ever throwed anything.

396
00:15:02,764 --> 00:15:05,299
Well, if it isn't
Mr. Nielsen himself.

397
00:15:05,334 --> 00:15:07,501
Nurse, who's the worst
doctor in this hospital?

398
00:15:07,536 --> 00:15:08,736
You are,
Dr. Hartman.

399
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,404
Good.
Put Hartman on this bozo.

400
00:15:10,439 --> 00:15:11,772
Hey, what can
I do for you?

401
00:15:11,807 --> 00:15:13,808
Please, Doc, you got to
help me with this nasty gash.

402
00:15:13,842 --> 00:15:14,842
What seems
to be the problem?

403
00:15:14,876 --> 00:15:16,243
No, it's my husband.

404
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:18,479
Oh. Well, you've got a lot
of nerve coming in here

405
00:15:18,513 --> 00:15:19,714
after what you
did to television.

406
00:15:19,748 --> 00:15:20,881
Now, get out!

407
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,783
Please, Doctor,
you've got to help him.

408
00:15:22,818 --> 00:15:25,119
You took an oath when
you went to medical school.

409
00:15:25,153 --> 00:15:26,954
I took a lot of things when
I went to medical school.

410
00:15:26,989 --> 00:15:28,756
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to answer this.

411
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,957
Hello?

412
00:15:29,992 --> 00:15:31,759
Ah, Hartman!

413
00:15:36,498 --> 00:15:37,632
Hey, guys.
How you doing?

414
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:38,666
Not so good, Peter.

415
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,800
Yeah, me, either.

416
00:15:39,835 --> 00:15:41,836
Thanks to you,
TV's a vast wasteland.

417
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,104
You know how
I know that phrase?

418
00:15:43,138 --> 00:15:44,472
I read it in a book,
you monster!

419
00:15:44,506 --> 00:15:46,107
Aw, come on, let me
make it up to you.

420
00:15:46,141 --> 00:15:47,141
Let me buy you a beer.

421
00:15:47,175 --> 00:15:48,876
No, that seat's taken.

422
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,944
Move along, Peter.

423
00:15:49,978 --> 00:15:51,646
What are you
talking about?

424
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,680
You guys are my pals.

425
00:15:52,714 --> 00:15:53,781
We used to be, Peter.

426
00:15:53,815 --> 00:15:54,882
Now, scram.

427
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,118
Well, fine,
I'll sit at the bar.

428
00:15:57,152 --> 00:15:58,753
Not at my bar, you won't.

429
00:15:58,787 --> 00:16:00,054
Get out of here!

430
00:16:00,088 --> 00:16:02,189
Geez, I can't
show my face anywhere.

431
00:16:02,224 --> 00:16:04,725
I might as well be back
doing public radio.

432
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,127
This is Peter Griffin,

433
00:16:06,161 --> 00:16:09,497
and you're listening
to <i>Book Talk</i> on WRNI.

434
00:16:09,531 --> 00:16:10,798
Today we'll be discussing

435
00:16:10,832 --> 00:16:12,667
Bret Easton Ellis's
popular work,

436
00:16:12,701 --> 00:16:16,404
<i>Less Than Zero,</i> a tale
of privilege, detachment

437
00:16:16,438 --> 00:16:18,606
and youthful alienation.

438
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,474
(taking a long, loud sip of tea)

439
00:16:22,144 --> 00:16:23,811
But first,
a word from our sponsor,

440
00:16:23,845 --> 00:16:26,047
Westin's Golden Soda Biscuits.

441
00:16:26,081 --> 00:16:27,748
I'm enjoying one right now.

442
00:16:27,783 --> 00:16:29,884
(crunches biscuit)

443
00:16:29,918 --> 00:16:31,352
Mmm.

444
00:16:31,386 --> 00:16:35,322
(sips, then crunches)

445
00:16:35,357 --> 00:16:37,058
Mmm.

446
00:16:37,092 --> 00:16:40,461
(sips tea, crunches biscuit)

447
00:16:40,495 --> 00:16:42,063
Mmm.

448
00:16:42,097 --> 00:16:45,599
(sips tea, crunches biscuit)

449
00:16:48,737 --> 00:16:50,304
(sips tea)

450
00:16:50,338 --> 00:16:52,339
Mmm.

451
00:16:55,811 --> 00:16:58,112
That concludes
today's session of <i>Book Talk.</i>

452
00:16:58,146 --> 00:17:00,881
Tune in tomorrow when we will
look at John Kennedy Toole's

453
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:03,984
unheralded early work,
<i>The Neon Bible.</i>

454
00:17:07,956 --> 00:17:09,356
Hey, what's wrong, Peter?

455
00:17:09,391 --> 00:17:10,891
I miss my friends, Brian.

456
00:17:10,926 --> 00:17:13,227
I mean, I was having fun
with those Nielsen boxes,

457
00:17:13,261 --> 00:17:14,795
but what's the point

458
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:17,431
if I don't got Joe and
Quagmire to enjoy it with me?

459
00:17:17,466 --> 00:17:20,267
I guess I shouldn't have
messed with television.

460
00:17:20,302 --> 00:17:22,269
Well, it's not
exactly your fault.

461
00:17:22,304 --> 00:17:23,671
The networks never should
have listened to you

462
00:17:23,705 --> 00:17:24,905
in the first place.

463
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,574
This is exactly what
makes bad television:

464
00:17:26,608 --> 00:17:28,509
pandering to the lowest
common denominator.

465
00:17:28,543 --> 00:17:30,144
So what do I do, Brian?

466
00:17:30,178 --> 00:17:31,679
Well, you still
have these boxes.

467
00:17:31,713 --> 00:17:34,615
That means you still have the
power to influence television.

468
00:17:34,649 --> 00:17:36,717
Maybe you can use that
power to help restore TV

469
00:17:36,752 --> 00:17:37,852
to the way it was.

470
00:17:37,886 --> 00:17:39,053
You're right, Brian.

471
00:17:39,087 --> 00:17:41,055
Maybe if I watch
smart, quality shows,

472
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:42,723
that'll help get things back
to the way they were.

473
00:17:42,758 --> 00:17:45,159
We can use these boxes
for good and...

474
00:17:46,294 --> 00:17:47,828
What the hell?!

475
00:17:47,863 --> 00:17:51,565
That's for adding another tree
to <i>One Tree Hill!</i>

476
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,034
Oh, my God, he destroyed
every last box!

477
00:17:54,069 --> 00:17:55,336
Holy crap!

478
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,904
We're sunk now, Peter.

479
00:17:56,938 --> 00:18:00,274
There goes your one chance to
get TV back to the way it was.

480
00:18:00,308 --> 00:18:02,176
Wait a minute.
Maybe not, Brian.

481
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:05,012
I think I just got an idea.

482
00:18:05,046 --> 00:18:06,747
Aah!
I got glass in my face!

483
00:18:06,782 --> 00:18:09,216
Oh, crap.
Now I forgot what it was.

484
00:18:09,251 --> 00:18:10,284
I got it!

485
00:18:10,318 --> 00:18:11,786
Aah! Son of a bitch!

486
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,423
You know who I hate?

487
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:17,458
The troops.

488
00:18:17,492 --> 00:18:18,793
Yeah, me, too.

489
00:18:18,827 --> 00:18:20,327
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
who are you?

490
00:18:20,362 --> 00:18:21,529
I'm Peter Griffin.

491
00:18:21,563 --> 00:18:22,930
I'm the guy
who ruined television,

492
00:18:22,964 --> 00:18:24,331
and I'm the guy
who's gonna fix it.

493
00:18:24,366 --> 00:18:25,366
Guys!

494
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,400
I broke television,

495
00:18:26,434 --> 00:18:27,935
and now you have
to help me fix it!

496
00:18:27,969 --> 00:18:29,069
Yah-ha!

497
00:18:29,104 --> 00:18:31,405
Looks like this is one
we beat you to.

498
00:18:35,277 --> 00:18:37,344
Gentlemen, I have
gathered you all here today

499
00:18:37,379 --> 00:18:39,847
because you are the creators
of what television used to be

500
00:18:39,881 --> 00:18:41,248
before I ruined it.

501
00:18:41,283 --> 00:18:44,051
And we need to rebuild
television from the ground up.

502
00:18:44,085 --> 00:18:46,987
So, I'm gonna need
all your best ideas.

503
00:18:47,022 --> 00:18:49,723
J.J. Abrams, you take
wonder and complexity

504
00:18:49,758 --> 00:18:51,826
and present it in a way that
no one can possibly understand.

505
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,093
Whaddaya got?!

506
00:18:53,128 --> 00:18:55,062
I've got an alien
that goes back in time

507
00:18:55,096 --> 00:18:57,965
and encounters a koala bear
in an Eastern European town.

508
00:18:57,999 --> 00:18:59,500
Totally confused.
Do it!

509
00:18:59,534 --> 00:19:02,036
Okay, now, we're gonna need
15 workplace comedies

510
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,904
where people talk
to the camera for some reason.

511
00:19:03,939 --> 00:19:05,940
You, you, you and you-- go.

512
00:19:07,008 --> 00:19:08,309
When Peter told me to make

513
00:19:08,343 --> 00:19:09,677
a workplace comedy
where people talk

514
00:19:09,711 --> 00:19:10,978
to the camera, I thought...

515
00:19:11,012 --> 00:19:12,646
Not now!
I mean, go do a show!

516
00:19:12,681 --> 00:19:15,049
Don't-don't do
that thing here.

517
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,083
Huh.

518
00:19:16,117 --> 00:19:17,384
Wonder if I can
pull off one of those

519
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:19,420
"can you believe what
I have to put up with" looks

520
00:19:19,454 --> 00:19:20,754
to the camera.

521
00:19:23,692 --> 00:19:26,393
Okay, Mark Burnett, you did
<i>Survivor</i> and <i>The Apprentice.</i>

522
00:19:26,428 --> 00:19:29,196
Can you give me a reality show
where people do horrible,

523
00:19:29,231 --> 00:19:30,598
unforgiveable things
to each other

524
00:19:30,632 --> 00:19:32,299
for embarrassingly
small sums of money?

525
00:19:32,334 --> 00:19:33,467
I got some ideas.

526
00:19:33,501 --> 00:19:36,303
Here's a nickel,
pull down your pants.

527
00:19:36,338 --> 00:19:37,538
There's a show.

528
00:19:37,572 --> 00:19:38,839
Yah-ha! Go!

529
00:19:40,275 --> 00:19:41,642
All right, now,
who's gonna make a show

530
00:19:41,676 --> 00:19:42,743
about horrible
New Jersey freaks?

531
00:19:42,777 --> 00:19:43,911
You know what?
I don't care.

532
00:19:43,945 --> 00:19:44,945
Just someone, do it!

533
00:19:45,981 --> 00:19:47,181
Okay, Dick Wolf,

534
00:19:47,215 --> 00:19:49,250
make the same <i>Law and Order</i>
six times.

535
00:19:49,284 --> 00:19:51,252
Oh, and also,
could you marry Matt Weiner

536
00:19:51,286 --> 00:19:53,354
'cause I want your name
to be Dick "Weener."

537
00:19:53,388 --> 00:19:55,522
Okay, but can I go by
"Dick Wolf-Weener"?

538
00:19:55,557 --> 00:19:57,491
Oh, my God, yes!
Yes! Yes!

539
00:19:57,525 --> 00:19:59,126
Okay, Bravo people,
go find women fighting.

540
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,594
No, you know what,
just find women.

541
00:20:00,629 --> 00:20:01,862
They'll end up fighting.

542
00:20:01,897 --> 00:20:04,331
All right, everyone who's left,
make a talent show.

543
00:20:04,366 --> 00:20:06,033
We are done.

544
00:20:06,067 --> 00:20:09,303
Oh, Kelsey Grammer,
what are you still doing here?

545
00:20:09,337 --> 00:20:10,638
I-I have nothing left
for you.

546
00:20:10,672 --> 00:20:11,839
I'm... I'm sorry.

547
00:20:11,873 --> 00:20:15,576
Ah. Then I shall take
my ease on the lanai.

548
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,244
I don't care
what you do now.

549
00:20:21,383 --> 00:20:23,684
TV ANNOUNCER: We now return
to <i>Mike and Molly.</i>

550
00:20:23,718 --> 00:20:25,552
Have you decided
what you'd like to order?

551
00:20:25,587 --> 00:20:27,087
Yes, the chopped salad?

552
00:20:27,122 --> 00:20:28,822
I'll have everything
except that.

553
00:20:28,857 --> 00:20:29,890
(studio audience laughing)

554
00:20:29,925 --> 00:20:30,991
(laughing)

555
00:20:31,026 --> 00:20:32,393
That waiter's like, "What?!"

556
00:20:32,427 --> 00:20:33,527
Well, you did it, Peter.

557
00:20:33,561 --> 00:20:35,262
You got TV back to normal.

558
00:20:35,297 --> 00:20:37,398
Yeah, guys,
I'm sorry for screwing up

559
00:20:37,432 --> 00:20:38,666
all your favorite shows.

560
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,934
Ah, that's okay, Peter.

561
00:20:39,968 --> 00:20:40,935
So, what do you say?

562
00:20:40,969 --> 00:20:42,236
Are we pals again?

563
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,815
Ah, course we are.
You bet.

564
00:20:43,816 --> 00:20:45,616
Well, let's drink
to having TV

565
00:20:45,651 --> 00:20:48,186
back in the hands of people
who know what they're doing.

566
00:20:49,412 --> 00:20:51,313
I think <i>Zack and Cody</i>
would be funnier

567
00:20:51,347 --> 00:20:53,315
if they did the show
in their underpants.

568
