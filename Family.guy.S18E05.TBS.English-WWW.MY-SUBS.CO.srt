<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,174
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

3
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:11,802
<i>But where are those
good old-fashioned values</i>

4
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:14,847
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

5
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:18,184
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

6
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:21,604
<i>Lucky there's a man who
positively can do</i>

7
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,064
<i>All the things that make us</i>

8
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:24,899
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:30,155

11
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:39,618
- Hey, where's Quagmire?
- Actually, I haven't seen him all week.

12
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:42,250
Methinks he found a new lady friend.

13
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:45,086
Don't say "methinks" ever again, Joe.

14
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:47,346
- Hey, there he is.
- Hey, guys.

15
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:48,673
What-What's all this?

16
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:52,014
Oh, this little oogie-woogie
is my new friend, Albertine.

17
00:00:52,015 --> 00:00:53,614
Who thinks she's French.

18
00:00:53,615 --> 00:00:55,930
She loves to smoke
and feels it's not truly a meal

19
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:57,431
unless you serve bread.

20
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,225
Isn't that right, Albertine?

21
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,227
You got to serve bread?

22
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,563
I don't believe
she's ever said any of that.

23
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:06,107
So where have you been
<i>lo</i> these many days?

24
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:07,650
Joe!

25
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:10,111
Well, you know how there's
hardly any cat cafés in town?

26
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:12,029
Well, I decided to open a cat café.

27
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,615
- What's a cat café?
- It's like a coffee shop,

28
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:17,577
except one where lots of cats
live and roam.

29
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:21,830
Hmm, methinks the cat café
sounds like a great idea.

30
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:24,208
That's it, Joe!
I challenge you to a duel!

31
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,085
Pistols at midnight.

32
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,802
Peter, did you bring a flamethrower?

33
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,138
No.

34
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:40,475
I also didn't bring one of them
laser guns from<i> Ghostbusters.</i>

35
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:43,633
Joe, look! Look!

36
00:01:43,634 --> 00:01:45,193
I got Mayor West!

37
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:52,029
Good. We'll keep him
till we get a new mayor.

38
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,825
Principal Shepherd, we were
so surprised to get your call.

39
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,243
Wh-What's going on?

40
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,787
Mrs. Griffin, Meg and Chris
were caught cheating.

41
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,080
- What?
- Yes.

42
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,166
They had the Lost Boys of the Sudan

43
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,085
standing in for them in gym class.

44
00:02:09,251 --> 00:02:11,089
Nice block, Griffin.

45
00:02:12,868 --> 00:02:14,842
Nice shot, other Griffin.

46
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,093
This is terrible.

47
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,137
Uh, what do you think about this, Peter?

48
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,599
Bad. Very bad.

49
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:27,146
Here it is, guys! What do you think?

50
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,399
I'm realizing I may have a cat allergy.

51
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,859
I think it's great, Glenn.

52
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,487
And people really seem to be
enjoying themselves.

53
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:37,031
Boy, if I could clean myself
with my tongue,

54
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,324
I'd never leave the house.

55
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:44,163
Right?

56
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,165
And it's like, if I had nine lives,

57
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,542
maybe I'd finally find a man.

58
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,339
You's joining me.

59
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,177
- Peter, we have to talk.
- What fireworks?

60
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,846
After what happened today
with Meg and Chris at school,

61
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,141
I sent an e-mail to my sister,
and five minutes later,

62
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,281
Google Ads suggested
a Christian family camp.

63
00:03:07,282 --> 00:03:09,230
Yeah, the world's better
now that corporations read

64
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:12,400
our most private communications
and then sell back at us

65
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,568
the very things
they've eavesdropped about.

66
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,657
Even before this, I'd worried about

67
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:21,742
our church attendance dropping off.

68
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,578
Now with the kids showing
a complete lack of morals,

69
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:27,790
well, we may all need to go
to Christian family camp.

70
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,584
Lois, you know I love you like a
brother, but I'm not doing that.

71
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,087
I'd only get in an awkward,
campfire-crackle argument

72
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,422
with a counselor.

73
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,424
Jesus has love for everyone.

74
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,259
Uh, actually, what Jesus has

75
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,511
is the might of Western civilization.

76
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:43,222
Jesus has guns, germs and steel.

77
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,979
Sorry, the wood is very wet.

78
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,106
Uh, actually, the wood is very dry.

79
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,233
Wet wood hisses, dry wood crackles

80
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,901
during uncomfortable silence.

81
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:02,534
I like cutaways where I get to be smart.

82
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,040
What the... what the hell is that?

83
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,631
Hey! Shut up!

84
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,633
Don't look at me! I'm dominant!

85
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,552
Brian? What are you doing here?

86
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,471
What am I doing here? What is all this?

87
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:26,140
I happen to own this place.
It's a cat café.

88
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,309
Now get out of here.
You're making all my cats angry.

89
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,685
That's why they're hissing.

90
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,645
Actually, frightened cats hiss.

91
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,063
Angry cats moan.

92
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,067
You can't open this place here.

93
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,028
It's right next to my favorite bar.

94
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,780
Go to hell, Brian.
You don't own this block.

95
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,239
I'm not going anywhere.

96
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,785
Fine. But I am about to become
your worst nightmare.

97
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,828
No way. I've already had
my worst nightmare.

98
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,830
I've told you about
my worst nightmare, right?

99
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,500
- No, I-I don't think so.
- Oh, boy, get comfortable.

100
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,585
Well, first,
I'm driving through a forest,

101
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:57,316
but it's actually inside,
which is weird, right?

102
00:04:57,317 --> 00:04:58,923
- Okay.
- And there's all these people

103
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,509
in the van who normally wouldn't
know each other in real life:

104
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,679
my second grade teacher, my mom,
Joe, but it wasn't quite Joe.

105
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,848
All the kids are
yelling at me in German,

106
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,184
and I understood them,
but I don't speak German.

107
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,853
Then<i> SNL</i> is starting,
and I'm clearly in the cast,

108
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,855
and I haven't been
to any of the rehearsals,

109
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:18,025
and all the cue cards are blank,
and that show is all cue cards.

110
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,069
And just as that's sinking in,

111
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,862
I realize I'm also the musical guest.

112
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,364
I mean, I can't pull that off.

113
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,449
Who do I think I am? Silverchair?

114
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,285
- And the weird thing is...
- Wait a minute.

115
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,703
Listening to other people's nightmares

116
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,121
is<i> my</i> worst nightmare!

117
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,958
Oh. Oh, thank God.

118
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,171
I got to shut down that cat place.

119
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,220
Okay, Peter, the kids and I
are off to church camp.

120
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:49,557
Meg, Chris, the vans are here.

121
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,267
Wait a minute.

122
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:54,144
- You got any booze in that bag, mister?
- No, sir.

123
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,730
Well, then, how you gonna
make any friends at camp?

124
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,232
Here you go.

125
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:01,987
Now chug all this next to
a lake, you little rascal.

126
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,158
Shut down the cat café!

127
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,202
It's a nuisance
and a threat to public health!

128
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,330
Oh, for God's sake.

129
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:17,251
City ordinance 321 states,
"Food or drink shall not

130
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:21,505
be prepared or consumed within
20 feet of fecal matter."

131
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,335
- Damn it, Brian.
- Also, Persian cats?

132
00:06:24,336 --> 00:06:26,594
Let's call them what they are:
Iranian cats.

133
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:29,763
This entire operation
needs to be shut down.

134
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,057
And as long as
Brian's got your attention,

135
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,518
is it taking anyone else longer to wipe?

136
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,061
More wipes these days?

137
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,606
I'm taking shorter poops
but with longer wipes,

138
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,900
and there's always this one little line.

139
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,903
I swear to God, it's like
there's a crayon down there.

140
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,852
Wait, excuse me for a minute.

141
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,283
Son of a gun, it was a crayon.

142
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:52,200
Thanks for letting me
talk that out, everybody.

143
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,960
Wikipedia states that

144
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:03,464
"Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic
disease spread by exposure

145
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:04,924
to infected cat feces."

146
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,216
Damn it, Brian, get out of here.

147
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,927
You're scaring away my customers.

148
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,054
They also ring you up
on one of those tablets

149
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,931
they flip around at you and then glare

150
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,141
while you pick from
three inflated tip percentages.

151
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,060
You can also choose "no tip."

152
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,896
But that option is, by design,
much less prominent.

153
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,189
You're a jerk.

154
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,108
But fine, if it's a fight
you want, you got one.

155
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,153
I will squash you like a bug.

156
00:07:25,776 --> 00:07:27,905
Well, that's enough of that show.

157
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,991
But, Dad, we want to see
what happens at Christian camp.

158
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,828
All right. But they're on thin ice.

159
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,924
Welcome to Sunrise Woods Bible Camp.

160
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,926
I'm the camp director Vera.

161
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:51,011
Nice to meet you. We're the Griffins.

162
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,847
Why are all these trees
bunched together?

163
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,474
Th-Those are woods, Chris.

164
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,768
I only like rooms.

165
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,436
What a lovely setting.

166
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,022
Yes, the fresh air really helps

167
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,692
clear your mind
of thoughts of Tom Selleck.

168
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,861
Oh. How frighteningly specific.

169
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,863
Ugh, Mom, this place sucks.

170
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:13,826
It's even worse than when Dad
sent us to 1940s comedy school.

171
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,787
Say, Corporal, what are you
writing in your diary?

172
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:19,748
It's private. Take a look.

173
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,292
Now, that's some good, clean fun.

174
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:25,796
Also in the 1940s,
six million Jews died.

175
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,464
That's it, we're done.

176
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,635
This show is not for the Bugsteins.

177
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,474
<i>Good evening. Quite a battle brewing...</i>

178
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,144
<i>Clever news pun, doesn't really
work as I haven't yet mentioned</i>

179
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:43,188
<i>the subject of the story...
At Quahog's new cat café.</i>

180
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,233
<i>Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa
filed this report.</i>

181
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:51,405
<i>Tom, I'm standing here outside
of Quahog's new cat café.</i>

182
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:55,075
<i>Local resident Brian Griffin
has described the café</i>

183
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,494
<i>as a threat to public health.</i>

184
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:00,514
<i>That's right, Tricia.
And since I'm on local TV,</i>

185
00:09:00,515 --> 00:09:02,364
<i>I'm gonna talk a little too loud,</i>

186
00:09:02,365 --> 00:09:04,084
<i>and then occasionally
I'm gonna turn away</i>

187
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,741
<i>From the microphone
to point at things off-camera,</i>

188
00:09:06,742 --> 00:09:08,505
<i>So my overall point is lost.</i>

189
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,676
<i>Powerful claims. Thank you, Brian.</i>

190
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:17,715
Okay, Brian, I brought
everything we need:

191
00:09:17,716 --> 00:09:19,671
water, sunscreen, Fruit Roll-Ups,

192
00:09:19,672 --> 00:09:20,934
- batteries.
- Stewie,

193
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,436
you know you're not allowed
to have Fruit Roll-Ups.

194
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,021
Damn, I tried to bury it in there.

195
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,564
What are you even wearing?

196
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:29,109
Oh, this is what Princess Diana
wore to protest land mines.

197
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,030
It's sad she's not around
to watch her son go bald.

198
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,948
Brian, I'm glad you're here.

199
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,451
Based on the various public
health concerns you raised,

200
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:40,704
the city has decided
to shut this establishment down.

201
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,123
Really? You're closing the café?

202
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,959
That's right. Thanks to you,
I'm out of business.

203
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,817
I certainly hope you're happ...
Oh, nice top, Stewie.

204
00:09:48,818 --> 00:09:49,963
Come on, lock it up.

205
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,814
Until the Board of Health
gives the okay, you're done.

206
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:57,042
Wow, I actually got the place shut down.

207
00:09:57,043 --> 00:09:58,815
I'm glad I was here for this, Brian.

208
00:09:58,816 --> 00:10:00,641
We've hardly done anything
together since we made

209
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:03,977
that fiber commercial and had
to use code words for pooping.

210
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,230
Wow, Brian, I've never felt so regular.

211
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:09,108
Yes, you seem exceptionally
active while maintaining

212
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,352
- proper body health.
- That's right.

213
00:10:11,353 --> 00:10:15,072
Just two spoonfuls a day
to stay regular and active.

214
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,586
- More coffee, Stewie?
- Yes, please.

215
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:20,953
Oh, dear, that was a mistake.

216
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,080
You mean, you're about to be active?

217
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,540
Currently active.

218
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,042
Cut to the shot of them
stirring the product into water!

219
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,920
<i>GurgleMax: Take a massive comfort.</i>

220
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,339
Oh, God!

221
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,591
Oh, there's regular on the carpet!

222
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:37,511
Ah, there's so much regular!

223
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,894
How are those drawings of Jesus coming?

224
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,272
Okay, a little dark on the hair there.

225
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,274
Let's lighten it up. Lighten it up.

226
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,025
Eyes should be blue.

227
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:55,195
Remember, history says
that Jesus does not look like

228
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,030
a traditional man from the Middle East,

229
00:10:57,031 --> 00:11:00,784
but rather someone
who sells raw milk online.

230
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,662
Okay, let's put those away for now.

231
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,873
I'd like to move on to having you all

232
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,958
sign your contracts with God.

233
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,043
Contracts with God?

234
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:13,797
Yep. It's a written commitment
to forgo all alcohol,

235
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,850
drugs and self-pleasure.

236
00:11:16,851 --> 00:11:19,554
Yeah, I'm gonna have
my lawyer look at this.

237
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,641
I tell you, it's a good day, Stewie.

238
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:27,060
Now that that cat café is gone,
I can finally get back

239
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,283
to my favorite bar and do some writing.

240
00:11:29,284 --> 00:11:31,648
Whoa, sorry. Can't let you in there.

241
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,317
What? I come in here all the time.

242
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,403
Well, apparently, due to some
recent public health concerns,

243
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,573
the city has said that no
animals of any kind are allowed

244
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,574
in any public establishment.

245
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,429
What?! You got to be kidding me!

246
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:46,413
Well, that's all right, Brian.
We can go to<i> my</i> writing spot.

247
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,081
Brian! Look at my jump!

248
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,917
Look at my jump! Look at my jump!

249
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,251
Whoa!

250
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:54,213
This place has the best
pizza and Pepsi, Brian.

251
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,591
Did you hear me?
The best pizza and Pepsi.

252
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,680
Oh, no, my pizza and Pepsi!

253
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,191
Oh, hey, Peter. Come on in.

254
00:12:09,192 --> 00:12:10,520
Thanks for coming by.

255
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,773
Aw, no problem, buddy.
Here, I brought you something.

256
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,359
I figured anyone living alone
with 73 cats

257
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,403
needs to have a double-XL
Minnie Mouse sweatshirt.

258
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,072
Thank you so much.

259
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,032
This won't fit at all; it's perfect.

260
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,116
So, how's it going?

261
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,285
Well, not bad. Got plenty of company.

262
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,621
Well, that's good.
I haven't seen you at the Clam.

263
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:28,956
Well, I've been pretty busy.

264
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,540
So, can I get you something to drink?

265
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,708
Sure. What have you got?

266
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,961
Well, I've got water
with cat hair in it.

267
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,379
Eh, anything else?

268
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,297
I've got lemonade with cat hair in it.

269
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,716
Uh, kind of a summer drink.
Anything else?

270
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,718
Oh, sure. Cat hair ginger ale?

271
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,845
- Nope.
- Cat hair iced tea?

272
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,137
Uh, again, summer.

273
00:12:45,138 --> 00:12:47,327
You want to just take a look
in the fridge, see what I got?

274
00:12:47,328 --> 00:12:49,434
Sure.

275
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,480
Someone just had kittens in my mouth.

276
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,225
What's up? What are you doing?

277
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:01,905
Nothing. I'm just sitting here,
trying to figure out

278
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,991
why we have stupid purple couches.

279
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,993
Have you ever known anyone in your life

280
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,160
to own a purple couch?

281
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,288
I would assume Steve Harvey.

282
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,674
That actually sounds right,
but-but what is<i> this?</i>

283
00:13:11,675 --> 00:13:13,153
A picture of a mountain?!

284
00:13:13,154 --> 00:13:14,835
When have we ever been to a mountain?!

285
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:17,170
- What mountain even is it?
- That's Mount Quahog.

286
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,506
Yeah... I don't know, feels made up.

287
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,174
Brian, is this all because
you haven't been able

288
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,677
- to get a drink?
- I haven't been able to go anywhere.

289
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,929
No dogs allowed in public places.

290
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,681
Yes, I was thinking about that.

291
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,935
What if there was a way
for you to go out?

292
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,088
"Emotional support animal"?

293
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:38,025
Wear this, every place
will have to let you in.

294
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:40,319
- So long as I'm with you.
- Where'd you even get that thing?

295
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,778
The letters are iron-on.

296
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,532
The vest is from when I worked
at Office Depot.

297
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,199
One pen? You're buying one pen?

298
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,237
Yep.

299
00:13:50,238 --> 00:13:52,497
You don't work in an office
you can steal this from?

300
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,874
I work from home.

301
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,709
Ugh.

302
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,255
<i>Office Depot. We're coming, Blockbuster.</i>

303
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:06,261
Mom, we don't really have to get
baptized, do we?

304
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,638
No, Meg, just hang
towards the back of the line.

305
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,391
- Good plan.
- Chris, stop relieving yourself.

306
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,061
You've got those pee eyes.

307
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:17,887
Brother Chris.

308
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,027
Do it again.

309
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:25,030
- Sister Lois?
- Oh, no, thanks.

310
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,281
Y-You'd have no way of knowing this,

311
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,533
but I'm actually having
a very good hair day.

312
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,243
When my hair gets wet,
I tend to look like

313
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,289
a frazzled Sandra Bullock
from one of her comedies.

314
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:39,045
My ex-husband had Nazi
paraphernalia and<i> he</i> left<i> me.</i>

315
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,509
So I said, "That shirt
looks really good on you,"

316
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,594
and he says, "Thanks, my
boyfriend got it for me."

317
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,274
It's like, whoa, all I said
was I like the shirt,

318
00:14:50,275 --> 00:14:52,599
and he has to drop "boyfriend"
like a nuclear bomb?

319
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,102
- I mean, that's on<i> him,</i> right?
- Yeah. I don't know.

320
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:57,983
Ugh, you're supposed to be giving me
emotional support right now.

321
00:14:57,984 --> 00:14:59,147
Let's just get to the bar.

322
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,067
No, no, Brian, say something
nice about me right now.

323
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,777
Come on, Stewie,
that's not what this is.

324
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:06,029
It is now. Say something nice about me

325
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,862
or I'll disappear like
a serial killer in a '90s movie.

326
00:15:08,863 --> 00:15:10,534
Stewie, wait. I need you to get in.

327
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:11,744
I'm gonna do it.

328
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,585
Okay, who's ready for some breakf...?

329
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,588
Oh, crap, another one died.
Hey, hey, stop eating her!

330
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,133
Get away! Okay, new house rule.

331
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,678
Everyone look at me.
Don't eat the dead cats.

332
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,013
Oh. Hey, Quagmire.

333
00:15:35,014 --> 00:15:36,458
We came to see how it's going.

334
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:39,646
Uh, "how's it going"?
I got a dead cat on a pitchfork!

335
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,565
I don't even know which can
to put it in!

336
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:44,317
Trash?! Yard trimmings?! Recycling?!

337
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,319
I just put whatever in whatever.

338
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,991
Hey, guys! Check it out!

339
00:15:47,992 --> 00:15:51,950
Cat legs! Cats, arise.

340
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,577
Guys! It's working!

341
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,043
I'm not dead!

342
00:16:05,295 --> 00:16:07,883
Okay, we're getting out
of this place tonight.

343
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,394
Everyone clear on the plan?

344
00:16:09,395 --> 00:16:11,178
Yep. Meg and I switch faces

345
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,305
- like in the movie<i> Face/Off?</i>
- No.

346
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,016
Oh. Then we have an issue.

347
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,976
I told you we should ask Mom first.

348
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,311
Why would you think that?

349
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,856
Ugh... Just, you two follow my lead.

350
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,529
You know, Vera, I've been
so moved by my time here

351
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,782
at camp, I wonder if I could
perhaps say grace tonight?

352
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,369
Oh, that'd be lovely, Lois.

353
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:40,040
Well, I'd like to begin
with a moment of silence.

354
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:43,596
A fully counted-out,
Mississippi, 60-second

355
00:16:43,597 --> 00:16:45,719
moment of silence.

356
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:54,889
And the first one
to open their eyes is gay.

357
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,896
Psst. Up here.

358
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,315
My eyes are open, too.

359
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:09,694
<i>There was something</i>
<i>in the air that night</i>

360
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:14,574
<i>The stars were bright, Fernando</i>

361
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:18,245
<i>They were shinin' there for you and me</i>

362
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:22,457
<i>For liberty, Fernando</i>

363
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:26,545
<i>Though we never thought</i>
<i>that we could lose</i>

364
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,172
<i>There's no regret.</i>

365
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:34,052
Ugh. Good riddance,
Christian family camp.

366
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,263
Totally. I will say, though,

367
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:38,932
it seemed like Chris
enjoyed himself there.

368
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:41,601
Well, Meg, you know Chris is
a little bit dumb,

369
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,895
and I know you're
not particularly popular

370
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,064
or beautiful, but you do have
a head on your shoulders.

371
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,067
So religion isn't gonna be
for people like you and me.

372
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,445
It's basically for:
stupid people like Chris.

373
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:55,121
So to summarize,
religion for you and me?

374
00:17:55,122 --> 00:17:57,742
No good. But for idiots like Chris?

375
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:01,538
- Perfect.
- What are you guys talking about?

376
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:04,457
- How handsome you are.
- Really?

377
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,043
Swear to God.

378
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,213
You're a monster.

379
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,970
Stupid law. Banning dogs.

380
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:19,223
Kibbles and bits and bits and bits.

381
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,940
You! You son of a bitch!
This is all your fault!

382
00:18:33,952 --> 00:18:35,280
- What the...?
- Ha-ha!

383
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,419
You thirsty, boy?
Yeah, you're a thirsty boy.

384
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,505
Wait a minute, we're fighting!

385
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:54,090
Aah!

386
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,802
And now, time to make <i>my</i> getaway.

387
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,849
Brian, oh, my God! Are you all right?

388
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,686
Here, let me mend you,
like in a 1990s action movie.

389
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,774
Aw, thanks. That<i> is</i> better.

390
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,862
Look at us. What are we doing?

391
00:19:12,863 --> 00:19:15,654
I don't even know anymore.

392
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,072
You know what?

393
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,282
I'm sorry I destroyed
your dream, Quagmire.

394
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,493
I know you loved that café.

395
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,537
Wow. Um... thanks, Brian.

396
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,581
Why<i> did</i> you open that place, anyway?

397
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,959
Well... honestly, I just thought

398
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,672
that maybe I could put something
good in the world for a change.

399
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:34,881
What do you mean?

400
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,257
I mean that... uh...

401
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,802
I've always been about sex
and seducing women,

402
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,387
but you know what?

403
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,971
Someday I'm gonna be dead.

404
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:45,225
And, I-I mean, is that my legacy?

405
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:46,851
I just thought if I created something

406
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,561
that makes people happy,

407
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,898
maybe people would remember me for<i> that.</i>

408
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,109
You probably think that's stupid.

409
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:58,321
Quagmire... I'm here for you.

410
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,657
For emotional support.

411
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:03,493
Thanks, Brian. What do you say?

412
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:04,828
You want to go for a walk?

413
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,956
I<i> always</i> want to go for a walk.

414
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:13,169
Hey, does anyone know what's
going on with my brown crayon?

415
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,713
Because it disappeared
from the box for a while,

416
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,131
and now it's back.

417
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:19,175
It's a little... I don't know,
oily and misshapen?

418
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,010
I'm not a crayon scientist,

419
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,058
but it looks like it's seen some heat.

420
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:32,021
<i>The city repealed a law
prohibiting animals</i>

421
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,732
<i>from public businesses today.</i>

422
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,275
<i>And finally, tonight...</i>

423
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,213
<i>We built this city!</i>

424
00:20:37,214 --> 00:20:39,904
There. Now it's in your head, too.

425
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,780
Well, I'm glad you get to go out
in public again, Brian.

426
00:20:42,781 --> 00:20:45,452
I'm glad you, Chris, and Meg are
back from that Christian camp.

427
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:46,911
Hey, where is Meg, anyway?

428
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,622
Oh, she was so mad I dragged her
to Christian camp,

429
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:52,459
she ran away to live
with a Japanese family.

430
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,422
<i>Damare, Meg!</i>

431
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:03,967
<i>Family Guy</i> over! On-uh Foxuuu!
