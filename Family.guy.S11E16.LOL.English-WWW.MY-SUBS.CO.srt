ANNOUNCER:
We now return to <i>Bottom Chef.</i>

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,935
Daniel L.,
please pack your fudge and go.

14
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:42,520
Fine!

15
00:00:42,554 --> 00:00:44,839
TOM TUCKER: We interrupt this
broadcast with breaking news.

16
00:00:44,873 --> 00:00:47,141
An aide to Mayor
Adam West has been found

17
00:00:47,176 --> 00:00:48,976
stabbed to death
at the mayor's mansion.

18
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:49,961
That's right, Tom.

19
00:00:49,995 --> 00:00:51,245
Police say the
victim was killed

20
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,114
by a knife
belonging to the mayor,

21
00:00:53,148 --> 00:00:55,817
who is considered the
prime suspect at this time.

22
00:00:55,851 --> 00:00:57,018
Oh, my God.

23
00:00:57,052 --> 00:00:58,136
Uncle Adam!

24
00:00:58,187 --> 00:00:59,170
Uhp, town emergency.

25
00:00:59,204 --> 00:01:00,454
Don't got to
finish my green beans.

26
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:02,857
Peter, you stay there and
finish those green beans.

27
00:01:02,891 --> 00:01:06,210
But my stomach's upset
on account of the news.

28
00:01:06,245 --> 00:01:07,945
Also found
in the mayor's residence

29
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,814
was a blackmail note
from the victim

30
00:01:09,848 --> 00:01:11,315
threatening to expose the mayor

31
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,085
in a corruption scandal
unless the victim was paid off.

32
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:15,720
You can put a picture of a note

33
00:01:15,754 --> 00:01:17,989
above my shoulder any time now,
Tony.

34
00:01:18,023 --> 00:01:20,024
No, that's the Rose Bowl Parade.

35
00:01:20,058 --> 00:01:21,893
That's the Pumpkin Festival.

36
00:01:21,927 --> 00:01:24,195
Okay, okay,
you think that humiliates me?

37
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:25,263
You-- I-I don't care.

38
00:01:25,297 --> 00:01:26,497
Oscar De La Hoya does it.

39
00:01:26,532 --> 00:01:28,266
We now go live to
Tricia Takanawa,

40
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,334
who is outside
the mayor's mansion.

41
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:33,304
Tom, I'm standing outside
the mayor's mansion,

42
00:01:33,338 --> 00:01:35,456
where, against the wishes
of his attorneys,

43
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,843
the mayor has agreed to an
impromptu press conference.

44
00:01:38,877 --> 00:01:40,678
(reporters calling out)

45
00:01:40,712 --> 00:01:41,762
What do you
know about the murder?

46
00:01:41,796 --> 00:01:43,197
Did you
kill that man?

47
00:01:43,232 --> 00:01:45,166
Yes, I'll take a question
from the reporter

48
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,052
from the <i>Quahog</i>
<i>Elementary School Gazette.</i>

49
00:01:48,086 --> 00:01:49,053
Timmy?

50
00:01:49,087 --> 00:01:50,788
Are you afraid of the dark?

51
00:01:50,822 --> 00:01:52,590
I thought
we had an understanding

52
00:01:52,624 --> 00:01:54,358
that the dark was off limits.

53
00:01:54,393 --> 00:01:56,744
This press conference is over.

54
00:01:56,778 --> 00:01:59,780
This has been
Tricia Takanawa with the news.

55
00:01:59,814 --> 00:02:02,516
And now I will have
my normal post-news review

56
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:04,485
from my mom in her car.

57
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,686
You no good!

58
00:02:05,721 --> 00:02:07,021
You no good on news!

59
00:02:07,055 --> 00:02:08,956
You stiff, like
watching board!

60
00:02:08,991 --> 00:02:10,725
Joan London
mother, so happy.

61
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,228
Tricia Takanawa
mother, so sad.

62
00:02:14,263 --> 00:02:16,063
Wow, he really did it.

63
00:02:16,098 --> 00:02:17,965
I always knew Mayor West
was a little crazy,

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,568
but I never thought he was
capable of something like this.

65
00:02:20,602 --> 00:02:22,203
The mayor's going to jail.

66
00:02:22,237 --> 00:02:24,121
That means anything goes.

67
00:02:25,207 --> 00:02:28,292
(knocking on door)

68
00:02:28,327 --> 00:02:30,011
I pushed a lady.

69
00:02:30,045 --> 00:02:31,963
God, I can already
hear the jokes

70
00:02:31,997 --> 00:02:34,081
Jay Leno's gonna be
telling about our mayor.

71
00:02:34,116 --> 00:02:35,116
Oh, yeah,
like what?

72
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,234
Oh, you know,

73
00:02:36,285 --> 00:02:37,451
it's like you can
already hear them.

74
00:02:37,486 --> 00:02:38,569
You know?
Like what?

75
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,020
Like exactly
what jokes do you hear?

76
00:02:40,038 --> 00:02:41,405
Tell me one of the jokes.

77
00:02:41,456 --> 00:02:43,574
Brian, all I have to do is
start fake sneezing around you

78
00:02:43,609 --> 00:02:46,093
and you'll spend the rest
of your life outside.

79
00:02:46,128 --> 00:02:48,262
Oh, yeah, yeah, I can
hear some of the jokes.

80
00:02:48,297 --> 00:02:49,747
Well, I guess
you just never know

81
00:02:49,781 --> 00:02:52,166
what kind of rage
some people have bottled up.

82
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,584
Well, we all
got anger, Chris.

83
00:02:53,619 --> 00:02:54,619
The important thing

84
00:02:54,653 --> 00:02:56,420
is finding a healthy way
to channel it.

85
00:02:56,471 --> 00:02:59,140
For me, as you know,
it's the family bath.

86
00:02:59,174 --> 00:03:01,375
Peter, how long
do we have to sit here?

87
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,777
Until I'm
not angry anymore,

88
00:03:02,811 --> 00:03:04,845
you naked
bunch of bitches!

89
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,230
(seagulls squawking)

90
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,668
(indistinct chatter)

91
00:03:16,842 --> 00:03:18,759
JUDGE: Everyone,
please be seated.

92
00:03:18,794 --> 00:03:20,194
We will now hear

93
00:03:20,228 --> 00:03:22,330
the defense attorney's
closing statement.

94
00:03:22,364 --> 00:03:23,731
I switched seats.

95
00:03:23,765 --> 00:03:26,100
In closing, although
it seems pretty clear

96
00:03:26,134 --> 00:03:27,735
that my client
committed this murder,

97
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:29,503
I would consider it
a personal favor to me

98
00:03:29,538 --> 00:03:31,122
if you found
him not guilty.

99
00:03:31,173 --> 00:03:34,425
That's your
closing argument?

100
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:38,279
Whoa, those karate
lessons are really paying off.

101
00:03:38,313 --> 00:03:40,314
Thank you, Sensei.

102
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:41,449
Welcome.

103
00:03:41,483 --> 00:03:42,583
He came.

104
00:03:42,617 --> 00:03:44,168
Jurors, you
have now heard

105
00:03:44,202 --> 00:03:45,636
all the facts
of this case.

106
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:48,172
I remind you that because
we are a small town,

107
00:03:48,206 --> 00:03:49,507
many of you may have ties

108
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,242
with the defendant
or the victim.

109
00:03:51,276 --> 00:03:53,494
You must set aside
these personal connections

110
00:03:53,528 --> 00:03:56,030
and render an impartial
and unanimous verdict.

111
00:03:56,064 --> 00:03:57,665
Does anyone have any questions?

112
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:00,835
Yeah, is Toblerone
the fanciest thing in the world?

113
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:02,103
I-I just don't understand.

114
00:04:02,137 --> 00:04:03,721
How could
Uncle Adam do this?

115
00:04:03,755 --> 00:04:05,356
He's the mayor
of our town.

116
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,591
Well, Meg, life
isn't always as simple

117
00:04:07,626 --> 00:04:09,260
as what they
teach you at school.

118
00:04:09,294 --> 00:04:10,328
I don't know, Mom.

119
00:04:10,362 --> 00:04:12,496
I have a pretty realistic
home ec class.

120
00:04:12,531 --> 00:04:13,931
Okay, kids.

121
00:04:13,965 --> 00:04:17,068
Now I'm gonna take
the casserole out of the oven.

122
00:04:17,102 --> 00:04:18,786
Okay, it's a little burned.

123
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,237
No reason to panic.

124
00:04:20,272 --> 00:04:21,739
(tires screech, car
door opens and closes)

125
00:04:21,773 --> 00:04:22,740
Oh, God, that's Daddy.

126
00:04:22,774 --> 00:04:24,091
He's home early.

127
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,893
Let-Let's get some spices
in here and fix this.

128
00:04:25,927 --> 00:04:26,894
(door opens
and closes)

129
00:04:26,928 --> 00:04:28,128
Okay, he's inside the house.

130
00:04:28,146 --> 00:04:29,480
Let's-let's hope his meeting
went well.

131
00:04:29,514 --> 00:04:31,315
MAN: God, that meeting
went awful!

132
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,350
Oh, boy.

133
00:04:32,384 --> 00:04:33,417
What's that smell?

134
00:04:33,452 --> 00:04:34,852
Did you burn dinner,
you stupid pig?

135
00:04:34,886 --> 00:04:36,136
Okay, kids, put your heads down.

136
00:04:36,154 --> 00:04:37,154
Put your heads down.

137
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:38,456
And don't try to stand between

138
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,257
me and your father;
it'll just make it worse.

139
00:04:46,314 --> 00:04:49,150
So I's been asked by the judge
to be the foreman,

140
00:04:49,184 --> 00:04:51,218
and I want y'all to know
that we's gonna run

141
00:04:51,253 --> 00:04:55,156
a fair jury and a clean jury,
so I brought some wet naps

142
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,391
for everyone to wipe off
their areas.

143
00:04:57,426 --> 00:05:00,561
'Cause one of us gets sick,
we's all gonna get sick.

144
00:05:00,595 --> 00:05:01,996
And that may lead to some of us

145
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,564
getting sicker than others.

146
00:05:03,598 --> 00:05:04,999
Look, can we
get this underway?

147
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:06,467
I mean, we were
all in that courtroom.

148
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:07,701
What-what is
there to discuss?

149
00:05:07,736 --> 00:05:08,736
It's obvious
he did it.

150
00:05:08,804 --> 00:05:11,322
(overlapping chatter)

151
00:05:11,373 --> 00:05:12,893
Plus, I got to get
back to the station.

152
00:05:12,908 --> 00:05:14,175
If I'm not there by 5:00,

153
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:15,543
Joyce will anchor the news,
and I don't think

154
00:05:15,577 --> 00:05:17,445
anyone wants
that to happen again.

155
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:20,114
Our top story:
Guys, right?

156
00:05:20,148 --> 00:05:21,482
Yes, it's open and shut.

157
00:05:21,516 --> 00:05:23,551
Now let's just vote him guilty
and get out of here.

158
00:05:23,585 --> 00:05:24,946
Look, I know
everyone's in a hurry,

159
00:05:24,953 --> 00:05:26,821
but shouldn't we at least
go over the evidence

160
00:05:26,855 --> 00:05:28,856
once before we vote,
just to be fair?

161
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,025
You know what would shed
some light on th case?

162
00:05:31,059 --> 00:05:33,177
If we huck water balloons
at people in the street.

163
00:05:35,847 --> 00:05:37,581
They were carrying a trampoline.

164
00:05:37,616 --> 00:05:38,649
Here's the facts:

165
00:05:38,683 --> 00:05:40,251
there was a note
from the victim,

166
00:05:40,285 --> 00:05:43,254
threatening to expose the mayor
in a corruption scandal.

167
00:05:43,288 --> 00:05:45,906
The murder weapon
was the mayor's own knife.

168
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:49,376
And finally, that lady with
the Peter Gallagher eyebrows

169
00:05:49,411 --> 00:05:52,146
on the witness stand
saw the whole thing.

170
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,460
Okay, let's get
down to business.

171
00:05:53,482 --> 00:05:55,716
All in favor of "guilty,"
raise your hands.

172
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,984
(together):
Guilty.

173
00:05:57,018 --> 00:05:58,352
All "guilty."

174
00:05:58,386 --> 00:05:59,553
Good, well, that's it,
let's get out of here.

175
00:05:59,588 --> 00:06:01,188
Anyone for "not guilty"?

176
00:06:06,027 --> 00:06:08,579
(angry, incredulous remarks)

177
00:06:08,613 --> 00:06:09,997
What the hell?

178
00:06:10,031 --> 00:06:12,566
All right, looks like
we's gonna be here a while.

179
00:06:12,601 --> 00:06:14,068
Who wants pizza for dinner?

180
00:06:15,387 --> 00:06:18,522
And who wants
Purina Moist and Meaty Dog Chow?

181
00:06:20,058 --> 00:06:22,927
(angry, incredulous remarks)

182
00:06:22,961 --> 00:06:24,295
I had that
for breakfast!

183
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:32,263
What do you mean "not guilty"?!

184
00:06:32,274 --> 00:06:33,241
What's wrong with you?

185
00:06:33,275 --> 00:06:35,343
Oh, shoot,
that was a stomachache.

186
00:06:35,377 --> 00:06:36,811
I told that guy he had polio.

187
00:06:36,845 --> 00:06:39,046
Look, the system specifies
the defendant

188
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:41,749
must be proven guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt.

189
00:06:41,783 --> 00:06:43,818
Mayor West's life
is on the line here.

190
00:06:43,852 --> 00:06:45,987
I'm just saying,
it's possible he didn't do it.

191
00:06:46,021 --> 00:06:47,604
(angry, incredulous remarks)

192
00:06:47,623 --> 00:06:49,240
That's for the jury
to decide.

193
00:06:49,274 --> 00:06:50,825
Mayor West is crazy.

194
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:53,077
He should've been locked up
a long time ago.

195
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:54,912
Yeah, there's definitely
something off about him.

196
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,013
I'm his physician.

197
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:58,816
Okay, now we'll just
test those reflexes.

198
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,184
MAN (muffled):
Hey, did you hear that?

199
00:07:00,218 --> 00:07:01,218
MAN 2:
There's someone out there.

200
00:07:01,253 --> 00:07:02,320
Hello?

201
00:07:02,354 --> 00:07:03,654
WOMAN (muffled):
We're in here!

202
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,089
MAN 3:
There are six of us!

203
00:07:05,157 --> 00:07:07,141
Look, we all saw
that blackmail note.

204
00:07:07,175 --> 00:07:08,943
Mayor West is
the only one with a motive.

205
00:07:08,977 --> 00:07:10,378
I don't even know
why we're discussing it.

206
00:07:10,412 --> 00:07:12,997
Well, was Mayor West
the only one with a motive?

207
00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:14,765
I mean, there are
people who would benefit

208
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,200
if he were
put away for murder.

209
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:18,085
Political rivals,
special interests.

210
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,071
I mean, it's possible
he could have been framed.

211
00:07:20,105 --> 00:07:23,074
(angry, incredulous remarks)

212
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:24,725
Enough!

213
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,827
Was a movie with Jennifer Lopez

214
00:07:26,862 --> 00:07:28,896
that did not
live up to expectations.

215
00:07:28,898 --> 00:07:31,899
Well, Mayor West did say
he never saw the letter.

216
00:07:31,933 --> 00:07:33,200
And he was under oath.

217
00:07:33,235 --> 00:07:34,235
Yeah, he lied.

218
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:35,886
Of course he lied;
he's a politician.

219
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:37,288
They're all liars.
Yeah!

220
00:07:37,322 --> 00:07:39,774
John F. Kennedy swore he'd serve
a full four-year term.

221
00:07:39,808 --> 00:07:41,208
Liar.

222
00:07:41,243 --> 00:07:44,011
Look, we should be sticking
to the facts, not stereotypes.

223
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,964
It's unfair to say
that all politicians are liars,

224
00:07:46,998 --> 00:07:48,632
therefore Mayor West is guilty.

225
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:49,984
Brian's right.

226
00:07:50,018 --> 00:07:53,120
I was a county alderman once
and I never told no fibs.

227
00:07:53,155 --> 00:07:55,022
I bent over
backwards and forwards

228
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,324
for them constituents.

229
00:07:56,358 --> 00:07:58,559
It's important
to make sure everyone is happy,

230
00:07:58,593 --> 00:08:00,328
so I took a lot of polls.

231
00:08:00,362 --> 00:08:01,662
(muttering):
Gay stuff.

232
00:08:01,697 --> 00:08:04,498
Yeah, and I served honorably
as a U.N. interpreter.

233
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:06,934
(speaking foreign language)

234
00:08:06,968 --> 00:08:08,803
Okay, he's mad about something.

235
00:08:08,837 --> 00:08:10,971
He appears to be
talking really fast.

236
00:08:11,006 --> 00:08:13,741
He spits whenever
he makes the "ch" noise,

237
00:08:13,775 --> 00:08:16,310
which, in this language,
happens a lot.

238
00:08:16,345 --> 00:08:18,446
I'm expected to entertain him
and his wife tonight,

239
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,815
so if anyone knows a good
restaurant in the area...

240
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:22,983
Sushi or tapas,
something where they're always

241
00:08:23,018 --> 00:08:24,135
bringing stuff to the table

242
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:25,436
so you have something
to talk about.

243
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,637
You know?

244
00:08:26,671 --> 00:08:28,239
"Hey, what's this?
This looks good..."

245
00:08:28,273 --> 00:08:29,507
War, oh, war, war!

246
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,459
That last sentence
was about war!

247
00:08:31,493 --> 00:08:33,210
Look, an expert
confirmed

248
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:35,212
that the blackmail note
was signed by the victim.

249
00:08:35,247 --> 00:08:37,314
That points
irrefutably to West.

250
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:39,483
Well, maybe we should
take a look at that letter.

251
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:40,818
Yeah, I'd like to see that.

252
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:43,287
'Cause I can read it
just like everybody else.

253
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:45,556
<i>And the charade continues.</i>

254
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,942
Bailiff, please.

255
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:49,059
Yeah?

256
00:08:49,077 --> 00:08:50,995
Mr. Bailiff, we
request that you

257
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:52,630
bring us the note
from the victim.

258
00:08:52,664 --> 00:08:54,682
Joe, what the hell
are you doing out there?

259
00:08:54,716 --> 00:08:56,283
You're a cop, not a bailiff.

260
00:08:56,318 --> 00:08:57,518
Eh, I'm undercover.

261
00:08:57,552 --> 00:08:59,353
Someone's been raping
all the bailiffs.

262
00:08:59,388 --> 00:09:01,689
So you're just sitting around
waiting to be raped?

263
00:09:01,723 --> 00:09:03,391
MAN (gruffly): Hey, Bailiff,
can I talk to you

264
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:05,226
for a second in
this broom closet?

265
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,494
Sure, strange man.

266
00:09:06,528 --> 00:09:10,231
I can't wait to hear
what this is all about.

267
00:09:15,587 --> 00:09:16,971
Well, there's your motive.

268
00:09:17,022 --> 00:09:19,039
A note from the victim
threatening Mayor West.

269
00:09:19,074 --> 00:09:20,408
What more proof
do you want?

270
00:09:20,442 --> 00:09:22,376
Yeah, are you trying to
suggest that Mayor West's

271
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:23,878
enemy faked
a corruption letter

272
00:09:23,912 --> 00:09:24,979
and then
killed himself?

273
00:09:25,013 --> 00:09:26,013
That's idiotic!

274
00:09:28,934 --> 00:09:31,836
But it just might work.

275
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:32,937
What?

276
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:40,845
You know, something bothered me

277
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,513
about the stationery
that note was on,

278
00:09:42,547 --> 00:09:44,148
with the-the decorative
"M" border.

279
00:09:44,182 --> 00:09:45,182
It's from the
office of the mayor.

280
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:46,217
The "M" is for "mayor."

281
00:09:46,251 --> 00:09:47,785
What are you
getting at?

282
00:09:47,819 --> 00:09:49,620
No, no, I'm pretty sure
the "M" is for "Marriott."

283
00:09:49,654 --> 00:09:51,589
How do you know?
Because I once got a note

284
00:09:51,623 --> 00:09:55,726
from the Marriott
written on the same paper.

285
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,094
(gasping)

286
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,462
"Dear Brian.

287
00:09:58,497 --> 00:09:59,947
"You were amazing last night.

288
00:09:59,981 --> 00:10:01,115
Love, Ida."

289
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:02,349
(laughing):
This is from the night

290
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,368
you had sex with Quagmire's dad.

291
00:10:04,402 --> 00:10:05,619
Ah, come on!

292
00:10:05,654 --> 00:10:08,055
I did a dog once,
but I was in the Philippines,

293
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:09,590
and I sure as hell
didn't write him a letter.

294
00:10:09,624 --> 00:10:11,459
What's-- w-w-what, so
what does that prove?

295
00:10:11,526 --> 00:10:12,593
The victim had access

296
00:10:12,627 --> 00:10:13,928
to all the "Office of the Mayor"

297
00:10:13,962 --> 00:10:15,229
stationery he could ever want,

298
00:10:15,263 --> 00:10:17,164
yet he hand-made a letterhead

299
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,166
on stationery from a Marriott?

300
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,001
As far as I'm concerned,
that casts doubt.

301
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:23,654
(angry, incredulous remarks)

302
00:10:23,688 --> 00:10:25,072
Look, you guys
just say the word

303
00:10:25,106 --> 00:10:27,091
and I'll put this ball with
cheese in it on the floor.

304
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,109
We won't hear from him
for an hour and a half.

305
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:34,715
Look, if I'm still the only
one who says "not guilty,"

306
00:10:34,749 --> 00:10:36,650
I won't hold
things up any longer.

307
00:10:36,685 --> 00:10:38,469
Let's vote again,
and I'll abstain.

308
00:10:38,503 --> 00:10:39,703
If it's unanimous,

309
00:10:39,738 --> 00:10:41,655
I'll change my vote
and we can all go home.

310
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:44,825
Okay, everyone take one of these
here and write their vote.

311
00:10:47,212 --> 00:10:50,548
Hey, Quagmire, y-you gonna
write something funny?

312
00:10:50,582 --> 00:10:51,916
No, Peter, I'm not.

313
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,151
I'm starting to think
all you do is dick around.

314
00:10:54,185 --> 00:10:56,086
Sorry.

315
00:10:57,272 --> 00:10:59,023
Everyone vote?

316
00:10:59,057 --> 00:11:00,824
Okay, now let's count.

317
00:11:00,859 --> 00:11:03,711
"Guilty," "guilty."

318
00:11:03,745 --> 00:11:06,580
Some hurtful slurs followed
by the word "guilty."

319
00:11:06,615 --> 00:11:07,581
(laughs)

320
00:11:07,616 --> 00:11:09,984
"Guilty," "guilty."

321
00:11:10,018 --> 00:11:11,619
"El guilto."

322
00:11:11,653 --> 00:11:13,821
"Guilty," "guilty."

323
00:11:13,855 --> 00:11:16,106
This one's just a squiggly line.

324
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:19,343
That's, uh,
that's "guilty" in Latin.

325
00:11:19,377 --> 00:11:21,946
<i>You're playing</i>
<i>a dangerous game, Carl.</i>

326
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,280
"Guilty."

327
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,182
"Not guilty."

328
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:27,218
(indistinct arguing)

329
00:11:29,104 --> 00:11:30,321
ALL:
Ew!

330
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:32,223
I farted during the murmuring.

331
00:11:32,257 --> 00:11:34,358
What monumental douche
voted "not guilty"

332
00:11:34,392 --> 00:11:35,726
on this no-brainer?

333
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,212
I think we know who
the flip-flopper is.

334
00:11:38,246 --> 00:11:40,381
Bruce didn't change his vote.

335
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,049
I did.

336
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,450
(all gasp)

337
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:45,553
I respect Brian's courage.

338
00:11:45,587 --> 00:11:47,555
It's not easy to stand alone.

339
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:50,124
Or find the child
who stands alone.

340
00:11:50,158 --> 00:11:52,860
But that's the one you want.

341
00:11:52,894 --> 00:11:55,663
Look, we have been cooped up
in this room for five hours now.

342
00:11:55,697 --> 00:11:58,315
I'm starting to feel
like an animal in a cage.

343
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,718
Yeah, or a T. rex
trying to masturbate.

344
00:12:00,752 --> 00:12:03,304
All right,
Internet porn-- check.

345
00:12:03,338 --> 00:12:05,089
Tissues-- check.

346
00:12:05,123 --> 00:12:06,790
Lotion-- check.

347
00:12:06,825 --> 00:12:08,809
Okay, let's go.

348
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,246
Aw.

349
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,281
(roaring)

350
00:12:18,086 --> 00:12:20,654
And that's why they were
such vicious killers.

351
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:24,124
♪ Oh, he couldn't masturbate
because his arms are too short ♪

352
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:26,043
♪ They feared him
from Kilpatrick ♪

353
00:12:26,077 --> 00:12:27,778
♪ Down to Galway Bay Port

354
00:12:27,812 --> 00:12:31,115
♪ Luckily he found a wife
so he could have sex ♪

355
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:32,750
♪ The non-masturbatin'

356
00:12:32,784 --> 00:12:35,352
♪ Tyrannosaurus rex.

357
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,688
Okay, look, tempers are starting
to get a little heated,

358
00:12:37,722 --> 00:12:40,457
so why don't we all go take us
a little potty break?

359
00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:42,242
Now you're all gonna have
to witness me taking

360
00:12:42,277 --> 00:12:45,346
an old-man pill that looks
way too big to swallow.

361
00:12:46,231 --> 00:12:48,215
(gagging)

362
00:12:54,122 --> 00:12:56,290
Oh, there we go.

363
00:12:59,577 --> 00:13:01,178
It's his fault
we're still here.

364
00:13:01,212 --> 00:13:03,280
How is it you think
you know everything anyway?

365
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,783
You don't even understand
your feelings for the mailman.

366
00:13:05,817 --> 00:13:08,168
(barking)

367
00:13:08,203 --> 00:13:09,520
You (bleep) get out of here!

368
00:13:09,554 --> 00:13:10,688
I'll kill you!

369
00:13:10,722 --> 00:13:12,056
But come back
tomorrow same time.

370
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,892
I get very sad on Sundays
when you're not here.

371
00:13:14,926 --> 00:13:16,193
PETER:
Aw, damn it.

372
00:13:16,227 --> 00:13:17,227
MORT:
What happened?

373
00:13:17,262 --> 00:13:19,380
I dropped my phone
in the toilet.

374
00:13:19,414 --> 00:13:20,681
(water splashing)
(Peter groans)

375
00:13:20,715 --> 00:13:23,617
Oh, it's so cold and
it's under everything.

376
00:13:23,652 --> 00:13:26,654
(groans) I feel like I'm rooting
around a pitcher of sangria.

377
00:13:26,688 --> 00:13:28,756
(groans) Where is it?

378
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:31,191
Oh, my God, why haven't
I found it yet?

379
00:13:31,226 --> 00:13:33,894
Oh, no, I didn't roll
my sleeve up far enough.

380
00:13:33,928 --> 00:13:37,064
Oh, why didn't I flush
when I got in here?

381
00:13:37,098 --> 00:13:39,500
Aw, this isn't even all mine!

382
00:13:39,534 --> 00:13:42,069
Oh, no, there's a spider
crawling on my face.

383
00:13:42,103 --> 00:13:45,506
(smack) Aah, why didn't I use the
hand that was on the floor?!

384
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,608
Why did I use
my toilet hand?!

385
00:13:47,642 --> 00:13:50,010
Oh, wait, here it is
behind the toilet.

386
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,867
This is ridiculous.

387
00:13:56,901 --> 00:13:58,702
Even if you don't believe
the note was legitimate,

388
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:01,255
there was an eyewitness
who saw the entire thing.

389
00:14:01,289 --> 00:14:03,290
Well, I have questions
about her testimony.

390
00:14:03,324 --> 00:14:04,958
She said she was at a party.

391
00:14:04,993 --> 00:14:06,994
Not just any party--
a sex party.

392
00:14:07,028 --> 00:14:09,446
Now, how could a woman
at an orgy witness a murder?

393
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:11,682
The bedroom was a hundred feet
from the window.

394
00:14:11,716 --> 00:14:13,901
Okay, first of all,
the term "orgy" is outdated.

395
00:14:13,935 --> 00:14:16,120
We call them
"genital jamborees."

396
00:14:16,154 --> 00:14:17,788
But still, I don't see
how she could look out

397
00:14:17,822 --> 00:14:19,390
a window and witness a crime.

398
00:14:19,424 --> 00:14:21,575
Trust me, you're banging
eight strangers who responded

399
00:14:21,609 --> 00:14:23,944
to a flyer, at some point
you're gonna look out a window

400
00:14:23,978 --> 00:14:26,046
and question every decision
you've ever made.

401
00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:27,064
Look, I'll demonstrate.

402
00:14:27,098 --> 00:14:28,549
You people come here.

403
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:31,051
Okay, Tom, you're over
here on all fours.

404
00:14:31,086 --> 00:14:32,820
Carter, I need
your face right here.

405
00:14:32,854 --> 00:14:34,104
Nope, even closer.

406
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,039
You're gonna want to feel
the heat coming off him.

407
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:38,659
Okay, Consuela, I'm gonna
need you on your knees.

408
00:14:38,693 --> 00:14:40,254
And we're probably
partway into it here,

409
00:14:40,261 --> 00:14:42,329
so one of your eyes
is stuck shut.

410
00:14:42,363 --> 00:14:45,365
All the way shut-- there
are 11 of us, dear.

411
00:14:46,935 --> 00:14:49,269
All right, Tom,
you're squinting.

412
00:14:49,304 --> 00:14:50,571
You're anticipating--
don't-don't do that.

413
00:14:50,605 --> 00:14:52,473
Carl, you can take your fist
out of your own mouth.

414
00:14:52,507 --> 00:14:53,507
Bruce, great work.

415
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,442
Bruce seems like
the only gamer here.

416
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,911
Thanks, it's okay
to look the other way

417
00:14:57,946 --> 00:15:00,414
when y'all pass me on the
street with y'all's wives.

418
00:15:00,448 --> 00:15:01,682
I understand.

419
00:15:01,716 --> 00:15:03,600
And that places
the witness right here,

420
00:15:03,618 --> 00:15:04,858
next to the lubricating station

421
00:15:04,869 --> 00:15:06,353
and the terrible
smelling guest book.

422
00:15:06,387 --> 00:15:07,421
Would she be face up?

423
00:15:07,455 --> 00:15:09,173
No, she had small breasts
but a great ass.

424
00:15:09,207 --> 00:15:10,741
She's definitely face down.

425
00:15:10,775 --> 00:15:13,110
But then, how could
she see the window?

426
00:15:13,144 --> 00:15:15,479
Oh, my God.

427
00:15:15,513 --> 00:15:16,780
You're right.

428
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,182
She couldn't have.

429
00:15:21,786 --> 00:15:23,887
And now to take
my position.

430
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:25,906
This is what I call
the Butter Pat.

431
00:15:36,891 --> 00:15:39,392
Okay, y'all, so we's
now at six "guilty,"

432
00:15:39,427 --> 00:15:40,927
six "not guilty."

433
00:15:40,961 --> 00:15:42,695
So we's all gonna
have to stay here

434
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,864
until we's unanimous
in our verdict.

435
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:46,699
Well, so what if that woman
at the orgy couldn't see?

436
00:15:46,734 --> 00:15:49,202
There's plenty of other evidence
that West is guilty.

437
00:15:49,236 --> 00:15:51,104
Yeah, let's wrap this up--
I got the director's cut

438
00:15:51,138 --> 00:15:53,706
of <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>
waiting for me at home.

439
00:15:56,243 --> 00:15:58,194
Don't look, Marion.
Okay.

440
00:15:58,245 --> 00:16:00,163
By the way, I'm pregnant.

441
00:16:00,197 --> 00:16:02,315
Maybe just one quick peak.

442
00:16:02,349 --> 00:16:04,217
Come on, people,
he obviously did it.

443
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:05,985
You know his type--
they're all guilty.

444
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,487
Well, what type is that?

445
00:16:07,521 --> 00:16:08,988
He's one of those plain-lippies.

446
00:16:09,023 --> 00:16:11,191
You know, no mustache
like a normal person.

447
00:16:11,225 --> 00:16:13,026
Prancing around
with his naked lip out

448
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,294
for all the world to see.

449
00:16:14,328 --> 00:16:17,330
Sir, you are talking
to a plain-lippy.

450
00:16:17,364 --> 00:16:18,644
Oh, now,
don't take it like that.

451
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,133
Some of them are all right.

452
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:22,452
But you know what I mean--
they're all over the place.

453
00:16:22,486 --> 00:16:24,471
How about me, Tucker--
am I all right?

454
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:26,139
Well, of course
you're all right.

455
00:16:27,575 --> 00:16:28,808
(all gasp)

456
00:16:28,843 --> 00:16:31,478
Huh, imagine that.

457
00:16:31,512 --> 00:16:32,712
(sighs)

458
00:16:32,746 --> 00:16:34,247
What happened to me?

459
00:16:34,281 --> 00:16:37,167
I've become my father.

460
00:16:37,218 --> 00:16:39,669
Not guilty.

461
00:16:39,703 --> 00:16:42,522
That really hurt because
it was a real mustache.

462
00:16:42,556 --> 00:16:44,457
Okay, the majority
of this room now believes

463
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:47,193
that there is reasonable doubt
about Mayor West's guilt.

464
00:16:47,228 --> 00:16:48,549
And what do
the rest of you think?

465
00:16:48,562 --> 00:16:50,680
Look, I just don't think
he could've done it.

466
00:16:50,714 --> 00:16:51,881
Guilty.

467
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:52,999
(whispers indistinctly)

468
00:16:53,033 --> 00:16:54,701
Oh, oh, guilty is
the other one?

469
00:16:54,735 --> 00:16:56,870
Well, I don't know!

470
00:16:56,904 --> 00:16:58,638
Okay, it's good
we're talking this out.

471
00:16:58,672 --> 00:17:00,473
Now I'd really like to hear
from the holdouts

472
00:17:00,508 --> 00:17:02,509
because a man's life hangs
in the bal...

473
00:17:02,543 --> 00:17:03,710
Peter, what are you doing?

474
00:17:03,744 --> 00:17:05,378
It's getting very tense in here.

475
00:17:05,412 --> 00:17:07,914
Do you guys mind if I struggle
to open these blinds?

476
00:17:23,247 --> 00:17:25,498
Damn it, come on, stay up there.

477
00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:27,183
QUAGMIRE: You got to yank it
to the side, Peter.

478
00:17:27,218 --> 00:17:28,451
I'm yanking it
as far as it goes.

479
00:17:28,485 --> 00:17:29,953
CARL: You got to catch
it on the thing.

480
00:17:30,004 --> 00:17:31,538
Oh, that's helpful.

481
00:17:31,572 --> 00:17:33,606
HARTMAN: The left side's getting
lower than the right side.

482
00:17:33,641 --> 00:17:34,774
I can see what's happening.

483
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:35,775
QUAGMIRE:
Now twist it.

484
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:37,577
All right.

485
00:17:37,611 --> 00:17:38,978
See? Now it's open.

486
00:17:41,849 --> 00:17:43,850
Okay, we's
at 11 to one.

487
00:17:43,884 --> 00:17:47,020
Carter, you're the only person
who still thinks he's guilty.

488
00:17:47,054 --> 00:17:49,222
You're damn right I do--
look at the facts.

489
00:17:49,256 --> 00:17:51,591
There was a dead guy found
in Mayor West's home.

490
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,359
There's no one else
with any motive.

491
00:17:53,394 --> 00:17:55,428
And the police detective who
examined all the evidence

492
00:17:55,462 --> 00:17:57,096
named him the prime suspect.

493
00:17:57,131 --> 00:17:59,432
(scoffs) You guys paid
attention that whole trial?

494
00:17:59,466 --> 00:18:00,934
Lame-- not me.

495
00:18:00,968 --> 00:18:02,702
I was too busy
being cool.

496
00:18:02,736 --> 00:18:04,737
The jury is instructed
to disregard

497
00:18:04,772 --> 00:18:06,472
the witness' last remark.

498
00:18:06,507 --> 00:18:08,308
Yeah, whatever, Judge.

499
00:18:08,342 --> 00:18:10,710
None of this stuff's ever
gonna apply to my real life.

500
00:18:10,744 --> 00:18:13,396
I'm just gonna go work in
the mines anyway like my dad.

501
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,882
How would you like to stay
for an hour after the trial?

502
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,800
Oh, I'm real scared.

503
00:18:17,835 --> 00:18:20,003
Is your dad
hitting you, Peter?

504
00:18:20,037 --> 00:18:21,487
Shut up, just shut up!

505
00:18:21,522 --> 00:18:23,022
You have no right, man!

506
00:18:23,057 --> 00:18:25,358
You don't know nothing
about my side of town!

507
00:18:25,392 --> 00:18:27,160
Look, he's guilty,
I just know it.

508
00:18:27,194 --> 00:18:29,846
He's a double-dealing
spineless politician.

509
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,197
But how do you know
he's guilty?

510
00:18:31,231 --> 00:18:32,181
Oh, I know.

511
00:18:32,216 --> 00:18:34,317
Mayor West has
let people down.

512
00:18:34,351 --> 00:18:36,886
Guys, I feel like all
we talk about is Mayor West.

513
00:18:36,921 --> 00:18:38,371
Like who, who has he let down?

514
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:40,006
Someone who got him elected.

515
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,658
Someone who padded
his expense account.

516
00:18:41,692 --> 00:18:43,626
And all I wanted was
to fire a missile

517
00:18:43,661 --> 00:18:46,212
into a fault line to sink half
of Quahog into the ocean

518
00:18:46,246 --> 00:18:48,264
and make
my real estate waterfront.

519
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:49,949
You got that from <i>Superman.</i>

520
00:18:49,984 --> 00:18:51,017
Nobody likes you.

521
00:18:51,051 --> 00:18:52,018
I even let him marry

522
00:18:52,052 --> 00:18:53,486
my daughter
Carol, damn it.

523
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,021
I mean, doesn't that
mean anything?

524
00:18:55,055 --> 00:18:57,857
No, not to West, that
ungrateful bastard.

525
00:18:57,891 --> 00:18:59,859
It wasn't that aide that
got stabbed in the back,

526
00:18:59,893 --> 00:19:01,928
it was me!

527
00:19:01,962 --> 00:19:03,963
(crying)

528
00:19:05,482 --> 00:19:07,500
Not guilty.

529
00:19:08,535 --> 00:19:11,037
Well, I guess that's it.

530
00:19:11,071 --> 00:19:13,539
Yeah, looks like
we've reached our verdict.

531
00:19:13,574 --> 00:19:14,807
You know what
I just realized?

532
00:19:14,842 --> 00:19:16,876
My jury duty's tomorrow.

533
00:19:19,847 --> 00:19:22,031
Ladies and gentlemen of Quahog,

534
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:23,599
I feel vindicated.

535
00:19:23,634 --> 00:19:26,102
Today the truth has prevailed.

536
00:19:26,136 --> 00:19:28,805
And we've witnessed
the power of the greatest

537
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:31,007
justice system in all the world.

538
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,892
(reporters clamoring)

539
00:19:32,926 --> 00:19:34,377
Yes, Miss Takanawa.

540
00:19:34,411 --> 00:19:35,845
Now that you've been acquitted,

541
00:19:35,879 --> 00:19:39,282
what does the future hold
for Mayor Adam West?

542
00:19:39,316 --> 00:19:41,784
Oh, I don't know.

543
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:45,872
♪ Into the great wide open

544
00:19:47,391 --> 00:19:51,961
♪ Under them skies of blue

545
00:19:53,163 --> 00:19:57,417
♪ Out in the great wide open

546
00:19:59,153 --> 00:20:02,388
♪ A rebel without a clue.

547
00:20:04,174 --> 00:20:07,377
I'll probably just remain mayor
of this great city.

548
00:20:07,411 --> 00:20:10,680
This also is part
of my fantasy sequence.

549
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:16,853
I'll probably just remain
mayor of this great city.

550
00:20:16,887 --> 00:20:20,723
And I know this is real because
you're not rabbit-people.

551
00:20:24,328 --> 00:20:25,862
Ah, what a day.

552
00:20:25,896 --> 00:20:29,232
You both did your civic duty
and you saved Mayor West.

553
00:20:29,266 --> 00:20:30,950
Yeah, I mean, it was
a pretty intense experience,

554
00:20:30,984 --> 00:20:32,902
but the important thing is,
in the end,

555
00:20:32,936 --> 00:20:34,170
justice was served.

556
00:20:34,204 --> 00:20:35,988
All you did was
let a guy go.

557
00:20:36,023 --> 00:20:37,690
There's still
a murderer out there.

558
00:20:37,725 --> 00:20:40,093
Yeah, but we saved
an innocent man today.

559
00:20:40,127 --> 00:20:41,461
And that's something
to feel good about.

560
00:20:41,495 --> 00:20:42,762
"Feel good about"?

561
00:20:42,796 --> 00:20:44,642
They found eight more
bodies last night.

562
00:20:44,997 --> 00:20:46,515
One of them was
on this block.

563
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:49,160
There's a maniac out there.
He's cutting people's power off,

564
00:20:49,256 --> 00:20:51,380
breaking into their homes,
and slitting their throats.

565
00:20:53,323 --> 00:20:55,291
And we're dead.

566
00:20:55,325 --> 00:21:00,325
