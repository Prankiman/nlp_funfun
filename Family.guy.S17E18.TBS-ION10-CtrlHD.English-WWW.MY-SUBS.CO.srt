<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

2
00:00:04,915 --> 00:00:08,152
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

3
00:00:08,153 --> 00:00:11,755
<i>But where are those
good old-fashioned values</i>

4
00:00:11,756 --> 00:00:14,658
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

5
00:00:14,659 --> 00:00:18,027
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

6
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:21,665
<i>Lucky there's a man who
positively can do</i>

00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:23,218
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:24,825
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

11
00:00:38,816 --> 00:00:41,385
Ugh. I can't believe
you dragged me to The Flow.

12
00:00:41,386 --> 00:00:43,387
- This is gonna suck.
- Oh, knock it off.

13
00:00:43,388 --> 00:00:45,117
It's not gonna be that bad.

14
00:00:45,118 --> 00:00:46,656
Besides, I couldn't leave you at home.

15
00:00:46,657 --> 00:00:48,958
Last time I did that,
the kids walked in on you

16
00:00:48,959 --> 00:00:50,861
looking at Internet corn.

17
00:00:55,633 --> 00:00:58,469
Oh, God, what I wouldn't do to that.

18
00:00:59,537 --> 00:01:01,538
What? N-No! No, it's not even mine!

19
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:02,872
I just clicked on it!

20
00:01:02,873 --> 00:01:06,410
And c-come on,
it's not like it's gay corn.

21
00:01:06,411 --> 00:01:07,877
It's gay corn.

22
00:01:07,878 --> 00:01:10,747
It was baby corn.

23
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:15,752
Hi, ladies, and welcome to The Flow!

24
00:01:18,556 --> 00:01:20,690
We'll be starting the taping
in just a few minutes,

25
00:01:20,691 --> 00:01:22,559
but I wanted to come out here personally

26
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,361
and say hi to my fans.

27
00:01:24,362 --> 00:01:27,697
Let's get everyone up, up, up
and dancing like maniacs.

28
00:01:54,692 --> 00:01:55,925
First down.

29
00:01:58,796 --> 00:02:00,697
Let's welcome our first guest,

30
00:02:00,698 --> 00:02:03,600
my colleague at Channel 5
and now a best-selling author,

31
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:05,402
Tricia Takanawa.

32
00:02:06,737 --> 00:02:09,439
So, Tricia, tell us about your book.

33
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,575
I understand it's been
number one on Amazon

34
00:02:11,576 --> 00:02:13,109
for many weeks, long time.

35
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,412
It's called Throw It Away:

36
00:02:15,413 --> 00:02:18,582
The Life-Improving Art of De-cluttering.

37
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,917
People nowadays own too much stuff.

38
00:02:20,918 --> 00:02:23,920
I am encouraging them to throw it away.

39
00:02:23,921 --> 00:02:26,456
Genius! So just throw everything out?

40
00:02:26,457 --> 00:02:27,657
Not quite.

41
00:02:27,658 --> 00:02:29,893
If it kindles joy, you keep it.

42
00:02:29,894 --> 00:02:32,996
But if no joy, you throw it away.

43
00:02:32,997 --> 00:02:35,499
Can I look at your phone?

44
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,133
No. Use your activity book.

45
00:02:37,134 --> 00:02:40,136
I already did
all the fun ones at church.

46
00:02:40,137 --> 00:02:41,638
It's very simple.

47
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:44,841
I came up with it after hiking
to the top of Mount Asia

48
00:02:44,842 --> 00:02:47,344
and meditating on Epiphany Bridge.

49
00:02:47,345 --> 00:02:49,313
Ah! Peter, these are Asian techniques,

50
00:02:49,314 --> 00:02:50,647
and they're new to me.

51
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:52,816
I have to buy this book,
read two chapters,

52
00:02:52,817 --> 00:02:55,251
then leave it on my nightstand
for a year.

53
00:02:55,252 --> 00:02:57,253
That fart was the lady next to me.

54
00:02:57,254 --> 00:02:59,255
Whatever. I'm getting that book, Peter.

55
00:02:59,256 --> 00:03:01,190
And it's for reading,
not for killing spiders.

56
00:03:01,191 --> 00:03:02,459
Oh, don't worry, Lois.

57
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,661
I got a better method
for doing that now.

58
00:03:04,662 --> 00:03:07,664
I'm really excited
you're humanely relocating me

59
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:09,599
to outside your house.

60
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,436
Oh, yeah. Me and the fellas
thought it was time.

61
00:03:12,437 --> 00:03:14,838
♪

62
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:16,607
Oh, no...

63
00:03:25,483 --> 00:03:28,353
Kids! Peter! Get down here!

64
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,522
Everyone, I just read
Tricia Takanawa's book,

65
00:03:32,523 --> 00:03:34,624
and it was really inspiring.

66
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,626
She says that when you
de-clutter your house,

67
00:03:36,627 --> 00:03:39,896
you de-clutter your mind and
clear a path to true happiness.

68
00:03:39,897 --> 00:03:41,998
How about a clear path to dinner, bitch.

69
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:45,001
So I want everyone to go through
every single item you own,

70
00:03:45,002 --> 00:03:48,638
and if it doesn't kindle joy,
throw it away.

71
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,906
See?

72
00:03:49,907 --> 00:03:53,410
This sweater, it's okay,
but it doesn't kindle joy.

73
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:54,744
I'm throwing it out.

74
00:03:54,745 --> 00:03:56,813
Now, get to it.

75
00:03:56,814 --> 00:03:58,582
Wow, she's really all in on this.

76
00:03:58,583 --> 00:03:59,683
Well, she's searching for something

77
00:03:59,684 --> 00:04:01,351
to fill her empty life.

78
00:04:01,352 --> 00:04:02,819
You remember when
she thought the solution

79
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,522
was putting a lemon slice
in a plain glass of water

80
00:04:05,523 --> 00:04:08,192
for a "very simple kind of pleasure"?

81
00:04:11,496 --> 00:04:13,530
Ah. Perfection.

82
00:04:13,531 --> 00:04:15,665
And just the thing
to wash down six Xanax

83
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,868
from four different prescriptions.

84
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,438
Mmm.

85
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:24,875
Tomorrow, this will seem
like a new idea again.

86
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,781
Oh, my voodoo doll of Mom.

87
00:04:31,782 --> 00:04:34,784
Yeah, totally throw.
It never worked, anyway.

88
00:04:34,785 --> 00:04:37,554
Ow! What the hell was that?!

89
00:04:37,555 --> 00:04:38,888
Oh. Keep.

90
00:04:45,896 --> 00:04:49,198
Box of cords that go to
computers from the 1980s.

91
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,567
Keep.

92
00:04:50,568 --> 00:04:53,403
$70,000 in Camel Cash.

93
00:04:53,404 --> 00:04:56,305
I should've pulled the trigger
on that umbrella. Keep.

94
00:04:56,306 --> 00:04:58,908
Woody and Buzz,
who definitely are not alive,

95
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:02,479
so I can turn my back... on them!

96
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,415
Well, I guess they passed the test.

97
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,460
They're really... not alive!

98
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:10,587
Peter, what are you doing up there?

99
00:05:10,588 --> 00:05:12,589
Oh, nothing, Lois.
I was just making sure

100
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,591
I kept my Woody and Bu...

101
00:05:14,592 --> 00:05:16,493
I knew it.

102
00:05:16,494 --> 00:05:18,595
Peter, there's nothing
in your throwaway pile.

103
00:05:18,596 --> 00:05:20,630
I know. I'm keeping everything.

104
00:05:20,631 --> 00:05:23,600
- Everything kindles joy!
- That can't be true.

105
00:05:23,601 --> 00:05:25,602
Even this old tin can on a string?

106
00:05:25,603 --> 00:05:27,604
I mean, what are you
even doing with this?

107
00:05:27,605 --> 00:05:28,638
You're a grown man!

108
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,507
Why would you possibly need this?

109
00:05:30,508 --> 00:05:32,843
If anything is garbage, this is garbage.

110
00:05:33,911 --> 00:05:35,912
Sounds like things aren't going well

111
00:05:35,913 --> 00:05:38,915
- at the Griffins.
- This is why no girls allowed.

112
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:42,220
I hate to do this, guys,
but Peter's been compromised.

113
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:47,624
Oh, look, my box of ribbons I've
saved from various presents.

114
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,460
Oh, I'm not throwing that out.
That's a good ribbon.

115
00:05:50,461 --> 00:05:51,795
This is a good ribbon, too.

116
00:05:51,796 --> 00:05:53,797
These are all very usable ribbons.

117
00:05:53,798 --> 00:05:55,499
Hey, little guy.
How's the sorting going?

118
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,101
I'm not getting rid of my ribbons!

119
00:05:58,135 --> 00:06:01,170
I just wanted to know

120
00:06:01,171 --> 00:06:03,707
if I could borrow a ribbon.

121
00:06:11,482 --> 00:06:13,783
If you love Game of Thrones on HBO,

122
00:06:13,784 --> 00:06:16,553
you'll love Cinemax's Boob Dragons.

123
00:06:21,158 --> 00:06:24,694
Series pass. Record all. Priority one.

124
00:06:24,695 --> 00:06:27,130
Peter, that's, like, your 50th bag.

125
00:06:27,131 --> 00:06:28,565
What could possibly be in there?

126
00:06:28,566 --> 00:06:31,167
- Oh. Have you not heard?
- Brian, no!

127
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:33,202
<i>Well, everybody's... 'bout the bird</i>

128
00:06:33,203 --> 00:06:34,638
<i>Bird, bird, bird</i>

129
00:06:37,374 --> 00:06:38,508
<i>Bird, bird, bird</i>

130
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:40,510
<i>Bird is the... bird, bird...</i>

131
00:06:40,511 --> 00:06:42,512
Wait a minute, didn't we destroy that?

132
00:06:42,513 --> 00:06:43,647
I glued it.

133
00:06:43,648 --> 00:06:46,683
"Surfin' Bird," uh, uh, uh,

134
00:06:46,684 --> 00:06:48,318
finds a way.

135
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,494
I love it!

136
00:06:58,495 --> 00:07:00,330
Perfect!

137
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,701
Ah-ha-ha!

138
00:07:08,372 --> 00:07:09,706
So, Lois, what's your next

139
00:07:09,707 --> 00:07:12,241
"bored housewife seeking
purpose in life" project

140
00:07:12,242 --> 00:07:13,610
after de-cluttering?

141
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:16,345
Vegan baking? Handmade soaps on Etsy?

142
00:07:16,346 --> 00:07:18,347
Whoa. You drunk already, bro?

143
00:07:18,348 --> 00:07:20,216
What's your next fake writing project,

144
00:07:20,217 --> 00:07:22,251
a rap opera about Grover Cleveland?

145
00:07:22,252 --> 00:07:24,420
No, Lois, that would be ridiculous.

146
00:07:24,421 --> 00:07:28,124
Mine is a '70s funk musical
about William Howard Taft.

147
00:07:31,696 --> 00:07:33,396
<i>Who's the big fat president</i>

148
00:07:33,397 --> 00:07:36,399
<i>Whose suits look like
a flannel circus tent?</i>

149
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,234
<i>Taft</i>

150
00:07:38,235 --> 00:07:39,435
<i>Right on</i>

151
00:07:39,436 --> 00:07:41,370
<i>Who's that presidential chub</i>

152
00:07:41,371 --> 00:07:44,207
<i>Got stuck in the White House tub?</i>

153
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:47,243
<i>William Howard Taft</i>

154
00:07:47,244 --> 00:07:49,145
<i>They say this cat Taft</i>

155
00:07:49,146 --> 00:07:50,614
<i>Is a fat mother...</i>

156
00:07:50,615 --> 00:07:52,248
<i>Shut your mouth</i>

157
00:07:52,249 --> 00:07:54,150
<i>I'm just talkin' 'bout Taft</i>

158
00:07:54,151 --> 00:07:55,586
<i>And we can dig it.</i>

159
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,069
Ah.

160
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,626
Ah, so good to be home.

161
00:08:16,273 --> 00:08:17,573
Since when do you surf?!

162
00:08:17,574 --> 00:08:20,243
Oh, I don't. I just
rolled around in the sand

163
00:08:20,244 --> 00:08:22,512
and brought home
this bucket of alive crabs.

164
00:08:28,252 --> 00:08:29,786
When the clutter is gone,

165
00:08:29,787 --> 00:08:32,488
the path to happiness is clear.

166
00:08:32,489 --> 00:08:35,158
Lois, you could just pee in
these like a space suit, right?

167
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,861
Peter... you don't kindle joy.

168
00:08:37,862 --> 00:08:39,595
- What?
- I'm sorry,

169
00:08:39,596 --> 00:08:42,932
but I'm looking at you,
and I'm just not feeling joy.

170
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:44,801
What... what are you saying?

171
00:08:44,802 --> 00:08:46,435
Peter...

172
00:08:46,436 --> 00:08:49,205
I don't think I can have you
in the house right now.

173
00:08:49,206 --> 00:08:50,874
You're throwing me away?

174
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,541
Yes.

175
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:54,377
I'm so sorry, Peter.

176
00:08:54,378 --> 00:08:57,180
I just feel like
if you don't kindle joy...

177
00:08:57,181 --> 00:08:58,715
And that's what the book said...

178
00:08:58,716 --> 00:09:01,217
You can't kick me out of my own house.

179
00:09:01,218 --> 00:09:03,119
The house that I pay for?

180
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,221
That I semi-pay for
with help from your parents?

181
00:09:05,222 --> 00:09:07,156
That your parents pay for entirely,

182
00:09:07,157 --> 00:09:09,492
but I get to put the
mortgage coupon in the mailbox?

183
00:09:09,493 --> 00:09:11,227
That your parents pay for entirely

184
00:09:11,228 --> 00:09:12,528
using autodraft from their account

185
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:15,298
while I put a pretend mortgage
coupon that clearly says

186
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:17,333
"Not legal tender" into the mailbox?

187
00:09:17,334 --> 00:09:19,135
That your parents pay for entirely

188
00:09:19,136 --> 00:09:20,336
using autodraft from their account

189
00:09:20,337 --> 00:09:22,672
while I put a pretend
mortgage coupon that says

190
00:09:22,673 --> 00:09:25,675
"Not legal tender" into
Stewie's Sesame Street mailbox?

191
00:09:25,676 --> 00:09:27,410
That your parents pay for entirely

192
00:09:27,411 --> 00:09:29,178
using autodraft from their account

193
00:09:29,179 --> 00:09:31,514
while Chris puts a pretend
mortgage coupon that says

194
00:09:31,515 --> 00:09:34,350
"Not legal tender" into
Stewie's Sesame Street mailbox

195
00:09:34,351 --> 00:09:36,485
while I hold the plastic door
open for him?

196
00:09:36,486 --> 00:09:38,254
That your parents pay for entirely...

197
00:09:38,255 --> 00:09:40,356
- Peter, we get it.
- Okay.

198
00:09:40,357 --> 00:09:42,064
What's happening again?

199
00:09:42,065 --> 00:09:43,893
I'm asking you to leave the house.

200
00:09:43,894 --> 00:09:45,830
The house that I pay for?

201
00:09:50,901 --> 00:09:53,569
Thanks for letting me
crash here, Quagmire.

202
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,438
No problem, Peter.
I'm sure Lois'll cool down

203
00:09:55,439 --> 00:09:57,440
in a few days, and you'll be back home.

204
00:09:57,441 --> 00:09:59,876
Yeah, she'll be fine. And you
won't even know I'm here.

205
00:09:59,877 --> 00:10:03,446
I mean, I need to keep up
with my workouts.

206
00:10:03,447 --> 00:10:06,916
And I can't sleep unless I have
Dunkirk on at full volume.

207
00:10:09,619 --> 00:10:11,722
But, yeah, this'll be great.

208
00:10:15,192 --> 00:10:17,193
Hi, kids. Do you need those hats?

209
00:10:17,194 --> 00:10:19,295
- I mean...
- It's the foundation of my look,

210
00:10:19,296 --> 00:10:21,130
but we can discuss it.

211
00:10:21,131 --> 00:10:23,432
I feel like they're clutter.
I feel like you don't need them.

212
00:10:23,433 --> 00:10:25,468
L-Let's just see
what you look like without...

213
00:10:25,469 --> 00:10:28,237
Whoa! You kids are Legos?

214
00:10:28,238 --> 00:10:31,607
Sorry you had to find out this way, Mom.

215
00:10:31,608 --> 00:10:33,376
Oh. Hi, Brian. You're carrying clutter,

216
00:10:33,377 --> 00:10:34,911
I'll just throw it out.

217
00:10:34,912 --> 00:10:37,313
Ha! A clean house means a clean soul,

218
00:10:37,314 --> 00:10:40,216
and a clean soul is a happy one.

219
00:10:40,217 --> 00:10:41,717
That was a whole pizza.

220
00:10:41,718 --> 00:10:43,286
And I didn't even start eating it yet.

221
00:10:43,287 --> 00:10:44,720
You're surprised about a pizza?

222
00:10:44,721 --> 00:10:46,956
She threw out a whole guy.

223
00:10:46,957 --> 00:10:48,825
Yeah, Lois might be starting to lose it.

224
00:10:48,826 --> 00:10:50,960
Even her cutaways are getting
a little too minimalist.

225
00:10:50,961 --> 00:10:52,395
Have you noticed?

226
00:10:52,396 --> 00:10:55,339
Donald Trump's hair is unusual.

227
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,139
Oh, hey, don't use the toilet.
I'm making wine.

228
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,473
Peter, you got to get out.

229
00:11:04,474 --> 00:11:06,342
The truth is I should have
asked you to leave

230
00:11:06,343 --> 00:11:07,676
after the other night.

231
00:11:11,015 --> 00:11:12,949
- Hello?
- Quagmire?

232
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,237
Yeah?

233
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:16,452
I can't sleep.

234
00:11:16,453 --> 00:11:18,454
So?

235
00:11:18,455 --> 00:11:20,289
I can't sleep.

236
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:22,258
What do you want me to do?

237
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:24,127
Will you read me a story?

238
00:11:24,128 --> 00:11:27,030
Peter, I-I'm-I'm in the middle
of something here.

239
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:29,432
- Like, maybe a Clifford?
- Peter, get out of here!

240
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:31,334
- Clifford?
- No! Not now!

241
00:11:31,335 --> 00:11:33,369
Quagmire, Clifford now?

242
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:36,473
Ugh! Just read him the story.

243
00:11:37,975 --> 00:11:40,476
"Clifford was just too big
for the bathtub."

244
00:11:40,477 --> 00:11:43,212
- Isn't he big, Peter?
- Clifford big!

245
00:11:43,213 --> 00:11:45,614
"So they decided
to hose him in the yard instead,

246
00:11:45,615 --> 00:11:47,483
but Clifford couldn't fit
through the door."

247
00:11:47,484 --> 00:11:49,152
See that, Peter?

248
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,556
Finally. All right, ladies,
I guess we can...

249
00:11:53,557 --> 00:11:55,992
Wouldn't you know it.

250
00:11:55,993 --> 00:11:58,495
Oh, my God,
they took the whole roof off.

251
00:12:06,971 --> 00:12:09,005
Everybody thinks they can kick me out?

252
00:12:09,006 --> 00:12:11,207
Well, who gets the last laugh now?

253
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,209
I get to sleep with all my stuff

254
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:16,180
in a storage unit
on the highway access road.

255
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:23,199
Okay, can't go to bed till you make one.

256
00:12:32,162 --> 00:12:34,198
All right, just got to make one.

257
00:12:38,002 --> 00:12:40,004
I'm going to sleep.

258
00:12:45,109 --> 00:12:47,717
Something bad's gonna happen
if you don't do it.

259
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:50,915
Meg! Chris!

260
00:12:52,349 --> 00:12:54,450
What the (BLEEP) is this?

261
00:12:54,451 --> 00:12:56,385
- I've never seen it before.
- I don't know.

262
00:12:56,386 --> 00:12:57,686
Stewie, she's got your time machine.

263
00:12:57,687 --> 00:12:59,688
Well, don't drag that
down the stairs or else...

264
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:12,735
Thank God, everything's back to normal.

265
00:13:12,736 --> 00:13:14,471
Pe-tew. Gross.

266
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,874
I tell you to clean your rooms,
and the first thing you do

267
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,577
is put all your science projects
in Stewie's closet?

268
00:13:21,578 --> 00:13:24,480
- Mom, we didn't...
- Stop arguing and get rid of it.

269
00:13:24,481 --> 00:13:26,815
And give me those glasses.
They're cluttering up your face.

270
00:13:26,816 --> 00:13:30,419
- I need them to see.
- They're not bringing me joy!

271
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,922
You realize there are four of us
and one of her.

272
00:13:32,923 --> 00:13:35,224
- If we rushed her all at once...
- That's not gonna work.

273
00:13:35,225 --> 00:13:37,793
She's clearly developed
the strength of the insane.

274
00:13:37,794 --> 00:13:40,663
- What did you say, Chris?
- Uh, nothing. I'm sorry!

275
00:13:40,664 --> 00:13:44,333
Chris, I will not have
your comic strip anger

276
00:13:44,334 --> 00:13:45,601
cluttering up my house.

277
00:13:45,602 --> 00:13:47,670
It's negative, and it ruins my joy.

278
00:13:47,671 --> 00:13:50,439
- Get it out of here!
- Now you've done it.

279
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,776
You've made me 1930s work whistle angry!

280
00:13:57,447 --> 00:13:58,781
Shut up, Meg!

281
00:13:58,782 --> 00:14:00,683
- What? I didn't say anything.
- You just did.

282
00:14:00,684 --> 00:14:02,851
Your voice... it's cluttering up
my space. Get out.

283
00:14:02,852 --> 00:14:05,118
- But...
- Get out of my house!

284
00:14:05,822 --> 00:14:08,857
You know, Lois, one could argue
that your bra is clutter.

285
00:14:08,858 --> 00:14:11,327
Nice try, dirtbag. Leave.

286
00:14:11,328 --> 00:14:12,661
Figured it was gonna happen, anyway.

287
00:14:12,662 --> 00:14:14,664
Might as well go out on my terms.

288
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:19,703
♪

289
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,807
I cluttered my pants.

290
00:14:24,808 --> 00:14:27,444
It did not kindle joy.

291
00:14:35,185 --> 00:14:37,186
Well, that does it.

292
00:14:37,187 --> 00:14:39,322
I got rid of all the clutter.

293
00:14:39,323 --> 00:14:41,490
I made order out of chaos,

294
00:14:41,491 --> 00:14:43,959
And it's beautiful.

295
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,363
Ah, there's even an echo in here now.

296
00:14:47,364 --> 00:14:49,365
I'm so happy!

297
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:52,501
I'm very unhappy!

298
00:14:52,502 --> 00:14:56,205
My house is at peace, so I am at peace.

299
00:14:56,206 --> 00:14:59,408
You're all alone and sad.

300
00:14:59,409 --> 00:15:02,578
Simplicity is good for the soul.

301
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:06,215
Your soul is as empty as this house,

302
00:15:06,216 --> 00:15:08,218
this house, this house.

303
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:26,269
But I did what the book said.
I did it all.

304
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:29,205
Why didn't it work?
Why am I still not happy?

305
00:15:29,206 --> 00:15:30,606
What have I done?

306
00:15:30,607 --> 00:15:33,871
Looks like there's only
one thing left to get rid of.

307
00:15:39,216 --> 00:15:40,449
The mirror.

308
00:15:43,187 --> 00:15:45,554
- Look. Towels!
- They don't even match.

309
00:15:45,555 --> 00:15:48,176
Who cares? They're still thirsty.

310
00:15:54,231 --> 00:15:56,599
She's not here. Come on.

311
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,302
Wow. Everything's gone.

312
00:15:59,303 --> 00:16:01,138
What's that?

313
00:16:02,706 --> 00:16:05,241
"Words, letters, letters and words,

314
00:16:05,242 --> 00:16:07,376
mm-hmm, mm-hmm, more words and letters."

315
00:16:07,377 --> 00:16:08,711
Chris, can't you read?

316
00:16:08,712 --> 00:16:11,247
No, I know the letters
when they're on their own,

317
00:16:11,248 --> 00:16:13,282
but, you know,
when they team up like this,

318
00:16:13,283 --> 00:16:16,319
I'm just, uh... I'm sort of outmatched.

319
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,621
"It was my fault, not yours.

320

"I'm so sorry, and I love you all.

321
00:16:21,158 --> 00:16:22,391
"Goodbye.

322
00:16:22,392 --> 00:16:24,727
"P.S. Please throw this note out.

323
00:16:24,728 --> 00:16:26,629
It is clutter."

324
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,664
Oh, my God. Where could she be?

325
00:16:28,665 --> 00:16:30,933
You don't think
she killed herself, do you?

326
00:16:30,934 --> 00:16:32,601
We're gonna need professional help.

327
00:16:32,602 --> 00:16:33,969
I got to call Joe.

328
00:16:37,407 --> 00:16:38,774
Hello?

329
00:16:38,775 --> 00:16:41,677
Joe, are you in my kitchen?

330
00:16:41,678 --> 00:16:43,012
No.

331
00:16:44,013 --> 00:16:46,014
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

332
00:16:46,015 --> 00:16:48,451
Hey, Bon.

<i>Did they have the French bread pizza?</i>

334
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:52,289
Not a good time, Bon.

335
00:16:59,863 --> 00:17:02,498
Well, she's dead. It's a suicide note.

336
00:17:02,499 --> 00:17:04,533
It doesn't actually say
she's gonna end it.

337
00:17:04,534 --> 00:17:06,269
Maybe she just took off somewhere.

338
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,704
I'll call Cleveland.
Maybe he saw something.

339
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,774
Hello?

340
00:17:11,775 --> 00:17:14,210
Are you stealing my copper plumbing?

341
00:17:14,211 --> 00:17:15,844
- No.
- What are you doing?

342
00:17:15,845 --> 00:17:17,146
Nothing.

343
00:17:18,515 --> 00:17:20,048
Hey, Donna.

Not a good time, Don.

Dad, how can you be so sure
Mom is at Mount Asia?

347
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,531
We cut a whole scene

You got to just trust me.

Boy, feels like Rocky, huh?

that I left my phone in my pocket.

I had too much. But then I had nothing.

Oh, when Mommy's unstable,

I just came here to think.

381
00:19:41,257 --> 00:19:42,658
You made me lose my balance,

382
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:45,127
but when I landed in all that garbage,

383
00:19:45,128 --> 00:19:47,696
I realized it saved my life.

384

Literally, yes, but also
it saves my life every day.

The joy that you find in everything...

386

The fact that every little thing
you see kindles joy for you...

387
00:19:57,341 --> 00:19:59,308
That's the right attitude, Peter.

388
00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:02,378
And I'm gonna try to have
that attitude from now on.

Oh, just leave it for now.
We'll deal with it later.

393
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,638
Oh, okay. Thanks, Mom.

394
00:20:29,639 --> 00:20:31,874
Yeah, that de-cluttering thing
was nice for a while,

395
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,809
but I definitely went overboard.

396
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:36,679
I don't know. Somehow, an idea
I got from a two-minute segment

397
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,747
on a morning talk show didn't
bring me the life satisfaction

398
00:20:38,748 --> 00:20:40,549
I thought it would.

399
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:43,218
On the bright side, our sparse,
white living room looks like

the John Lennon, Yoko Ono
"Imagine" living room.

401

We can't afford "Imagine," so
just imagine this is "Imagine."
