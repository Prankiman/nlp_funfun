12
00:00:37,181 --> 00:00:39,248
Ah, Smitty's Steakhouse.

13
00:00:39,483 --> 00:00:41,851
You know, this was the
fanciest restaurant in Quahog

14
00:00:41,885 --> 00:00:44,620
when I was a kid.
The ladies' room has a big space

15
00:00:44,655 --> 00:00:47,023
with chairs in it, like a living
room, before you get back

16
00:00:47,057 --> 00:00:48,291
to where the crappers are.

17
00:00:48,325 --> 00:00:50,126
Good evening and
welcome to Smitty's.

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,128
I'll be back with
martinis for Mom and Dad,

19
00:00:52,162 --> 00:00:54,830
and for you kids,
some martinis.

20
00:00:54,865 --> 00:00:56,499
Dad, can you pass
the bread?

21
00:00:56,533 --> 00:00:58,935
Sure. But don't forget
the butter that looks like

22
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:02,238
decorative bathroom soaps and
is impossible to smear.

23
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:08,945
Thanks, Dad!
This really ruins it!

24
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:10,680
What will you
be having, sir?

25
00:01:10,714 --> 00:01:13,249
Yes, I'll have what I had last
time: pheasant on the glass.

26
00:01:13,283 --> 00:01:15,151
Don't you mean
"pheasant under glass"?

27
00:01:15,185 --> 00:01:16,419
Nope.

28
00:01:16,453 --> 00:01:18,487
(chirping)

29
00:01:18,522 --> 00:01:22,525
Yeah. Now turn around
and lay an egg on the glass.

30
00:01:24,695 --> 00:01:26,929
Aw, yeah.

31
00:01:26,964 --> 00:01:30,666
I defy you to tell me
exactly what's wrong with this.

32
00:01:34,404 --> 00:01:36,806
Oh, Peter, look.
You can put your business card

33
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,808
in this bowl
and maybe win a free lunch.

34
00:01:38,842 --> 00:01:40,643
I don't have a
business card.

35
00:01:40,677 --> 00:01:42,845
And I think
you knew that.

36
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,513
I hope you enjoyed
your meal, sir.

37
00:01:44,548 --> 00:01:47,016
May I offer you a toothpick?
Oh, I-I don't know.

38
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,018
We've already spent
a lot of money in here tonight.

39
00:01:49,052 --> 00:01:52,088
No, sir, it-it's free.

40
00:01:53,724 --> 00:01:56,158
Oh!

41
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:01,297
Peter, that's not how
you use a toothpick.

42
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:02,798
You pick your teeth
with it.

43
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:05,368
I cannot believe I have
to explain this to you.

44
00:02:05,402 --> 00:02:08,404
There are gaps in my knowledge.
This is hardly news.

45
00:02:10,073 --> 00:02:11,807
Wow, this is awesome!

46
00:02:11,842 --> 00:02:14,677
This is like
I'm having a whole second meal!

47
00:02:16,346 --> 00:02:19,315
Man, this just feels right.

48
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:22,385
That's it. From here on out, I
am about all things toothpick.

49
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:24,887
I'm gonna go everywhere with
it, always be chewin' on it,

50
00:02:24,921 --> 00:02:26,656
#-and start all my
sentences with,

51
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,224
"All right, here's
what you're gonna do."

52
00:02:28,258 --> 00:02:30,226
Excuse me, we're
from out of town.

53
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,862
Where do people go to listen
to live music around here?

54
00:02:32,896 --> 00:02:34,864
I'll handle this. All right,
here's what you're gonna do:

55
00:02:34,898 --> 00:02:36,699
skip the live music.
Get yourself a room

56
00:02:36,733 --> 00:02:38,868
over at the Wickford Marina.
Take her out on a balcony,

57
00:02:38,902 --> 00:02:41,103
point to any boat in the harbor,
and tell her it's yours.

58
00:02:41,138 --> 00:02:43,205
Now, you got rubbers?
Now that I'm a toothpick guy,

59
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,207
I call 'em rubbers. Or you could
just pull the hose out

60
00:02:45,242 --> 00:02:46,709
of the bucket
and let it spray free.

61
00:02:46,743 --> 00:02:49,812
I've had a vasectomy.

62
00:02:52,649 --> 00:02:55,284
Chris, now that I'm a toothpick
guy, it's my job to sit

63
00:02:55,318 --> 00:02:57,286
on a BMX bike
outside the rec center

64
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,722
and ask every kid
if they're the new kid.

65
00:02:59,756 --> 00:03:01,724
Hey. You the new kid?

66
00:03:01,758 --> 00:03:03,392
Why?
Never mind why.

67
00:03:03,427 --> 00:03:06,395
Got any cool toys?
Uh, I got an Xbox.

68
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,964
How about you?
I got a Barbie with a wiener on it.

69
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:11,967
Took a thumb from a G.I. Joe,
put it on with superglue.

70
00:03:12,002 --> 00:03:14,236
Looks pretty real.
Real enough, anyways.

71
00:03:14,271 --> 00:03:16,305
Does the job.
Does what job?

72
00:03:16,339 --> 00:03:18,908
You get it. My family
moves around a lot

73
00:03:18,942 --> 00:03:20,576
'cause I do stuff like this.

74
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,078
Um... okay.

75
00:03:22,112 --> 00:03:23,979
I got to go now.
You sure you don't want

76
00:03:24,014 --> 00:03:25,915
to come over and pull
on my cat's nipples?

77
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:29,285
We can do anything,
'cause my mom has two jobs.

78
00:03:31,321 --> 00:03:32,788
All right,
I'm off to the fish market.

79
00:03:32,823 --> 00:03:34,390
What? Why?

80
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:36,459
Well, the most intimidating
people are toothpick guys

81
00:03:36,493 --> 00:03:38,627
who work at seafood counters
and make people uncomfortable

82
00:03:38,662 --> 00:03:40,563
for not knowing
about fish.

83
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:41,997
What's good here?
It's all good.

84
00:03:42,032 --> 00:03:43,499
What's the freshest?
It's all fresh.

85
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:44,767
How 'bout the halibut?
Is it gamey?

86
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:45,701
Gamey?

87
00:03:45,702 --> 00:03:47,937
I mean, you know, is it fishy?
It's all fish.

88
00:03:47,971 --> 00:03:50,673
Is there a special way to prepare it?
I'd cook it up.

89
00:03:50,707 --> 00:03:52,274
W-Well, what's
the best fish here?

90
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:53,442
What's your favorite fish?

91
00:03:53,477 --> 00:03:56,345
I don't eat fish.
I only like spaghetti.

92
00:04:00,917 --> 00:04:03,119
Ugh, when are you gonna
get rid of that toothpick?

93
00:04:03,153 --> 00:04:05,621
It's disgusting,
and it's starting to smell.

94
00:04:05,655 --> 00:04:07,614
Why would I give it up?
It's gettin' me tons of tail.

95
00:04:07,638 --> 00:04:08,724
What?

96
00:04:08,725 --> 00:04:12,161
And check this out.
The rare triple toothpick flip.

97
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,433
(choking)

98
00:04:17,467 --> 00:04:19,668
Oh, my God,
are you all right?

99
00:04:19,703 --> 00:04:21,504
(coughs)
No, I swallowed it!

100
00:04:21,538 --> 00:04:23,272
My toothpick! It's gone!

101
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:25,341
Damn it! I'm gonna need
you to put that large

102
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,976
two-handed colander
over the toilet.

103
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,978
Peter, that was
a wedding present from my aunt.

104
00:04:29,012 --> 00:04:30,412
Well, let's use
the ice cream maker!

105
00:04:30,447 --> 00:04:31,547
We've never used it once!

106
00:04:31,581 --> 00:04:34,550
Calm down. You can always get
another toothpick.

107
00:04:34,584 --> 00:04:36,152
Oh, my God, you're right!

108
00:04:36,186 --> 00:04:37,653
Lois, we got to drive
to Smitty's right now

109
00:04:37,687 --> 00:04:40,055
and get one.
Now? But we told Chris

110
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,825
we'd be there
when he wakes up from surgery.

111
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:46,629
All right, we were able
to fix your hernia,

112
00:04:46,663 --> 00:04:49,031
but you've got to stop lifting
sewer hole covers.

113
00:04:49,065 --> 00:04:50,800
But the Ninja Turtles
live down there.

114
00:04:50,834 --> 00:04:52,034
I'm friends with them.

115
00:04:52,068 --> 00:04:54,136
Hey, fat ass,
I brought you flowers.

116
00:04:54,171 --> 00:04:56,872
But stay out of the sewers!
We're trying to work down there.

117
00:04:56,907 --> 00:04:59,175
Thanks, Donatello!

118
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:00,876
(tires screech)

119
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:02,311
Oh, thank God!

120
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:04,180
Quick, we need
another toothpick!

121
00:05:04,214 --> 00:05:07,616
Thank you, Maurice.

122
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,295
Just get your toothpick
and let's get out of here.

123
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:20,596
Ugh. No, thanks.

124
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,032
That old lady has ruined
toothpicks for me.

125
00:05:23,066 --> 00:05:25,267
Just like how Meg
ruined broccoli.

126
00:05:25,302 --> 00:05:27,269
Hey, Meg, look,
they're little trees!

127
00:05:27,304 --> 00:05:28,537
No, they're not.

128
00:05:28,572 --> 00:05:30,773
They're not?!

129
00:05:30,807 --> 00:05:33,209
Hey, Peter!

130
00:05:33,243 --> 00:05:35,878
Oh, look, there's Quagmire
and his transgendered mother,

131
00:05:35,912 --> 00:05:39,081
which is now great.

132
00:05:39,115 --> 00:05:40,449
Hey, Quagmire. Hey, Ida.

133
00:05:40,483 --> 00:05:42,084
I didn't know
you liked Smitty's.

134
00:05:42,118 --> 00:05:43,752
Oh, yeah, I've been coming here
for ages.

135
00:05:43,787 --> 00:05:45,521
They even named a sandwich
after me.

136
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:47,923
It's an inside-out hot dog
slathered in ketchup.

137
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,059
Please, please
join us.

138
00:05:50,093 --> 00:05:53,062
Oh, we wouldn't want
to interrupt your brave dinner.

139
00:05:53,096 --> 00:05:54,730
Nonsense, we're happy
to have you.

140
00:05:54,764 --> 00:05:56,332
All right,
but we already ate dinner,

141
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:59,902
so maybe just an iceberg wedge,
a steak, and some sides.

142
00:05:59,936 --> 00:06:02,271
And then I said something random
that suggested

143
00:06:02,305 --> 00:06:03,939
a whole crazy story!

144
00:06:03,974 --> 00:06:06,408
(all laugh)

145
00:06:06,443 --> 00:06:08,410
Oh, God, that's
hilarious, Lois.

146
00:06:08,445 --> 00:06:10,246
I could listen to
you talk all night.

147
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,848
Yeah, but we got to get going.
Carter's our babysitter,

148
00:06:12,883 --> 00:06:16,018
and if he's with the kids too
long, they start sayin' racisms.

149
00:06:16,052 --> 00:06:18,020
Aw, I wish the fun didn't have
to end.

150
00:06:18,054 --> 00:06:20,589
I always enjoy spending time
with you two.

151
00:06:20,624 --> 00:06:22,391
Well, why don't you
come over tomorrow?

152
00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:25,728
We'll fire up the grill and have
the gang over for a cookout.

153
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:28,130
Well, that sounds wonderful.
Well, great, we'll be there!

154
00:06:28,164 --> 00:06:30,065
Hey, before you two
leave, let's take a photo.

155
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,401
Yeah! Selfie!
(laughs)

156
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:34,803
I just learned that word.

157
00:06:37,807 --> 00:06:40,276
Perfect! Well, good
night, you guys.

158
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,611
See you tomorrow,
hashtags!

159
00:06:42,646 --> 00:06:44,980
You're not doin'
that right.

160
00:06:48,485 --> 00:06:50,886
Boy, that Lois is really
something, isn't she?

161
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:53,789
Yeah. Peter's
a lucky guy.

162
00:06:53,823 --> 00:06:55,391
Glenn, do you...

163
00:06:55,425 --> 00:06:57,793
do you have feelings for her?

164
00:06:57,827 --> 00:07:00,129
What?
(scoffs) No.

165
00:07:00,163 --> 00:07:01,563
A mother always knows.

166
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:03,565
You like to play the
field, but, deep down,

167
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,335
you really wish you had a
woman like Lois, don't you?

168
00:07:06,369 --> 00:07:08,170
No, I don't want a woman
<i>like</i> Lois.

169
00:07:08,204 --> 00:07:10,005
I want Lois.

170
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,341
She's perfect.
I've loved her for years.

171
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,843
She's warm and kind
and beautiful.

172
00:07:14,878 --> 00:07:17,313
I've never been so in love
with anyone.

173
00:07:17,347 --> 00:07:19,148
Glenn, that's
very sweet,

174
00:07:19,182 --> 00:07:21,650
but you're talking about
your best friend's wife.

175
00:07:21,685 --> 00:07:23,252
I know, I know.
It's wrong.

176
00:07:23,286 --> 00:07:24,653
And Peter's
a good friend.

177
00:07:24,688 --> 00:07:26,588
Not like Cleveland.

178
00:07:26,623 --> 00:07:28,657
Hey, I got two
of these phone books.

179
00:07:28,692 --> 00:07:30,259
Didn't know
if you wanted one.

180
00:07:30,293 --> 00:07:32,428
Hey, how long
have we known each other?

181
00:07:32,462 --> 00:07:36,432
Long time. And yet we've never
discussed mothers' maiden names,

182
00:07:36,466 --> 00:07:39,668
the names of old pets,
high school mascots,

183
00:07:39,703 --> 00:07:42,104
favorite teachers.
Heck, I don't even know

184
00:07:42,138 --> 00:07:44,106
the last four digits
of your Social.

185
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,941
Cleveland, do you need
to borrow some money?

186
00:07:45,976 --> 00:07:47,959
I do!
They're gonna kill Donna!

187
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,597
Really?

188
00:07:48,621 --> 00:07:50,927
No. I just want
to buy a man's fur coat.

189
00:07:51,214 --> 00:07:52,982
Get out of here.

190
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:55,718
(distant knocking)

191
00:07:55,752 --> 00:07:57,486
(door opens in distance)
Hey, Peter,

192
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,321
I had an extra
phone book, and I...

193
00:07:59,356 --> 00:08:01,657
PETER: I'm not buyin' you that coat!
(door slams)

194
00:08:08,098 --> 00:08:10,299
(snores, coughing)
Huh? Who? What?

195
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,301
Yeah, what? What? Which
doggy in what window?

196
00:08:12,335 --> 00:08:13,969
So, how'd everything go?

197
00:08:14,004 --> 00:08:15,804
Hard to tell. I was
coughing the whole time.

198
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,806
By the way, I couldn't figure
out how to use your oven,

199
00:08:17,841 --> 00:08:19,541
so I destroyed it
in a blind rage.

200
00:08:19,576 --> 00:08:21,343
Well, good night.

201
00:08:21,378 --> 00:08:25,347
Ooh, after that steak, I got
to go lay down on the toilet.

202
00:08:25,382 --> 00:08:26,653
(phone vibrates)

203
00:08:26,676 --> 00:08:28,583
Huh. Looks like I got
a couple of messages.

204
00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:30,853
(banging sounds on voicemail)
STEWIE: Uh, Dad? Dad?

205
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:32,688
Grandpa's going nuts
on the oven.

206
00:08:32,722 --> 00:08:33,922
Can you come home quick?

207
00:08:33,957 --> 00:08:35,424
Who the hell is that?

208
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,693
Huh. There's one from Quagmire.

209
00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:38,844
(muffled conversation)

210
00:08:38,867 --> 00:08:40,873
Huh, must've pocket-dialed me
again.

211
00:08:40,897 --> 00:08:43,365
QUAGMIRE:
I want Lois. She's perfect.

212
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,933
I've loved her for years.

213
00:08:44,968 --> 00:08:47,536
She's warm and kind
and beautiful.

214
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,538
I've never been so in love
with anyone.

215
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:51,540
Oh, my God.

216
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:53,776
Quagmire's in love with my wife?

217
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,611
(phone rings)
Hello?

218
00:08:55,645 --> 00:08:57,846
LOIS: Peter, I'm having troubles
on the toilet.

219
00:08:57,881 --> 00:08:59,114
Bring the ice cream maker.

220
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,398
Brian, there's somethin' I
got to talk to you about.

221
00:09:07,432 --> 00:09:09,967
Quagmire pocket-dialed
me last night.

222
00:09:10,001 --> 00:09:12,069
You got to hear this.

223
00:09:12,104 --> 00:09:14,238
QUAGMIRE:
I want Lois. She's perfect.

224
00:09:14,272 --> 00:09:16,741
I've loved her for years.
Oh, my God!

225
00:09:16,775 --> 00:09:18,743
He's in love
with Lois?

226
00:09:18,777 --> 00:09:20,411
Yeah, and if you keep
listenin', you can hear

227
00:09:20,445 --> 00:09:22,947
a Puerto Rican busboy get
fired in the background.

228
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:25,583
It's pretty funny. He cries.
But can you believe Quagmire?!

229
00:09:25,617 --> 00:09:27,251
Well, I guess
it's not that shocking.

230
00:09:27,285 --> 00:09:29,987
I mean, he has said 100 times
that he wants to bang Lois.

231
00:09:30,021 --> 00:09:32,156
No, no, no, that's just
Quagmire bein' a horndog.

232
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,958
This is love.

233
00:09:33,992 --> 00:09:36,093
I don't know, I think you're making
too big a deal out of this.

234
00:09:36,128 --> 00:09:38,395
Too big a deal?! The guy's
been sitting next to me

235
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,097
all these years,
acting like he's my friend,

236
00:09:40,132 --> 00:09:42,333
when all he really wants
is to be with my wife!

237
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:44,068
Geez, calm down.
No, I'm telling you,

238
00:09:44,102 --> 00:09:46,137
he's gonna try to take
Lois away from me.

239
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:48,105
You know what? I'm going
over there right now

240
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,908
and hit him with a shovel, like
a white trash YouTube girl.

241
00:09:50,942 --> 00:09:52,176
Peter, wait, wait.
Listen.

242
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,612
Delete that message
and pretend you never heard it.

243
00:09:54,646 --> 00:09:55,813
What? Why?

244
00:09:55,847 --> 00:09:57,515
Because you weren't meant
to hear it.

245
00:09:57,549 --> 00:10:00,351
If you act on this, all you'll
do is wreck your friendship

246
00:10:00,385 --> 00:10:02,186
and cause heartache
for everyone involved.

247
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,476
What, so what am I supposed
to do, just ignore it?

248
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,725
Yeah. Ignore it.
Like you do with the ghost

249
00:10:05,726 --> 00:10:08,376
of that colonial woman who
died falling down our stairs.

250
00:10:09,161 --> 00:10:13,264
(moaning): I saw you
eat a crayon...

251
00:10:13,298 --> 00:10:15,633
It was purple.
I thought it was grape.

252
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:17,768
Look, you've got to be
the bigger man.

253
00:10:17,803 --> 00:10:19,804
You got to just keep this
to yourself.

254
00:10:19,838 --> 00:10:21,839
(sighs) Fine,
I won't say anything.

255
00:10:21,873 --> 00:10:23,974
Good. And don't be
passive-aggressive, either.

256
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:26,811
Like one of those songs
in an old musical.

257
00:10:26,845 --> 00:10:28,012
(jaunty melody plays)

Pretty good turnout
for this thing.

267
00:10:52,671 --> 00:10:55,039
Oh, yeah, Mort
<i>and</i> Neil Goldman.

268
00:10:55,073 --> 00:10:57,007
It's like Coachella.

269
00:11:00,512 --> 00:11:02,179
There's that son of a bitch!

270
00:11:02,214 --> 00:11:04,181
He's got some nerve
showing up here.

271
00:11:04,216 --> 00:11:06,050
Peter, remember what
we talked about.

272
00:11:06,084 --> 00:11:07,751
Look at them clouds
up there.

273
00:11:07,786 --> 00:11:09,353
Yeah, that one
look like Nathan.

274
00:11:09,387 --> 00:11:10,988
That one look
like Shawn.

275
00:11:11,022 --> 00:11:12,556
And there go Wanya
over there.

276
00:11:12,591 --> 00:11:15,559
How blessed are we to have
all them Boyz II Men

277
00:11:15,594 --> 00:11:17,828
just floating around
in the sky?

278
00:11:17,863 --> 00:11:19,263
Glenn! Ida!
You made it!

279
00:11:19,297 --> 00:11:21,098
Hey, Lois. I brought
the hamburger buns,

280
00:11:21,132 --> 00:11:22,366
like you wanted.

281
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,701
I wasn't sure
what people like,

282
00:11:23,735 --> 00:11:26,270
so I got some with seeds on them
and some without.

283
00:11:26,304 --> 00:11:28,405
What does he mean
by that, "seeds"?

284
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,241
Like semen?
Is that what he means?

285
00:11:30,275 --> 00:11:33,043
Semen on her buns.
Am I the only one hearing this?

286
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:35,512
Get the hell away from my wife,
you scumbag!

287
00:11:35,547 --> 00:11:37,081
Peter, what are you
talking about?

288
00:11:37,115 --> 00:11:38,682
I'll tell you
what I'm talking about!

289
00:11:38,717 --> 00:11:39,884
I'm talking about this!

290
00:11:39,918 --> 00:11:41,518
PETER (recorded):
Idea for a movie.

291
00:11:41,553 --> 00:11:45,022
<i>Fop Cop.</i> It's a cop
who's, like, a fancy guy.

292
00:11:45,056 --> 00:11:47,358
Nobody heard that!
None of you take that!

293
00:11:47,392 --> 00:11:49,627
What I meant to play was this.

294
00:11:49,661 --> 00:11:51,762
QUAGMIRE:
I want Lois. She's perfect.

295
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:53,597
I've loved her for years.

296
00:11:53,632 --> 00:11:56,200
<i>Fop Cop.</i>
That could work.

297
00:11:56,234 --> 00:11:58,269
Glenn...
i-is this true?

298
00:11:58,303 --> 00:12:00,871
Wait a minute, how the hell'd you get
that recording, Peter?

299
00:12:00,906 --> 00:12:02,907
You pocket-dialed me,
you bastard!

300
00:12:02,941 --> 00:12:04,608
Peter, that was a
private conversation.

301
00:12:04,643 --> 00:12:07,945
That doesn't change the fact
that you want to steal my wife!

302
00:12:07,979 --> 00:12:09,980
Hey, get your
hands off me!

303
00:12:10,982 --> 00:12:12,549
LOIS:
Oh, my God!

304
00:12:12,584 --> 00:12:14,218
JOE: Oh, come on, you two.
MAN: Come on, man.

305
00:12:14,252 --> 00:12:15,452
Hey, what are y'all doing?
Someone stop him!

306
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,654
Kill him, Dad!

307
00:12:16,688 --> 00:12:18,088
Murder him!

308
00:12:19,124 --> 00:12:20,925
(Quagmire and Peter grunting)

309
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,593
That's it!
End of cookout!

310
00:12:22,627 --> 00:12:26,263
Get out of my house, and don't
ever speak to me again!

311
00:12:27,766 --> 00:12:29,733
Wow, that turned ugly fast.

312
00:12:29,768 --> 00:12:32,036
Just like my trip to Tampa Bay.

313
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:35,205
Hey, city boy,
what's with the arm pants?

314
00:12:40,545 --> 00:12:42,646
QUAGMIRE (recorded):
I want Lois. She's perfect.

315
00:12:42,681 --> 00:12:44,348
I've loved her for years.

316
00:12:44,382 --> 00:12:46,450
(groans) You're still
listening to that thing?

317
00:12:46,484 --> 00:12:50,321
It's like, I can't even process
why he'd feel this way.

318
00:12:50,355 --> 00:12:52,656
Maybe... you know, maybe
play it one more time and...

319
00:12:52,691 --> 00:12:54,491
I can't believe this.

320
00:12:54,526 --> 00:12:56,327
I thought Quagmire
was my friend!

321
00:12:56,361 --> 00:12:58,329
Peter, it's not
that surprising.

322
00:12:58,363 --> 00:13:00,597
He's always had a
potent sex drive.

323
00:13:00,632 --> 00:13:03,200
Remember his
grandmother's funeral?

324
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:06,303
(quietly):
Yeah, get it in there.

325
00:13:06,338 --> 00:13:07,972
Oh, I <i>wish</i> this was
about sex.

326
00:13:08,006 --> 00:13:10,574
If he was just home
busting one to his buddy's wife,

327
00:13:10,608 --> 00:13:12,309
hell, we've all done that.

328
00:13:12,344 --> 00:13:13,944
I've heard. Allegedly.

329
00:13:13,979 --> 00:13:16,380
But not often.
And never to Donna.

330
00:13:16,414 --> 00:13:19,116
Except when she wore those shiny
gold shorts to parent-teacher night.

331
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,218
Oh, yeah, that
was hilarious.

332
00:13:21,252 --> 00:13:22,319
(laughing):
Yeah, that was...

333
00:13:22,354 --> 00:13:23,654
that was so tacky.

334
00:13:23,688 --> 00:13:26,390
But Quagmire actually has
feelings for you.

335
00:13:26,424 --> 00:13:29,560
I'm afraid he might take you
away from me.

336
00:13:29,594 --> 00:13:31,929
Peter, nobody's
taking me anywhere.

337
00:13:31,963 --> 00:13:33,697
I love <i>you.</i>

338
00:13:33,732 --> 00:13:34,732
Mmm.

339
00:13:34,766 --> 00:13:36,100
I love you, too, Lois.

340
00:13:36,134 --> 00:13:38,435
Hey, you ever heard
any of the other wives

341
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,970
saying they're
attracted to me?

342
00:13:40,005 --> 00:13:41,338
(laughs)

343
00:13:41,373 --> 00:13:43,841
No, um, not that
I recall, no.

344
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,676
Look, now that
this is settled,

345
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,945
maybe you and Glenn can
put this behind you.

346
00:13:47,979 --> 00:13:50,681
No way! How am I supposed
to be friends with someone

347
00:13:50,715 --> 00:13:53,350
who's in love with my wife?
Quagmire is dead to me

348
00:13:53,385 --> 00:13:55,919
and needs to be dealt with
in an appropriate manner.

349
00:13:55,954 --> 00:13:57,988
Shame.

350
00:13:58,023 --> 00:13:59,757
Shame.

351
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,258
Shame.

You got to do something!

You're right.
Quagmire, wait!

You almost left
without this!

He did it.

00:16:11,292 --> 00:16:12,592
Now go to bed.

Your grandkids

399
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:21,234
I had a pretty good
egg dish last night.

400
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:24,604
What? What-what am I supposed
to do with that information?

401
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,140
Well, I don't know.
Maybe ask me for the recipe?

402
00:16:27,175 --> 00:16:29,109
Do you have it?
No.

403
00:16:29,143 --> 00:16:31,144
So what's going on
with you guys?

404
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:32,813
Nothing much.

405
00:16:32,847 --> 00:16:35,282
See, this is where Quagmire
normally would have told

406
00:16:35,316 --> 00:16:37,317
one of his
outrageous sex stories.

407
00:16:37,352 --> 00:16:40,454
Aw, we don't need him.
I got a sex story for you.

408
00:16:40,488 --> 00:16:42,322
So I'm bangin' this chick,
and she's sayin' to me,

409
00:16:42,357 --> 00:16:44,324
"I'm worried that Chris won't
get into college."

410
00:16:44,359 --> 00:16:45,959
And then I says to her,

411
00:16:45,993 --> 00:16:47,661
"Yeah, that seems
like a legitimate concern."

412
00:16:47,695 --> 00:16:50,530
And then I lost my wood,
and so we just watched Colbert,

413
00:16:50,565 --> 00:16:53,033
and then I took a dump
completely nude.

414
00:16:53,067 --> 00:16:55,235
Who else but Peter?

415
00:16:56,971 --> 00:16:59,606
Peter, face it-- without
Quagmire, we're boring.

416
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,308
Oh, come on,
that ain't true.

417
00:17:01,342 --> 00:17:03,944
Yes, it is. He had
all the fun ideas.

418
00:17:03,978 --> 00:17:06,546
Remember? He even
took me parasailing.

419
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:11,017
This is awesome!
It's like I'm flying!

420
00:17:11,052 --> 00:17:12,619
(whooping)

421
00:17:12,653 --> 00:17:15,322
I've never felt so alive!

422
00:17:15,356 --> 00:17:19,192
Oh, if only
I had a pair of legs.

423
00:17:19,227 --> 00:17:21,695
All right!

424
00:17:21,729 --> 00:17:24,331
(munching, gobbling)

425
00:17:24,365 --> 00:17:27,000
It was the fish part of me
that wanted 'em!

426
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:28,769
(munching, gobbling)

427
00:17:32,573 --> 00:17:36,643
(sighs) Look, Peter, I'm
sorry Quagmire moved away,

428
00:17:36,677 --> 00:17:39,579
but you can't just sit around
the house and drink all day.

429
00:17:39,614 --> 00:17:41,915
It's all your fault
Quagmire fell in love with you.

430
00:17:41,949 --> 00:17:44,050
Traipsin' around
in your tan pants

431
00:17:44,085 --> 00:17:46,653
and your green shirt
and your soothing voice.

432
00:17:46,687 --> 00:17:48,221
<i>My fault?!</i>

433
00:17:48,256 --> 00:17:49,990
Yeah, everything is messed up.

434
00:17:50,024 --> 00:17:52,592
I lost my best friend,
my buddies are all fighting,

435
00:17:52,627 --> 00:17:55,162
that chick at work is saying
stuff that ain't true.

436
00:17:55,196 --> 00:17:56,596
Okay, you know what?

437
00:17:56,631 --> 00:17:58,098
Enough feeling
sorry for yourself.

438
00:17:58,132 --> 00:18:00,233
We're fixing this now.
Get in the car.

439
00:18:00,268 --> 00:18:02,068
What? Why?
You'll see.

440
00:18:02,103 --> 00:18:04,070
Why should I trust you?

441
00:18:04,105 --> 00:18:06,606
You're always trickin' me into
going places I don't want to.

442
00:18:06,641 --> 00:18:10,544
Oh... you said we were going
to a place Walt Disney built.

443
00:18:10,578 --> 00:18:13,046
No, Peter. I said supported.

444
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,482

<i>don't go on the train ride.</i>

446
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,427
I've been playing
a game I invented

447
00:18:27,462 --> 00:18:30,130
called "mini racquetball"
in your garage.

448
00:18:30,164 --> 00:18:32,299
Uh-huh.
It's pretty fun.

449
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,134
He has not won
a single point.

450
00:18:34,168 --> 00:18:36,203
You don't have to win
to have fun.

451
00:18:36,237 --> 00:18:37,737
(knocking on door)

452
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,609
Lois? Peter. Zod.

453
00:18:42,643 --> 00:18:45,378
Hey. You're parked behind
my trapezoid-thing.

454
00:18:45,413 --> 00:18:47,547
Yeah, yeah,
I'll move it in a sec.

455
00:18:47,582 --> 00:18:50,383
Glenn, all this nonsense
has to stop now.

456
00:18:50,418 --> 00:18:52,619
The only reason
this became an issue is because

457
00:18:52,653 --> 00:18:54,654
Peter heard something
he wasn't supposed to hear.

458
00:18:54,689 --> 00:18:56,490
CLEVELAND: Guy from <i>Superman</i>
lives here?!

459
00:18:56,524 --> 00:18:58,725
And the truth is,
we all have private thoughts

460
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:01,728
we don't act on,
and that's okay.

461
00:19:01,762 --> 00:19:03,830
For instance, every time
I'm on the subway,

462
00:19:03,865 --> 00:19:05,999
I want to push a stranger
onto the tracks.

463
00:19:06,033 --> 00:19:07,067
And that's fine!

464
00:19:07,101 --> 00:19:08,735
I don't do it!

465
00:19:08,769 --> 00:19:10,437
I guess you're right.

466
00:19:10,471 --> 00:19:12,806
I don't <i>totally</i> disagree with
what Kim Jong-un's doing,

467
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,641
but you don't see
me moving there.

468
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:16,610
I take medicine
I get from the veterinarian.

469
00:19:16,644 --> 00:19:18,011
Is that one?

470
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:19,946
No, no, it's not,
but the point is,

471
00:19:19,981 --> 00:19:21,915
we all have secret thoughts.

472
00:19:21,949 --> 00:19:24,484
But there's no reason they
should ruin our friendships.

473
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:26,453
Sometimes I think about
going to the hospital

474
00:19:26,487 --> 00:19:27,988
and switching
the babies around.

475
00:19:28,022 --> 00:19:29,823
Somali pirates
seem cool, too.

476
00:19:29,857 --> 00:19:32,192
I wouldn't mind eating
the Phillie Phanatic.

477
00:19:32,226 --> 00:19:34,628
See? We're all
terrible people inside.

478
00:19:34,662 --> 00:19:37,030
Joe's a little worse
than the rest of us,

479
00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:40,267
but we all just shove
our thoughts deep down,

480
00:19:40,301 --> 00:19:41,835
where they can't
hurt anybody.

481
00:19:41,869 --> 00:19:44,371
Huh, maybe you're right.

482
00:19:44,405 --> 00:19:46,139
Of course I'm right.

483
00:19:46,173 --> 00:19:48,975
The secret to happiness is
burying all your true feelings

484
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,845
and living a life
of bland compromise.

485
00:19:51,879 --> 00:19:53,980
So here's the question, Glenn.

486
00:19:54,015 --> 00:19:58,051
Do you love Peter enough
to repress your love for me?

487
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:05,358
Peter, if you're willing
to forget all about this,

488
00:20:05,393 --> 00:20:08,995
I'm more than happy to continue
hiding my true feelings.

489
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,131
I do miss us
hanging out together.

490
00:20:11,165 --> 00:20:13,800
Huh. Sorry I kind of
went a little crazy.

491
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:15,902
Ah, that's all right.

492
00:20:15,937 --> 00:20:18,371
And I'm sorry
I will always love your wife.

493
00:20:18,406 --> 00:20:19,839
Which I don't.

494
00:20:19,874 --> 00:20:21,308
Thank you, Glenn.

495
00:20:21,342 --> 00:20:22,175
All right!

496
00:20:22,209 --> 00:20:23,743
What do you say
we all celebrate

497
00:20:23,778 --> 00:20:26,146
with a game
of mini racquetball?

498
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,548
Wait. Is mini racquetball
just Ping-Pong?

499
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:31,284
Kind of.

500
00:20:34,855 --> 00:20:37,557
Boy, it's good to have the gang
together again.

501
00:20:37,592 --> 00:20:39,392
Yeah, welcome
home, buddy.

502
00:20:39,427 --> 00:20:41,861
Man, I missed sitting around,
just shooting the breeze.

503
00:20:41,896 --> 00:20:43,863
Hey, so how'd you get
your house back?

504
00:20:43,898 --> 00:20:45,365
This ought to be good.

505
00:20:45,399 --> 00:20:46,833
I suspended escrow.

506
00:20:46,867 --> 00:20:48,101
Oh.

507
00:20:49,403 --> 00:20:51,864
Hey, guys, you know that egg
dish I was talking about?

508
00:20:51,963 --> 00:20:54,870
Turns out that was
just a dream I had.
