00:00:02,307 --> 00:00:05,641
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

2
00:00:05,745 --> 00:00:08,978
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

3
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:12,576
<i>But where are those
good old-fashioned values</i>

4
00:00:12,688 --> 00:00:15,681
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

5
00:00:15,792 --> 00:00:19,024
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

6
00:00:19,163 --> 00:00:22,328
<i>Lucky there's a man who
positively can do</i>

7
00:00:22,435 --> 00:00:23,902
<i>All the things that make us</i>

8
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:25,631
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

9
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:30,576
<i>He's a family guy</i>

10
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:38,821
- Happy birthday, Mom.
- Oh, thank you, everybody.

11
00:00:38,924 --> 00:00:42,884
I know it's a little self-centered,
but this is my favorite day of the year.

12
00:00:42,997 --> 00:00:45,865
Here, Mom, this is from me and Meg.

13
00:00:47,335 --> 00:00:51,865
- Topol? The smoker's tooth polish?
- Take the hint.

14
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:54,744
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

15
00:00:55,747 --> 00:00:58,012
<i>Lionel Richie's Can't Slow Down?</i>

16
00:00:58,117 --> 00:01:00,245
Great album, Lois. Great album.

17
00:01:00,353 --> 00:01:03,289
I didn't know who I was
until I heard this album.

18
00:01:05,427 --> 00:01:09,422
Oh, God, Lionel. You have been hurt.

19
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:14,061
You have been hurt by somebody,
that much is clear.

20
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:19,172
Who hurt you? Who hurt you?
Who hurt you?

21
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,145
Who hurt you? Who hurt you?

22
00:01:21,449 --> 00:01:25,251
Oh, thank you all so much.
What thoughtful gifts.

23
00:01:25,355 --> 00:01:26,617
Lois, there's one more.

24
00:01:26,723 --> 00:01:29,124
Oh, Brian, you don't have to
give me anything.

25
00:01:29,227 --> 00:01:30,661
Oh. Well, give it back, then.

26
00:01:32,564 --> 00:01:34,396
No. No, we have fun.

27
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,804
Oh, my God. Two tickets for a cruise.
Brian, this is wonderful.

28
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,002
- What the hell?
- Dick.

29
00:01:43,113 --> 00:01:45,912
Hey, hey, hey, hey. What is this?
We agreed on a $20 limit.

30
00:01:46,017 --> 00:01:47,041
We set a cap, you jerk.

31
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:51,333
Are you trying to make us look bad,
you son of a bitch?

32
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:55,000
Peter, what are you angry about?
You get to go on a cruise with me.

33
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:56,098
- What?
- What?

34
00:01:56,211 --> 00:01:59,579
Well, yeah, you didn't think Brian meant
for me to go with him, did you?

35
00:01:59,682 --> 00:02:03,210
Great. This was a bigger waste of time
than Ringo's songwriting.

36
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:06,986
- Hey, guys. I wrote a song.
- Oh, that's great.

37
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:08,651
- Good, Ringo.
- Fantastic.

38
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:11,926
You know what?
I'm gonna put it right here.

39
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:16,027
Right on the refrigerator.
That way, we'll get to see it every day.

40
00:02:16,138 --> 00:02:17,538
All right.

41
00:02:21,178 --> 00:02:23,511
Now, you kids behave yourselves
while we're away.

42
00:02:23,615 --> 00:02:27,052
Yeah, be good till we get back,
and, Brian, stay out of the cat box.

43
00:02:27,153 --> 00:02:29,019
Stay out of the cat box.

44
00:02:29,523 --> 00:02:32,618
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.

45
00:02:32,727 --> 00:02:34,491
Farewell, Brian. I'm off to sea.

46
00:02:34,597 --> 00:02:37,123
An hour from now,
I'll be surrounded by seamen.

47
00:02:37,234 --> 00:02:38,827
Sperm whales and seamen.

48
00:02:39,303 --> 00:02:40,429
A swallow.

49
00:02:40,538 --> 00:02:43,509
Stewie, Peter and Lois aren't taking you
with them. They've already boarded.

50
00:02:46,447 --> 00:02:50,384
Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.

51
00:02:50,485 --> 00:02:54,389
Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.

52
00:02:54,658 --> 00:02:58,151
No. No, you can't leave, not without me.
I'm the baby.

53
00:02:58,263 --> 00:03:00,994
<i>I haven't been this disappointed
since I saw The Lake House.</i>

54
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,869
See, the mailbox is like a time portal.

55
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,667
Everything Keanu Reeves puts in there,
Sandra Bullock gets two years later.

56
00:03:14,072 --> 00:03:15,438
What the fuck?

57
00:03:20,782 --> 00:03:22,545
Peter, what do you say
we go get some lunch?

58
00:03:22,651 --> 00:03:24,983
Not yet, Lois. I've been watching
this woman for three hours

59
00:03:25,087 --> 00:03:26,350
waiting for her to turn over.

60
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:30,325
Peter, she knows she untied her bikini.
Women don't forget those things.

61
00:03:30,428 --> 00:03:31,396
Well, will you go over there

62
00:03:31,496 --> 00:03:33,294
- and pour a cold drink on her back?
- No.

63
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:34,423
Will you go over there behind her

64
00:03:34,534 --> 00:03:36,093
- and yell, "Fire drill"?
- No.

65
00:03:36,203 --> 00:03:37,670
Will you go over there
and lift her shoulder a little,

66
00:03:37,771 --> 00:03:40,570
- so I can see her nipple?
- All right, fine.

67
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,838
What a slut.

68
00:03:47,585 --> 00:03:49,645
I'm sorry,
but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to bar you

69
00:03:49,755 --> 00:03:52,520
from the aft section of the ship
for the rest of the cruise.

70
00:03:52,626 --> 00:03:53,957
We are so sorry.

71
00:03:54,061 --> 00:03:56,086
Peter, what the hell did you think
you were doing?

72
00:03:56,197 --> 00:03:59,190
Lois, it is called the "poop deck."
That is why I pooped there.

73
00:03:59,302 --> 00:04:01,202
- You're disgusting.
- And you're misleading.

74
00:04:06,326 --> 00:04:10,287
- Boy, this is romantic, isn't it, Lois?
- Oh, it sure is, sweetie.

75
00:04:10,398 --> 00:04:13,334
<i>I feel like that fat-ass British girl
from Titanic.</i>

76
00:04:13,436 --> 00:04:15,462
<i>- What girl?
- The lead in Titanic,</i>

77
00:04:15,572 --> 00:04:17,700
the one opposite Leonardo DiCaprio.

78
00:04:17,809 --> 00:04:19,743
- Sweetheart, that was a guy.
- What?

79
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:22,040
That was a guy.
That was Philip Seymour Hoffman.

80
00:04:22,147 --> 00:04:23,809
What? No, it wasn't.

81
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:26,443
Yes, it was, honey.
It was Philip Seymour Hoffman.

82
00:04:27,655 --> 00:04:29,487
Look at you out here, on a big trip.

83
00:04:33,998 --> 00:04:35,022
- What are you doing?
- I'll teach that hussy

84
00:04:35,132 --> 00:04:36,122
to go on a boat ride without me.

85
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:40,030
When she returns,
I'm going to put bamboo splinters

86
00:04:40,135 --> 00:04:41,398
under all her fingernails.

87
00:04:41,504 --> 00:04:43,529
Then I'm gonna strip her down
and tie her to the bed.

88
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,268
- Okay.
- Then I'm gonna make her crawl

89
00:04:45,376 --> 00:04:49,007
on her hands and knees while I drip
hot candle wax all over her back.

90
00:04:49,115 --> 00:04:51,413
- And then what are you gonna do?
- Let's see...

91
00:04:51,517 --> 00:04:53,782
Are you gonna shower her off
after all that candle wax?

92
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:57,188
- No, I'm gonna keep her filthy.
- Yeah, she's been a bad girl.

93
00:04:57,293 --> 00:04:59,489
And then I'm gonna gag her
with her own underwear.

94
00:05:00,964 --> 00:05:02,489
- What?
- No, no, nothing, nothing.

95
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,594
That's all part of your diabolical plan
to humiliate her.

96
00:05:06,705 --> 00:05:08,367
Yes, yes, she'll be humiliated.

97
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,943
Maybe you'll handcuff her?
She'll hate that.

98
00:05:10,044 --> 00:05:12,103
- Then I shall do that as well.
- And call her a bitch.

99
00:05:12,213 --> 00:05:13,476
Until I'm hoarse with rage.

100
00:05:13,582 --> 00:05:16,746
Maybe smack her ass with a riding crop
and watch her go to town on herself?

101
00:05:16,853 --> 00:05:17,843
Yes, and then... What?

102
00:05:17,955 --> 00:05:20,652
No, I mean, that would like...
That would show her.

103
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,659
What the hell does the second part
have to do with that?

104
00:05:22,761 --> 00:05:25,732
No, man, it's your thing. I mean,
I don't care if one hand is on her boob

105
00:05:25,832 --> 00:05:29,701
and the other hand is down there.
It's your... It's your project.

106
00:05:29,804 --> 00:05:33,799
Are you... You're getting some kind
of sick, sexual thrill off this, aren't you?

107
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,775
Who cares?
You're not gonna kill her anyway.

108
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:38,542
You're gonna bitch and moan, and then
you're gonna do what you always do.

109
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:41,381
The minute Lois walks through that door,
you're gonna forget all about it,

110
00:05:41,487 --> 00:05:43,478
beg for your apple juice,
go poop and fall asleep.

111
00:05:45,462 --> 00:05:46,657
God, he's right.

112
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:49,529
I've got the same daily routine
as Dick Clark.

113
00:05:49,635 --> 00:05:53,367
Rupert, I've been all talk.
So much time wasted.

114
00:05:53,473 --> 00:05:56,136
Well, no longer. Lois is a dead woman.

115
00:05:56,243 --> 00:05:59,111
I'll do to her
what douche bags did to the guitar.

116
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:04,581
<i>This is a song I wrote last summer.
It's called Water.</i>

117
00:06:07,058 --> 00:06:10,928
<i>My hair is growing</i>

118
00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:14,559
<i>Growing all the time</i>

119
00:06:15,904 --> 00:06:18,999
<i>Look how sensitive I am</i>

120
00:06:19,109 --> 00:06:23,980
<i>'Cause my voice is so fine</i>

121
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:30,390
<i>Every beer I've ever had
is on a shelf above my bed</i>

122
00:06:33,228 --> 00:06:38,327
<i>And sometimes, I put my speakers
facing out my window</i>

123
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:52,076
Peter, stop picking your teeth.
We're at the Captain's table.

124
00:06:52,188 --> 00:06:55,681
And that was the first time
I saw the northern lights at their peak.

125
00:06:55,793 --> 00:07:00,630
And as I gazed,
astonished at their lustrous brilliance,

126
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:03,396
I turned to my first mate and I said,

127
00:07:03,503 --> 00:07:07,440
"We are looking
into the very eyes of God."

128
00:07:08,077 --> 00:07:09,567
- What a wonderful story.
- All right, I got one for you.

129
00:07:11,205 --> 00:07:14,073
So, me and Lois are driving up to Vermont
to get this abortion...

130
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,838
- Peter!
- Hang on, hang on, Lois. Don't ruin it.

131
00:07:16,946 --> 00:07:18,812
All right.
So, we're driving up to get this abortion,

132
00:07:18,915 --> 00:07:22,852
and we get to the abortion clinic,
and the abortionist has one hand.

133
00:07:22,954 --> 00:07:26,392
The abortionist has one hand.
Missing hand on the abortionist.

134
00:07:26,493 --> 00:07:27,755
And we're there to get an abortion.

135
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:30,490
- Peter, for God's...
- I'll tell it. I'll tell it.

136
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:34,058
So I turned to Lois and I says,
"You want to get an abortion here?

137
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:37,334
"You want to get an abortion with
the abortionist having a stump hand?"

138
00:07:37,441 --> 00:07:38,874
And she says, " An abortion here?

139
00:07:38,976 --> 00:07:40,968
"Are you kidding me?
The abortionist's got one hand.

140
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,274
"How do you abort with one hand?"

141
00:07:42,381 --> 00:07:45,351
And I says, " That's what I just said.
The abortionist has one hand.

142
00:07:45,452 --> 00:07:47,216
"We can't get an abortion here."

143
00:07:47,321 --> 00:07:49,813
So we turned around and went home
and two-and-a-half months later,

144
00:07:49,925 --> 00:07:51,290
our daughter, Meg, was born.

145
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:59,262
Okay, explain to me
exactly what I did wrong.

146
00:07:59,371 --> 00:08:02,239
Peter, that story
was completely inappropriate.

147
00:08:02,341 --> 00:08:04,207
Well, send me the crap to hell

148
00:08:04,311 --> 00:08:06,780
for being nostalgic
about the early years of our marriage.

149
00:08:06,881 --> 00:08:08,975
You've totally ruined this trip for me.

150
00:08:09,084 --> 00:08:11,849
I am mortified to even show my face
around this ship.

151
00:08:11,955 --> 00:08:13,617
Hey, the Captain's the one
who should be embarrassed.

152
00:08:13,724 --> 00:08:17,525
- His story was gay.
- You're gay.

153
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:20,827
Pleasuring a man with a socked foot,
one time, does not make a person gay.

154
00:08:47,424 --> 00:08:49,153
Hello, Mother.

155
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:53,391
Stewie? What the hell are you...
How did you get here?

156
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:57,231
Oh, there's a very simple answer to that.
You drove me here, Lois.

157
00:08:57,337 --> 00:09:00,273
With all the indignities I've been forced
to suffer day in and day out

158
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,468
under your matriarchal tyranny.

159
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:05,639
What are you...
What are you doing with a gun?

160
00:09:05,749 --> 00:09:09,151
Something I should've done
a very long time ago.

161
00:09:41,732 --> 00:09:44,702
I did it! I killed her! She's dead!

162
00:09:49,643 --> 00:09:54,048
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!
Oh, yeah, that's right.

163
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,583
<i>And finally, still no word
on the disappearance of Lois Griffin,</i>

165

<i>who vanished from a cruise ship
six days ago.</i>

166
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,501
<i>Well, folks, that's the news,
and I am out of here.</i>

167
00:10:11,907 --> 00:10:15,901
Daddy, she's been missing so long.
Do you think they'll ever find her?

168
00:10:16,046 --> 00:10:19,711
- God, I hope so, Meg.
- Oh, yes, I'm sure they'll find her.

169
00:10:19,818 --> 00:10:22,913
<i>This is fantastic.
Nobody suspects a thing.</i>

170
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,150
<i>Listen to my voice. That sounds cool.</i>

171
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:27,194
<i>Hello.</i>

172
00:10:27,329 --> 00:10:31,892
<i>Pigs in Space.</i>

173
00:10:33,403 --> 00:10:36,931
Hi, Peter. Can I talk to you in the kitchen
for a second?

174
00:10:37,977 --> 00:10:40,344
What is it, Joe?
Please tell me Lois is alive.

175
00:10:41,548 --> 00:10:46,249
It's been six days, Peter.
I'm sorry, but we had to call off the search.

176
00:10:46,388 --> 00:10:48,983
I'm afraid you're just gonna have
to accept the fact that...

177
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:50,927
She's gone.

178
00:10:51,061 --> 00:10:54,190
No!

179
00:11:02,343 --> 00:11:03,572
<i>We now return to</i>

180

Harrison Ford Telling Random People
He Wants His Family Back.

181
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,011
<i>- I want my family back.
- Okay.</i>

182
00:11:10,121 --> 00:11:12,852
<i>- Give me back my family.
- Get off me.</i>

183
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,824
<i>I want my family back.</i>

184
00:11:16,624 --> 00:11:18,751
- Hey, where've you been?
- I had another date.

185
00:11:18,859 --> 00:11:21,420
You know, I'm glad
you're finally putting yourself out there.

186
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:25,093
- Lois would've wanted you to move on.
- Yeah, only this one was kind of awkward.

187
00:11:25,402 --> 00:11:28,236
So, I'm a Leo and your ad said
that you're a Cancer?

188
00:11:28,373 --> 00:11:30,638
No, actually, it said I have cancer.

189
00:11:30,743 --> 00:11:34,407
Not cancer of the vagina, is it?
Here, have some more wine.

190
00:11:34,614 --> 00:11:35,673
Then, there was that date I had
with that stick figure.

191
00:11:37,635 --> 00:11:41,538
So, how would this work in bed?

192
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,305
Well, I can't do sex,
but I can give you a stick job.

193
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:49,009
- That... That sounds...
- Yes, it is very unpleasant.

194
00:11:49,284 --> 00:11:51,549
But the freakiest
was that date I had with Bonnie.

195
00:11:52,055 --> 00:11:55,253
Peter, you don't know
how badly I need this.

196
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:57,692
I don't know, Bonnie.
It's just a little weird.

197
00:11:57,796 --> 00:11:58,889
Joe's a friend of mine.

198
00:11:58,998 --> 00:12:01,729
No, it's okay.
I promise you, it's okay.

199
00:12:01,835 --> 00:12:04,100
I'm not sure.

200
00:12:04,205 --> 00:12:05,695
It's okay, Peter.

201
00:12:06,107 --> 00:12:08,976
Just remember, whatever you do,
don't tell Chris I'm dating.

202
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:12,481
Peter, Lois has been dead for a whole year.
You're gonna have to tell him sometime.

203
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:18,052
Hi, Dad. Did we get any mail from Mom
at the health spa today?

204
00:12:18,158 --> 00:12:19,216
Nope. Sorry, Chris.

205
00:12:19,326 --> 00:12:21,851
She said she's going straight from the spa
right back to Europe.

206
00:12:21,963 --> 00:12:25,297
But I haven't seen Mom since she took me
back-to-school shopping.

207
00:12:25,635 --> 00:12:28,298
All right, sweetie,
you ready to get some new notebooks,

208
00:12:28,405 --> 00:12:30,203
and protractors and slacks?

209
00:12:30,308 --> 00:12:33,107
- I want blue jeans.
- You're getting slacks!

210
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,347
Here you go, Stewie. Finish your oatmeal,

211
00:12:38,453 --> 00:12:41,184
and then I'll get you ready
for our Mommy and Me class.

212
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:44,419
You know, Meg has really flourished
since Lois was murdered.

213
00:12:44,527 --> 00:12:47,053
What are you talking about?
Lois' death was an accident.

214
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:50,032
Which is just what someone
who pulled off the perfect murder

215
00:12:50,135 --> 00:12:51,467
would want you to think.

216
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:54,837
What the hell are you... Stewie, did you...

217
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:56,974
Did you kill Lois?

218
00:12:57,078 --> 00:13:00,640
Of course, I didn't, Brian.
Remember what you said?

219
00:13:00,749 --> 00:13:04,744
I'm all talk.
I wouldn't possibly go through with it.

220
00:13:04,856 --> 00:13:10,421
- I'll just poop and fall asleep.
- My God, you did it. You actually did it.

221
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:11,622
Oh, God.
I've really screwed myself up here.

222
00:13:11,732 --> 00:13:12,790
Listen, could you reach into my pocket

223
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,924
and get the number
for that acupuncturist?

224
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,761
You son of a bitch. You killed Lois!

225
00:13:17,867 --> 00:13:20,428
Good luck proving that, Brian.
No, seriously, that number...

226
00:13:20,537 --> 00:13:22,836
Well, I'm gonna expose you
for what you are.

227
00:13:22,941 --> 00:13:26,139
No matter what it takes,
you are gonna pay for this.

228
00:13:26,245 --> 00:13:29,113
You know, it's funny. From this position,
I can hear Meg up in her room.

229
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:32,712
I'm gonna pretend
you're the New York Knicks.

230
00:13:36,848 --> 00:13:39,477
Hey, put your wallets away, guys.
The drinks are on me.

231
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:42,282
Well, that's awful nice, Peter.
What's the occasion?

232
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:44,517
Lois' life insurance policy paid off.

233
00:13:44,626 --> 00:13:46,720
I've got more money
than Barbra Streisand.

234
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:49,121
Honey, I'm going shopping.

235
00:13:52,003 --> 00:13:54,063
And I was gonna valet park.

236
00:13:54,807 --> 00:13:57,743
I didn't know that you had life insurance
on Lois.

237
00:13:57,844 --> 00:14:01,212
- Did you get that right before the cruise?
- Actually, I got it on the cruise.

238
00:14:01,315 --> 00:14:03,750
Right after we had that big fight
when I said, "I wish you were dead,"

239
00:14:03,852 --> 00:14:05,753
right before I never saw her again.

240
00:14:05,855 --> 00:14:08,222
Well, see you guys later.
I got to go buy hot dogs.

241
00:14:08,325 --> 00:14:10,817
We keep running out for some reason.

242
00:14:11,262 --> 00:14:13,925
Either of you guys think
it's a little suspicious

243
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:18,972
that Peter took out a life insurance policy
on Lois right before she went missing?

244
00:14:19,073 --> 00:14:22,237
- You don't think...
- That fat bastard murdered her, didn't he?

245
00:14:22,378 --> 00:14:26,475
That son of a bitch.
He's a killer, like Bernie Goetz.

246
00:14:26,584 --> 00:14:28,780
You know, the subway vigilante
from the '80s?

247
00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:31,413
I used to do a bit about him back
when I was doing stand up.

248
00:14:31,691 --> 00:14:35,424
<i>What else is in the news? Oh, oh, oh,
Bernie Goetz, you hear about this?</i>

249
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:39,160
<i>This guy Bernie Goetz shot
a bunch of muggers on the subway.</i>

250
00:14:39,268 --> 00:14:43,069
<i>Wouldn't mind having him with me
next time I go see my mother-in-law.</i>

251
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,335
<i>No, but really,
New York City's a great place to live,</i>

252
00:14:45,443 --> 00:14:46,968
<i>if you're a cockroach.</i>

253
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:48,707
<i>- You suck!
- I know.</i>

254
00:14:52,686 --> 00:14:56,179
Hey, Stewie, I found this receipt for
a speedboat rental upstairs in your room.

255
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:59,490
It's dated about a year ago.
Any idea how it got there?

256
00:14:59,596 --> 00:15:01,656
Someone who rented a speedboat
must've left it there.

257
00:15:01,766 --> 00:15:02,755
Uh-huh.

258
00:15:02,867 --> 00:15:04,164
Well, you can play innocent all you want.

259
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,670
I am gonna find the evidence
to put you away,

260
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,900
starting by proving
that you were on that cruise ship

261
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:10,136
the night Lois disappeared.

262
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:12,713
No, I wasn't.
I was at the carnival with Rupert.

263
00:15:12,814 --> 00:15:13,803
The carnival with Rupert.

264
00:15:16,193 --> 00:15:20,256
We won! We won! Do it again.
Now I want a pink one.

265
00:15:20,366 --> 00:15:22,767
Stewie, we've been playing
for half an hour.

266
00:15:22,869 --> 00:15:25,133
Oh, okay. You want to go ride
the tea bags? Tea cups?

267
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:26,331
Tea bags?

268
00:15:50,013 --> 00:15:51,447
I was hoping to keep
these mementos, Rupert,

269
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:54,383
but I can't risk it,
with the dog sniffing around for evidence.

270
00:16:02,531 --> 00:16:05,330
Damn! What the hell are they doing here?

271
00:16:05,435 --> 00:16:07,097
What are we looking for, Joe?

272
00:16:07,204 --> 00:16:09,297
Well, the trail is pretty cold by now,

273
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:13,174
but if Peter did kill Lois,
we might find some clues in his garbage.

274
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,613
Man, I haven't dug through these cans
since Lois died.

275
00:16:16,717 --> 00:16:19,949
Can't believe it's been 12 months
since I've deliberately choked myself

276
00:16:20,054 --> 00:16:22,854
by stuffing her discarded makeup sponges
down my throat.

277
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,790
What's wrong with you?

278
00:16:26,197 --> 00:16:27,528
Oh, my God.

279
00:16:29,434 --> 00:16:32,131
That does look like Peter's handwriting.

280
00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:37,269
There's no doubt anymore.
Peter murdered his wife.

281
00:16:39,882 --> 00:16:42,909
This is fantastic!
I'm completely off the hook.

282
00:16:44,122 --> 00:16:45,180
What the hell?

283
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:48,351
Hey, little man.
Tell Chris to open his window?

284
00:16:51,264 --> 00:16:57,069
<i>Just around the corner
There's a rainbow in the sky</i>

285
00:16:57,173 --> 00:17:04,104
<i>So let's have another cup o' coffee
And let's have another piece o'pie!</i>

286
00:17:10,491 --> 00:17:12,288
Joe, what the hell is going on?

287
00:17:12,393 --> 00:17:15,990
You're a suspect in Lois' murder,
that's what's going on.

288
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:19,797
Don't make us go good cop,
developmentally disabled cop on you.

289
00:17:19,904 --> 00:17:26,073
We know that you killed Lois.

290
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:29,810
Hello?

291
00:17:33,422 --> 00:17:34,447
No.

292
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:40,289
We can put you at the scene

293
00:17:40,399 --> 00:17:44,064
where she was killed.

294
00:17:44,171 --> 00:17:46,868
Hobey's right, Peter.
It doesn't look good for you.

295
00:17:46,975 --> 00:17:48,602
Joe, you got this all wrong.

296
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,043
Like God did,
when he made Rosie O'Donnell.

297
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:56,252
- You can't put a vagina on this man.
- Why not? I'm God.

298
00:17:56,354 --> 00:17:58,983
Well, what do you want to do
about the breasts?

299
00:17:59,091 --> 00:18:02,551
Take a couple out of the bin
we can't find matches for.

300
00:18:07,737 --> 00:18:11,265
I... I can't believe Dad killed Mom.

301
00:18:13,211 --> 00:18:16,613
Look, there he is. Dad, how could you?

302
00:18:16,749 --> 00:18:19,947
Hey, Dad, if they put you in jail,
can we go in your room?

303
00:18:20,054 --> 00:18:23,457
Look, don't you kids buy any of this
for a second. Your father is innocent.

304
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:24,787
Oh, he killed her.

305
00:18:24,894 --> 00:18:27,989
Just like the telephone killed
the telegraph sex business.

306
00:18:28,365 --> 00:18:30,800
Hey, baby. I bet you're hot. Stop.

307
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:34,499
Describe to me what you're doing
to yourself right now. Stop.

308
00:18:35,141 --> 00:18:40,046
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, nasty!

309
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,078
This trial is called to order.

310
00:18:43,186 --> 00:18:46,122
Defense counsel,
we will hear your opening statement.

311
00:18:46,223 --> 00:18:51,185
Hey, everybody. Today's the big day.
That's all, Your Honor.

312
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,367
- Good. Good.
- Prosecutor, call your first witness.

313
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,530
Peter called me right after
he killed my daughter

314
00:18:57,639 --> 00:19:01,542
- to tell me he killed my daughter.
- Really? Well, that is interesting.

315
00:19:01,644 --> 00:19:03,078
Yes, and as a favor to the court,

316
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,446
I've produced this simulation
of how the killing transpired.

317
00:19:06,551 --> 00:19:10,215
I play Peter, and I hired an Asian hooker
to play my daughter.

318
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:14,189
<i>Lois, I'm fat and I'm stupid,
and I fart at times</i>

319
00:19:14,295 --> 00:19:16,321
<i>that ruin my father-in-law's
social occasions,</i>

320
00:19:16,432 --> 00:19:20,130
<i>- and that's why I'm never invited to them.
- You pay me now?</i>

321
00:19:23,639 --> 00:19:26,803
That's how it happened.
And that Lois was no saint, either.

322
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:30,278
Said she'd give me an over-under
for 60 bucks. Got gipped.

323
00:19:32,084 --> 00:19:34,349
Chris, have you ever seen your father
do anything bad?

324
00:19:36,363 --> 00:19:37,524
Well, now that you mention it...

325
00:19:44,742 --> 00:19:46,334
Hey, Meg. Proud of you.

326
00:19:48,082 --> 00:19:51,143
Has your father ever killed anyone
that you know of?

327
00:19:51,253 --> 00:19:54,280
Well, once by accident
when he was in the military.

328
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,288
All right. You all know your orders.

329
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,122
When you see the Taliban
come over the horizon,

330
00:19:58,229 --> 00:19:59,560
you open fire immediately.

331
00:19:59,664 --> 00:20:02,361
Okay, so when I see Pat Tillman
come over the horizon, I shoot him.

332
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:05,233
No, no, no. When you see the enemy
come over the horizon,

333
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:06,670
- you shoot the enemy.
- Okay.

334
00:20:06,774 --> 00:20:07,969
Good, now repeat it back to me.

335
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:10,135
Okay, I shoot Pat Tillman,
then run over the horizon.

336
00:20:10,245 --> 00:20:12,714
No. He's on our side!
You charge the enemy...

337
00:20:12,815 --> 00:20:15,614
- Right, and shoot Pat Tillman.
- No, no, no, no!

338
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:18,211
Well, you know what? You're gonna
have to explain it to me again,

339
00:20:18,323 --> 00:20:20,224
'cause it sounds to me
like I'm repeating back to you

340
00:20:20,326 --> 00:20:21,658
exactly what you're telling me,

341
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,229
and obviously,
you're hearing something different,

342
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,492
so just one more time.

343
00:20:25,633 --> 00:20:28,934
Okay, when you see the Taliban
come over the horizon, you shoot them.

344
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,634
All right, so I shoot Pat Tillman,
and then run when the Taliban show up.

345
00:20:31,742 --> 00:20:34,712
No, you shoot the Taliban!
Not Pat Tillman. Got it?

346
00:20:34,813 --> 00:20:35,802
- Got it.
- You sure?

347
00:20:35,914 --> 00:20:37,542
- Yep.
- All right.

348
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,242
Hey, you know
where I can find Pat Tillman?

349
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:44,290
- Mr. Griffin, do you deny killing your wife?
- Of course I deny it. I loved my wife.

350
00:20:44,426 --> 00:20:45,985
And I certainly think
I'd remember killing her.

351
00:20:46,095 --> 00:20:47,324
Mr. Griffin, do you drink?

352
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:49,825
I plead the fifth of Jack.

353
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:53,002
No, no, I'm joking. Yes, I drink.

354
00:20:53,102 --> 00:20:56,197
- And have you ever struck your wife?
- Only in front of the kids

355
00:20:56,307 --> 00:20:58,674
to assert my status
as dominant male of the pride.

356
00:20:58,777 --> 00:21:01,872
- Are you a violent man?
- What are you, a wise guy?

357
00:21:01,981 --> 00:21:04,280
'Cause I know how to deal with wise guys.

358
00:21:04,384 --> 00:21:07,081
- No further questions.
- You son of a bitch.

359
00:21:07,188 --> 00:21:09,521
If I had a gun on a boat, I'd shoot you.

360
00:21:12,996 --> 00:21:14,897
Mr. Foreman, how say you?

361
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:18,937
We find Peter Griffin guilty of murder
in the first degree.

362
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:20,562
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

363
00:21:20,673 --> 00:21:21,766
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

364
00:21:21,876 --> 00:21:24,038
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

365
00:21:30,009 --> 00:21:34,208
Okay, can I ask everyone to please stop
saying "oh, no" in this courtroom?

366
00:21:34,315 --> 00:21:38,082
'Cause the fucking Kool-Aid guy's
gonna keep showing up. Thank you.

367
00:21:38,187 --> 00:21:40,554
Mr. Griffin, I hereby sentence you
to life imprisonment

368
00:21:40,657 --> 00:21:41,646
with no possibility of...

369
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:06,791
Lois. You're alive.

370
00:22:06,894 --> 00:22:09,489
- Mom, you're alive!
- Oh, my gosh. Mom!

371
00:22:09,597 --> 00:22:12,089
Lois, my God, what happened?
We thought you were dead.

372
00:22:12,201 --> 00:22:14,762
Mom, we thought Dad killed you.

373
00:22:14,871 --> 00:22:18,969
No, he didn't, Chris, but someone tried to.

374
00:22:19,078 --> 00:22:24,074
- Do you remember who it was?
- Yes, I do. It was Stewie.
