﻿1
00:00:04,812 --> 00:00:06,783
Hey guys, can I share
something with you?

2
00:00:06,808 --> 00:00:08,040
Sure.
Yeah. Go ahead.

3
00:00:08,065 --> 00:00:11,206
Well, you know how I don't ever
brag about my sexual exploits.

4
00:00:11,231 --> 00:00:13,071
That would be an
accurate statement, yes.

5
00:00:13,072 --> 00:00:16,542
Well, last night,
Bonnie and I got really kinky.

6
00:00:16,576 --> 00:00:17,709
She painted my toenails.

7
00:00:17,744 --> 00:00:18,610
(giggles)

8
00:00:18,645 --> 00:00:20,546
Wha...?
You serious?

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,281
Check it out.

10
00:00:24,117 --> 00:00:25,751
What the hell is that?!

11
00:00:25,785 --> 00:00:26,818
Nail polish.

12
00:00:26,853 --> 00:00:27,886
No. The foot.

13
00:00:27,921 --> 00:00:30,389
It's a child's foot, Joe.

14
00:00:30,423 --> 00:00:32,724
Wha... I-I don't... you-you were
crippled when you were an adult.

15
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:33,825
How the hell did...?
Yeah.

16
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,627
A few months back,
I got really drunk

17
00:00:35,662 --> 00:00:37,763
and was playing around
with an elastic band.

18
00:00:37,797 --> 00:00:40,399
I wrapped it around my thigh
and forgot about it

19
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:43,535
for a week or two and uh, yeah,
so, that's my left foot now.

20
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:44,603
(sighs)

21
00:00:44,637 --> 00:00:46,038
I mean,
it still works the same.

22
00:00:46,072 --> 00:00:47,139
Oh, yeah, sure.

23
00:00:47,173 --> 00:00:48,807
Still a foot, I guess.

24
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:50,075
CLEVELAND:
Whassup?

25
00:00:50,109 --> 00:00:51,276
( <i>The Cleveland Show</i> theme
stinger plays)

26
00:00:51,311 --> 00:00:52,811
Oh, hey, Cleveland.
Hi.

27
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:54,246
Wait, don't you have
a show to do?

28
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,181
(laughs):
Oh... That's right.

29
00:00:56,216 --> 00:00:58,317
All right.
I knew this was coming.

30
00:00:58,351 --> 00:01:00,052
Everybody give me
your best shot.

31
00:01:00,086 --> 00:01:01,620
Oh, my God.
Where do I even begin?

32
00:01:01,654 --> 00:01:03,255
You know,
it's not a good sign

33
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:04,389
that this is
the first time

34
00:01:04,424 --> 00:01:05,424
a lot of people
are realizing

35
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:06,258
you <i>had</i> a show.

36
00:01:06,292 --> 00:01:07,726
Your logo was stupid.

37
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,127
It looked like
a big, purple penis

38
00:01:09,162 --> 00:01:10,395
and your ratings blew.

39
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,065
We did about the same
as <i>Bob's Burgers.</i>

40
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:14,132
That's your bar!?

41
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:15,334
Oh, shame on you!

42
00:01:15,368 --> 00:01:17,569
This is good.
This is constructive.

43
00:01:17,604 --> 00:01:19,238
The talking bear
was so bad,

44
00:01:19,272 --> 00:01:21,807
Seth MacFarlane quit voicing him
after season two.

45
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:24,042
It's hard to make
a talking bear funny.

46
00:01:24,077 --> 00:01:26,912
(laughing): It worked out
okay in movie form.

47
00:01:26,946 --> 00:01:28,947
What was supposed to be
the show's audience?

48
00:01:28,982 --> 00:01:29,948
Who did you make it for?

49
00:01:29,983 --> 00:01:31,016
Like, some black guy

50
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,684
who's never met
another black guy?

51
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:34,486
Anything else?
Yeah.

52
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,522
Here's four seasons worth of
DVDs of what we've been up to.

You know, just so you're
back up the speed.

It'll be nice
having Cleveland

82
00:02:51,898 --> 00:02:53,031
back across
the street.

83
00:02:53,066 --> 00:02:54,232
Why?

84
00:02:54,267 --> 00:02:56,301
I think a lot of times
you only say things

85
00:02:56,336 --> 00:02:57,703
because they make
you sound good.

86
00:02:57,737 --> 00:02:59,237
You know, Cleveland,
it must be weird

87
00:02:59,272 --> 00:03:01,873
for you guys to move and
not 'cause of a hurricane.

88
00:03:01,908 --> 00:03:04,409
Oh, Lois, I'm so
glad to see

89

Peter and Cleveland
back together again.

00:03:06,346 --> 00:03:07,746
Yeah, me too.

91
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,214
Now Peter will have
something to do

92
00:03:09,248 --> 00:03:10,415
besides flushing
the toilet

93
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,017

Hey, where do you
want me to put

129
00:04:25,825 --> 00:04:27,125
all these giraffe
figurines?

130
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160

Right about here?

134
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:35,000
Maybe a
little higher.

00:04:35,034 --> 00:04:36,535
Oh, like, uh,
up here?

136
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:38,069
I think
maybe higher.

You don't want
it too high, now.

Let's get you a
different job, Joe.

139
00:04:41,908 --> 00:04:43,108
Are you sure?

140
00:04:43,142 --> 00:04:45,243
'Cause I already hung
all these paintings.

142
00:04:51,484 --> 00:04:53,118
Hey, Cleveland,
what's that?

143
00:04:53,152 --> 00:04:54,953
Oh, this is
my bead door.

144
00:04:54,987 --> 00:04:56,021
It looks stupid.

145
00:04:56,055 --> 00:04:57,789
Why don't you walk
through it?

146
00:05:01,027 --> 00:05:02,194
How do you feel?

147
00:05:02,228 --> 00:05:03,595
Awesome!

148
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:05,831
Like a suitcase
comin' out of the airport.

149
00:05:05,865 --> 00:05:07,232
Yeah, or
like a bug

walkin' through
Stevie Wonder's hair.

151
00:05:14,006 --> 00:05:17,175
Turns out this old house is
lacking in storage space,

152
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,377
so I gotta make some
tough decisions.

153
00:05:19,412 --> 00:05:20,846
You gonna keep
these neckties?

154
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,347
Yeah, throw 'em
in my car.

155
00:05:22,381 --> 00:05:23,782
They're just to keep
my trunk closed

156
00:05:23,816 --> 00:05:25,550
what if I'm ever
haulin' garbage.

157
00:05:25,585 --> 00:05:26,718
I ain't no lawyer.

158
00:05:26,752 --> 00:05:28,620
I use whatever
for my purposes.

159
00:05:28,654 --> 00:05:30,088
Could be a box spring.

160
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:31,490
Could be a
old radio.

161
00:05:31,524 --> 00:05:33,258
Could be a more
recent radio...

162
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:34,426
Wait, now
I'm confused.

163
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,261
So... so some of this
stuff isn't trash?

164
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:37,829
Like this
old computer monitor?

165
00:05:37,864 --> 00:05:39,164
Nah, that's a
sittin' chair,

166
00:05:39,198 --> 00:05:40,365
what for children.

167
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,867
How about this telephone cord?

168
00:05:41,901 --> 00:05:43,201
That's a pet leash.

169
00:05:43,236 --> 00:05:45,704
If the good Lord decideth
we should have one.

170
00:05:45,738 --> 00:05:47,239
I'm gonna go
ahead and ditch

171
00:05:47,273 --> 00:05:49,341
these promotional
McDonald's cups from the 80's.

172
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,109
Nah, that's all
we drink from.

173
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:52,677
That's the Riddler
right there.

174
00:05:52,712 --> 00:05:55,647
He would make inquiries
to set your mind a-jumble.

175
00:05:55,681 --> 00:05:58,049
How do you live in a
house with all this junk?

176
00:05:58,084 --> 00:06:00,018
I'd rather stay in a
house with small kids.

177
00:06:00,052 --> 00:06:02,254
So you can sleep
on the couch.

178
00:06:02,288 --> 00:06:04,222
Uh, please take
the potty seat off the toilet,

179
00:06:04,257 --> 00:06:05,557
don't try to
pee through it.

180
00:06:05,591 --> 00:06:07,259
There's juice boxes
in the fridge

181
00:06:07,293 --> 00:06:09,728
and if you get hungry,
there's plenty of Goldfish in the couch.

182
00:06:09,762 --> 00:06:12,731
Um, feel free to watch
TV with the sound off.

183
00:06:12,765 --> 00:06:14,399
And the kids
will be down here

184
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:16,968
first thing in the morning
to antagonize the dogs.

185
00:06:17,003 --> 00:06:19,004
Oh, and everyone
here has pinkeye.

186
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,012
"...And that was the moment
I stopped being Dwayne Johnson

187
00:06:27,046 --> 00:06:29,381
and started being The Rock."

188
00:06:29,415 --> 00:06:31,116
That's a good place
to leave off.

189
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,617
Hey, I just realized.

190
00:06:32,652 --> 00:06:33,618
We're The Rock!

191
00:06:33,653 --> 00:06:34,653
What do you mean?

192
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:35,987
Together, you and I

193
00:06:36,022 --> 00:06:38,390
make one biracial
wrestler.

194
00:06:38,424 --> 00:06:40,158
(gasps) Do you have any
folding chairs?

195
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:41,293
No.

196
00:06:41,327 --> 00:06:42,327
That's all right.
I'll use this.

197
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:43,628
Folding chair!

198
00:06:43,663 --> 00:06:44,596
Ow!

199
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,664
DONN
What was that?!

200
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:46,798
(gasps)

201
00:06:46,832 --> 00:06:48,567
That was my
great-grandma's vase!

202
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:50,335
On the drive up
from Virginia,

203
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:52,070
she kept that vase
'tween her legs.

204
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:54,506
W-What are you doing?!

205
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,641
Making sure you
learn your lesson.

206
00:06:56,676 --> 00:06:58,376
Ow! It hurts!

207
00:06:58,411 --> 00:06:59,578
It hurts!

208
00:06:59,612 --> 00:07:01,513
I can't believe Japanese men

209
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:03,248
pay good money for this.

210
00:07:03,282 --> 00:07:06,051
At work, I am
important businessman.

211
00:07:06,085 --> 00:07:09,688
Here, I am bad boy!

212
00:07:14,492 --> 00:07:15,826
TV ANNOUNCER:
We now return to

213
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,461
<i>The Gay Bachelor.</i>

214
00:07:17,495 --> 00:07:19,196
Ew, they're
all gross!

215
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,898
I'm keeping
the roses.

216
00:07:20,932 --> 00:07:23,534
Mom!
Mrs. Brown spanked me!

217
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:24,668
What?!

218
00:07:24,702 --> 00:07:26,970
And you still haven't
pulled up your pants?

219
00:07:27,005 --> 00:07:28,105
Chris, what
happened?

220
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,441
I was playing with Rallo
and I broke a vase

221
00:07:30,475 --> 00:07:32,342
and then she gave me
a spanking!

222
00:07:32,377 --> 00:07:35,045
Uh, I believe the term
is "whuppin'", Chris.

223
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,780
God, look at the size
of that handprint.

224
00:07:36,815 --> 00:07:38,315
It's like Doctor J.

225
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:39,750
Peter, this
is serious!

226
00:07:39,784 --> 00:07:41,285
A woman hit
our child!

227
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,953
What is wrong
with her?

228
00:07:42,987 --> 00:07:45,255
Whoa, can I get
some white bread

229
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,623
on that judgmental
sandwich?

230
00:07:46,658 --> 00:07:48,525
Brian, why are you
bringing race into this?

231
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,993
Lois, I've
spent my life

232
00:07:50,028 --> 00:07:51,895
trying to keep
race out of things.

233
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,630
That's why whenever
I walk into Lids,

234
00:07:53,665 --> 00:07:54,965
every guy
fist-bumps me.

235
00:07:54,999 --> 00:07:56,667
Oh, you're
full of crap, Brian.

236
00:07:56,701 --> 00:07:58,335
I'm just saying,
Lois, some of us

237
00:07:58,369 --> 00:07:59,903
go through life
without seeing color.

238
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,972
That's because you're
color blind, Brian.

239
00:08:02,006 --> 00:08:02,973
You're right.

240
00:08:03,007 --> 00:08:04,408
I am color blind.

241
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,542
Here...

242
00:08:05,577 --> 00:08:06,743
and here.

243
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,812
Hey, remember when you
swallowed that rib-eye bone

244
00:08:08,847 --> 00:08:10,080
and you couldn't
poop it out?

245
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,381
And then you
pushed real hard

246
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,250
and the poo came through
the rib eye hole?

247
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,986
Peter, we gotta go
over there and talk to Donna.

248
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,055
All right, but you need
to cool down first, Lois.

249
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:19,523
Find a way
to channel your anger.

250
00:08:19,557 --> 00:08:21,859
What I do is throw
a shot put into a crowd

251
00:08:21,893 --> 00:08:23,527
and make it look
like an accident.

252
00:08:26,431 --> 00:08:27,598
(grunts)

253
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,867
I forgot to make it
look like an accident.

254
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,538
(doorbell ringing)

255
00:08:34,572 --> 00:08:36,139
That woman
is gonna be sorry

256
00:08:36,174 --> 00:08:37,774
she laid her hands
on our son.

257
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,343
Hello.

258
00:08:39,377 --> 00:08:40,577
Hi, j-just
so you know,

259
00:08:40,612 --> 00:08:41,812
this is sort of
Lois's thing.

260
00:08:41,846 --> 00:08:43,313
I-I'm not really
upset about it.

261
00:08:43,348 --> 00:08:44,314
So... go
ahead, dear.

262
00:08:44,349 --> 00:08:45,649
Donna, what gives you

263
00:08:45,683 --> 00:08:47,050
the right to
spank my child?

264
00:08:47,085 --> 00:08:49,419
It always smells like
the same meal over here.

265
00:08:49,454 --> 00:08:50,888
I hit him
for a reason.

266
00:08:50,922 --> 00:08:52,489
He broke my vase.

267
00:08:52,524 --> 00:08:54,525
And maybe I wouldn't have
to discipline your child

268
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:56,093
if you did
it yourself!

269
00:08:56,127 --> 00:08:57,227
Oh, please!

270
00:08:57,262 --> 00:08:58,862
The only thing kids
learn from spanking

271
00:08:58,897 --> 00:09:01,064
is adults don't have the
patience to teach them.

272
00:09:01,099 --> 00:09:02,232
Bull honkey.

273
00:09:02,267 --> 00:09:03,233
What?!

274
00:09:03,268 --> 00:09:04,368
I don't spank,

275
00:09:04,402 --> 00:09:06,069
and my children are
very well-behaved.

276
00:09:06,104 --> 00:09:07,170
Oh, yeah?

277
00:09:07,205 --> 00:09:09,506
Your baby's on
the roof right now.

278
00:09:11,376 --> 00:09:12,376
Stewie!

279
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,011
You get down from there
this instant!

280
00:09:14,045 --> 00:09:15,279
Munch me, bitch!

281
00:09:15,313 --> 00:09:17,347
Right now, Stewie,
or you're in time-out!

282
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:19,116
How many gray pubes
you pluck today,

283
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,117
you old bag?

284
00:09:20,151 --> 00:09:21,852
Your time-outs
are a joke.

285
00:09:21,886 --> 00:09:23,120
You're a
terrible parent.

286
00:09:23,154 --> 00:09:24,788
I'm a terrible
parent?!

287
00:09:24,822 --> 00:09:26,156
You're a child abuser!

288
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,291
You know what?

289
00:09:27,325 --> 00:09:29,126
From now on, I don't
want our families

290
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,861
having anything to do
with each other!

291
00:09:30,895 --> 00:09:33,056
Well, Cleveland, looks like
these two little alley cats

292
00:09:33,064 --> 00:09:34,831
have scrapped it out.
I'll see you tomorrow.

293
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,099
That includes
you, Peter.

294
00:09:36,134 --> 00:09:38,435
I don't want you ever
talking to Cleveland again.

295
00:09:38,469 --> 00:09:39,903
And Cleveland,
I forbid you

296
00:09:39,938 --> 00:09:42,072
from ever talking
to Peter again!

297
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,881
Hey, Lois, look!

298
00:09:50,915 --> 00:09:52,049
I'm smoking!

299
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,584
You can't control dick!

300
00:09:53,618 --> 00:09:55,819
I'm a roof baby now!

301
00:09:59,857 --> 00:10:01,558
So we're
making plans

302
00:10:01,593 --> 00:10:03,293
for Susie's first
birthday party.

303
00:10:03,328 --> 00:10:04,461
Oh, that's good bar talk.

304
00:10:04,495 --> 00:10:05,562
Hey, y'all..

305
00:10:05,597 --> 00:10:07,497
Oh, oh, uh, sorry,
Peter, I'll...

306
00:10:07,532 --> 00:10:08,498
I'll get
outta here.

307
00:10:08,533 --> 00:10:09,499
No, no, no, no,
I'll go.

308
00:10:09,534 --> 00:10:10,500
I'll go.
It's okay.

309
00:10:10,535 --> 00:10:11,602
What's goin' on?

310
00:10:11,636 --> 00:10:13,503
You guys touch
pee-pees or something?

311
00:10:13,538 --> 00:10:14,504
I wish.

312
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:16,573
No, our wives
got in a big fight

313
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:18,308
and banned us from
seeing each other.

314
00:10:18,343 --> 00:10:19,309
So what if they're in a fight?

315
00:10:19,344 --> 00:10:20,944
What does that have
to do with you?

316
00:10:20,979 --> 00:10:22,412
Well, I gotta
live with Donna.

317
00:10:22,447 --> 00:10:24,147
Uh-oh.
There she is.

318
00:10:25,516 --> 00:10:26,883
Oh, no!
Peter, quick!

319
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,185
Change pigments!

320
00:10:32,323 --> 00:10:34,424
That was close.

321
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:36,860
Peter, we can't risk
seeing each other.

322
00:10:36,894 --> 00:10:39,963
But, Cleveland, you and I are
pals, and I just got you back.

323
00:10:39,998 --> 00:10:41,832
Well, there might
be one solution.

324
00:10:41,866 --> 00:10:44,901
We just got to hang out where
there's no chance we'll be seen.

325
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,503
You know,
keep it a secret.

326
00:10:46,537 --> 00:10:47,838
Then that's what we'll do.

327
00:10:47,872 --> 00:10:49,606
'Cause I can't
lose you again, Cleveland.

328
00:10:49,641 --> 00:10:52,709
I'm closer to you than
I am to my own right hand.

329
00:10:52,744 --> 00:10:55,479
Oh, my God,
you like scrambled eggs, too?

330
00:10:55,513 --> 00:10:57,614
Here, go ahead, have some.

331
00:10:57,649 --> 00:10:59,483
Whoa, that's a big bite there.

332
00:10:59,517 --> 00:11:00,684
Slow down, buddy.

333
00:11:00,718 --> 00:11:02,285
(makes choking sounds)

334
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,655
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! He's choking!

335
00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:07,157
Thanks for coming.

336
00:11:07,191 --> 00:11:09,026
Thank you... Thank you...

337
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,060
Thanks for coming.

338
00:11:13,097 --> 00:11:14,765
Why you thought
it was appropriate

339
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,634
to show up here, Cheryl,
I have no idea.

340
00:11:21,105 --> 00:11:23,240
Are you sure this is
the best solution, Peter?

341
00:11:23,274 --> 00:11:25,342
I just figured a plane
is a safe place

342
00:11:25,376 --> 00:11:28,111
where you and I can hang out
and not be seen by our wives.

343
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:29,880
Oh, that makes sense.
So, what have you been up to?

344
00:11:29,914 --> 00:11:31,848
Yup, sorry, Cleveland, I'm gonna
have to cut you off there.

345
00:11:31,883 --> 00:11:33,316
Whenever I ride on a plane,

346
00:11:33,351 --> 00:11:35,519
I have to put on my
noise-cancelling head phones.

347
00:11:35,553 --> 00:11:38,255
Leaves me alone
with nothing but my thoughts.

348
00:11:38,289 --> 00:11:40,490
<i>But I don't</i> want
<i>to kill all these people!</i>

349
00:11:40,525 --> 00:11:42,826
<i>I don't care about the</i>
<i>alignment of the dark forces!</i>

350
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,429
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

351
00:11:46,631 --> 00:11:48,365
CLEVELAND:
<i>I love my wife Donna.</i>

352
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,468
<i>I wish she and Peter's wife</i>
<i>got along better.</i>

353
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,904
<i>That's why</i>
<i>we're on this airplane.</i>

354
00:11:53,938 --> 00:11:56,073
<i>I'm Cleveland.</i>

355
00:11:58,543 --> 00:12:00,010
(siren blaring)

356
00:12:00,044 --> 00:12:01,745
Ah, dang it!

357
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:07,617
Do you have any idea how
fast you were going, sir?

358
00:12:07,652 --> 00:12:08,570
Peter?!

359
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:10,120
Hey, Cleveland, this
is just so we can talk

360
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:11,722
without getting spotted
by Lois and Donna.

361
00:12:11,756 --> 00:12:13,990
I need you to step
out of the car, sir.

362
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:15,659
Peter, there's got
to be a better way...

363
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,061
He's got a knife!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

364
00:12:18,096 --> 00:12:19,796
Sorry, Cleveland,
it's got to be authentic.

365
00:12:19,831 --> 00:12:21,431
Ow! Ow!
Stay down! Stay down!

366
00:12:21,466 --> 00:12:22,999
Cleveland, try
to grab my gun.

367
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,135
Oh, trying to grab
my gun, are you?

368
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:27,170
Ow! Ow!

369
00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:30,540
Hey, rookie, save some for me.

370
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:33,777
Wow, the whole
gang's back together.

371
00:12:33,811 --> 00:12:34,811
Shut up!

372
00:12:34,846 --> 00:12:36,513
We don't need you
in this town!

373
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,548
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

374
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,951
(whispering):
We don't need you in this town.

375
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,396
Oh, oh, oh, hi, Lois.

376
00:12:53,431 --> 00:12:54,871
You were with
Cleveland, weren't you?

377
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:55,866
No!

378
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,167
Then what were you doing?

379
00:12:57,201 --> 00:12:58,602
I'm, uh...

380
00:12:58,636 --> 00:13:00,036
I'm having an affair.

381
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,271
That's ridiculous.

382
00:13:01,305 --> 00:13:02,506
It's not ridiculous.

383
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,573
It's Cybill Shepherd.

384
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:05,275
She's attainable
for a guy like me now.

385
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:06,610
Peter, enough lies.

386
00:13:06,644 --> 00:13:08,645
I know you were with Cleveland.

387
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:11,982
Until further notice,
you can sleep downstairs.

388
00:13:12,016 --> 00:13:13,717
(sighs)

389
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,018
Aw, man.

390
00:13:15,052 --> 00:13:16,953
I wonder how it's going
for Cleveland.

391
00:13:16,988 --> 00:13:18,255
DONNA:
Cleveland, Get in here!

392
00:13:18,289 --> 00:13:19,689
And pull your pants down!

393
00:13:19,724 --> 00:13:21,758
(spanking)
(Cleveland screaming)

394
00:13:21,793 --> 00:13:25,195
CLEVELAND: At least turn me over
to my back side!

395
00:13:30,194 --> 00:13:31,528
MALE ANNOUNCER:
We now return to

396
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:34,564
"Slightly Too Early Comedy Club
Audience Member."

397
00:13:34,598 --> 00:13:36,966
Not like when Clinton was
in the White House, huh?

398
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:38,401
When Clinton was
in the White House,

399
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:40,236
all you needed to vote was
a piece of duct tape and a...

400
00:13:40,271 --> 00:13:41,504
(laughing)

401
00:13:41,539 --> 00:13:43,106
Yes, yes!

402
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,742
But things are different
with the Republican majority.

403
00:13:45,776 --> 00:13:47,811
They're totally in the pocket
of the oil companies.

404
00:13:47,845 --> 00:13:49,813
I mean, the President
of the United States

405
00:13:49,847 --> 00:13:51,147
might as well be...
(laughs)

406
00:13:51,182 --> 00:13:52,782
Amen! Why not?

407
00:13:52,817 --> 00:13:54,284
Why not, right?

408
00:13:54,318 --> 00:13:56,086
But I guess
it could be worse.

409
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,454
The other day,
my wife asked me

410
00:13:57,488 --> 00:13:59,155
if her ass looked fat
in her jeans.

411
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,490
And I'm like, "Honey..."

412
00:14:00,524 --> 00:14:02,692
Oh, no!
(laughing)

413
00:14:02,726 --> 00:14:05,361
Wow. Wow!

414
00:14:05,396 --> 00:14:07,630
Dad, what are you
doing down here?

415
00:14:07,665 --> 00:14:09,299
Eh, your mom's making me
sleep on the couch

416
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,967
'cause she caught me
hanging out with Cleveland.

417
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:12,068
How about you?

418
00:14:12,103 --> 00:14:14,104
Mom's making me sleep
in the basement.

419
00:14:14,138 --> 00:14:16,673
Sleeping lower in the house is
a big punishment for her.

420
00:14:16,707 --> 00:14:18,274
Well, this isn't working.

421
00:14:18,309 --> 00:14:19,642
I can't keep sneaking around

422
00:14:19,677 --> 00:14:20,998
trying to hang out
with Cleveland.

423
00:14:21,011 --> 00:14:22,912
Maybe you could figure
out a way to get

424
00:14:22,947 --> 00:14:24,781
Mom and Mrs. Brown
to be friends.

425
00:14:24,815 --> 00:14:26,549
Yeah, you know,
I bet I can.

426
00:14:26,584 --> 00:14:29,052
I mean, I'm the guy who figured
out how much eye contact

427
00:14:29,086 --> 00:14:31,454
a band should make
during a guitar solo.

428
00:14:35,092 --> 00:14:37,227
Yeah, we're in sync,
and showing others

429
00:14:37,261 --> 00:14:39,262
how much we love the song.

430
00:14:40,865 --> 00:14:44,000
Okay, okay, time
to turn away now, Vince.

431
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:47,470
Come on, we got
a lot of song left!

432
00:14:47,505 --> 00:14:49,506
Turn away!
Look at something else!

433
00:14:51,242 --> 00:14:54,477
I'm glad you didn't listen.

434
00:14:58,883 --> 00:15:00,383
Chris is right.

435
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:01,751
I got to do something.

436
00:15:56,407 --> 00:15:59,209
All right, Cleveland, nothing
bonds women together like

437
00:15:59,243 --> 00:16:01,444
having to take care of invalid
husbands in the hospital.

438
00:16:01,445 --> 00:16:03,079
What?
Don't die!

439
00:16:03,113 --> 00:16:05,114
(Cleveland screams)

440
00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:09,552
(crying):
Oh, Cleveland,

441
00:16:09,587 --> 00:16:13,456
I'm gonna hate
those Griffins forever.

442
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,159
Only my side had airbags.

443
00:16:18,362 --> 00:16:20,396
Peter, what are we doing here?

444
00:16:20,431 --> 00:16:22,565
Well, women will
always band together

445
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,001
to stop an offensive art
exhibit from coming to town.

446
00:16:25,035 --> 00:16:27,804
So I've arranged for all
my photos of baby wieners

447
00:16:27,838 --> 00:16:29,572
to be put on display.

448
00:16:29,607 --> 00:16:32,475
Oh, Peter, I'm gonna have
to call the police on this.

449
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:34,010
What? Why?

450
00:16:34,044 --> 00:16:35,778
It's to get our wives
back together!

451
00:16:35,813 --> 00:16:37,714
Peter, these are
hundreds of naked babies

452
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:39,882
in suggestive situations!

453
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:42,752
And they're time-stamped
as far back as 1998,

454
00:16:42,786 --> 00:16:45,555
which is way before
we had this idea!

455
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:48,124
(crying):
I need help!

456
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:52,528
All right, Cleveland, one thing
that always bonds women

457
00:16:52,563 --> 00:16:54,230
is healing an abused animal.

458
00:16:54,265 --> 00:16:56,165
So I got us
an injured bald eagle.

459
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,101
Somebody put cigarettes out
all over him.

460
00:16:58,135 --> 00:16:59,802
Peter, that's a symbol
of our country.

461
00:16:59,837 --> 00:17:01,971
This particular eagle
is a dick.

462
00:17:02,006 --> 00:17:03,606
Everything out of its mouth
is a taunt.

463
00:17:03,641 --> 00:17:05,174
Peter, you're
being ridiculous.

464
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:06,776
And you need to release
that eagle out into the...

465
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,177
(squawks)

466
00:17:08,212 --> 00:17:09,312
What'd that eagle say?

467
00:17:09,346 --> 00:17:10,647
(squawks)

468
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:12,682
Lock the door.

469
00:17:14,718 --> 00:17:16,719
(children laughing)

470
00:17:18,722 --> 00:17:20,356
Peter, let's just
give Susie her gift,

471
00:17:20,391 --> 00:17:21,791
eat our cake and leave.

472
00:17:21,825 --> 00:17:24,594
I don't want to be here
with that Brown family.

473
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:27,030
That sounds even more racist
than it is.

474
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:30,500
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you...

475
00:17:30,534 --> 00:17:32,669
The Great Quagini!

476
00:17:32,703 --> 00:17:35,104
Hey-ey, everybody!
There's the birthday girl!

477

Oh, oh, what's that
behind your ear?

478

Oh, it's a condom!

Quagmire, please stop touching
my baby with a condom.

my beautiful assistant in half.

Won't be needing this.

All right, Peter,

You're my three-legged
