00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:06,027
It seems today that all you see

2
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:09,108
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

3
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:12,736
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

4
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,508
On which we used to rely?

5
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:18,784
Lucky there's a family guy

6
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:22,514
Lucky there's a man who
Positively can do

7
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:24,055
all the things that make us

8
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:25,788
Laugh and cry

9
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:30,556
He's a family guy

10
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,800
There's Craig Hoffman. He's such a rebeI.

11
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:41,968
Oh, my God, he is so gorgeous.

12
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:44,202
And he plays by no one's rules
but his own.

13
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,675
Meg, you should ask him out.

14
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:48,509
I mean, you're the only one of us
who's ever had a reaI boyfriend.

15
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,446
I'm back. I brought another picnic.

16
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:56,283
You're such a good listener.
You're not like the other boys.

17
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:00,251
You're so good with animals.

18
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:03,792
I guess I could give it a try.
all right, here goes.

19
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:05,528
Hi, Craig.

20
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,898
I was wondering if maybe you'd want to...

21
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:11,197
I don't know, go out sometime.

22
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:14,865
That's about as likely as me playing
by someone else's rules besides my own...

23
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:16,532
which I would never do.

24
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:19,134
I play by my own rules, nobody else's.

25
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,405
Not even my own.

26
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:22,981
- How about a movie?
- I don't go out with dudes.

27
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:30,279
- Mom, Dad, am I ugly?
- Of course not, sweetie.

28
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,449
Yeah, where'd you get
a stupid idea like that?

29
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:35,221
- Craig Hoffman.
- Craig Hoffman said that?

30
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:38,126
Well, he's a sharp kid. You might be ugly.

31
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:44,328
There, there, let me dry those tears.

32
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:48,072
Yes, your anguish sustains me.

33
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:50,608
Meg, honey, don't let
those awfuI kids at schooI...

34
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,110
make you feeI bad about yourself.
I tell you what.

35
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:56,580
Tomorrow you and I are gonna go out
and get you some brand new outfits.

36
00:01:56,683 --> 00:02:00,449
Maybe a pair of those low-rider jeans
that'll show off your cute butt, huh?

37
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:02,680
Really? Wow, thanks, Mom.

38
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,416
Meg in low-riders.

39
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,715
Enough of that.

40
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:09,821
Go away, damn you.

41
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,225
You're going to get it now.

42
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,739
Oh, my God!

43
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,305
Horace, what is this all about?

44
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,283
What the hell's it look like?
I'm putting the bar up for sale.

45
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,547
Please tell me
this is some kind of practicaI joke.

46
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,419
Like the kind I used to play when
I was an intern at the hospitaI.

47
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:41,956
I'm afraid I have some very bad news.
Your wife's gonna be a vegetable.

48
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:45,792
You'll have to bathe her, feed her
and care for her the rest of her life.

49
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,230
Oh, my God.

50
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,164
No, I'm just kidding. She's dead.

51
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:51,802
Ever since that mega-mall opened
across the street...

52
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,566
it's been taking away all my business.

53
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:58,103
They got 300 stores, 200 restaurants...

54
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,441
53 bars, and an indoor cattle ranch.

55
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:04,974
I go to Baskin-Robbins
every night and buy myself a little treat.

56
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,615
Now, how in the hell am I supposed
to compete with that?

57
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,187
You need to fix the place up.

58
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:12,554
Reinvent The Clam's image
and we'll help you.

59
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,320
That'll take forever.

60
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:17,521
Not if we do a 1980s
fixing-stuff-up montage.

61
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:48,460
Well, I think we made it worse.

62
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,462
Boy, I do not envy
whoever has to clean that mess up.

63
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:57,193
Brian, why don't you take Stewie
while Meg and I go clothes shopping?

64
00:03:57,303 --> 00:04:01,103
You know, it's awfully dangerous for me to
be walking around the mall at my height.

65
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:03,641
- I say, let me get on your back.
- Oh, for God's sake.

66
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,836
Strong with the force, young Skywalker is.

67
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:08,140
- God, I don't believe this.
- That is why you fall.

68
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,442
What about this, Meg?

69
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:12,143
A pink baby tee that says "Little Slut?"

70
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,779
- That seems pretty hip.
- I don't know if that's really me, Mom.

71
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,856
Well, they've got one that says
"Porn Star"...

72
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:21,484
and another that says "Sperm Dumpster"
and they're all written in glitter.

73
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,687
all right. all right.
Give me "Sperm Dumpster. "

74
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,127
That's the spirit.

75
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,893
- You finding everything okay?
- Yes, thank you.

76
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:31,198
- You just let me know if you need any-
- How do these jeans look?

77
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:37,770
- $10.
- $5.

78
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,401
- $8 and I'll do it.
- Fine.

79
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,581
Help, I've escaped
from Kevin Spacey's basement!

80
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:43,671
Help me!

81
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,743
I am so outrageous. Give me the cash.

82
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,716
- Cold in here?
- Nope, just really small.

83
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,051
Face it, Mom.
No matter what I wear, I look ugly.

84
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,560
Meg, you're being... That's...

85
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,397
Let's try down here.

86
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:03,964
Coming up next, Joan Rivers speaks
to us from beyond the grave.

87
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,163
But first, let's go
to the Quahog Mega-Mall...

88
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:08,240
where Asian correspondent
Tricia Takanawa...

89
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:09,740
is handing out makeovers.

90
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,238
That's right, Tom.

91
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,835
Some lucky hideous woman
will be transformed...

92
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:18,007
by our makeover magicians
into someone of value to society.

93
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,813
Meg, that's it. You could get a makeover.

94
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,115
That'd be just the thing to boost
your confidence.

95
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:26,191
Miss Takanawa! Miss Takanawa!

96
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:27,725
Over here!

97
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:31,729
My daughter needs a makeover like
there's no freaking tomorrow.

98
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,898
It looks like we've got a winner, Tom.

99
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:44,699
- Face it, The Clam is doomed.
- Come on, guys, we can't give up now.

100
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:49,180
Peter, we've tried every theme
we could think of and everything's falled.

101
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:52,342
Especially that Coyote Ugly theme.

102
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:01,583
It's no use, this place is finished.

103
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,753
Quagmire, go get the "For Sale" sign.

104
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,488
Hey, Horace, what the hell's this?

105
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:10,000
It's a karaoke machine.
I never got around to installing it.

106
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,867
A karaoke machine?
Wait a minute, that's it.

107
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,906
We'll turn this place into a karaoke bar.

108
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,840
Oh, man, that's the best idea
since they faked the moon landing.

109
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:19,574
Okay, cut.

110
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,817
NeiI Armstrong.

111
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,886
Wait a minute.
You're supposed to be on the moon.

112
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,511
I just saw it on TV.

113
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:31,988
There's a... tape delay.

114
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:34,389
And solar winds...

115
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:44,668
Peter, take a look at your daughter.

116
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:50,542
Oh, my God, Lois, I'm sorry.
It was 20 years ago.

117
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:53,578
- I'd never even heard the word "rubber"...
- Peter, this is Meg.

118
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,869
Oh.

119
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,609
I got a makeover, Dad. Don't I look great?

120
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:01,881
Meg, honey, I always thought
you were beautifuI just the way you...

121
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,483
God, couldn't do that with a straight face.

122
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:12,387
Welcome to the family, sweetheart.
Chris, go burn all Meg's old pictures.

123
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:17,593
There's got
to be a morning after

124
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,940
We're moving closer to the shore

125
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:28,438
I know we'll be there by tomorrow

126
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:33,875
And we'll escape the darkness

127
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:37,786
We won't be searching anymore

128
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,082
Thank you very much.

129
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,957
I don't understand it.
This place should be jumping.

130
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:44,996
Well, we just need to kick it up a notch.

131
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,587
Horace, hit it.

132
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,967
Just a small town girI

133
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:54,234
Living in a lonely world

134
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,367
She took the midnight train

135
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:01,038
Going anywhere

136
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:03,481
Peter, don't make me do...

137
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,949
Just a city boy

138
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:10,180
Born and raised in South Detroit

139
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,415
He took the midnight train

140
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:17,223
Going anywhere

141
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,227
Oh, God, I love this song.

142
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,333
And I love it when amateurs
sing the Iyrics.

143
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:26,127
But I hate baseball cards.

144
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,204
Some will win

145
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,207
Some will lose

146
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:34,005
Some were born to sing the blues

147
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:37,310
The movie never ends

148
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,943
It goes on and on

149
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,416
Hey, that's Journey. Kickass!

150
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,051
Howard!

151
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,163
That is Journey.

152
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:56,458
Streetlight people

153
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,566
Get some! Get some!

154
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,047
Guys, we were freaking electric.

155
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:12,311
Yeah, they loved us.
Gentlemen, this is a sign.

156
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:15,285
We are gonna start our own rock band.

157
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,754
Who's with me?
I'm in.

158
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,116
Looks like the guys are gonna
form a rock band.

159
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,854
Maybe they'll learn a little something.

160
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:26,125
Stick around, you just might learn
something, too.

161
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:36,103
You know, Peter, just because you guys
entertained a bunch of drunken idiots...

162
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,041
at a karaoke bar, doesn't mean
you have what it takes to form a band.

163
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:42,012
Brian, you're just ants at a picnic.
We're gonna be awesome.

164
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:43,376
Wait. What am I?

165
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,844
I'm ants at a picnic?
Is that what you just said?

166
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,553
I'm ants at a picnic? all right.
Just making sure.

167
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,317
Sorry I'm late, fellas.

168
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,155
CooI, Glenn. You look just like Tommy Lee.

169
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,458
Well, I figured it'd be appropriate
since I just found out I got hepatitis.

170
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:01,590
You know, maybe we should have
decided on outfits that matched.

171
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,498
Now we all look like a bunch of queers.

172
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,264
Fellas, it doesn't matter what you wear...

173
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:08,636
as long as you play kickass rock and roll
and do this with your tongue.

174
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:11,642
- Am I right, Gene?
- You got that right, Pete.

175
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:20,179
Oh, my. Hi, Gene.
I didn't know you were here.

176
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,652
all right. Keep it in your mouth, rock star.

177
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:30,054
- Great job getting hot, Meg.
- Gee, thanks.

178
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,525
- Hey, Meg.
- Hi, Craig.

179
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,066
Now that you're attractive,
how about we go out sometime?

180
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,429
Gosh, I'd love to.

181
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:39,299
Great, I'll pick you up whenever
I feeI like it.

182
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:42,537
Hey, Meg. We noticed Craig Hoffman
just asked you out.

183
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,008
That makes you cooI.
Wanna hang out with us?

184
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,671
- Sure.
- Hey, I'm here to pick you up.

185
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,748
Here we are, fellas. Our first major gig.

186
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,513
Peter, this is a house of corrections.

187
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:58,280
You gotta start somewhere, fellas.
That's how you evolve.

188
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,120
Like when the Tin Man found out
he was gay.

189
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,169
Look what happened by accident.

190
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,705
I hear there's a lot of buzz about this band.

191
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:24,783
Yeah, there was a pretty positive review
carved in Tony's ass.

192
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,079
all right, kids.
Now everyone stay together.

193
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,653
It's very important to your father...

194
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:30,847
that we're here for his band's
first performance.

195
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:34,619
The people who beat you are proud
to present, all the way from Quahog...

196
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:37,252
Fat, Horny, Black and Joe.

197
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:42,057
- Hello, Cleveland!
- Hello, Peter.

198
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,292
One, two, three, four...

199
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,203
Oh, my God, we don't know any songs.

200
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,502
- You suck!
- Get off the stage!

201
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,141
What do we do?

202
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:55,907
I know what I'm doing.
I'm getting out of here.

203
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:01,282
How about a funny story
about Lake Wobegone?

204
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,720
It was the day
of the tuna hot-dish jamboree...

205
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,386
Oh, no. Kids, your father's in trouble.

206
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,825
- I'm going up there.
- I'm coming, too, Mom.

207
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,260
Oh, my God.

208
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:13,763
The guy behind me braided my hair.

209
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:18,295
Chris, grab a guitar. Brian, take the drums.

210
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,894
Here, Stewie, play with this.

211
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,996
Mom, can we please just get out of here?

212
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,977
- Oh, my God.
- Who is she?

213
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,803
God, I could strangle her all night long.

214
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:32,145
Boy, that's not healthy, is it?
That that's the first place I go to?

215
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,412
Hit it!

216
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:38,984
Cloudy skies and rain clouds
Have come to stay

217
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:45,355
Windy nights and sad sights
Won't go away

218
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:51,431
But I wanna be without a care

219
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:57,137
Unicorns and butterflies everywhere

220
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:06,708
Gonna buy me a rainbow

221
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:13,455
Gonna wrap it up in a great big bow

222
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,352
The time is right
It's day, not night

223
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,524
Just open up your heart
It'll be all right

224
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:27,133
Gonna buy me a rainbow

225
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,503
Buy me a rainbow

226
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:39,449
You guys were great.
My name's Jimmy lovine.

227
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,712
And I'd like to make you
filthy rich rock stars.

228
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,880
Wow, you're the chairman of
Interscope Records.

229
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,981
- What're you doing in prison?
- I stomped a cat to death.

230
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:48,889
Listen, you guys got talent.

231
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,657
- Well, where do we sign?
- Right here, on Tony's butt cheek.

232
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,694
And initiaI here...

233
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:57,831
and here.

234
00:13:58,637 --> 00:13:59,865
And date.

235
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,133
Oh, crap. Today's the seventeenth.

236
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:11,545
Gonna buy me a rainbow

237
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,140
Buy me a rainbow

238
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,787
- How was that, Dr. Ditty?
- Yo, that sounds smooth, y'all.

239
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,655
I just have a-

240
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,830
God, I'm so sorry. I keep doing that.

241
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,899
God, please forgive me.

242
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,833
I get that from my father.
He's from a different generation.

243
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,767
- It's-
- Whatever, man.

244
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,205
- We cooI? We good?
- Yeah, we're cooI. Fine.

245
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:41,146
Mr. Doctor? If you get shot in a rap feud...

246
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:44,011
can you perform surgery on yourself?

247
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:47,142
Well, no, Chris. My degree's in optometry.

248
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:48,345
all right, Dr. Ditty.

249
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,445
I got three choices for you
for the name of the band:

250
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,956
Peter Griffin Starship,
Peter Griffin and the Sunday Steppers...

251
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,453
or Testicular Sound Express.

252
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,496
I think the name is Meg.

253
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,690
- Me? Why?
- Yeah, why?

254
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,664
Let me explain something to you, all right?

255
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:06,169
We got to get her half-naked
and put her out front, center stage.

256
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,433
And that's gonna make y'all billionaires...

257
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,135
because America loves
hot, white jallbait ass.

258
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,711
Wait a minute.

259
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:16,606
That's the smartest thing I've ever heard...

260
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:18,910
anyone say about anything.

261
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,987
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Meg
being exploited that way.

262
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,284
Shut up, Mom, it's not your decision.
I want to be exploited.

263
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,552
Meg, don't you talk to me like that.

264
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,857
Look, Lois, I love MeaI Ticket
just as much as I love Chris and Stevie...

265
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:33,932
but business is business.
So, let's get this show on the road, huh?

266
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,399
Good. Now, I just need you to sign this.

267
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,604
Oh, God. Sorry.

268
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,468
Oh, my God. That is not me.

269
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:43,404
That's not who I am. I vote Democrat.

270
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:46,376
It will not happen again.
We cooI? We good?

271
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:50,308
You...

272
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:53,214
You guys know I have no problem
with black people, right?

273
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,082
Yeah. Sure.

274
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:57,449
You did say you hated Crooklyn.

275
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,838
- Hey, Doc, you got a minute?
- What you want, dog?

276
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,209
Yeah, so, hey, check it out.

277
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,545
Stewie and I have been working
on some stuff of our own.

278
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,485
And we thought there might be a place
for us to sing on the next album.

279
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:32,321
Hey, cooI. You're busy. No sweat.

280
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,321
Boy, Benson was a funny show.

281
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:42,928
- I'll talk to you later.
- Well, what did he say?

282
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:45,469
He said he'd think about it.
Okay, so where were we?

283
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:46,538
Okay.

284
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:49,835
I want to have intercourse
with you

285
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,571
Intercourse with you

286
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,044
Relations.

287
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:58,014
Intercourse with you

288
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,948
- Right?
- Yeah. No, great, that sounds good.

289
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,576
all right, groovy.

290
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,678
Now, is there a shorter word
for intercourse?

291
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:06,053
Lois, go grab me another bag of Skittles.

292
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,922
- Excuse me, young lady?
- Did I freaking stutter?

293
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,987
- I said more Skittles.
- all right. That is it, Meg.

294
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,861
You know, ever since you
got that makeover...

295
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,696
you've developed a terrible attitude.

296
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:20,067
And all the success with the family band
is only making it worse.

297
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,799
The family band?

298
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:25,907
You know, maybe you haven't noticed,
Lois, but I am the band.

299
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:29,970
- Right, Missus Wong?
- Yeah, she band. Old lady jealous.

300
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:34,149
Peter, we have to do something.
We're losing our daughter.

301
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,016
I'm worried about
what's happening to her.

302
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,611
Lois, this is the kind of thing...

303
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,692
that always resolves itself
if you just ignore it, all right?

304
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,353
What's more important is
we're living the sweet life.

305
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:46,260
This is even more fun than
when I performed at the White House.

306
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:49,634
Mr. President,
I present to you Peter Griffin.

307
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,617
Okay, listen up, everybody.
I got great news.

308
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:12,051
Meg, you and your family are gonna
perform on Saturday Night Live.

309
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:15,426
You mean I'm gonna get to meet
John Belushi and Gilda Radner...

310
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:18,655
and PhiI Hartman, and Chris Farley,
and Horatio Sanz? Sweet!

311
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,070
Saturday Night Live.

312
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,866
I can't think of anything more exciting.

313
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:30,737
Oh, my God, a water fountain!

314
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:37,247
Meg, I'm Jimmy Fallon.

315
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:40,409
It's great to finally meet you. I'm hosting.

316
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,815
Why don't you come hang out
in my dressing room?

317
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:45,856
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

318
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,585
Come on, let's go.

319
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,352
Peter, I'm worried about Meg.
She's spirallng out of controI.

320
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,590
I mean, what if she develops
a coke problem?

321
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,189
No Coke. Pepsi.

322
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,935
Come on, you set me up for that one.

323
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:04,067
Wow, Jimmy.

324
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,872
That was everything
Ladies Home JournaI said it would be.

325
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,844
Awesome, great, thanks.

326
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:12,114
You know, there's something I...

327
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:13,941
There's something I gotta tell you.

328
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:17,249
Being with you just made me feeI
so... Live from New York...

329
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,256
it's Saturday Night!

330
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:23,083
It's Saturday Night Live.

331
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,662
Oh, my God.

332
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:27,027
Yeah, that wasn't a very good
opening sketch, was it?

333
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:30,260
- A rare miss.
- I don't think that was a sketch, Peter.

334
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,972
Mom, Dad, he used me for comedy.

335
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:35,198
Wait a minute.

336
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,571
Are you telling me
that my daughter was deflowered...

337
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,236
in front of one-and-a-half times
the Mad TVaudience?

338
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,607
My poor baby.

339
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:43,408
My God, Lois, you were right.

340
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,380
Why the hell didn't I see it coming?

341
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:49,614
all right, stand aside.
It's about time I did my fatherly duty.

342
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,847
I said "duty," but no time
to laugh about it now.

343
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,391
Hey, everybody, it's great to be back.

344
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,464
So we got a great show tonight and-

345
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:02,295
Hey, Fallon, say goodnight, you bum.

346
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:05,699
And this is for laughing
and looking at the camera...

347
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,362
during every sketch you've ever been in.

348
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,497
Who do you think you are? CaroI Burnett?

349
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:12,543
You think because she did it,
it's okay for you?

350
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:15,169
You haven't earned what she's earned,
buddy.

351
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,578
all right, now where's the guy
who slept with my daughter?

352
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,183
I'm so glad to be the reaI me again.

353
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,380
It's too much work being beautifuI.

354
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:27,322
Not for me, but it's good
to have you back, pumpkin.

355
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:30,088
Well, I guess there's only
one thing left to do.

356
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,233
Listen, thanks, everybody.
I had a great time tonight.

357
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:40,305
I want to thank Jimmy Fallon
for being such a good sport.

358
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:45,171
Lois, Meg, Stewie, Brian, Chris,
the guys from the prison...

359
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:46,767
Counting Crows.

360
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:49,774
If I'm forgetting anybody, I'm sorry.
Goodnight, everybody!

361
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:51,473
Our thoughts are with you, Chevy!

362
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,848
From the world famous
Apollo Theater in Harlem...

363
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,051
it's show time at the-

364
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,986
What? I'm tired.

365
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:08,497
It has nothing to do with the fact
that it's a black show.

366
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,068
What? I can't be tired at 1:00
in the morning?
