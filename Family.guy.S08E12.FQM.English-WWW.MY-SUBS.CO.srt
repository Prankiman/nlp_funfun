Ah, it smells so good out here.

You see, Peter?

13
00:00:40,168 --> 00:00:42,002
This is a much better way to spend a Sunday

14
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,971
than what you dragged us to last week.

15
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:45,606
Hey, if I'm starring in a production

Stewie, look.

29
00:01:16,538 --> 00:01:17,872
A butterfly.

30
00:01:19,407 --> 00:01:20,908
Let's get it!

31
00:01:22,577 --> 00:01:24,912
Uh, Chris, I don't think we
should be leaving the trail.

32
00:01:26,882 --> 00:01:28,516
I shall put you in a glass box

33
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:30,251
to display on Saint Trimmings Day.

34
00:01:30,318 --> 00:01:31,585
Awww.

35
00:01:31,653 --> 00:01:34,054
British guys always capture my butterflies.

36
00:01:34,122 --> 00:01:36,157
Yes, and to add insult to injury,

37
00:01:36,224 --> 00:01:37,825
I shall present to you my fanny:

38
00:01:37,893 --> 00:01:39,593
Sir Chadwell Heath.

39
00:01:43,265 --> 00:01:44,532
Aw, darn it.

40
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:47,401
Hey, wait a second. Where are we?

41
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:49,503
Oh, no.

42
00:01:49,571 --> 00:01:50,671
Hey, Chris, did you know

43
00:01:50,739 --> 00:01:52,973
your bacne spells "Citibank" in Braille?

44
00:01:56,978 --> 00:01:59,914
Great. You had to chase the butterfly.

45
00:01:59,981 --> 00:02:02,449
Yes, I had to chase the butterfly.

46
00:02:02,517 --> 00:02:04,251
I came out here to observe nature.

47
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,853
What did you come out here for?

48
00:02:05,921 --> 00:02:08,522
I came to the woods because I
wished to live deliberately,

49
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,925
and see if I could not
learn what it had to teach,

50
00:02:10,992 --> 00:02:12,860
and not, when I came to die,

51
00:02:12,928 --> 00:02:15,196
discover that I had not lived.

52
00:02:15,263 --> 00:02:17,398
Wow, Stewie. That was beautiful.

53
00:02:17,465 --> 00:02:19,166
- Did you write that?
- No.

54
00:02:19,234 --> 00:02:20,935
But can you tell me who did?

55
00:02:21,002 --> 00:02:22,837
Log on now.

56
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,042
All right, let's tally up those responses.

57
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:31,912
Wow.

58
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,814
You know who that is?
You know who Thornton Mellon...

59
00:02:33,882 --> 00:02:35,082
First of all, it was Henry David Thoreau.

60
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,750
But do you know who Thornton Mellon is?

61
00:02:36,818 --> 00:02:39,887
That was Rodney Dangerfield's
character in <i>Back to School</i>.

62
00:02:39,955 --> 00:02:42,423
You feel good
about yourselves? Huh?

63
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,959
This is why the other countries
are beating us, you know!

64
00:02:45,026 --> 00:02:46,760
So you know,
you got only yourself to blame

65
00:02:46,828 --> 00:02:48,362
next time you go
to the vet and complain

66
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,065
that that Indian doctor is
too rough with your cat.

67
00:02:53,768 --> 00:02:56,937
Stewie, are we gonna die?

68
00:02:57,005 --> 00:02:58,639
Hey, hey.

69
00:02:58,707 --> 00:02:59,874
Probably.

70
00:02:59,941 --> 00:03:02,209
I... I don't want to die!

71
00:03:02,277 --> 00:03:04,144
You know, Chris, if by some miracle,

72
00:03:04,212 --> 00:03:06,013
we do manage to get out of here alive,

73
00:03:06,081 --> 00:03:08,382
I'm gonna finally run
for public office again.

74
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,718
I think people have forgotten
my last embarrassment.

75
00:03:13,722 --> 00:03:15,789
Harry Truman. Stupid jerk.

76
00:03:15,857 --> 00:03:17,892
Freakin' FDR's ass bitch.

77
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:19,660
If we get back home alive,

78
00:03:19,728 --> 00:03:22,463
I'm gonna finally open up
to Ellen from my math class

79
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,164
and tell her how much I like her.

80
00:03:24,232 --> 00:03:26,066
I'd like those things for us, Chris.

81
00:03:28,336 --> 00:03:29,436
What are you doing?

82
00:03:29,504 --> 00:03:30,704
I'm digging a hole.

83
00:03:30,772 --> 00:03:31,972
Why?

84
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,774
'Cause I like to sleep on my side.

85
00:03:41,316 --> 00:03:44,018
Our top story:
The search for two local boys

86
00:03:44,085 --> 00:03:46,120
lost in the woods drags
on into its third day.

87
00:03:46,187 --> 00:03:47,388
That's right, Diane.

88
00:03:47,455 --> 00:03:49,623
Still no sign of Chris and Stewie Griffin.

89
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:51,492
Here's the update from the local authorities

90
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:53,394
who are overseeing the
search party's efforts.

91
00:03:53,461 --> 00:03:56,096
We're still very optimistic that
we're gonna find these kids,

92
00:03:56,164 --> 00:03:58,632
and we just want to urge
everyone not to give up hope.

93
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,000
All right, everyone,

94
00:04:00,068 --> 00:04:02,403
we are officially looking for corpses.

95
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,438
Repeat, this is now a recovery effort.

96
00:04:04,506 --> 00:04:06,440
We are officially looking for corpses,

97
00:04:06,508 --> 00:04:07,675
so let's get back out there,

98
00:04:07,742 --> 00:04:09,343
bring back those dead bodies.

99
00:04:09,411 --> 00:04:10,878
Oh, God, this is horrible!

100
00:04:10,946 --> 00:04:12,379
I can't watch anymore!

101
00:04:12,447 --> 00:04:14,715
Mom, Daddy, thank you
so much for coming over.

102
00:04:14,783 --> 00:04:16,283
Oh, of course, dear.

103
00:04:16,351 --> 00:04:17,518
I don't know what to do.

104
00:04:17,585 --> 00:04:19,086
They scoured the area,

105
00:04:19,154 --> 00:04:20,487
and there's no sign of them.

106
00:04:20,555 --> 00:04:22,456
I feel like I can't just
sit here doing nothing,

107
00:04:22,524 --> 00:04:24,191
but I don't know what I can do.

108
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:25,993
I'll tell you who could help. Medium.

109
00:04:26,061 --> 00:04:27,528
Daddy, that's not a real person.

110
00:04:27,595 --> 00:04:29,196
That's a character on a TV show.

111
00:04:29,264 --> 00:04:30,931
Don't you disparage Medium.

112
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:32,399
Medium works very hard.

113
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:34,501
You know, Mom, I saw this
thing on the Discovery Channel

114
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:36,603
about psychics who help
find people who are lost.

115
00:04:36,671 --> 00:04:37,771
Really?

116
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:39,139
I saw this thing on the Discovery Channel

117
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:41,108
about this fat woman who sat on her dog

118
00:04:41,176 --> 00:04:42,943
and it went up inside her guts.

119
00:04:46,281 --> 00:04:47,681
It's been three days,

120
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:49,483
and I just don't know where else to turn.

121
00:04:49,551 --> 00:04:51,218
Please, can you help me?

122
00:04:51,286 --> 00:04:52,653
Don't worry, Lois.

123
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:55,622
The spirit world wants
very much to assist you.

124
00:04:56,825 --> 00:04:59,226
Your missing sons will be found.

125
00:04:59,294 --> 00:05:03,130
Oh, oh! Thank you,
thank you so much!

126
00:05:03,198 --> 00:05:05,332
I can't tell you how reassuring that is.

127
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,669
Ah. My babies are okay.

128
00:05:10,772 --> 00:05:12,639
Will you answer one question for me?

129
00:05:12,707 --> 00:05:13,774
Yes.

130
00:05:13,842 --> 00:05:16,176
Thank you so much.

131
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:24,251
Well, Stewie, I think we're finished.

132
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:26,587
It sure looks that way.

133
00:05:26,654 --> 00:05:29,156
It's been a pleasure
serving with you, Chris.

134
00:05:29,224 --> 00:05:31,558
And with you, Stewie.

135
00:05:31,626 --> 00:05:33,660
Jeffrey! Jeffrey, come back.

136
00:05:33,728 --> 00:05:35,429
It's gonna get dark soon!

137
00:05:35,497 --> 00:05:37,798
All this drama over a turkey burger?!

138
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:40,667
Oh, thank God!

139
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,802
Oh, you're not Jeffrey.

140
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,637
You're that missing baby and boy.

141
00:05:43,705 --> 00:05:44,972
Jeffrey!

142
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,241
I found that missing baby and boy!

143
00:05:47,308 --> 00:05:48,976
I don't care.

144
00:05:51,012 --> 00:05:52,246
Mommy!

145
00:05:52,313 --> 00:05:53,514
Chris! Stewie!

146
00:05:53,581 --> 00:05:55,015
My babies!

147
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,518
Oh, I'm so happy you're safe!

148
00:05:57,585 --> 00:05:59,219
Oh, I knew they'd find you.

149
00:05:59,287 --> 00:06:00,854
I knew you were okay.

150
00:06:00,922 --> 00:06:02,423
It's just like the psychic said.

151
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,691
Thank you all for your help, everybody.

152
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:05,993
Oh, for definite.

153
00:06:06,061 --> 00:06:08,295
It's just like a childhood
game of Hide and Find!

154
00:06:08,363 --> 00:06:09,530
You said it, friend!

155
00:06:09,597 --> 00:06:10,864
What do you say for celebration

156
00:06:10,932 --> 00:06:12,699
we go dunk our whistles in the trough?

157
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:15,169
Ah! We should totally phone Gaspard!

158
00:06:15,236 --> 00:06:16,970
Ah! He would love to hear this tale!

159
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:20,407
Oh, but I only have 15
pfenigs on my phone card.

160
00:06:20,475 --> 00:06:22,810
Happy Gerbitz Day.

161
00:06:22,877 --> 00:06:23,944
- Ah! Ah!
- Ah!

162
00:06:24,012 --> 00:06:25,279
- Ah!
- Ah!

163
00:06:29,914 --> 00:06:33,650
Oh, it is so good to have my
boys back home safe and sound.

164
00:06:33,717 --> 00:06:35,318
Thank God for that psychic.

165
00:06:35,386 --> 00:06:37,220
What are you talking about?
The psychic didn't do anything.

166
00:06:37,288 --> 00:06:39,689
Well, she said we were
gonna find them and we did.

167
00:06:39,757 --> 00:06:41,591
I always wondered about psychics,

168
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:43,660
but I gotta tell ya, I'm a believer now.

169
00:06:43,727 --> 00:06:46,496
Yeah, I'm gonna go back and
see what else she has to say.

170
00:06:46,564 --> 00:06:48,698
Hey, check it out. Chris and Stewie,

171
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:50,934
you're on the front page of the paper.

172
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:52,869
You know, Chris, that girl from school

173
00:06:52,937 --> 00:06:54,704
sees that picture and you're in.

174
00:06:54,772 --> 00:06:56,673
Look, Stewie, I'm not
really gonna ask her out.

175
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,542
I think that just might
have been cocky forest talk.

176
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,944
No, but you got to take advantage of this.

177
00:07:01,011 --> 00:07:02,145
Seize your moment.

178
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,114
Like the Duck Founding Father.

179
00:07:04,181 --> 00:07:06,883
Gentlemen, these are all
important fundamental rights,

180
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:10,186
but I move we strike the
right to bob for small fish

181
00:07:10,254 --> 00:07:11,955
with your butt in the air. All in favor?

182
00:07:12,022 --> 00:07:12,889
Aye.

183
00:07:12,957 --> 00:07:13,890
Opposed?

184
00:07:15,025 --> 00:07:16,059
The motion carries.

185
00:07:18,796 --> 00:07:21,097
I don't know about this, Stewie.

186
00:07:21,165 --> 00:07:22,599
Nonsense. You're a hero now.

187
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:23,766
Your picture's in the paper.

188
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:24,901
She'll be fawning all over you.

189
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:25,902
Now, which one is she?

190
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,837
There.

191
00:07:30,774 --> 00:07:32,742
Hi, Chris!

192
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,611
Wait a minute. That's the girl?

193
00:07:34,678 --> 00:07:36,980
Yeah. Isn't she special?

194
00:07:37,047 --> 00:07:38,848
That's the way the state of
Rhode Island would put it.

195
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:42,185
Uh, there's something...
up with her, isn't there?

196
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,920
Yeah. She's got Down's Syndrome.

197
00:07:43,988 --> 00:07:45,188
Oh, okay, well, there we go.

198
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,723
She's so sweet.

199
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:49,592
And doesn't she have the
most beautiful eyes?

200
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,361
Well, the spacing seems a tad off,

201
00:07:51,428 --> 00:07:52,862
but, yeah, individually, they're not awful.

202
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,430
All right, I'm on board. Go talk to her.

203
00:07:55,633 --> 00:07:58,134
Um, hi, Ellen.

204
00:07:58,202 --> 00:07:59,469
Hi, Chris.

205
00:07:59,537 --> 00:08:02,038
Um, this is my little brother Stewie.

206
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,908
Your head makes me laugh.

207
00:08:04,975 --> 00:08:07,977
I'm guessing this one owned a bunny,
but not anymore.

208
00:08:09,547 --> 00:08:12,215
Um, listen there's something
I've wanted to tell you

209
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,050
for a really long time.

210
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,585
Oh, yeah? What?

211
00:08:15,653 --> 00:08:18,154
Well, um, I really like you.

212
00:08:19,557 --> 00:08:21,791
And I was wondering if maybe, um...

213
00:08:21,859 --> 00:08:23,893
you want to go out on a date with me.

214
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,596
Okay. Pick me up Saturday at 8:00.

215
00:08:26,664 --> 00:08:28,731
Great. See you then.

216
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,967
There you go. Being confident.

217
00:08:31,035 --> 00:08:34,003
Like an Italian guy in any
given theoretical situation.

218
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:35,471
If that was me...

219
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:37,440
I'm, I'm just saying,
if that was me...

220
00:08:37,508 --> 00:08:39,676
They are lucky that was not me.

221
00:08:39,743 --> 00:08:41,678
Because, if the circumstances were such,

222
00:08:41,745 --> 00:08:43,413
as you have described them,

223
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,581
but with me in them,

224
00:08:44,648 --> 00:08:46,950
that's a very different and scary outcome

225
00:08:47,017 --> 00:08:48,218
for those involved.

226
00:08:48,285 --> 00:08:49,485
If.

227
00:08:52,756 --> 00:08:53,990
Oh, my God, Brian.

228
00:08:54,058 --> 00:08:55,358
Oh... my... God.

229
00:08:55,426 --> 00:08:56,459
Whoa. What is it? What happened?

230
00:08:56,527 --> 00:08:57,994
I just went to see my psychic Estelle,

231
00:08:58,062 --> 00:09:00,263
and she told me that Stewie is gonna grow up

232
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,965
to be very successful.

233
00:09:02,032 --> 00:09:03,600
Ah! Isn't that great news?

234
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:05,468
You went to see that psychic again?

235
00:09:05,536 --> 00:09:06,502
That's the third time this week.

236
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,471
She's a lifesaver, Brian.

237
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:10,807
She gives me the confidence to live my life

238
00:09:10,874 --> 00:09:12,609
knowing I'm making the right choices.

239
00:09:12,676 --> 00:09:14,844
Wow, and she does all this for free?

240
00:09:14,912 --> 00:09:16,412
No, she charges me.

241
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,748
She charges you?! Well, that's weird.

242
00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:21,818
Why would you pay her to
hear things you want to hear?

243
00:09:21,885 --> 00:09:24,053
I'm not crazy about your tone, Brian.

244
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:26,322
Well, I just think you're
being taken for a ride, Lois.

245
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,124
Like a snail on the back of a turtle.

246
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,461
Slow down!

247
00:09:31,528 --> 00:09:34,130
I want to get there,
but I want to get there alive!

248
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:39,435
Mom, why do I have to
take a bath with Stewie?

249
00:09:39,503 --> 00:09:42,171
Because, Meg, Estelle told
me that someone in the family

250
00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:43,773
was in danger of drowning,

251
00:09:43,841 --> 00:09:45,942
and that I should take
some steps to prevent it.

252
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,283
So, from now on, everybody has a bath buddy.

253
00:09:49,258 --> 00:09:50,479
Hey, Meg. Watch.

254
00:10:02,026 --> 00:10:03,626
What am I gonna do?

255
00:10:03,694 --> 00:10:06,462
I'm really nervous about
my date with Ellen tonight.

256
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:10,400
I mean, I want to impress her,
but what if I mess things up?

257
00:10:10,467 --> 00:10:11,968
Oh, come on, Chris, it's just a matter

258
00:10:12,036 --> 00:10:13,269
of getting off on the right foot.

259
00:10:13,337 --> 00:10:16,439

Now, what is it you want?

322
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,580
All right, look, Lois, this psychic nonsense

323
00:13:44,648 --> 00:13:46,983
has gone too far,
so I'm going to prove to you

324
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,585
that there is no such thing
as someone who is psychic,

325
00:13:49,653 --> 00:13:51,287
and that with the most minimal training

326
00:13:51,355 --> 00:13:52,688
and the right set of buzzwords,

327
00:13:52,756 --> 00:13:54,457
anyone can appear to be psychic.

328
00:13:54,525 --> 00:13:56,726
Even a complete boob like Peter. Watch this.

329
00:13:56,793 --> 00:13:58,561
Excuse me, ma'am. I'm psychic,

330
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,763
and I'm getting a strong feeling from you.

331
00:14:00,831 --> 00:14:03,799
Do you have a watch or
clock that no longer works?

332
00:14:03,867 --> 00:14:06,802
W... Wow. I used to have a watch that broke.

333
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,038
You see, just by asking
very general questions

334
00:14:09,106 --> 00:14:10,506
that would apply to most people,

335
00:14:10,574 --> 00:14:13,576
a person can appear to have
inside knowledge about you.

336
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,978
I'm also sensing that you
have a dead relative.

337
00:14:16,046 --> 00:14:17,914
My husband died of cancer last year.

338
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:19,115
Oh, my God. Awesome.

339
00:14:19,182 --> 00:14:21,083
Okay, uh, I'm sensing some other bad stuff.

340
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,452
My daughter was just in an accident.

341
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,854
- Sweet! High five!
- You're awful.

342
00:14:24,922 --> 00:14:26,422
Hey, you don't want to hear the truth,

343
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,490
don't come to the park.

344
00:14:27,558 --> 00:14:29,125
Okay.

345
00:14:29,192 --> 00:14:30,626
Okay, you made your point.

346
00:14:30,694 --> 00:14:31,694
I get it.

347
00:14:31,762 --> 00:14:33,329
Maybe I went a little overboard

348
00:14:33,397 --> 00:14:34,931
with the things Estelle told me.

349
00:14:34,998 --> 00:14:37,033
All right, look, can we just go home now?

350
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,367
Come on, Peter, let's go.

351
00:14:38,435 --> 00:14:40,369
Brian, I felt something.

352
00:14:40,437 --> 00:14:42,939
Just now, talking to
that bitch cancer widow.

353
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:45,107
I think I may have a gift.

354
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,076
Peter, we were just doing a demonstration.

355
00:14:47,144 --> 00:14:48,644
No, Brian. This is real.

356
00:14:48,712 --> 00:14:50,947
I believe I am psychic.

357
00:14:51,014 --> 00:14:52,515
My first prediction:

358
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:55,351
I am either going to fly or
ruin that family's picnic.

359
00:14:56,853 --> 00:14:58,688
Hey! You've ruined our picnic!

360
00:14:58,755 --> 00:15:00,323
Psychic.

361
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:07,700
Peter, what are you doing?

362
00:15:07,768 --> 00:15:08,768
Quiet, Brian.

363
00:15:08,836 --> 00:15:10,670
I'm performing a psychic reading.

364
00:15:10,737 --> 00:15:12,839
Peter, for the last time,
you're not psychic.

365
00:15:12,906 --> 00:15:14,507
I most certainly am.

366
00:15:14,575 --> 00:15:16,042
All right, Quagmire, clear your mi...

367
00:15:16,109 --> 00:15:17,210
Ooh, soft hands.

368
00:15:17,277 --> 00:15:18,444
Clear your mind,

369
00:15:18,512 --> 00:15:20,713
remove all traces of unease and doubt,

370
00:15:20,781 --> 00:15:23,516
and I will tell you your future.

371
00:15:23,584 --> 00:15:24,851
What is it, Peter?

372
00:15:24,918 --> 00:15:26,586
You will die in a plane crash

373
00:15:26,653 --> 00:15:28,821
and be reincarnated as a prophylactic.

374
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,191
All right!

375
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:33,960
No, no, not all right!

376
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,398
Well, I'm glad we're
finally going out, Ellen.

377
00:15:39,466 --> 00:15:41,868
I've really liked you for a long time.

378
00:15:41,935 --> 00:15:43,970
Hey, what the hell you think you're doing?

379
00:15:44,037 --> 00:15:45,171
Sitting down.

380
00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:47,106
Get up and pull my chair out for me.

381
00:15:47,174 --> 00:15:49,008
Oh, goodness, I'm sorry.

382
00:15:49,076 --> 00:15:50,643
I'm so sorry.

383
00:15:50,711 --> 00:15:51,911
That's better.

384
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:55,681
You going to be this rude all evening?

385
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:58,351
You haven't asked me anything about myself.

386
00:15:58,418 --> 00:16:00,253
Oh. Um, sorry.

387
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,488
Um, uh, so... so,
what do your parents do?

388
00:16:02,556 --> 00:16:03,589
That's better.

389
00:16:03,657 --> 00:16:04,991
My dad's an accountant,

390
00:16:05,058 --> 00:16:07,894
and my mom is the former governor of Alaska.

391
00:16:07,961 --> 00:16:09,128
Oh, that's cool.

392
00:16:09,196 --> 00:16:10,363
It's real cool.

393
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,298
Now, get up, come over here,

394
00:16:12,366 --> 00:16:14,133
and give me a shoulder massage.

395
00:16:14,201 --> 00:16:15,835
Okay.

396
00:16:15,903 --> 00:16:18,738
Boy, you're tougher than a doggy dominatrix.

397
00:16:18,805 --> 00:16:20,139
Do it, do it. Come on, do it.

398
00:16:20,207 --> 00:16:21,574
Do it, do it.

399
00:16:21,642 --> 00:16:23,843
Aah, yes!

400
00:16:23,911 --> 00:16:25,945
Yes! Aah, you bitch!

401
00:16:26,013 --> 00:16:27,280
Aah!

402
00:16:32,786 --> 00:16:34,153
Oh, my God, this is awful.

403
00:16:34,221 --> 00:16:35,922
There's got to be 200 people here.

404
00:16:41,862 --> 00:16:42,895
Thank you.

405
00:16:42,963 --> 00:16:44,263
Thank you so much for coming.

406
00:16:44,331 --> 00:16:45,831
Thank... Hold on.

407
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:47,533
I'm sensing something psychic.

408
00:16:47,601 --> 00:16:50,002
Ma'am, did you have a female relative

409
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,804
who's passed on to the other side

410
00:16:51,872 --> 00:16:54,273
named, um, um...

411
00:16:54,341 --> 00:16:56,108
- Polly?
- Polly! I said it first.

412
00:16:56,176 --> 00:16:58,277
That was amazing.

413
00:16:58,345 --> 00:17:00,346
I've never seen a bad show at the Marriott.

414
00:17:00,414 --> 00:17:03,649
Oh, my God, they're all
falling for this insanity.

415
00:17:03,717 --> 00:17:05,017
I'm sensing a black guy over here.

416
00:17:05,085 --> 00:17:06,018
Is there a black guy?

417
00:17:06,086 --> 00:17:07,620
Me! I'm a black guy.

418
00:17:09,356 --> 00:17:10,589
Yes, good, good.

419
00:17:10,657 --> 00:17:13,125
I'm sensing your infant
daughter has earrings.

420
00:17:13,193 --> 00:17:14,760
He's right. She does.

421
00:17:16,663 --> 00:17:18,464
Peter, you got to stop this right now.

422
00:17:18,532 --> 00:17:19,632
Shut up, Lois.

423
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,067
Don't mess up my psychic-ness.

424
00:17:21,134 --> 00:17:22,468
I'm sensing a doctor in the audience.

425
00:17:22,536 --> 00:17:23,769
Where is the doctor?

426
00:17:23,837 --> 00:17:24,870
I'm a doctor.

427
00:17:24,938 --> 00:17:26,372
Okay. Your great grandmother

428
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,374
is contacting me right now,
and she wants to know

429
00:17:28,442 --> 00:17:30,509
if this rash looks like
it's going to go away.

430
00:17:30,577 --> 00:17:33,813
Well I... I... I guess I'd
tell her to use Bactine.

431
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,881
No! She says Bactine hurts.

432
00:17:35,949 --> 00:17:37,750
She wants something
more soothing.

433
00:17:39,219 --> 00:17:41,187
Peter, we need your help.

434
00:17:41,254 --> 00:17:42,888
We just got word of a kidnap victim

435
00:17:42,956 --> 00:17:45,124
buried alive with a bomb
strapped to his chest.

436
00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:46,892
We need your psychic powers

437
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,295
to lead us to him before the bomb goes off.

438
00:17:49,363 --> 00:17:50,496
Well, well.

439
00:17:50,564 --> 00:17:52,765
Finally, a true test of my abilities.

440
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,300
You came to the right place, Joe.

441
00:17:54,368 --> 00:17:56,002
I'll psych that guy out for you.

442
00:17:56,069 --> 00:17:57,336
Peter, you can't do this.

443
00:17:57,404 --> 00:17:58,971
All right, I mean, it... it's one thing

444
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,539
to take money from a bunch of suckers,

445
00:18:00,607 --> 00:18:01,640
but this is serious.

446
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,142
- You're a fraud.
- I am not.

447
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:05,411
I'll tell you who's a fraud: Mr. Spock.

448
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:07,680
- Mr. Sulu, set a course for...
- One moment, Captain.

449
00:18:07,748 --> 00:18:09,782
They're about to announce
the winning numbers

450
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,317
for the Intergalactic Lottery.

451
00:18:11,385 --> 00:18:12,685
<i>Female voice: Today's winning numbers</i>

452
00:18:12,753 --> 00:18:16,822
<i>are 18, 24, 41 and 72.</i>

453
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,191
Ah, yes!

454
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:20,426
You're damn right!

455
00:18:20,494 --> 00:18:21,494
Hell, yeah!

456
00:18:21,561 --> 00:18:22,728
You can suck it.

457
00:18:22,796 --> 00:18:24,563
You can suck it. You can suck it.

458
00:18:24,631 --> 00:18:26,165
You can all suck it!

459
00:18:26,233 --> 00:18:27,800
Live long and suck it!

460
00:18:30,237 --> 00:18:31,504
Well, Ellen, I had

461
00:18:31,571 --> 00:18:33,639
a really interesting time with you tonight.

462
00:18:33,707 --> 00:18:35,641
I guess I'll talk to you soon.

463
00:18:35,709 --> 00:18:37,143
You're not leaving yet.

464
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:40,379
I need somebody to make
me an ice cream sundae,

465
00:18:40,447 --> 00:18:42,048
so get in the house.

466
00:18:42,115 --> 00:18:43,582
Okay, okay.

467
00:18:46,987 --> 00:18:49,422
Uh, unless you're going to pull a sundae

468
00:18:49,489 --> 00:18:50,990
out of your belly button,

469
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:53,793
I'd get your ass
in the (bleep) kitchen.

470
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,127
Oh, boy.

471
00:18:55,195 --> 00:18:57,396
My dogs are mooing today.

472
00:18:58,598 --> 00:19:00,766
No, no, no, no, no, no.

473
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:01,901
What's the matter?

474
00:19:01,968 --> 00:19:04,070
Did I say put chocolate sauce on there?

475
00:19:04,137 --> 00:19:07,139
Did you hear me say put
chocolate sauce on there?

476
00:19:07,207 --> 00:19:08,507
Well, I... I just thought that...

477
00:19:08,575 --> 00:19:09,742
You thought what?

478
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:12,211
You know, if you want access to this temple,

479
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:14,547
you better pay the proper tribute.

480
00:19:14,614 --> 00:19:16,415
All right, that is it!

481
00:19:16,483 --> 00:19:18,417
I don't care how hot you are.

482
00:19:18,485 --> 00:19:21,053
I don't much like being treated this way.

483
00:19:21,121 --> 00:19:23,722
You know, I used to hear that
people with Down's syndrome

484
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,791
were different than the rest of us,
but you're not.

485
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:27,393
You're not different at all.

486
00:19:27,461 --> 00:19:30,529
You're just a bunch of (bleep)
like everyone else!

487
00:19:30,597 --> 00:19:32,798
I got bad news for you, buddy.

488
00:19:32,866 --> 00:19:34,300
You just blew it.

489
00:19:34,367 --> 00:19:36,435
Get out of my house now!

490
00:19:41,741 --> 00:19:42,875
How'd it go?

491
00:19:42,943 --> 00:19:44,910
Looks like I totally screwed that up.

492
00:19:44,978 --> 00:19:46,545
No, you didn't. You made a vow

493
00:19:46,613 --> 00:19:48,747
that you were going to ask
Ellen out, and you did.

494
00:19:48,815 --> 00:19:50,282
That took courage, my friend.

495
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,251
Especially for a poor, timid sap like you.

496
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:53,419
I'm proud of you.

497
00:19:53,487 --> 00:19:54,887
Thanks, Stewie.

498
00:19:54,955 --> 00:19:57,223
I'm just sorry I never
got to make out with her.

499
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,391
Oh, she would have crushed
your scrote into a diamond

500
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:00,659
with her robot-strength hand.

501
00:20:00,727 --> 00:20:02,795
Come on, let's get out of here.

502
00:20:04,664 --> 00:20:06,265
All right, Peter, we know the victim

503
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,600
is somewhere in this area.

504
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:09,535
We don't have much time before the bomb...

505
00:20:09,603 --> 00:20:10,703
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

506
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,138
Okay, Joe, when I'm tracking someone,

507
00:20:12,205 --> 00:20:13,572
it often helps to touch something

508
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,607
that belongs to the victim.

509
00:20:14,674 --> 00:20:15,708
Does he have a wife?

510
00:20:15,775 --> 00:20:17,243
Uh, yeah.

511
00:20:19,379 --> 00:20:20,779
Yeah, uh-huh.

512
00:20:20,847 --> 00:20:23,415
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

513
00:20:23,483 --> 00:20:24,583
It's still very fuzzy.

514
00:20:24,651 --> 00:20:26,919
Does he have a daughter?

515
00:20:26,987 --> 00:20:28,354
Yeah, I see.

516
00:20:28,421 --> 00:20:30,189
Does he have maybe, like,
a thinner, hotter daughter?

517
00:20:30,257 --> 00:20:31,857
Well, yes, but she's only twelve.

518
00:20:31,925 --> 00:20:33,359
Okay. Like... like a...
like a young twelve

519
00:20:33,426 --> 00:20:35,461
or, like, a "she eats a lot of milk products

520
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:36,862
so she got her boobs early"
twelve?

521
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,230
Which is a real thing, by the way.

522
00:20:38,298 --> 00:20:39,632
Peter, we're running out of time!

523
00:20:39,699 --> 00:20:41,133
All right, all right,
we'll try something else.

524
00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:45,337
I will now use my psychic
powers to seek help from beyond.

525
00:20:45,405 --> 00:20:48,307
I shall now channel the
ghost of Lou Costello,

526
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,309
who will guide us to this soul in distress.

527
00:20:52,112 --> 00:20:53,579
Hi, everybody. It's me, Lou Costello.

528
00:20:53,647 --> 00:20:55,781
All right, what's the name
of the guy we're looking for?

529
00:20:55,849 --> 00:20:57,316
Well, he's an Asian fella... Melvin Hu.

530
00:20:57,384 --> 00:20:58,717
- That's what I want to find out.
- What?

531
00:20:58,785 --> 00:20:59,952
- The name of the guy.
- Melvin Hu.

532
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,053
- Are you a cop?
- Yeah.

533
00:21:01,121 --> 00:21:02,321
- You handling this case?
- Yeah.

534
00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:03,522
- Then, what's the name of the guy?
- Hu.

535
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,557
- The guy we're looking for.
- Hu.

536
00:21:04,624 --> 00:21:05,591
- The guy who's buried.
- Hu.

537
00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:06,859
- The guy with the bomb.
- Hu.

538
00:21:06,927 --> 00:21:07,593
- What street's he live on?
- First.

539
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,864
Yeah, I'm not psychic.

540
00:21:11,865 --> 00:21:13,865
