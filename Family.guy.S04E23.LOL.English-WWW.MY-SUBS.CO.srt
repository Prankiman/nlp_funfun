<i>Tuesday on Scarecrow and Mrs. King...</i>

4
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:38,582
My God, what did those
drug dealers do to you?

5
00:00:38,615 --> 00:00:40,773
Oh, they took my chest
out and threw it over there.

6
00:00:40,805 --> 00:00:42,882
Then they pulled my legs out
and threw them over there.

7
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:45,408
Brian, you're still watching TV?

8
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,290
God, you've been sitting
there since I left.

9
00:00:47,327 --> 00:00:51,053
I spent all morning watching
a VH1 special on Gwen Stefani.

10
00:00:51,502 --> 00:00:53,651
I don't know what
a "Hollaback Girl" is,

11
00:00:53,858 --> 00:00:55,753
all I know is I want her dead.

12
00:00:55,827 --> 00:00:57,184
Hey, can you hand me the remote?

13
00:00:57,218 --> 00:01:00,020
You know, you've been laying
around the house a lot lately.

14
00:01:00,078 --> 00:01:02,793
Why don't you get a part-time
job like Peter used to have?

15
00:01:02,886 --> 00:01:07,081
Ding, fries are done. Ding, fries are done.
Ding, fries are done. Ding, fries are done.

16
00:01:07,115 --> 00:01:11,331
I gotta run, I gotta run,
I gotta run, I gotta run.

17
00:01:11,366 --> 00:01:14,330
I work at Burger King making
flame-broiled Whoppers,

18
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:17,783
I wear paper hats. Would you
like an apple pie with that?

19
00:01:17,835 --> 00:01:19,941
Would you like an apple pie with that?

20
00:01:20,015 --> 00:01:21,263
Mom, guess what?!

21
00:01:21,317 --> 00:01:24,422
I just found out I got that
internship at Mayor West's office.

22
00:01:24,475 --> 00:01:26,853
Wow, congratulations, Meg.

23
00:01:26,908 --> 00:01:30,131
Yeah, it was a really tough
interview, but I totally nailed it.

24
00:01:30,287 --> 00:01:33,723
All right, Meg, we're going to
start with a little word association.

25
00:01:33,767 --> 00:01:36,593
I'll say a word and you say
whatever comes into your head.

26
00:01:36,637 --> 00:01:37,811
- Okay.
- Mosquito.

27
00:01:37,835 --> 00:01:38,692
Bite.

28
00:01:39,085 --> 00:01:40,212
- Bite.
- Mosquito.

29
00:01:40,238 --> 00:01:41,200
Ah, yes. Good one.

30
00:01:41,238 --> 00:01:42,283
- Uh, mosquito.
- Bite.

31
00:01:42,305 --> 00:01:44,182
- Mosquito.
- Bite.

32
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:45,100
- Bite
- Mosquito.

33
00:01:46,108 --> 00:01:47,150
Very good.

34
00:01:47,175 --> 00:01:49,453
You are a worthy opponent, indeed.

35
00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:52,441
Oh, honey, I'm so proud of you.

36
00:01:52,486 --> 00:01:54,551
You see, Brian, Meg has a job.

37
00:01:54,618 --> 00:01:57,310
Hey, Meg, if you're working for the
mayor, you know what that means?

38
00:01:57,356 --> 00:01:59,160
Even you're doing better than Brian.

39
00:02:00,435 --> 00:02:02,872
Hey, everybody, Brian's the new Meg.

40
00:02:05,756 --> 00:02:09,281
Brian's the new Meg!
Brian's the new Meg!

41
00:02:09,326 --> 00:02:11,970
- Yeah, you're the new me.
- Shut up, Meg.

42
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:18,231
Let's go, kids.
Time for school.

43
00:02:18,276 --> 00:02:20,363
Lois, I don't want to
ruin your morning, but...

44
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:23,071
I flushed a diaper and
it's a mess up there.

45
00:02:25,018 --> 00:02:26,753
Brian, what is this?

46
00:02:26,795 --> 00:02:28,113
You're driving a cab?

47
00:02:28,158 --> 00:02:30,112
Well, Lois, I realized you were right.

48
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:32,150
I mean, it's time I went out
and got a job,

49
00:02:32,178 --> 00:02:33,911
for God's sakes, I'm seven years old.

50
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:37,323
Seven? That's not bad.
You know, Todd was 15 when he died.

51
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:38,840
The dog we had before you.

52
00:02:38,895 --> 00:02:40,912
Hey, Peter, did you call me?

53
00:02:40,946 --> 00:02:42,723
Yeah, I thought we'd
go to the park, Todd.

54
00:02:42,755 --> 00:02:45,442
Oh, you're not taking
me to the vet, are you?

55
00:02:45,467 --> 00:02:47,552
No, no, just a nice day at the park.

56
00:02:47,588 --> 00:02:50,561
I'm a little worried that you're
going to have me put down.

57
00:02:50,598 --> 00:02:54,731
I know there's been some concern
about my sphincter's low shutter speed.

58
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,640
No, no, we're just
going to the park, Todd.

59
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:59,403
Oh, okay, well,
I'll enjoy the ride, then.

60
00:03:01,635 --> 00:03:03,631
Around the park one
more time, Bitterman.

61
00:03:03,645 --> 00:03:05,070
Peter, I'm not your chauffeur.

62
00:03:05,106 --> 00:03:07,443
Not for long with that
attitude, Bitterman.

63
00:03:08,026 --> 00:03:10,122
Ah, this is living, Bitterman.

64
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:13,480
This set of wheels is even better than
those talking cars on that commercial.

65
00:03:14,335 --> 00:03:15,820
Hey, how you doing there?

66
00:03:15,847 --> 00:03:17,023
Listen, uh...

67
00:03:17,056 --> 00:03:19,801
I couldn't help but notice you
across the parking lot and, uh...

68
00:03:20,327 --> 00:03:22,560
you know, you're very
attractive and, uh...

69
00:03:22,906 --> 00:03:25,040
You want to go behind
the Applebee's and do it?

70
00:03:25,155 --> 00:03:29,823
Huh? You want to just go have some
dirty, stupid, insane parking lot sex?

71
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,151
Chuck, it's me, Morty.

72
00:03:32,186 --> 00:03:33,571
Yeah, 'cause we could...
What?!

73
00:03:33,596 --> 00:03:35,403
Yeah, they had me painted.

74
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:38,101
Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed.

75
00:03:38,128 --> 00:03:40,443
- Hey, how do you think I feel?
- No, no, that, too, but...

76
00:03:40,478 --> 00:03:41,893
- It's not all about you, you know.
- Morty...

77
00:03:41,927 --> 00:03:44,643
- Oh, my God, what are you doing?
- Think I was like a birthday present...

78
00:03:44,668 --> 00:03:47,233
- for the kid or something like that.
- Oh, my god. Look at you.

79
00:03:47,277 --> 00:03:49,100
- You're, you're hot.
- I know.

80
00:03:49,137 --> 00:03:52,261
You know what I would've done to you back
there? Why didn't you say something earlier?

81
00:03:52,295 --> 00:03:54,130
I said all that stuff. God!

82
00:03:54,148 --> 00:03:55,490
Let's not rule anything out.

83
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,932
- Hey, look, there's Lois.
- Yeah. Hey, honk the horn.

84
00:04:02,745 --> 00:04:04,783
Ah, hi, Peter.

85
00:04:05,407 --> 00:04:06,581
- Ram her.
- What?

86
00:04:06,596 --> 00:04:07,743
I said ram her!

87
00:04:08,518 --> 00:04:09,760
What the hell?!

88
00:04:09,788 --> 00:04:11,012
- Now shoot her tires out.
- What?

89
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:11,760
You got a gun?

90
00:04:11,777 --> 00:04:13,502
Well, yeah. Every cabbie
carries a gun...

91
00:04:13,535 --> 00:04:14,490
Give me the gun.

92
00:04:20,848 --> 00:04:23,951
What the hell is wrong with you, Peter?!
You could've killed me!

93
00:04:24,007 --> 00:04:27,632
Yeah, but I got you good, Lois.
Admit it. Just say it, I got you.

94
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:31,440
Oh, all right, you got me.

95
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:33,801
I told you.

96
00:04:35,227 --> 00:04:37,252
Oh, no, what happened here?

97
00:04:37,285 --> 00:04:39,290
Oh, we got into a little
accident. It's all right.

98
00:04:39,336 --> 00:04:40,461
Oh, no.

99
00:04:40,497 --> 00:04:43,671
Well, I guess accidents happen
when you least expect them.

100
00:04:43,706 --> 00:04:45,923
That how come they
call them accidents.

101
00:04:46,135 --> 00:04:50,240
Oh, look, you got the community
events corkboard wedged in your grill.

102
00:04:50,475 --> 00:04:51,891
There, that's better.

103
00:04:51,945 --> 00:04:55,673
Don't y'all forget to sign up for the
Quahog community talent show.

104
00:04:55,756 --> 00:04:59,110
Talent show?
Oh, Peter, that could be fun.

105
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:03,272
- Do you think we have a chance at winning?
- Absolutely. I love being around the stage.

106
00:05:03,285 --> 00:05:05,503
Except for that time we went
to see Phantom of the Opera.

107
00:05:05,546 --> 00:05:10,832
<i>Music is the gift I give to you...</i>

108
00:05:11,365 --> 00:05:13,681
Let's see the gross half of your face!

109
00:05:13,818 --> 00:05:14,841
Come on!

110
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:18,110
Let's see the gross half of your
face so I can get out of here.

111
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:20,550
- That nose better be piggy.
- Shut up.

112
00:05:20,565 --> 00:05:21,482
You shut up.

113
00:05:33,908 --> 00:05:35,381
<i>There it is.</i>

114
00:05:37,566 --> 00:05:41,002
Oh, your old guitar.
I haven't seen that thing in ages.

115
00:05:41,048 --> 00:05:43,950
Well, Lois, I thought you and me
could do a song for the talent show.

116
00:05:44,006 --> 00:05:46,563
It could be just like the old
days when we used to play.

117
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:47,973
You remember, Lois?

118
00:05:48,018 --> 00:05:50,601
Remember our band: Handful of Peter?

119
00:05:50,668 --> 00:05:52,251
Hi there, I'm Peter.

120
00:05:52,295 --> 00:05:53,652
And this is Lois.

121
00:05:53,705 --> 00:05:57,251
We want to talk to you about a
friend of ours. He's not here tonight.

122
00:05:57,287 --> 00:05:59,361
Although, you know,
he's kind of here, Lois.

123
00:05:59,407 --> 00:06:02,790
- You know you're right, he kind of is.
- Yeah, because he's in our hearts.

124
00:06:02,897 --> 00:06:05,251
Uh, this is a song about that man

125
00:06:05,308 --> 00:06:08,050
and his world that was taken from him.

126
00:06:13,968 --> 00:06:16,720
<i>Noble Indian chief</i>

127
00:06:16,775 --> 00:06:19,480
<i>Bring us back your ways</i>

128
00:06:19,535 --> 00:06:24,652
<i>You Indians were so awesome
in oh, so many ways</i>

129
00:06:24,835 --> 00:06:27,562
<i>They all loved each other</i>

130
00:06:27,617 --> 00:06:30,112
<i>Regardless of the tribe</i>

131
00:06:30,165 --> 00:06:33,151
<i>One Comanche needs a cup of sugar</i>

132
00:06:33,206 --> 00:06:36,402
<i>- And the Blackfoot would oblige...
- Oblige...</i>

133
00:06:36,466 --> 00:06:40,951
<i>The only cause of death
Was drifting off to sleep</i>

134
00:06:41,185 --> 00:06:46,201
<i>And they left this piece of wisdom
That we hope you all will keep</i>

135
00:06:46,257 --> 00:06:48,023
<i>And they said...</i>

136
00:06:58,587 --> 00:07:00,080
They're gone now.

137
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,301
How could this have happened?

138
00:07:02,357 --> 00:07:03,801
- How?
- How?

139
00:07:03,926 --> 00:07:06,353
Oh, I haven't thought
about that in years.

140
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:08,600
You know, it would be fun
to write some new songs.

141
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:09,870
You know what else is fun?

142
00:07:09,912 --> 00:07:13,401
Watching Mr. Belvedere
without people talking so loud.

143
00:07:13,498 --> 00:07:16,383
- So I was thinking we could...
- Streaks on the china!

144
00:07:16,457 --> 00:07:19,444
Never mattered before!
Who cared?

145
00:07:19,547 --> 00:07:21,460
When you drop-kicked your jacket!

146
00:07:21,516 --> 00:07:23,193
When you came through the door!

147
00:07:23,205 --> 00:07:24,571
No one glared!

148
00:07:27,388 --> 00:07:28,281
Hello?

149
00:07:28,518 --> 00:07:29,892
Hey, Lois, what's up?

150
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:30,992
Milk?

151
00:07:31,028 --> 00:07:32,871
Yeah, I'll pick some up
at the end of my shift.

152
00:07:32,946 --> 00:07:35,271
Oh, got to go.
First fare of the night.

153
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:40,940
I should really pick up that
milk now before I forget.

154
00:07:42,047 --> 00:07:44,041
You son of a bitch!

155
00:07:46,657 --> 00:07:49,552
Hey, Brian, you see that magazine
cover right there? See who's on it?

156
00:07:49,616 --> 00:07:51,160
Yeah, that's Jessica Alba.

157
00:07:51,217 --> 00:07:52,790
Yeah, you want to know a secret, buddy?

158
00:07:52,825 --> 00:07:54,243
- What?
- I would do her.

159
00:07:54,295 --> 00:07:55,603
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

160
00:07:55,698 --> 00:07:58,651
I just wanted you to know
a little bit about who I am.

161
00:07:59,058 --> 00:08:00,531
Thanks for the milk, Carl.

162
00:08:01,716 --> 00:08:02,941
What the hell?

163
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:04,651
$400?!

164
00:08:04,695 --> 00:08:08,783
My God, this is a bigger rip-off than
Peter's Sounds of the Rainforest CD.

165
00:08:08,907 --> 00:08:11,241
This will help us fall asleep, Lois.

166
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:29,682
<i>All right, let's get rid
of all these trees.</i>

167
00:08:29,735 --> 00:08:32,640
<i>Once they're gone, this'll be a
great place to raise cheap beef.</i>

168
00:08:32,676 --> 00:08:34,121
<i>Up yours, Sting!</i>

169
00:08:34,168 --> 00:08:36,902
<i>Yeah, yeah! Hey, what's that
song he does that I hate?</i>

170
00:08:36,936 --> 00:08:38,431
<i>Uh, "Desert Rose. "</i>

171
00:08:38,507 --> 00:08:40,691
<i>Yeah, yeah, that song sucks.</i>

172
00:08:43,516 --> 00:08:46,181
Meg, I'm going to lunch
now and I'm having pizza.

173
00:08:46,248 --> 00:08:48,373
So if you see the Noid running around,

174
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:50,963
tell him if he ruins
my pizza's freshness,

175
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:52,861
I'll snap his neck.

176
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:58,472
Hey, Meg, I need to see the mayor
about this $400 parking ticket.

177
00:08:58,545 --> 00:09:02,211
Brian, you can't just barge in here.
You have to make an appointment.

178
00:09:02,265 --> 00:09:04,241
But this is flat-out extortion.

179
00:09:04,288 --> 00:09:05,341
No, it's not.

180
00:09:05,385 --> 00:09:07,841
Adam can charge whatever
he wants for a parking ticket.

181
00:09:07,878 --> 00:09:09,982
You know, Meg, that guy's
been playing fast and loose

182
00:09:10,036 --> 00:09:13,463
with his position for years now,
and I've had it. He's a corrupt bastard.

183
00:09:13,507 --> 00:09:15,630
- That is not true.
- Yes, it is.

184
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:18,541
Somebody's got to stand up and
prove to this town that he's a crook.

185
00:09:18,756 --> 00:09:20,550
And it looks like it has to be me.

186
00:09:22,085 --> 00:09:24,841
- What was all the commotion?
- Oh, nothing, it was just...

187
00:09:45,327 --> 00:09:49,001
Perhaps it was the Noid
who should've avoided me.

188
00:09:54,006 --> 00:09:55,702
Oh, you know what, Brian?

189
00:09:55,736 --> 00:09:58,502
It took me two hours to
spell "hat" with these things.

190
00:09:58,555 --> 00:10:01,843
I finally got the "T" right-side-up,
and then you come in here...

191
00:10:02,565 --> 00:10:05,151
You're a bastard.
Where are you going?

192
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:08,771
I'm going to expose Mayor West
as the corrupt politician that he is.

193
00:10:08,806 --> 00:10:11,512
I'm on my way to meet a source
who won't talk to me over the phone.

194
00:10:11,557 --> 00:10:13,981
Ooh, scandal in Quahog.
Count me in.

195
00:10:20,626 --> 00:10:22,322
Thank you for coming, Deep Throat.

196
00:10:22,365 --> 00:10:24,691
You'll understand if I don't
come out from the shadows.

197
00:10:24,728 --> 00:10:27,532
My identity will be safest
if you never see my face.

198
00:10:27,578 --> 00:10:29,030
Uh, okay.

199
00:10:29,107 --> 00:10:31,672
Mayor West hasn't slept
at home for three nights.

200
00:10:31,926 --> 00:10:33,463
Kermit the Frog?

201
00:10:33,497 --> 00:10:36,120
Somebody talked! No one is safe!
I'm getting out of here!

202
00:10:38,508 --> 00:10:39,863
What's his appeal?

203
00:10:42,027 --> 00:10:46,203
<i>They should make a tube
that sends you right to work</i>

204
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:48,833
<i>That would save a lot of gas</i>

205
00:10:49,267 --> 00:10:52,133
<i>But I guess there'd be a lot of tubes.</i>

206
00:10:52,268 --> 00:10:53,843
Well, that wasn't very good.

207
00:10:53,878 --> 00:10:56,040
We're never gonna win that talent show.

208
00:10:56,096 --> 00:10:59,633
Hey, now, Peter, you gotta remember
that when we used to write the old songs,

209
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:02,341
we had a lot of "inspiration," huh?

210
00:11:02,715 --> 00:11:07,191
You know, I think Brian may have some
inspiration in a cigar box under his bed.

211
00:11:07,235 --> 00:11:09,562
Eh, I don't know, Lois.
I don't think this is gonna work.

212
00:11:09,608 --> 00:11:11,982
Come on, we can't
give up on our goals.

213
00:11:12,035 --> 00:11:13,721
What if Jesus had done that?

214
00:11:18,877 --> 00:11:21,513
Why is the ironing board still out?

215
00:11:23,565 --> 00:11:27,153
That's, that's my
favorite picture of Brian,

216
00:11:27,206 --> 00:11:28,671
over there on that wall.

217
00:11:28,707 --> 00:11:32,183
He wants to have sex with me so bad.

218
00:11:35,446 --> 00:11:36,853
He's not,

219
00:11:36,928 --> 00:11:39,401
he's not gonna get to.

220
00:11:48,538 --> 00:11:50,202
All right. There he goes. Let's move.

221
00:11:52,715 --> 00:11:54,422
I say, what are we looking for?

222
00:11:54,466 --> 00:11:56,851
I dunno, some proof of
Mayor West's corruption.

223
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,260
What are you doing here, Brian?
Still trying to smear my boss?

224
00:12:01,315 --> 00:12:03,690
No, no, no, I actually
came to my senses,

225
00:12:03,745 --> 00:12:07,343
and realized I was out of line.
Uh, I'm just here to apologize.

226
00:12:08,156 --> 00:12:09,601
Oh, and, uh...

227
00:12:09,906 --> 00:12:12,512
you're so pretty.

228
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,571
You're always pretty.

229
00:12:15,648 --> 00:12:17,801
Oh, you guys are so sweet.

230
00:12:18,297 --> 00:12:20,452
Oh, well, it's my pleasure.

231
00:12:20,485 --> 00:12:23,510
Hey, can you guys hold on a sec?
I gotta get this to Helen in Accounting.

232
00:12:23,547 --> 00:12:25,181
Okay, bye.

233
00:12:29,047 --> 00:12:30,922
Aha. The mayor's date book.

234
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:32,610
This should tell us what we wanna know.

235
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:33,791
All right, let's get outta here.

236
00:12:33,815 --> 00:12:37,343
Oh, God, I feel more delirious
than my cousin, Stewie Cruise.

237
00:12:37,407 --> 00:12:40,411
I'm in love with Katie Holmes!
I'm in love with Katie Holmes!

238
00:12:40,447 --> 00:12:41,620
I'm not gay!

239
00:12:41,668 --> 00:12:44,160
Go see my new movie!
I'm in love with Katie Holmes!

240
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:45,430
I'm not gay!

241
00:12:47,335 --> 00:12:50,861
All we need is one incriminating entry
in this date book, and that's our ticket to...

242
00:12:51,998 --> 00:12:54,621
Hey, Brian. What's up?

243
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,531
Hi, uh, Lois...

244
00:12:57,567 --> 00:12:58,333
Peter.

245
00:12:58,357 --> 00:13:01,582
Brian, did you know
this couch was here?

246
00:13:01,646 --> 00:13:04,303
It's so comfortable.

247
00:13:04,348 --> 00:13:05,382
Hey, Lois...

248
00:13:05,406 --> 00:13:07,272
look how short Stewie is.

249
00:13:08,325 --> 00:13:10,033
He's so short.

250
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,153
Oh, my God. He is short.

251
00:13:19,245 --> 00:13:22,583
Well, uh, you two are
busy being nude. So, uh...

252
00:13:23,025 --> 00:13:25,681
we'll just, uh, head out and, uh...

253
00:13:26,357 --> 00:13:28,332
let you be nude.

254
00:13:29,426 --> 00:13:31,651
Who were those guys?

255
00:13:31,705 --> 00:13:33,440
I don't know.

256
00:13:33,468 --> 00:13:34,531
Room for one more?

257
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,630
Well, this is the last
entry in the date book.

258
00:13:41,658 --> 00:13:45,322
"Super secret meeting at motel.
Inform no one. "

259
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:46,822
I think we got him now.

260
00:13:46,845 --> 00:13:48,912
You know, you really shouldn't
lie on that bedspread.

261
00:13:48,946 --> 00:13:52,351
I saw this report on TV about
how filthy hotel rooms are.

262
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,453
<i>In a moment, we will
use the special lights</i>

263
00:13:54,475 --> 00:13:58,263
<i>to see just how filthy this seemingly
clean hotel room really is.</i>

264
00:14:04,785 --> 00:14:05,951
Well? What do you see?

265
00:14:08,977 --> 00:14:12,603
Oh, Jem, you are truly outrageous.

266
00:14:12,648 --> 00:14:15,501
Truly, truly, truly outrageous.

267
00:14:15,568 --> 00:14:18,390
I see a grown man enjoying cartoons.

268
00:14:19,546 --> 00:14:20,942
Well, that's it, then.

269
00:14:20,966 --> 00:14:23,540
The only thing this guy is
guilty of is being a whack-job.

270
00:14:23,577 --> 00:14:25,251
Wait, wait, wait.
Somebody's coming in.

271
00:14:25,988 --> 00:14:27,690
Oh, it's just some fat hooker.

272
00:14:28,546 --> 00:14:30,792
Oh, my God, it's Meg!

273
00:14:30,825 --> 00:14:32,613
- What?
- Meg and Adam West.

274
00:14:34,158 --> 00:14:35,582
Oh, oh, sorry, sorry.

275
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,273
God, this is incredible.

276
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:44,513
The mayor is dating a teenage intern,

277
00:14:44,537 --> 00:14:45,513
and it's Meg.

278
00:14:45,715 --> 00:14:46,731
What a story.

279
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:48,863
This is the perfect scandal
to take him down.

280
00:14:48,896 --> 00:14:50,530
All we need is taped evidence.

281
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:52,420
Well, I've got the
disguises right here.

282
00:14:55,115 --> 00:14:57,311
I thought you were supposed
to get the suit and the top hat.

283
00:14:57,335 --> 00:14:58,620
Eh, I liked this one better.

284
00:14:58,657 --> 00:15:00,262
Anything to wear a dress, huh?

285
00:15:04,268 --> 00:15:06,192
Gosh, you're swell, Meg.

286
00:15:06,245 --> 00:15:08,360
I really have a great
time when I'm with you.

287
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,550
Oh, Mayor West,

288
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,210
I feel exactly the same way.

289
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:13,460
Oh, please, please.
Call me Mayor Chapstick.

290
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:16,913
Well, we should probably go.

291
00:15:17,285 --> 00:15:18,641
Here they come. Kiss me.

292
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:22,821
Come on, we gotta follow them.

293
00:15:23,866 --> 00:15:24,622
Stewie?

294
00:15:26,408 --> 00:15:27,480
Everything all right?

295
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,042
Uh, yeah. Uh...

296
00:15:29,716 --> 00:15:33,650
Hey, listen. Freakin' shot in the dark.
You wanna do something sometime?

297
00:15:36,705 --> 00:15:38,230
Great practice, Lois.

298
00:15:38,255 --> 00:15:40,680
We are totally ready
for that talent show.

299
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:43,840
Oh, my God, Peter,
I am so wasted.

300
00:15:43,865 --> 00:15:45,541
All I want to do is make cookies.

301
00:15:46,076 --> 00:15:48,550
Oh, my God, I have a great idea.
Let's make cookies!

302
00:15:48,596 --> 00:15:50,341
We don't have to, Lois.
Look...

303
00:15:50,378 --> 00:15:53,591
there's a magical land of
desserts right behind you.

304
00:16:07,495 --> 00:16:08,771
Stop.

305
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,600
Oh, Brian. You scared me.

306
00:16:16,636 --> 00:16:18,250
Another late night, huh?

307
00:16:18,288 --> 00:16:20,482
Yeah, Mayor West keeps me pretty busy.

308
00:16:20,506 --> 00:16:22,171
Yeah, I noticed.

309
00:16:24,365 --> 00:16:25,593
Where did you get that?

310
00:16:25,626 --> 00:16:27,712
Meg, what the hell have
you gotten yourself into?

311
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:30,062
You realize he probably
does this with every new intern.

312
00:16:30,096 --> 00:16:32,470
That's not true.
Adam and I are in love.

313
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:33,911
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

314
00:16:33,956 --> 00:16:34,601
Listen.

315
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:36,723
I'm warning you
because I care about you.

316
00:16:36,756 --> 00:16:38,582
I am going to the
press with this story,

317
00:16:38,626 --> 00:16:39,710
and when it hits,

318
00:16:39,736 --> 00:16:42,010
it'll be bigger than
Uncle Sam's nipples.

319
00:16:43,006 --> 00:16:44,882
Jeez! What the hell...?

320
00:16:44,905 --> 00:16:46,552
Uh, they're called nipples, guys.

321
00:16:46,585 --> 00:16:48,450
- They're freakin' huge.
- You know what?

322
00:16:48,497 --> 00:16:50,671
Maybe we can just all
relax and enjoy the sauna.

323
00:16:53,017 --> 00:16:57,520
<i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles...</i>

324
00:16:57,566 --> 00:16:59,222
I have to tell you something, Adam.

325
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,910
You're an alien. I know.

326
00:17:00,935 --> 00:17:02,080
No, no.

327
00:17:02,127 --> 00:17:05,303
My dog is gonna expose
our relationship to the press.

328
00:17:05,347 --> 00:17:06,521
Well, so what?

329
00:17:06,546 --> 00:17:08,892
You and I know that we
haven't done anything wrong.

330
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:12,661
I told you that I'd wait for
you until you're 18 or 21.

331
00:17:12,707 --> 00:17:15,320
Or maybe 25, when you
can legally rent a car.

332
00:17:15,347 --> 00:17:16,383
They don't care.

333
00:17:16,437 --> 00:17:18,343
They're gonna make you
look like a monster.

334
00:17:18,386 --> 00:17:19,193
I see.

335
00:17:19,228 --> 00:17:22,652
Well, Meg, I'm a public figure.
I'm used to the tabloids' doodie.

336
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:24,311
It's you I'm worried about.

337
00:17:24,356 --> 00:17:27,711
You're just a sweet young lady
with her whole life ahead of her.

338
00:17:27,767 --> 00:17:29,662
This story could ruin your future,

339
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,682
and I can't let that happen.

340
00:17:31,746 --> 00:17:33,992
I'll take the fall, no matter what.

341
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:38,323
Good-bye, Meg.

342
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:40,393
I'll always value your friendship.

343
00:17:40,888 --> 00:17:42,923
I love you, Mayor Chapstick.

344
00:17:47,768 --> 00:17:49,672
Brian? What are you doing here?

345
00:17:49,738 --> 00:17:50,853
I, uh...

346
00:17:50,978 --> 00:17:52,671
just wanted to give you this.

347
00:17:53,396 --> 00:17:55,413
I don't think I'll be
needing it anymore.

348
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:58,353
I got so caught up in taking
down Mayor West, that I

349
00:17:58,398 --> 00:18:00,381
just lost sight of right and wrong.

350
00:18:01,145 --> 00:18:02,513
Thank you, Brian.

351
00:18:02,556 --> 00:18:05,302
Well, can I give you a lift home?
My cab's right outside.

352
00:18:17,998 --> 00:18:20,963
Good evening. I'm Diane Simmons,
and I'd like to welcome you

353
00:18:20,988 --> 00:18:23,390
to Quahog's Fifth Annual Talent Show.

354
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:26,172
Let's have a round of
applause for our first performer.

355
00:18:26,236 --> 00:18:29,051
<i>There's no moustache
like my father's moustache</i>

356
00:18:29,155 --> 00:18:31,483
<i>That's the biggest moustache in town.</i>

357
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,063
Play me off, Johnny.

358
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,393
Ah, what else be funny tonight?

359
00:18:42,478 --> 00:18:45,262
Uh... Star Jones got married.
That was in the news.

360
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:46,831
Uh, married a black fella,

361
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:49,722
which is quite a surprise
because I'd call her quite a catch,

362
00:18:49,765 --> 00:18:53,392
and black guys, by and large, they're
not so helpful on a fishing vessel.

363
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,310
Now, Portuguese, absolutely, absolutely.

364
00:18:56,557 --> 00:18:59,121
I even had a couple of Japanese
guys who worked out great.

365
00:18:59,575 --> 00:19:01,573
Thank you very much.
You guys have been terrific.

366
00:19:03,377 --> 00:19:06,013
And now our final
performance of the night.

367
00:19:06,035 --> 00:19:08,650
Let's hear it for: Handful of Peter.

368
00:19:15,745 --> 00:19:20,821
<i>In God's eyes
Everybody's hot</i>

369
00:19:23,936 --> 00:19:29,141
<i>This world has beauty
All through her</i>

370
00:19:32,175 --> 00:19:37,031
<i>Picture the fattest
Chick you know</i>

371
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:45,672
<i>God
Would totally do her</i>

372
00:19:48,185 --> 00:19:52,351
<i>He'd do her all the way
Even call her the next day</i>

373
00:19:52,396 --> 00:19:55,862
<i>To see how work was going</i>

374
00:20:01,495 --> 00:20:03,523
I can't believe we
lost the talent show.

375
00:20:03,548 --> 00:20:04,692
What'd we do wrong?

376
00:20:04,725 --> 00:20:06,763
Well, Dad, I think I can
shed a little light on that.

377
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,420
You guys were so baked,

378
00:20:08,446 --> 00:20:11,403
you didn't sound anywhere near
as good as you thought you did.

379
00:20:11,448 --> 00:20:12,760
I was in the audience.

380
00:20:22,785 --> 00:20:25,910
And here we thought
the weed was inspiring us.

381
00:20:25,956 --> 00:20:29,442
Well, that's a popular misconception,
Mom and Dad, but the fact is,

382
00:20:29,475 --> 00:20:32,452
the chief ingredient
in marijuana is THC,

383
00:20:32,487 --> 00:20:34,063
a mild form of acid,

384
00:20:34,086 --> 00:20:38,031
prolonged usage of which can cause
adverse effects to your sexual potency,

385
00:20:38,056 --> 00:20:42,322
short-term memory loss and can
also severely damage your brain tissue

386
00:20:42,355 --> 00:20:44,770
central nervous system
and basic motor skills.

387
00:20:44,817 --> 00:20:46,570
To put it simply, Mom and Dad,

388
00:20:46,596 --> 00:20:48,782
there's a reason
that they call it "dope. "

389
00:20:49,397 --> 00:20:51,572
Trying to watch Mr. Belvedere.

390
00:20:51,607 --> 00:20:53,821
So my advice to the
two of you would be...

391
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:56,161
According to our new arrival!

392
00:20:56,197 --> 00:20:58,610
Life is more than mere survival!

393
00:20:58,747 --> 00:21:01,421
And we just might live the good life yet!

394
00:21:05,237 --> 00:21:08,350
