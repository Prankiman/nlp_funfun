<i>Hi. This is Peter.</i>

13
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,675
<i>Don't get scared
that you can hear my voice</i>

14
00:00:35,742 --> 00:00:37,076
<i>but you can't see me.</i>

15
00:00:37,144 --> 00:00:39,211
<i>This is the story
of a great adventure</i>

16
00:00:39,279 --> 00:00:41,147
<i>that happened to me
and some of my pals.</i>

17
00:00:41,214 --> 00:00:43,249
<i>It all began innocently enough,</i>

18
00:00:43,317 --> 00:00:46,385
<i>with my stupid wife showing me
some dumb-ass brochure.</i>

19
00:00:46,453 --> 00:00:49,088
So, here's where we'll all
be staying this weekend.

20
00:00:49,156 --> 00:00:50,790
You and I will
have one cabin,

21
00:00:50,857 --> 00:00:52,191
and Bonnie and
Joe and Quagmire

22
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:53,459
will have the
other two.

23
00:00:53,527 --> 00:00:55,328
Ah, this is going
to be so much fun!

24
00:00:56,597 --> 00:00:58,130
Hi, Chris.
How was school?

25
00:00:58,198 --> 00:00:59,332
Not good.

26
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,734
I got suspended for
saying bad words.

27
00:01:01,802 --> 00:01:03,102
Oh, for God's sake!

28
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:04,704
My principal wants to
meet with you guys.

29
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:05,871
Should we go?

30
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:07,173
It sounds like a trap.

31
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,541
Yes, Peter,
we should go.

32
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:10,977
All right, but if it's a trap
and we don't come back,

33
00:01:11,044 --> 00:01:12,411
I get to make
smart-alecky remarks

34
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,847
when we're tied up back-to-back,
like last time.

35
00:01:14,915 --> 00:01:17,750
Any more bright
ideas, professor?

36
00:01:21,054 --> 00:01:23,856
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin,
the reason Chris was suspended

37
00:01:23,924 --> 00:01:26,692
is that he told a very
inappropriate joke in class.

38
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,927
Well, Principal Shepherd,

39
00:01:27,995 --> 00:01:29,895
we promise you
it won't happen again.

40
00:01:29,963 --> 00:01:31,797
I don't know where Chris
heard the joke,

41
00:01:31,865 --> 00:01:33,766
but I can assure you
it wasn't at home.

42
00:01:33,834 --> 00:01:35,001
Was it, Chris?

43
00:01:35,068 --> 00:01:36,702
No. Mr. Quagmire
told it to me.

44
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,170
I should have figured.

45
00:01:38,238 --> 00:01:39,839
Was it the one
where the blind man

46
00:01:39,906 --> 00:01:42,341
walks by the fish market and
says, "Good morning, ladies"?

47
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:44,210
I told you that one!

48
00:01:44,277 --> 00:01:45,511
You told me that one.

49
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:46,846
I sure did.

50
00:01:46,913 --> 00:01:48,681
We enjoy
each other's company.

51
00:01:52,653 --> 00:01:53,886
Hey, Quagmire.

52
00:01:53,954 --> 00:01:55,554
You know, you got Chris
suspended from school

53
00:01:55,622 --> 00:01:56,889
for telling one of
your dirty jokes.

54
00:01:56,957 --> 00:01:58,190
Oh, gosh, Peter, I'm sorry.

55
00:01:58,258 --> 00:01:59,725
You want me to talk to him?

56
00:01:59,793 --> 00:02:00,826
Well, no, actually, I...

57
00:02:00,894 --> 00:02:02,294
I want you to tell
me the joke.

58
00:02:02,362 --> 00:02:03,562
Yeah, tell us the joke.

59
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,064
You want to hear it?
All right.

60
00:02:05,132 --> 00:02:07,166
So, this chick meets a guy
at a bar, and...

61
00:02:10,604 --> 00:02:12,905
P.S. Your vagina's in the sink.

62
00:02:15,842 --> 00:02:17,743
Oh, God!
I pooped my pants!

63
00:02:17,811 --> 00:02:20,713
It's funny when it happens 
to other people.

64
00:02:23,116 --> 00:02:25,785
Yuck. That's the end
of those underwears.

65
00:02:25,852 --> 00:02:27,953
I didn't know what to do,
so I took them off

66
00:02:28,021 --> 00:02:30,156
and hummed them at the wall,
and they started sliding down

67
00:02:30,223 --> 00:02:31,190
like one of them
sticky octopuses.

68
00:02:31,258 --> 00:02:32,358
Well, it's a pretty funny joke,

69
00:02:32,426 --> 00:02:33,559
you know,
when you think about it.

70
00:02:33,627 --> 00:02:34,894
"Your vagina's in the sink."

71
00:02:34,961 --> 00:02:36,662
Damn it!

72
00:02:38,031 --> 00:02:40,399
Wow. He poops every time
he hears that joke.

73
00:02:40,467 --> 00:02:41,767
Yeah.

74
00:02:41,835 --> 00:02:43,703
He does, doesn't he?

75
00:02:49,242 --> 00:02:50,676
Get out of here,
Quagmire,

76
00:02:50,744 --> 00:02:52,478
I just put on
clean pants.

77
00:02:55,315 --> 00:02:57,249
Who's texted me?

78
00:02:57,317 --> 00:02:59,051
Damn it!

79
00:03:01,722 --> 00:03:02,988
Stop it, you guys,

80
00:03:03,056 --> 00:03:04,724
you're ruining all my clothes!

81
00:03:11,898 --> 00:03:13,966
Okay, Quagmire,
he's asleep.

82
00:03:28,982 --> 00:03:30,015
Peter!

83
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,684
You just pooped
all over the bed!

84
00:03:31,752 --> 00:03:35,821
When you poop in your dreams,
you poop for real.

85
00:03:39,926 --> 00:03:41,727
Hello, fellas.

86
00:03:41,795 --> 00:03:43,462
Hey, Pete...
Hey, those are my pants.

87
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,730
That's right.
Thought I'd come by

88
00:03:44,798 --> 00:03:46,465
and see if you have
any jokes to tell.

89
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:47,833
I enjoy a joke.

90
00:03:47,901 --> 00:03:49,168
I don't know.

91
00:03:49,236 --> 00:03:51,270
I want to tell the joke,
but I like those pants.

92
00:03:51,338 --> 00:03:52,471
I'll tell the joke.

93
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:53,806
Go ahead, Joe. I'm all anus.

94
00:03:53,874 --> 00:03:55,040
Joe, don't you dare.

95
00:03:55,108 --> 00:03:56,242
I'll push you straight
into traffic.

96
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:57,409
Peter, you win.

97
00:03:57,477 --> 00:03:59,078
All right, I won't
tell the joke anymore.

98
00:03:59,146 --> 00:04:00,579
You know, I... I got
to admit, Quagmire,

99
00:04:00,647 --> 00:04:01,947
despite all the problems,

100
00:04:02,015 --> 00:04:03,382
that joke is
freaking hilarious.

101
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,317
- Where'd you hear it?
- Bruce told it to me.

102
00:04:05,385 --> 00:04:06,619
No way Bruce came
up with that.

103
00:04:06,686 --> 00:04:07,853
Where'd he hear it?

104
00:04:07,921 --> 00:04:09,221
I don't know...
probably just around.

105
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:11,690
I mean, where does any
dirty joke come from?

106
00:04:11,758 --> 00:04:12,925
Hey, you know,
Joe is right.

107
00:04:12,993 --> 00:04:14,093
There's a million
of them.

108
00:04:14,161 --> 00:04:15,561
They got to be coming
from somewhere.

109
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:17,530
I mean, somebody's got to
be making these things up.

110
00:04:17,597 --> 00:04:18,931
- Well, who?
- I don't know.

111
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:21,066
But haven't you ever
wanted to find out?

112
00:04:21,134 --> 00:04:23,502
Well, yeah, but how
would anyone do that?

113
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,870
A quest, Joe.

114
00:04:24,938 --> 00:04:26,806
We go on a quest
to find the source

115
00:04:26,873 --> 00:04:28,174
of the world's dirty jokes.

116
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:29,408
Who's with me?

117
00:04:29,476 --> 00:04:30,442
Well, I'm with you.

118
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,777
Oh, what the hell? So am I.

119
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,713
<i>And so began our journey</i>

120
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:36,415
<i>to find the splendid source</i>

121
00:04:36,483 --> 00:04:38,250
<i>of off-color humor
as we know it.</i>

122
00:04:38,318 --> 00:04:40,820
<i>Our first stop
was to see Bruce.</i>

123
00:04:40,887 --> 00:04:42,087
Oh, hey.

124
00:04:42,155 --> 00:04:43,522
What size shoes
is y'alls?

125
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,890
Actually,
we're not here to bowl.

126
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,192
We were wondering
where you heard

127
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:47,860
that dirty joke
you told Quagmire.

128
00:04:47,928 --> 00:04:49,728
Oh, that one? Oh, no.

129
00:04:49,796 --> 00:04:52,164
I'm not going to tell y'all
that one here at the workplace.

130
00:04:52,232 --> 00:04:53,399
Too dirty.

131
00:04:53,466 --> 00:04:54,767
Maybe after quitting time,

132
00:04:54,835 --> 00:04:56,735
I'll have a mimosa
and tell y'all then.

133
00:04:56,803 --> 00:04:59,338
Look, you blade, just tell us
who you heard it from.

134
00:04:59,406 --> 00:05:01,907
<i>It turned out the joke
already had quite a history.</i>

135
00:05:01,975 --> 00:05:03,642
<i>Bruce had heard it
from Consuela.</i>

136
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,244
<i>Consuela heard it
from Mayor West.</i>

137
00:05:05,312 --> 00:05:06,712
<i>West heard it from
Dr. Hartman.</i>

138
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,380
<i>Hartman heard it from Angela,</i>

139
00:05:08,448 --> 00:05:10,583
<i>Angela from Opie,
Opie from Herbert.</i>

140
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,051
<i>Herbert heard it
from Tom Tucker.</i>

141
00:05:12,118 --> 00:05:13,786
<i>Tucker heard it from Bender
on</i> Futurama,

142
00:05:13,854 --> 00:05:15,321
<i>oddly enough, for some reason.</i>

143
00:05:15,388 --> 00:05:16,622
<i>Bender heard it
from Al Harrington,</i>

144
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,557

149
00:05:28,735 --> 00:05:31,537
<i>as they, too, had backtracked
the joke to some extent.</i>

150

00:05:44,217 --> 00:05:45,718
Can you play our song?

158
00:05:45,785 --> 00:05:47,720
<i>Okay,
lead singer from Asia.</i>

159
00:05:47,787 --> 00:05:51,891
♪ Now, sure as the sun
will cross the sky ♪

160
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:55,261
♪ this lie is over... ♪

161
00:05:58,598 --> 00:06:00,666
We can't go
to Virginia, Peter.

162
00:06:00,734 --> 00:06:03,035
Bonnie and Lois planned
that couples weekend to Maine.

163
00:06:03,103 --> 00:06:05,037
We're supposed to leave
in the morning.

164
00:06:05,105 --> 00:06:06,472
Yeah, Peter,
we've looked long enough.

165
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:08,274
Maybe the joke
doesn't have a source.

166
00:06:08,341 --> 00:06:10,242
Don't be stupid.
Somebody had to have made it up.

167
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,710
And we're going to find out who.

168
00:06:11,778 --> 00:06:13,212
Besides, this will be
way more fun

169
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,047
than hanging out
in Maine with the wives,

170
00:06:15,115 --> 00:06:16,482
sitting around
a campfire,

171
00:06:16,549 --> 00:06:18,651
listening to Lois
tell grocery stories.

172
00:06:18,718 --> 00:06:21,754
"Oh, Peter,
you should have been there.

173
00:06:21,821 --> 00:06:24,556
"Uncle Ben's converted
brown rice was on sale.

174
00:06:24,624 --> 00:06:28,093
They marked it down
from $12 to... to three..."

175
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:30,496
Whatever... I don't know
how much rice is,

176
00:06:30,563 --> 00:06:31,864
but you know
what I'm saying.

177
00:06:38,405 --> 00:06:40,406
Okay, Peter,
I've got the directions.

178
00:06:40,473 --> 00:06:42,174
Head north
on the turnpike.

179
00:06:42,242 --> 00:06:44,143
That's going to be
the quickest route to Maine.

180
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,377
Sure, Lois.

181
00:06:49,382 --> 00:06:51,884
Say, ladies, I was wondering
if you could tell me...

182
00:06:51,952 --> 00:06:53,585
what was childbirth like?

183
00:06:53,653 --> 00:06:55,988
Oh, Glenn,
you have no idea.

184
00:06:56,056 --> 00:06:58,324
It's something no man
could understand.

185
00:06:58,391 --> 00:07:01,994
Think of the most intense
pain you've ever felt,

186
00:07:02,062 --> 00:07:04,897
and imagine feeling
that for hours.

187
00:07:04,965 --> 00:07:06,498
<i>Well, and then,
by the eighth month,</i>

188
00:07:06,566 --> 00:07:09,234
<i>I had hemorrhoids that hung
like bunches of grapes.</i>

189
00:07:09,302 --> 00:07:12,705
<i>And then, they said
I was four centimeters dilated.</i>

190
00:07:12,772 --> 00:07:14,673
They didn't think I was far
enough, but I was like,

191
00:07:14,741 --> 00:07:17,676
<i>"I can tell you I'm far enough."</i>

192
00:07:17,744 --> 00:07:20,212
And that's when
Chris was born.

193
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,047
Gosh, that's all
so fascinating.

194
00:07:22,115 --> 00:07:23,582
Let me ask you
something else.

195
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,951
Have you girls ever worked
in an office with other women

196
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:27,920
who you have negative things
to say about?

197
00:07:27,988 --> 00:07:29,254
- Oh, God, yes.
- Oh, my God.

198
00:07:29,322 --> 00:07:30,522
Quagmire, shut up.
We're here.

199
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:34,400
You drove us to Virginia?!

200
00:07:34,489 --> 00:07:36,257
All right, look, we're sorry
we deceived you girls,

201
00:07:36,324 --> 00:07:37,658
but this is important.

202
00:07:37,726 --> 00:07:40,527
The trail leads to a bartender
who works here.

203
00:07:40,595 --> 00:07:42,963
He could be the source
of the dirty joke.

204
00:07:49,738 --> 00:07:52,439
Hi, there. What can I do
for you gentlemen?

205
00:07:52,507 --> 00:07:54,074
We've traveled a very long way

206
00:07:54,142 --> 00:07:55,943
to find out
where you heard this joke.

207
00:07:56,011 --> 00:07:58,279
Oh...

208
00:07:58,346 --> 00:07:59,980
I remember that.

209
00:08:00,048 --> 00:08:01,749
I heard it from that guy.

210
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:04,785
Cleveland?!

211
00:08:04,853 --> 00:08:06,120
Hey, fellas.

212
00:08:06,187 --> 00:08:07,421
Holy crap!

213
00:08:07,489 --> 00:08:09,089
Who knew we'd run
into you here?

214
00:08:09,157 --> 00:08:11,392
Except everyone,
if Fox ruined it in the promos.

215
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:13,294
What a surprise this is.

216
00:08:17,766 --> 00:08:20,467
Donna, it's so nice of you
to invite us to stay here.

217
00:08:20,535 --> 00:08:22,102
Oh, Lois,
it's my pleasure.

218
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,738
I don't think we've seen
you folks since the wedding.

219
00:08:24,806 --> 00:08:26,273
Still waiting on that gift.

220
00:08:26,341 --> 00:08:28,742
The gift was the show.

221
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,477
Uh, she doesn't know
what she's talking about.

222
00:08:30,545 --> 00:08:32,579
It's great to have
you all down here.

223
00:08:32,647 --> 00:08:33,947
Hey, you know, Cleveland,
you better hide

224
00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:35,015
the markers from your kids.

225
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,550
Somebody colored in your Jesus.

226
00:08:36,618 --> 00:08:39,687
Somebody colored in your ass
with too much ass, fat-ass.

227
00:08:39,754 --> 00:08:41,288
All right, Cleveland,
let's get down to business.

228
00:08:41,356 --> 00:08:42,756
Who told you the joke?

229
00:08:42,824 --> 00:08:46,193
A bellhop at the Royale
Hotel in Washington, DC.

230
00:08:46,261 --> 00:08:48,329
I met him when I took
Cleveland Jr. there

231
00:08:48,396 --> 00:08:50,164
to see the
Lincoln Memorial.

232
00:08:50,231 --> 00:08:53,133
But then Daddy got frustrated
'cause he couldn't find it,

233
00:08:53,201 --> 00:08:55,402
so we just ate fast food
in the parking lot.

234
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,838
I'm just saying,
maybe put up a damn sign.

235
00:08:57,906 --> 00:09:00,607
Anyway, the bellhop's
name is Sal Russo.

236
00:09:00,675 --> 00:09:03,243
He knows every dirty
joke ever written.

237
00:09:03,311 --> 00:09:05,212
Then that's the guy
we got to talk to.

238
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,748
Everyone, don't get too used
to being around black people,

239
00:09:07,816 --> 00:09:10,084
'cause we are going
to Washington, DC.

240
00:09:10,151 --> 00:09:11,685
Now, wait a minute, Peter.

241
00:09:11,753 --> 00:09:14,221
Donna's been nice enough to
invite us to stay the weekend,

242
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:15,789
and frankly,
that sounds better

243
00:09:15,857 --> 00:09:17,624
than continuing this
wild-goose chase.

244
00:09:17,692 --> 00:09:19,993
Well, Lois, if you
and Bonnie want to stay here,

245
00:09:20,061 --> 00:09:21,795
maybe Cleveland could join us.

246
00:09:21,863 --> 00:09:23,197
Yeah, it'd be
just like old times.

247
00:09:23,264 --> 00:09:24,598
What do you say, Cleveland?

248
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:25,866
Oh, I don't know.

249
00:09:25,934 --> 00:09:27,401
I've kind of got
my own life now.

250
00:09:27,469 --> 00:09:29,636
All right, well, if you
have a sudden change of heart

251
00:09:29,704 --> 00:09:31,438
and you want to chase us
down the street

252
00:09:31,506 --> 00:09:33,540
as we're pulling away,
you know where to find us.

253
00:09:46,788 --> 00:09:48,188
Okay, guys, I got one.

254
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:51,325
Would you rather get
a massage from a man

255
00:09:51,393 --> 00:09:53,894
or surgery from
a female doctor?

256
00:09:53,962 --> 00:09:54,862
Wow.

257
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:56,230
Like, minor surgery?

258
00:09:56,297 --> 00:09:57,564
No, serious surgery.

259
00:09:57,632 --> 00:09:58,866
Like a blown kidney
or something.

260
00:09:58,933 --> 00:09:59,900
Geez.

261
00:09:59,968 --> 00:10:01,402
Good question, Peter.

262
00:10:01,469 --> 00:10:02,636
- Is the man gay?
- No.

263
00:10:02,704 --> 00:10:04,938
Is the female doctor
at least Jewish or Asian?

264
00:10:05,006 --> 00:10:06,240
No, but, actually,
you know what?

265
00:10:06,307 --> 00:10:07,908
I'm going to take
it up a notch.

266
00:10:07,976 --> 00:10:10,310
Hispanic female doctor
or gay male masseuse?

267
00:10:10,378 --> 00:10:12,112
Hispanic from Spain?

268
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,547
No.

269
00:10:13,615 --> 00:10:14,915
- Aw.
- Aw.

270
00:10:14,983 --> 00:10:16,383
So, it's basically...
would you rather

271
00:10:16,451 --> 00:10:18,585
get a massage
from a gay man or die?

272
00:10:18,653 --> 00:10:19,820
All right,
I got another one.

273
00:10:19,888 --> 00:10:21,688
Let Amy Winehouse
spit in your mouth

274
00:10:21,756 --> 00:10:24,291
or eat a raw slice of
Anderson Cooper's ass?

275
00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:26,326
Sign me up for Cooper.

276
00:10:26,394 --> 00:10:28,829
What the hell?

277
00:10:42,177 --> 00:10:43,277
What the hell
was that about?

278
00:10:43,344 --> 00:10:44,411
Who were those guys?

279
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:46,146
I don't know,
but I'll tell you this...

280
00:10:46,214 --> 00:10:48,916
I saw one of them
back in the bar in Stoolbend.

281
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:50,451
You think they
were following us?

282
00:10:50,518 --> 00:10:53,253
Either that or they got a grudge
against our back windshield.

283
00:10:53,321 --> 00:10:54,888
Ah, Joe, that's so dumb.

284
00:10:54,956 --> 00:10:56,723
Why would anybody
be trying to kill us?

285
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:59,893
It might be safe to assume
that someone does not want us

286
00:10:59,961 --> 00:11:02,229
to learn the origin
of that joke.

287
00:11:02,297 --> 00:11:05,232
<i>We had no idea
how right Cleveland was.</i>

288
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,935
<i>And if we had known
what lay ahead,</i>

289
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:09,470
<i>we would've stopped right there</i>

290
00:11:09,537 --> 00:11:10,904
<i>and gone straight back
to Quahog.</i>

291
00:11:10,972 --> 00:11:12,339
<i>But we didn't know.</i>

292
00:11:12,407 --> 00:11:13,607
<i>We didn't know.</i>

293
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,381
There it is...
Washington, DC,

294
00:11:21,449 --> 00:11:22,816
the seat of government

295
00:11:22,884 --> 00:11:24,952
for the world's former
most powerful nation.

296
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:27,588
Wow, those are all the monuments
I read about in school.

297
00:11:27,655 --> 00:11:28,922
There's the Washington Monument.

298
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:33,260
There's the Obama Monument.

299
00:11:33,328 --> 00:11:35,362
And there's
the Vietnam War Memorial.

300
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,464
Yeah, check out that Vietnamese
guy giving the business

301
00:11:37,532 --> 00:11:38,799
to those Vietnam Vets.

302
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:41,935
Scoreboard!
Scoreboard!

303
00:11:42,003 --> 00:11:43,637
Aw, what happened
to your friend?!

304
00:11:43,705 --> 00:11:45,172
Hey, I know that guy!

305
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,273
I kill him!

306
00:11:46,341 --> 00:11:47,508
He cry like a bitch!

307
00:11:47,575 --> 00:11:50,010
Vietnam, undefeated!

308
00:11:54,883 --> 00:11:56,817
All right,
this is the hotel

309
00:11:56,885 --> 00:11:58,385
where the
bellhop works.

310
00:12:04,225 --> 00:12:06,960
Hey, there he is.
Sal!

311
00:12:07,028 --> 00:12:08,428
Well, hey,
Cleveland!

312
00:12:08,496 --> 00:12:09,930
What are you
doin' here?

313
00:12:09,998 --> 00:12:11,365
I was wondering

314
00:12:11,432 --> 00:12:13,867
if my friends and I could
ask you a few questions.

315
00:12:13,935 --> 00:12:16,303
Yeah, where'd you hear that
dirty joke you told Cleveland?

316
00:12:16,371 --> 00:12:17,871
That's none of your business!

317
00:12:17,939 --> 00:12:18,939
Leave me alone!

318
00:12:19,007 --> 00:12:21,041
Don't let him get away!

319
00:12:28,349 --> 00:12:29,383
Hop on!

320
00:12:38,493 --> 00:12:40,160
Where did he go?!

321
00:12:40,228 --> 00:12:42,596
I think he went that way,
past the Reflecting Pool!

322
00:12:44,866 --> 00:12:46,567
Damn!
He's nowhere in sight.

323
00:12:46,634 --> 00:12:48,835
I'll ask these fellas.
Maybe they've seen him.

324
00:12:48,903 --> 00:12:50,504
Excuse me, have you seen...?

325
00:12:50,572 --> 00:12:52,573
H... H... Hold on a second.
I'm trying...

326
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,675
Hold on a sec.
Hey, pal, stop talking

327
00:12:54,742 --> 00:12:55,943
while I'm talking, all right?

328
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,544
You want a sandwich
full'a knuckles? Do ya?

329
00:12:57,612 --> 00:12:58,645
All right, that's it.

330
00:12:58,713 --> 00:12:59,580
Cleveland,
you take Cleveland.

331
00:12:59,647 --> 00:13:00,714
Joe, you take Joe.

332
00:13:00,782 --> 00:13:01,982
Quagmire,
you take Quagmire

333
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,884
and I'll get
Fatty McLoudmouth.

334
00:13:08,957 --> 00:13:11,091
It's no use, Peter.

335
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,593
We've lost him.

336
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,561
<i>Our journey
had abruptly ended,</i>

337
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:16,163
<i>and the trail had gone cold.</i>

338
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:20,167
Well, I guess

339
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:22,269
we're never gonna find
the source of that joke.

340
00:13:22,337 --> 00:13:23,770
I guess there's
nothing to do now

341
00:13:23,838 --> 00:13:25,238
but head back home.

342
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:26,373
Stop right
where you are!

343
00:13:27,108 --> 00:13:27,941
Down on the ground!

344
00:13:29,944 --> 00:13:32,012
<i>We were all terrified
that this would prove</i>

345
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,414
<i>to be an unexpected end
to our journey.</i>

346
00:13:34,482 --> 00:13:38,118
<i>But little did we know,
our journey was far from over.</i>

347
00:13:40,788 --> 00:13:41,655
Aah!
Aah!

348
00:13:41,723 --> 00:13:42,689
Ooh!
Oh!

349
00:13:45,093 --> 00:13:46,827
All right, did you get
the parking validated?

350
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:48,128
Ugh! No.

351
00:13:48,196 --> 00:13:49,863
That was the
whole reason we walked

352
00:13:49,893 --> 00:13:50,931
through Crate & Barrel.

353
00:13:54,451 --> 00:13:57,087
<i>We'd been captured,
tied up and kidnapped.</i>

354
00:13:57,242 --> 00:13:58,976
<i>And as if
that weren't bad enough,</i>

355
00:13:59,044 --> 00:14:00,678
<i>we found ourselves
on a plane,</i>

356
00:14:00,745 --> 00:14:02,112
<i>headed to an
unknown destination.</i>

357
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,914
Where the hell
are they takin' us?

358
00:14:03,982 --> 00:14:06,316
I don't know,
but I got a bad feeling.

359
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:09,720
Every plane.

360
00:14:09,788 --> 00:14:11,822
Every plane there's gotta be
a crying baby

361
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,624
and a mother ignoring it.

362
00:14:13,692 --> 00:14:17,461
Yes, he's crying.
Babies cry.

363
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:19,963
<i>After flying
for what seemed like hours,</i>

364
00:14:20,031 --> 00:14:22,599
<i>we found ourselves approaching
a strange island</i>

365
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:24,101
<i>on the horizon.</i>

366
00:15:05,777 --> 00:15:07,611
What the hell
is this place?

367
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:10,247
It is that which you have been
seeking, gentlemen.

368
00:15:10,315 --> 00:15:11,248
Who are you?

369
00:15:11,316 --> 00:15:12,750
I am the dean.

370
00:15:12,817 --> 00:15:14,118
The dean of what?

371
00:15:14,185 --> 00:15:17,521
The Dean of the Secret Order
of Dirty Joke Writers.

372
00:15:22,494 --> 00:15:24,361
Wow.

373
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:26,430
So these are
the people who write

374
00:15:26,498 --> 00:15:28,165
all the world's dirty jokes?

375
00:15:28,233 --> 00:15:29,600
Indeed they are.

376
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:31,235
Hey, isn't that
Stephen Hawking?

377
00:15:31,302 --> 00:15:33,537
So the housewife tells the plumber,

378
00:15:33,605 --> 00:15:36,140
"Okay, you cleaned my pipes,

379
00:15:36,207 --> 00:15:39,510
now get to work on that sink."

380
00:15:41,913 --> 00:15:43,213
And there's Bill Gates.

381
00:15:43,281 --> 00:15:44,648
Is there some joke area

382
00:15:44,716 --> 00:15:46,350
of a beaver eating
a woodpecker?

383
00:15:46,417 --> 00:15:48,185
Is that something...?
Would that work?

384
00:15:48,253 --> 00:15:51,255
Wow. These are some
of the world's smartest people.

385
00:15:51,322 --> 00:15:52,422
Not a lot of women.

386
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,892
Yeah, not a lot
of women.

387
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,693
What are they all doing here?

388
00:15:56,761 --> 00:15:59,029
Well, many of the world's
greatest geniuses

389
00:15:59,097 --> 00:16:00,798
secretly devote themselves

390
00:16:00,865 --> 00:16:03,200
to coming up with
the world's dirtiest jokes.

391
00:16:03,268 --> 00:16:05,435
Oh, it's been that way
for centuries.

392
00:16:05,503 --> 00:16:07,104
Great men such
as Ben Franklin,

393
00:16:07,172 --> 00:16:10,307
Charles Dickens,
Albert Einstein.

394
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,508
Shakespeare,
of course.

395
00:16:11,576 --> 00:16:13,343
I got a spear you can shake.

396
00:16:13,411 --> 00:16:15,746
Ha! There you go, put that in
one of your jokes.

397
00:16:15,814 --> 00:16:17,948
Let me show you around.

398
00:16:19,417 --> 00:16:20,784
From this room,

399
00:16:20,852 --> 00:16:23,620
we can see the entire
world's joke supply.

400
00:16:23,688 --> 00:16:27,024
This way we can tailor jokes
to where the need is greatest.

401
00:16:27,091 --> 00:16:29,459
Sir, we have a Best Man giving
a toast at a wedding,

402
00:16:29,527 --> 00:16:30,527
and he is just bombing.

403
00:16:30,595 --> 00:16:31,662
Put it up on the screen.

404
00:16:32,664 --> 00:16:35,499
Jim's...
Jim's so clumsy,

405
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:38,902
it's like he's got two
left feet and left hands.

406
00:16:40,572 --> 00:16:42,940
Permission to go to the
"Bride Is a Whore" file, sir.

407
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,007
Permission granted.

408
00:16:45,476 --> 00:16:47,644
Anyway, if Sheila was
a road sign,

409
00:16:47,712 --> 00:16:49,680
it would read "Open Trench."

410
00:16:57,021 --> 00:17:00,390
Well, gentlemen,
I hope you've enjoyed

411
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:01,725
the tour of our facility.

412
00:17:01,793 --> 00:17:03,093
This was amazing!

413
00:17:03,161 --> 00:17:04,461
Guys, we did it!

414
00:17:04,529 --> 00:17:07,231
We found the source of the
world's dirty jokes!

415
00:17:07,298 --> 00:17:10,033
I can't wait to tell
all the guys back at the Clam!

416
00:17:10,101 --> 00:17:12,970
Oh, I'm afraid that's
quite impossible.

417
00:17:13,037 --> 00:17:14,905
What do you mean?

418
00:17:14,973 --> 00:17:16,874
Well, you've seen
our secret island.

419
00:17:16,941 --> 00:17:19,676
You know about our network
of joke distribution agents,

420
00:17:19,744 --> 00:17:21,144
like the bellhop.

421
00:17:21,212 --> 00:17:23,714
We can't allow
the secret to be revealed.

422
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:27,084
I'm afraid you must stay here
for the rest of your lives.

423
00:17:39,797 --> 00:17:41,665
What are we gonna do now?

424
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:43,867
We gotta come up
with an escape plan.

425
00:17:46,504 --> 00:17:50,007
Hey, guys, I can see the plane
that brought us here!

426
00:17:50,074 --> 00:17:52,609
If we can figure out a way to
get to it, I can fly us home!

427
00:17:52,677 --> 00:17:53,844
I got an idea.

428
00:17:53,912 --> 00:17:55,512
One of us should pretend
we're hurt,

429
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,781
and when the guards come in
to give him medical attention,

430
00:17:57,849 --> 00:17:58,882
we'll jump 'em!

431
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,083
That's perfect, Joe.

432
00:18:00,151 --> 00:18:01,785
Hey, Cleveland,
you got a pencil on you?

433
00:18:01,853 --> 00:18:02,786
Oh, gosh,
I don't know.

434
00:18:02,854 --> 00:18:04,021
Oh, wait, here you go.

435
00:18:04,088 --> 00:18:05,022
Thanks.

436
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:06,256
Aah! What the hell?!

437
00:18:06,324 --> 00:18:07,658
Hey, help, help!

438
00:18:07,725 --> 00:18:09,026
We have an emergency!

439
00:18:09,093 --> 00:18:10,060
You dick!

440
00:18:10,128 --> 00:18:11,194
What's going on in here?!

441
00:18:11,262 --> 00:18:12,596
This man has been injured!

442
00:18:12,664 --> 00:18:14,031
He needs medical attention!

443
00:18:17,735 --> 00:18:18,936
Come on. Let's get outta here!

444
00:18:24,776 --> 00:18:28,078
All right, let's hurry up
and find a way out!

445
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,287
Well, well,

446
00:18:37,355 --> 00:18:40,390
it's quite clear the four of you
are going to be a problem.

447
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,392
Kill them.

448
00:18:44,862 --> 00:18:47,030
My God, I've done it!

449
00:18:47,098 --> 00:18:49,800
After eighty years of work
and research,

450
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:51,935
I have written
the greatest dirty joke

451
00:18:52,003 --> 00:18:54,037
in the history of mankind!

452
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,918
- Give me that!
- Not on your life!

453
00:19:07,986 --> 00:19:11,321
Take one step closer
and the paper gets it.

454
00:19:11,389 --> 00:19:14,124
Drop your guns!
Do as he says!

455
00:19:23,468 --> 00:19:24,568
Put it out!

456
00:19:24,635 --> 00:19:25,635
Put it out!

457
00:19:27,005 --> 00:19:28,505
Oh, my God!

458
00:19:28,573 --> 00:19:31,775
It's heading for the first
dead baby joke ever written!

459
00:20:08,012 --> 00:20:10,847
Look what we did.

460
00:20:10,915 --> 00:20:13,383
We destroyed a place
that brought joy

461
00:20:13,451 --> 00:20:15,786
and laughter
to the entire world.

462
00:20:15,853 --> 00:20:17,721
Is that the end
of all dirty jokes?

463
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:19,289
Well, maybe it is.

464
00:20:19,357 --> 00:20:22,092
But Peter's got the best one
ever written right there.

465
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,727
Read it, Peter.

466
00:20:23,795 --> 00:20:24,795
"Guess what?

467
00:20:24,862 --> 00:20:26,630
Chicken butt."

468
00:20:26,697 --> 00:20:28,432
That's it?
That's the joke?

469
00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:30,400
No, this is the joke!

470
00:20:31,602 --> 00:20:32,969
Now take me back
to Virginia,

471
00:20:33,037 --> 00:20:34,638
so I can put
some Bacitracin on this

472
00:20:34,705 --> 00:20:36,206
and pork my wife!

473
00:20:44,715 --> 00:20:47,150
<i>It was
a great adventure.</i>

474
