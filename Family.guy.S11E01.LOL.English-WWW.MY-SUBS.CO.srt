12
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,461
Hey, everyone.

13
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:37,895
You'll never guess
who I ran into

14
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,197
at the market just now.

15
00:00:39,231 --> 00:00:41,699
Your hairdresser who's
almost dead from cancer?

16
00:00:41,717 --> 00:00:43,151
Ross Fishman.

17
00:00:43,185 --> 00:00:45,169
Your old boyfriend?
The one with the penis?

18
00:00:45,203 --> 00:00:46,954
Peter, would you stop
being so jealous?

19
00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:48,606
I dated Ross 20 years ago.

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,757
That's right.

21
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:51,559
And that means he had
you first, Lois.

22
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,928
I'll always be Scottie Pippen
to his Michael Jordan.

23
00:00:53,962 --> 00:00:58,349
Ladies and gentlemen,
Michael Jordan!

24
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,552
And Scottie Pippen.

25
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,737
He's also good.

26
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,405
Why didn't they do Jordan last?

27
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,406
Alphabetical?

28
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:06,691
Oh, right. That's smart.

29
00:01:06,725 --> 00:01:07,942
You're smart.
But still.

30
00:01:07,993 --> 00:01:09,627
Peter, don't be ridiculous.

31
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:11,763
Ross' wife was with him,
and in fact,

32
00:01:11,797 --> 00:01:13,931
they invited us all over
for dinner tonight.

33
00:01:13,966 --> 00:01:15,733
Oh, come on, Lois.
I hate that guy.

34
00:01:15,768 --> 00:01:17,585
I don't want to have dinner with him.
Hey!

35
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,020
It's cooked food
in another house.

36
00:01:19,054 --> 00:01:21,372
That's exciting for
life-over women like me.

37
00:01:21,407 --> 00:01:23,007
We're going.
All right, fine.

38
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:25,326
But I'm gonna stare at
his wife's boobs so hard

39
00:01:25,361 --> 00:01:27,228
that when they both go
into the kitchen together,

40
00:01:27,262 --> 00:01:29,246
it will be discussed.

41
00:01:32,267 --> 00:01:35,837
Ah, the cold car ride through
a dark, suburban night.

44
00:01:43,512 --> 00:01:44,946
Wow, Pam.

45
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,414
Everything smells terrific.

46
00:01:46,448 --> 00:01:48,049
Did you make all
of this yourself?

47
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:49,817
Yeah, I just got home from work,

48
00:01:49,852 --> 00:01:51,069
put down the lawyer's briefcase,

49
00:01:51,103 --> 00:01:52,336
and put on the chef's hat.

50
00:01:52,371 --> 00:01:53,504
You know how it is.

51
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:55,173
Nah. She don't do nothing.

52
00:01:55,207 --> 00:01:58,042
So, Peter, Lois tells me that
you're working at the brewery.

53
00:01:58,077 --> 00:01:59,477
I think that's great.

54
00:01:59,511 --> 00:02:00,695
A real job.

55
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:02,947
Trading futures,
that's not real.

56
00:02:02,981 --> 00:02:05,450
But the money is unreal.

57
00:02:05,484 --> 00:02:07,118
Hey. To real jobs.

58
00:02:07,152 --> 00:02:08,336
That's it, Fishman.
Shirts off.

59
00:02:08,387 --> 00:02:09,971
I want to see who's
got bigger pecs.

60
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,255
Peter!

61
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,690
Well, they look better
when they're oiled up.

62
00:02:12,724 --> 00:02:13,925
Pass the salad dressing.

63
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:16,177
Oh, no, it's an almost-empty
squeeze bottle.

64
00:02:16,228 --> 00:02:18,229
Hang on.

65
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:22,533
Eh, it's all out.

66
00:02:22,568 --> 00:02:23,668
There's dressing on that salad.

67
00:02:23,702 --> 00:02:25,686
Give me that salad.

68
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,956
Yeah, who's
the better man now, Ross?

69
00:02:30,075 --> 00:02:31,492
Brian, what are you
doing down there?

70
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:32,743
They didn't set
a place for me.

71
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:33,828
Not a dog family.

72
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,863
Oh.

73
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,367
G'way.

74
00:02:39,401 --> 00:02:41,419
G'way, you.

75
00:02:44,923 --> 00:02:47,125
So, Ben, do you go
to James Woods High?

76
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,292
No.

77
00:02:48,327 --> 00:02:49,560
I'm a junior
at The Meadows.

78
00:02:49,595 --> 00:02:50,711
It's a private school.

79
00:02:50,746 --> 00:02:53,381
Oh, do they do it so right
at The Meadows.

80
00:02:53,415 --> 00:02:55,133
Class size is so small.

81
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:56,734
And they really
<i>know</i> your child.

82
00:02:56,768 --> 00:02:58,069
They care.

83
00:02:58,103 --> 00:02:59,604
Mr. Wiggins rested his thing

84
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:02,039
on Jen Crosby's shoulder
during a test.

85
00:03:02,074 --> 00:03:04,575
Yes, I'm told James Woods High
leads the nation

86
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,811
in teacher-to-student
"thing resting."

87
00:03:06,845 --> 00:03:08,679
Well, it's family
that really matters,

88
00:03:08,714 --> 00:03:10,781
and no family is
closer than ours.

89
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:13,100
That's why we love
taking trips together.

90
00:03:13,135 --> 00:03:15,102
Here we are in Machu Picchu.

91
00:03:15,137 --> 00:03:17,104
Is that the topless place
in South Attleboro?

92
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:19,207
I spat on a chick there
at a work retreat.

93
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,541
Peter, just stop talking.

94
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:22,677
What? We been places.
They ain't so great.

95
00:03:22,711 --> 00:03:25,713
Well, this year is perhaps
our biggest trip ever.

96
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,648
We're climbing
Mount Everest.

97
00:03:27,683 --> 00:03:29,016
Oh, yeah?
Is that right?

98
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:30,852
Well, so are we!
We are?

99
00:03:30,886 --> 00:03:32,520
Peter, I highly doubt that.

100
00:03:32,554 --> 00:03:34,555
I mean, no offense,
but it doesn't look like

101
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,691
your family would
be up to the task.

102
00:03:36,725 --> 00:03:38,025
I think he's right about that.

103
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,161
After all, we couldn't even
turn a double play.

104
00:03:40,195 --> 00:03:42,063
All right, Griffins, on the
ground, we're going to second.

105
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,164
Let's turn two here.

106
00:03:43,198 --> 00:03:44,432
Ground ball's
a double play ball.

107
00:03:44,466 --> 00:03:45,800
Play's at second.
Let's look sharp.

108
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:47,134
Tough "D." Tough "D."
Let's flash that leather.

109
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:48,286
Head in the game.
Play's to second.

110
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,504
This infield is
the Great Wall of China:

111
00:03:49,538 --> 00:03:50,738
nothing's getting past us.

112
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,440
Good "D" behind you, Bri.
Good "D" all around.

113
00:03:54,042 --> 00:03:55,243
I'm okay, everyone.

114
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:56,894
Don't worry, I am okay.

115
00:03:56,929 --> 00:03:58,229
My voice sounds weird,

116
00:03:58,263 --> 00:04:00,781
this is weird, I know,
but I feel fine.

117
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,554
Man, what a bunch of jerks.

118
00:04:06,588 --> 00:04:08,222
Yeah, we should call
Ross and tell him,

119
00:04:08,257 --> 00:04:10,291
"This is the hospital,
and your mom's dead."

120
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:12,126
And then, he'll be like,
"What hospital?"

121
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,228
And we'll be like,
"Saint Up Yours,"

122
00:04:14,263 --> 00:04:16,297
and then... and then
that's, like, two jokes.

123
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:17,415
Look, I'm sorry, Lois.

124
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:18,849
I-I know we can't
climb Mount Everest.

125
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,468
I-It's just, that guy
really got to me,

126
00:04:20,502 --> 00:04:22,036
and I wanted to
stick it to him.

127
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,571
Will you call tomorrow
and make some excuse

128
00:04:23,605 --> 00:04:24,589
that doesn't
make me look bad?

129
00:04:24,623 --> 00:04:25,690
Ooh, I know.

130
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:26,924
Tell him I'm a
pathological liar

131
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,659
and that I've been
under a lot of stress

132
00:04:28,694 --> 00:04:31,529
because of the child
rape charges I'm facing.

133
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,431
I think we should do it.
What?

134
00:04:33,465 --> 00:04:34,832
Lois, you can't be serious.

135
00:04:34,866 --> 00:04:36,100
Oh, I'm dead serious.

136
00:04:36,134 --> 00:04:38,152
You think I liked sitting there
pretending to be polite

137
00:04:38,203 --> 00:04:40,437
to those people while they
talked down to us like that?

138
00:04:40,455 --> 00:04:41,822
Well, I'm sick of it.

139
00:04:41,857 --> 00:04:44,825
I'm sick of this family
always feeling second best.

140
00:04:44,876 --> 00:04:47,278
I want to do something
we can be proud of.

141
00:04:47,296 --> 00:04:48,713
I want Stewie,
Meg, and Chris

142
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,781
to grow up
with some confidence.

143
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:52,917
Then don't buy our shoes
at the car wash.

144
00:04:52,951 --> 00:04:55,786
But climbing the world's
most dangerous mountain?

145
00:04:55,821 --> 00:04:57,255
Isn't that a little extreme?

146
00:04:57,289 --> 00:04:58,289
Maybe.

147
00:04:58,323 --> 00:05:00,358
But if the Fishmans
can do it, so can we.

148
00:05:00,392 --> 00:05:02,593
Yeah, we're just as good as them
or any other family.

149
00:05:02,628 --> 00:05:03,661
That's right.

150
00:05:03,695 --> 00:05:05,329
You guys, we're
climbing Mount Everest.

151
00:05:05,364 --> 00:05:06,731
Let's do it!

152
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:09,166
Yay! I drank seven cups
of coffee at the Fishmans'!

153
00:05:11,236 --> 00:05:12,520
Oh, crap. It's Quagmire.

154
00:05:12,554 --> 00:05:13,804
I don't want him
knowing about this.

155
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,656
He's always trying
to horn in on our plans.

156
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:16,841
Hey, what's going on?

157
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,009
You guys up to something?

158
00:05:18,043 --> 00:05:19,176
Shh-shh, kids, don't move.

159
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:20,177
Hello?

160
00:05:33,427 --> 00:05:35,028
So we're really doing this?

161
00:05:35,062 --> 00:05:36,863
We're actually gonna
climb Mount Everest?

162
00:05:36,897 --> 00:05:38,081
How are you okay with this?

163
00:05:38,115 --> 00:05:39,332
Well, if we make it
to the summit,

164
00:05:39,366 --> 00:05:41,834
I could pee there,
and then it would be mine.

165
00:05:41,869 --> 00:05:44,337
'Cause the rule is,
the highest pee wins.

166
00:05:44,371 --> 00:05:46,606
Okay, gang, once
we arrive in Nepal,

167
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,058
we'll get all the supplies we
need for the trip up Everest.

168
00:05:49,093 --> 00:05:50,393
Okay, but remember, kids,

169
00:05:50,427 --> 00:05:52,812
the people there have
never seen people before.

170
00:05:52,846 --> 00:05:54,280
So when they walk up to you,

171
00:05:54,314 --> 00:05:55,915
quickly stuff a dollar bill
in their mouth.

172
00:05:55,949 --> 00:05:57,717
And then you can pet 'em
as much as you want.

173
00:05:57,751 --> 00:05:59,185
Is that true, Dad?

174
00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:01,120
Nah, truth is, I don't know
nothing about this place.

175
00:06:01,155 --> 00:06:02,755
I don't even know
why it's called Nepal.

176
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,457
The mountains
look like nipples.

177
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:06,526
Well, you can't just
call a country Nipples.

178
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,494
What about Nepal?

179
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:10,229
Ooh, I like that.
Ha.

180
00:06:10,264 --> 00:06:11,881
Shocker: God gets it right.

181
00:06:23,544 --> 00:06:26,412
Okay, now, we got to make sure
we've got all the provisions

182
00:06:26,447 --> 00:06:27,847
before we head
up to base camp.

183
00:06:27,881 --> 00:06:29,916
'Cause I don't think there's
gonna be a Star Market

184
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,184
halfway up the mountain.

185
00:06:32,786 --> 00:06:33,820
Oh, Mom.

186
00:06:33,854 --> 00:06:35,555
That's our local
market at home.

187
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:36,989
Okay, let's split up

188
00:06:37,024 --> 00:06:39,325
and meet in an hour
in front of The Yak Shack.

189
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,427
And my mom is pounding
on the door,

190
00:06:41,462 --> 00:06:43,463
and I'm like,
"Mom, don't come in here.

191
00:06:43,497 --> 00:06:44,764
I'm yakking off."

192
00:06:44,798 --> 00:06:46,232
Boo.

193
00:06:46,266 --> 00:06:49,068
So, I've been carrying this
really promiscuous guide around,

194
00:06:49,103 --> 00:06:50,369
and my back starts itching.

195
00:06:50,404 --> 00:06:51,487
I go to the doctor,

196
00:06:51,522 --> 00:06:53,222
turns out I got sherpies.

197
00:06:53,257 --> 00:06:54,273
Ha-ha!

198
00:06:54,308 --> 00:06:55,608
Yeah, I'll meet
you guys here.

199
00:06:55,626 --> 00:06:56,793
I'm just gonna be here.

200
00:06:58,929 --> 00:07:01,264
Peter, I don't think we need
a donkey for this climb.

201
00:07:01,298 --> 00:07:03,166
Of course we don't
<i>need</i> a donkey, Lois.

202
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,383
It's a status thing here.

203
00:07:04,418 --> 00:07:05,635
You, leather man.

204
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:06,986
You sell me donkey.

205
00:07:20,384 --> 00:07:21,984
I don't know what it is,

206
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:25,788
but you... have got... it.

207
00:07:42,256 --> 00:07:44,557
Oh, my God.

208
00:07:44,591 --> 00:07:45,992
It's enormous.

209
00:07:46,026 --> 00:07:48,194
Lois, this is probably a
terrible time to remember this,

210
00:07:48,228 --> 00:07:50,463
but I think I might have
left the weed whacker on.

211
00:07:56,887 --> 00:07:58,454
Well, look who's here.

212
00:07:58,489 --> 00:08:00,323
I didn't believe you'd actually
follow through with this.

213
00:08:00,357 --> 00:08:01,824
Oh, hey, Fishman.

214
00:08:01,859 --> 00:08:03,693
Hey, listen, on
a scale of one to ten,

215
00:08:03,727 --> 00:08:05,728
how bad is the bathroom
situation up here?

216
00:08:05,762 --> 00:08:07,763
Like, ten is a suite
at the Four Seasons,

217
00:08:07,798 --> 00:08:09,765
and one is
a tied-up raincoat sleeve

218
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,134
at a party in your honor.

219
00:08:11,168 --> 00:08:12,568
Yes, we're here, Ross.

220
00:08:12,603 --> 00:08:14,670
When our family says that
we're gonna do something,

221
00:08:14,705 --> 00:08:15,872
we follow through
with it.

222
00:08:15,906 --> 00:08:18,040
Yeah, in fact, not only
are we gonna climb it,

223
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:20,042
we are gonna beat
you guys to the top.

224
00:08:21,078 --> 00:08:22,178
I seriously
doubt that.

225
00:08:22,212 --> 00:08:24,080
Oh, yeah?
Well, so do I!

226
00:08:24,114 --> 00:08:25,648
Yeah, so you watch it, Fishman.

227
00:08:25,682 --> 00:08:27,583
We are gonna beat you so bad,

228
00:08:27,618 --> 00:08:29,819
you'll think you gave
Chris Brown an STD.

229
00:08:29,853 --> 00:08:30,853
Is that what happened?

230
00:08:30,888 --> 00:08:32,622
You're not gonna
beat us to the top.

231
00:08:32,656 --> 00:08:35,024
In fact, you probably won't
even climb Everest at all.

232
00:08:35,058 --> 00:08:36,225
You don't have the nerve.

233
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,393
Like hell I don't.

234
00:08:37,427 --> 00:08:38,895
Getting to the top
ahead of you

235
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:41,180
is gonna be one of the
greatest moments of my life.

236
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,883
It might even beat graduating
from chiropractor school.

237
00:08:43,917 --> 00:08:45,518
Robert Baker.

238
00:08:47,254 --> 00:08:49,238
Brad O'Bannon.

239
00:08:50,407 --> 00:08:52,408
Anyone.

240
00:08:57,965 --> 00:08:59,799
Okay, the Fishmans are
heading up the North Face,

241
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,100
but I've been studying
this map

242
00:09:01,134 --> 00:09:03,035
and I think we've got a better
chance of beating them

243
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,470
if we go
up the South Face.

244
00:09:04,504 --> 00:09:05,905
Oh, we don't need
a map, Brian.

245
00:09:05,939 --> 00:09:07,874
I got us a GPMS machine.

246
00:09:07,908 --> 00:09:09,075
Go up.

247
00:09:09,109 --> 00:09:10,509
What do you think?
Just go up.

248
00:09:10,544 --> 00:09:12,078
Sorry.

249
00:09:12,112 --> 00:09:14,080
Okay, can everyone
just stop freaking out

250
00:09:14,114 --> 00:09:15,848
and just give me,
like, two minutes?

251
00:09:15,883 --> 00:09:17,850
God!

252
00:09:17,885 --> 00:09:20,253
Everyone's always yelling at me.

253
00:09:20,287 --> 00:09:21,888
W... All the questions!

254
00:09:21,922 --> 00:09:23,756
All right, well, maybe
we'll turn you on later

255
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,024
and see how you feel.

256
00:09:25,058 --> 00:09:27,276
She was so nice
in the store.

257
00:09:27,311 --> 00:09:29,612
Well, come on, everyone,
let's get started.

258
00:09:38,038 --> 00:09:40,439
Brian, I'm not sure
I can do this.

259
00:09:40,457 --> 00:09:43,075
It's chillier out here
than Angelina Jolie.

260
00:09:43,109 --> 00:09:44,377
Something like that.

261
00:09:44,411 --> 00:09:46,329
I-I-I don't know,
I-I-I'm so cold.

262
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,798
She took that sad
old lady's husband.

263
00:09:48,832 --> 00:09:50,883
You're just gonna have to
block out the cold, Stewie.

264
00:09:50,918 --> 00:09:52,685
Picture yourself
in a warm place.

265
00:09:53,737 --> 00:09:55,354
Okay, I think I can do that.

Guys, be sure to look

Well, then
let's keep moving.

What are you doing up here?

320
00:12:54,084 --> 00:12:55,818
Whatever Frank tells
me to do, man.

321
00:12:55,852 --> 00:12:58,654
Hey, Sam, get back in here
and carry my golf clubs.

322
00:12:58,688 --> 00:13:00,189
Yas, boss!

323
00:13:01,258 --> 00:13:03,459
Ew. Seems kind of racist,
doesn't it?

324
00:13:03,493 --> 00:13:05,111
No, no, 'cause,
'cause Sammy's in on it.

325
00:13:05,145 --> 00:13:06,862
Okay...

326
00:13:06,913 --> 00:13:10,032
But he's still
carrying the clubs.

327
00:13:13,987 --> 00:13:15,838
This is so hard!

328
00:13:15,872 --> 00:13:17,623
I can't do
this, Mom!

329
00:13:17,657 --> 00:13:19,208
Come on!
Keep pushing, kids!

330
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:20,543
We're almost there!

331
00:13:20,594 --> 00:13:22,494
I'm feeling nauseous.

332
00:13:22,512 --> 00:13:24,797
I think I got altitude sickness.

333
00:13:26,883 --> 00:13:28,333
Hey, Brian, you want
a pukesicle?

334
00:13:28,351 --> 00:13:30,669
I would love a pukesicle.

335
00:13:33,273 --> 00:13:35,858
I can see
the top of the mountain!

336
00:13:35,892 --> 00:13:37,893
Let's move it!

337
00:14:01,334 --> 00:14:03,252
We made it!
I don't believe it!

338
00:14:03,303 --> 00:14:05,221
We climbed Mount Everest!

339
00:14:05,255 --> 00:14:07,923
Isn't it amazing, Brian?
You can see for...

340
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,959
Oh, you're doing
your pee thing, right.

341
00:14:09,993 --> 00:14:11,894
I don't really know
what the point is.

342
00:14:11,928 --> 00:14:14,263
I mean, there's no way
other dogs can smell this.

343
00:14:14,314 --> 00:14:15,531
Trust me, Stewie.
They'll know.

344
00:14:15,565 --> 00:14:18,234
They'll know
the world is now mine.

345
00:14:20,737 --> 00:14:22,771
no way.

346
00:14:22,822 --> 00:14:24,723
Oh, my God, you guys.

347
00:14:24,741 --> 00:14:26,391
I'm so proud
of us all!

348
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:27,743
We made it!

349
00:14:27,777 --> 00:14:30,112
We proved that
we're not second-best!

350
00:14:30,163 --> 00:14:34,116
Well, look
who finally got here.

351
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:35,701
You, you beat us?

352
00:14:35,735 --> 00:14:37,069
Don't feel too bad, gang.

353
00:14:37,103 --> 00:14:40,172
We only beat you by one hour,
12 minutes, and 43 seconds.

354
00:14:40,207 --> 00:14:42,875
And, quite frankly,
we're bored of it up here.

355
00:14:42,909 --> 00:14:45,811
So you guys enjoy it.
We're gonna head back down.

356
00:14:46,947 --> 00:14:48,314
I hate those guys.

357
00:14:48,348 --> 00:14:49,682
Yeah, me, too.

358
00:14:49,716 --> 00:14:51,300
Come on.
Let's head back down.

359
00:14:51,351 --> 00:14:53,269
At least the hard part's over.

360
00:14:53,303 --> 00:14:54,570
I'm not so sure
about that.

361
00:14:54,604 --> 00:14:56,772
You might want to take a
look at those storm clouds.

362
00:15:05,065 --> 00:15:06,265
Oh, my God.

363
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:08,117
Yeah, it looks like
it's closing in fast.

364
00:15:08,151 --> 00:15:09,368
We're all gonna die!

365
00:15:09,402 --> 00:15:11,203
All right, everyone get
into a hilarious pose,

366
00:15:11,238 --> 00:15:12,621
so when they dig out
our bodies,

367
00:15:12,656 --> 00:15:13,923
they'll have a good laugh.

368
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:18,844
Heh. This guy's
pretty funny.

369
00:15:29,155 --> 00:15:30,570
This is terrible!

370
00:15:30,571 --> 00:15:32,722
The storm keeps
getting worse!

371
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,357
Mom, I can't even see!

372
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:37,110
And the scarf Brian
called "a gay waste"

373
00:15:37,161 --> 00:15:39,445
makes a rather
important appearance.

374
00:15:39,497 --> 00:15:41,331
I'm so hungry.

375
00:15:41,365 --> 00:15:42,532
Me, too.

376
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,667
I don't know
if I can keep going.

377
00:15:44,702 --> 00:15:46,119
Peter, I still
don't understand.

378
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,671
How the hell can we
already be out of food?

379
00:15:48,706 --> 00:15:50,373
Didn't I tell you
to bring trail mix?

380
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,008
Yeah, but by that
I thought you meant

381
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:55,612
a set list of totally awesome
tunes, which I do have.

382
00:15:55,646 --> 00:15:57,680
♪ I got the power! ♪

383
00:15:57,715 --> 00:15:59,916
And after this, it's
"Everybody Dance Now"

384
00:15:59,934 --> 00:16:01,684
and after that, it's
"Come Baby Come."

385
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:03,353
That sounds
like <i>Jock Jams.</i>

386
00:16:03,387 --> 00:16:06,389
It is similar
to <i>Jock Jams.</i>

387
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,974
It is <i>Jock Jams.</i>

388
00:16:13,063 --> 00:16:15,732
You guys, look,
there's something up ahead.

389
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:18,868
I think it's a person.

390
00:16:18,903 --> 00:16:21,070
Oh, my God,
maybe they have food.

391
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:22,906
Maybe it's a rescue team.

392
00:16:34,051 --> 00:16:36,336
Oh, my God,
it's Ben Fishman.

393
00:16:37,388 --> 00:16:38,388
Is he...?

394
00:16:38,422 --> 00:16:39,839
Yep. He's dead.

395
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,925
Oh, great. Not only are we
caught in this blizzard,

396
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,561
but there's some maniac up here
freezing people to death.

397
00:16:44,595 --> 00:16:46,346
That poor boy.

398
00:16:46,397 --> 00:16:49,265
We should bury him.
It's only right.

399
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,601
Yeah, yeah, we should, Lois.
You're right.

400
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:54,270
Or we could...

401
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,355
Could what?

402
00:16:55,406 --> 00:16:56,606
Eat him.

403
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,274
Brian!

404
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,743
Look, if we don't eat something
soon, we're all gonna pass out

405
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:02,946
from exhaustion and freeze
to death just like him.

406
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,332
Are we really
considering this?

407
00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:08,201
We're talking
about eating a person.

408
00:17:08,252 --> 00:17:10,370
Yeah, I'm not so sure
about this.

409
00:17:13,007 --> 00:17:14,323
Oh, I thought
we decided.

410
00:17:14,341 --> 00:17:15,375
I'm sorry.

411
00:17:15,426 --> 00:17:19,879
Well... I guess
we don't have a choice.

412
00:17:24,101 --> 00:17:26,803
I am oddly prepared for this.

413
00:17:29,473 --> 00:17:31,107
Oh, God, Peter.

414
00:17:31,141 --> 00:17:33,526
I hope Ben would forgive
us for what we did.

415
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,163
Look, we needed to eat,
the same way birds need to fly.

416
00:17:37,197 --> 00:17:39,399
What do you mean, you don't have
our names on there?

417
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,634
My wife and I absolutely have
to be on this flight.

418
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:43,303
I'm doing the best
I can, sir.

419
00:17:43,337 --> 00:17:44,804
Do you have
your confirmation number?

420
00:17:44,838 --> 00:17:47,907
I think you'll find all the
information you need on here.

421
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,676
Sir, this is just
a piece of paper

422
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:52,378
with the word "south"
written on it.

423
00:17:52,413 --> 00:17:54,130
Can I speak to your supervisor?

424
00:17:54,164 --> 00:17:57,133
You guys, there's
someone up ahead.

425
00:17:58,886 --> 00:18:00,303
Ben?!

426
00:18:00,337 --> 00:18:01,704
Ben?!

427
00:18:01,722 --> 00:18:03,640
Oh, my God, it's
the Fishmans.

428
00:18:03,674 --> 00:18:05,341
They look terrible.

429
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,310
Have you seen Ben?

430
00:18:07,344 --> 00:18:09,178
We lost him
in the storm.

431
00:18:09,212 --> 00:18:11,064
We're headed back up
to find him.

432
00:18:11,098 --> 00:18:13,382
I just hope he's not trapped
in some crevice somewhere.

433
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,852
Well, my gut tells me
he'll be squeezing himself out

434
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,386
of a crevice very soon.

435
00:18:25,162 --> 00:18:28,364
Oh! We finally made
it below the storm.

436
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,466
Look! I see base camp!

437
00:18:30,501 --> 00:18:36,172
Yay!
We're gonna be okay!

438
00:18:39,293 --> 00:18:42,679
Wait! We have to go back.

439
00:18:42,713 --> 00:18:44,597
What? What are you
talking about?

440
00:18:44,631 --> 00:18:46,766
Kids, your mom is clearly
delirious from the altitude.

441
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,801
I say we leave her
behind and marry

442
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,737
that hot new assistant
from my work.

443
00:18:50,771 --> 00:18:52,472
Look, Ben freezing to
death was one thing.

444
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,507
We had nothing
to do with that.

445
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,276
But we just let Ross and
Pam walk back up there,

446
00:18:57,311 --> 00:18:58,845
probably to
their deaths.

447
00:18:58,879 --> 00:19:01,080
And you know what?
That's not who we are.

448
00:19:01,115 --> 00:19:03,466
We're the Griffins.
And you know how we win?

449
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,319
You know how we keep
from being second-best?

450
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,537
We do the right thing.

451
00:19:07,571 --> 00:19:09,972
We go back up there
and save them.

452
00:19:10,007 --> 00:19:13,076
Tell me again why we ate
a person before we ate the dog.

453
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,560
Your mom's right.

454
00:19:14,595 --> 00:19:17,630
Let's head
back up there.

455
00:19:17,664 --> 00:19:19,298
Plus, if we don't rescue
the Fishmans,

456
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,950
their Jewish god is
just gonna sit there

457
00:19:20,968 --> 00:19:22,585
and make us feel guilty.

458
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:25,888
You do... whatever you want.

459
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,795
Over here!
I think I smell 'em!

460
00:19:37,434 --> 00:19:40,603
Oh, my God!
Look down there!

461
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,975
We got to get them out!
They'll die down there!

462
00:19:45,993 --> 00:19:47,777
Well, we've got some rope.

463
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:50,913
Quick, Peter!

464
00:19:50,948 --> 00:19:53,315
You're the only one strong
enough to carry two people.

465
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,359
All right, I got 'em!
Pull me up!

466
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,064
Peter, we can't do it!

467
00:20:25,115 --> 00:20:26,699
You're too heavy!

468
00:20:26,733 --> 00:20:28,317
Keep going!
You're almost there!

469
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:35,041
I found a rock I like.

470
00:20:38,545 --> 00:20:40,580
Griffins, I don't know
how to thank you.

471
00:20:40,631 --> 00:20:42,482
We never would have made it
without your help.

472
00:20:42,516 --> 00:20:44,383
Oh, you would've done
the same for us.

473
00:20:44,418 --> 00:20:46,252
There are more important things
than a petty rivalry.

474
00:20:47,187 --> 00:20:48,819
We're just happy
that you're okay.

475
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:50,753
Well, thank you both.
You saved our lives.
