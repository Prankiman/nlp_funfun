1
00:00:17,735 --> 00:00:20,966
Hello, neighbour.
I'm glad we're together again.

2
00:00:21,055 --> 00:00:23,933
Oh! I think I hear our friend, Trolley.

3
00:00:24,015 --> 00:00:27,007
- Actually, it's your mortal enemy, Stewie.
- What the...?

4
00:00:27,095 --> 00:00:29,973
Don't visit the neighbourhood
of make-believe today.

5
00:00:30,055 --> 00:00:33,092
- I dare say you'll find it quite in ruins.
- What?

6
00:00:39,735 --> 00:00:43,330
Meow, meow, meow, meow!
Meow, meow, meow, meow!

7
00:00:44,055 --> 00:00:46,046
- Oh, my God!
- That's right, all dead.

8
00:00:46,135 --> 00:00:49,525
And now, Mr Rogers - Fred.
May as well drop the bloody formalities.

9
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:52,652
- I'm going to kill you anyway.
- No, please... don't!

10
00:00:52,735 --> 00:00:57,251
How ironic! "Rogers".
It almost rhymes with "eliminate".

11
00:00:57,775 --> 00:00:59,572
No!

12
00:01:01,615 --> 00:01:04,573
- Wha... wha...?! What the devil?
- It's OK, Stewie.

13
00:01:04,655 --> 00:01:06,805
You were just talking in your sleep.

14
00:01:06,895 --> 00:01:10,092
But now it's time for you to meet Mr Death.

15
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:11,569
Argh!

16
00:01:12,055 --> 00:01:15,445
It seems today that all you see

17
00:01:15,535 --> 00:01:18,811
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

18
00:01:18,895 --> 00:01:22,444
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

19
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:24,526
On which we used to rely?

20
00:01:25,535 --> 00:01:28,766
Lucky there's a family guy

21
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:33,770
Lucky there's a man who positively
can do all the things that make us

22
00:01:33,855 --> 00:01:35,447
Laugh and cry

23
00:01:35,535 --> 00:01:40,734
He's a family guy

24
00:01:45,695 --> 00:01:46,810
Meow! 

25
00:01:47,535 --> 00:01:49,844
Help! Jane! 

26
00:01:49,935 --> 00:01:51,971
Stop this crazy thing! 

27
00:01:52,055 --> 00:01:53,568
Stop! Help! 

28
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:02,333
- Oh, my God! George! 
- Did you not hear me out there? 

29
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:03,928
- Are you...? 
- Go to your room. 

30
00:02:04,015 --> 00:02:06,051
- But what happened? 
- Go to your room! 

31
00:02:08,015 --> 00:02:13,612
For 45 minutes I was out there screaming. 
I know that cos my damn watch is broken! 

32
00:02:13,695 --> 00:02:16,334
- I'm... I'm sorry. 
- Ooh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! 

33
00:02:16,415 --> 00:02:18,645
Jane is sorry! I could have been killed! 

34
00:02:18,735 --> 00:02:20,851
So, what are you wearing?

35
00:02:22,335 --> 00:02:24,849
Wow. I bet you can see right through that.

36
00:02:24,935 --> 00:02:28,166
- Chris, who are you talking to?
- Grandma.

37
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,771
- Oh, no!
- What is it?

38
00:02:30,855 --> 00:02:33,289
It looks like Stewie
had an accident on the carpet.

39
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:34,967
Oh, Lois. Again?

40
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:38,092
That baby just does not
wanna keep his diaper on.

41
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:41,087
Here you are! What the hell is this?

42
00:02:41,175 --> 00:02:43,211
Sweetie, that's tuna salad.

43
00:02:43,295 --> 00:02:47,573
Oh, is that what it is? Really? I could have
sworn it was mayonnaise and cat food.

44
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,810
Here's 50 cents. Do me a favour, sweetheart.

45
00:02:50,895 --> 00:02:54,808
Next time you're shopping, why not
splurge on a tin of solid white albacore?

46
00:02:54,895 --> 00:02:58,683
Stewie, are you upset because
you went wee-wee on the carpet?

47
00:02:59,535 --> 00:03:03,323
- What did you just say?
- Hey, Lois... Did you pee in here?

48
00:03:03,415 --> 00:03:05,371
In a moment. What did you just say?

49
00:03:05,455 --> 00:03:08,288
Peter, we have a serious problem
we need to discuss.

50
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:11,447
Oh, jeez. This isn't another
one of those interventions, is it?

51
00:03:12,855 --> 00:03:17,565
Peter, you've been wearing that giant
foam cowboy hat for eight months now.

52
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:20,408
Please, for your family, take it off.

53
00:03:20,495 --> 00:03:24,283
Hey, I can take this hat off any time I want.
I just don't want to.

54
00:03:24,975 --> 00:03:26,090
Get away!

55
00:03:26,175 --> 00:03:28,928
No, it's Stewie. He peed on the carpet.

56
00:03:29,535 --> 00:03:31,969
- Do I... do I hit him?
- No!

57
00:03:32,055 --> 00:03:34,649
- Bend down, Mother.
- Yes, honey?

58
00:03:34,735 --> 00:03:37,807
How dare you sully my good name
by spreading slanderous filth!

59
00:03:37,895 --> 00:03:40,932
Stewie, no hitting. Use your words.

60
00:03:41,015 --> 00:03:43,290
He's probably just ashamed, Lois.

61
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:46,048
You're a helpless little
carpet tinkler, aren't you?

62
00:03:46,135 --> 00:03:50,174
Well! The outrages I have suffered today
will not be soon forgotten.

63
00:03:50,255 --> 00:03:53,008
I will not be forgetting... those outrages.

64
00:03:53,095 --> 00:03:55,655
No, no! No, they won't be forgotten.

65
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,454
- Not the...
- Outrages, yeah. I think we got it.

66
00:03:58,535 --> 00:03:59,331
Oh!

67
00:03:59,415 --> 00:04:02,054
Maybe it's time for Stewie
to start potty training.

68
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:05,332
Isn't he too young? You know
what happened to the Lindbergh baby.

69
00:04:05,415 --> 00:04:08,612
- Charles, he's only six months old.
- Honey, would you relax?

70
00:04:08,695 --> 00:04:13,052
God, I flew across the Atlantic by myself.
I'm a national treasure, for God's sake.

71
00:04:13,135 --> 00:04:14,693
I think I know how to...

72
00:04:14,775 --> 00:04:16,766
Oh, God! Oh, God!

73
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:21,333
All right... He was kidnapped.

74
00:04:21,415 --> 00:04:24,134
You call the police, I'll write the ransom note.

75
00:04:24,215 --> 00:04:26,570
What about Amelia? She saw everything.

76
00:04:26,655 --> 00:04:29,044
You leave her to me.

77
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:33,572
Come on, honey. He's been having accidents.
Maybe he's trying to tell us he's ready.

78
00:04:33,655 --> 00:04:36,488
This could be a nice way
for you and Stewie to bond.

79
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:38,167
Bond?

80
00:04:38,255 --> 00:04:40,450
James Bond.

81
00:04:40,535 --> 00:04:42,890
All right, Lois. I'll do it.

82
00:04:49,975 --> 00:04:53,809
Oh, God. Not again, Brian.
Why can't you stop peeing on the carpet?

83
00:04:53,895 --> 00:04:56,090
Dammit! It's not coming out.

84
00:04:56,175 --> 00:04:59,212
- Brian, is that you?
- Uh, yeah, it's me.

85
00:04:59,295 --> 00:05:02,446
- Is everything OK?
- Yeah, I just... I couldn't sleep.

86
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:04,526
- I'll be up in a minute.
- OK.

87
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:17,331
Join us tomorrow for more "Price is Right". 

88
00:05:17,415 --> 00:05:22,170
Remember, to help control the pet population, 
have your pets spayed or neutered. 

89
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,052
Oh, just die already.

90
00:05:24,135 --> 00:05:27,172
Ew! Mom, Stewie peed on the rug again.

91
00:05:27,255 --> 00:05:30,406
- No!
- Oh, this has gotta stop.

92
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,451
Oh, God! It smells gross!

93
00:05:32,535 --> 00:05:35,572
Princess, I don't see anyone
dabbing yours behind their ears.

94
00:05:35,655 --> 00:05:38,215
It looks like someone
already tried to clean it up.

95
00:05:38,295 --> 00:05:40,934
- No, it doesn't.
- Mine smells like soda.

96
00:05:43,015 --> 00:05:46,610
- I'm looking for toilet-training books.
- Yes, we can help you there.

97
00:05:46,695 --> 00:05:49,573
Everybody Poops is still
the standard, of course.

98
00:05:49,655 --> 00:05:52,613
We've also got the less popular
Nobody Poops But You. 

99
00:05:52,695 --> 00:05:57,132
- Huh. See, we're Catholic, so...
- Then you want You're a Naughty Child

100
00:05:57,215 --> 00:06:00,048
and That's Concentrated Evil
Coming Out the Back of You. 

101
00:06:00,135 --> 00:06:01,011
Perfect!

102
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:11,733
- Brian, what are you doing?
- Hi, Lois. I was just washing some things.

103
00:06:11,815 --> 00:06:14,090
Those look like our sheets and our quilt.

104
00:06:14,175 --> 00:06:17,053
They are. I'm washing them
with some fabric softener.

105
00:06:17,135 --> 00:06:20,445
They were so itchy I couldn't sleep,
which is why I was downstairs

106
00:06:20,535 --> 00:06:23,174
when you asked me if I was OK
and I said I couldn't sleep.

107
00:06:23,255 --> 00:06:25,610
You know, cos it was so itchy.

108
00:06:27,015 --> 00:06:30,769
Come on, Stewie. Don't you wanna
pee in the toilet bowl like a big boy?

109
00:06:30,855 --> 00:06:34,131
I remember when I learned
to use a potty all by myself.

110
00:06:34,215 --> 00:06:36,206
I was so proud.

111
00:06:38,535 --> 00:06:40,526
Hey, Lois. I did it!

112
00:06:41,615 --> 00:06:44,687
Well, perhaps I could give it
the old college try.

113
00:06:45,135 --> 00:06:47,569
Why don't you put your hands right there?

114
00:06:47,655 --> 00:06:50,123
- It'll help me relax.
- OK, buddy.

115
00:06:50,695 --> 00:06:51,923
Aagh!

116
00:06:52,015 --> 00:06:56,691
Maybe you don't have to pee. I oughta just
give you some beer. Goes right through you.

117
00:06:56,775 --> 00:07:01,565
Wonderful. And while we're at it,
we can light up a doobie and watch porn.

118
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:02,690
Yeah?

119
00:07:02,775 --> 00:07:06,290
Listen, you, I'll use these facilities
when I'm damn well ready.

120
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:09,208
Until then, you shall continue
to sanitise my crevasse

121
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:12,810
and be damn grateful
for the opportunity-starting right...

122
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:20,733
Well, not now. But soon!

123
00:07:25,175 --> 00:07:27,405
Oh, and I want these and these and these.

124
00:07:27,495 --> 00:07:31,124
- Only one.
- But... but that man over there got two.

125
00:07:31,215 --> 00:07:35,174
Peter, I don't care what the other men
are getting. You're only getting one.

126
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:37,723
I hate you!

127
00:07:37,815 --> 00:07:41,774
- Hey, what's that sound?
- You're urinating!

128
00:07:41,855 --> 00:07:44,085
So, it's been you all along!

129
00:07:44,175 --> 00:07:48,054
Oh, this is too perfect!
I've been taking the blame for Rex.

130
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:51,923
- Ew! It's everywhere!
- It's OK. Meg, hand me my sweater.

131
00:07:52,015 --> 00:07:54,290
Brian, where d'you think you are, Payless?

132
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:59,290
I say, I say! Paco, grab a mop. Will
somebody get Patches the hell out of here

133
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,969
before he bends a French biscuit
on the conveyor belt?

134
00:08:02,055 --> 00:08:05,445
Sh. It's OK.
We'll meet you in the parking lot.

135
00:08:05,535 --> 00:08:07,526
Oh, God, Lois. I need help.

136
00:08:16,935 --> 00:08:21,884
Look, I... I really don't even know why
I'm here. The urologist said I was fine.

137
00:08:21,975 --> 00:08:24,535
Sometimes these things
can be psychological.

138
00:08:24,615 --> 00:08:30,372
Doubt that. I've got a very comfortable life.
I live with a great family, my needs are met.

139
00:08:30,455 --> 00:08:34,733
OK, look, so maybe this isn't where
I thought I was gonna be at seven years old.

140
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,010
It's just that... I...

141
00:08:37,095 --> 00:08:39,325
Is it OK if I smoke in here?

142
00:08:39,415 --> 00:08:41,406
Thanks.

143
00:08:42,335 --> 00:08:46,647
It's just that things don't always
work out the way we plan.

144
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,885
You know, I've never been to Europe.

145
00:08:48,975 --> 00:08:52,934
Now look at me. Middle-aged,
alone and peeing in supermarkets.

146
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:55,404
Man, didn't see that coming.

147
00:08:59,015 --> 00:09:02,132
I had this dream last night.
Did you ever see Logan's Run? 

148
00:09:03,615 --> 00:09:07,654
Last day. Capricorn 2537.

149
00:09:07,735 --> 00:09:10,886
Our next dedication
goes out to Tony from Kim. 

150
00:09:22,535 --> 00:09:24,287
We've got a runner in sector G.

151
00:09:53,015 --> 00:09:56,007
Oh. What about him?
He's gotta be in his fifties.

152
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,848
- So what do you think?
- I think you're very sensitive

153
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:03,403
and you put up a tough front.

154
00:10:03,495 --> 00:10:05,884
I think you're in pain.

155
00:10:07,015 --> 00:10:11,327
- Damn it, Brian. Do not cry.
- I'd like to pet you, Brian.

156
00:10:11,415 --> 00:10:13,610
Would that be OK?

157
00:10:13,695 --> 00:10:16,209
You're a good dog, Brian. A very good...

158
00:10:16,295 --> 00:10:17,648
Keep it above the waist, Doc.

159
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:21,173
And now Part 2 of
our very own Asian correspondent

160
00:10:21,255 --> 00:10:24,053
Tricia Takanawa's special report on sex. 

161
00:10:24,135 --> 00:10:28,128
Tom, I'm standing in the bedroom
of Judy and Glen Isaacs.

162
00:10:28,215 --> 00:10:32,652
Ten years married and still in love.
What's their secret?

163
00:10:32,735 --> 00:10:35,886
Judy has an inoperable
brain tumour the size of my fist,

164
00:10:35,975 --> 00:10:38,853
and that just happens to be Glen's fetish.

165
00:10:39,695 --> 00:10:44,086
- Brian, how'd it go?
- Well, I think I have a bit of "me" work to do.

166
00:10:44,175 --> 00:10:48,009
- But I'm feeling things, and that's a start.
- Oh, that's wonderful.

167
00:10:48,095 --> 00:10:54,568
Like most other people, I used to think
therapy was only for crazies and nut jobs.

168
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:57,044
Isn't that silly?

169
00:10:57,135 --> 00:10:58,887
Hey, Lois, I...

170
00:10:58,975 --> 00:11:02,888
Hey, Brian. How you doin'?
They let you out already?

171
00:11:02,975 --> 00:11:05,569
I was in a therapy session,
not a lunatic asylum.

172
00:11:05,655 --> 00:11:10,524
Hey, calm down. Lots of crazy people have
gone on to lead normal, successful lives.

173
00:11:13,095 --> 00:11:14,892
What did your therapist say?

174
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:21,323
Dr Kaplan thinks the, uh... accidents
are linked to some kind of midlife crisis.

175
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:26,011
He suggested I go out into the world and
pursue my dreams. I'm leaving tomorrow.

176
00:11:49,615 --> 00:11:52,766
Whoa, hang on. I gave you
one of the ones with silverware in it.

177
00:11:52,855 --> 00:11:54,846
Take this one instead.

178
00:11:56,295 --> 00:11:58,286
That one's probably fine.

179
00:12:01,295 --> 00:12:02,364
Beautiful.

180
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,774
Aagh!

181
00:12:06,815 --> 00:12:10,205
- Oh, my God! Are you Stephen King?
- No, I'm Dean Koontz.

182
00:12:10,295 --> 00:12:12,206
Oh.

183
00:12:20,735 --> 00:12:24,523
But, you know,
thanks to these sessions, I think I'm OK.

184
00:12:24,615 --> 00:12:27,527
Being out in the world,
feeling my power-and no accidents.

185
00:12:27,615 --> 00:12:30,846
- I've been dry for two weeks now.
- Mazel tov.

186
00:12:30,935 --> 00:12:34,974
Well, goodbye, Dr Kaplan. And thank you.

187
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:38,331
I know Stacey isn't your mother,
but upside-down face or not,

188
00:12:38,415 --> 00:12:40,406
you have to respect her!

189
00:12:41,295 --> 00:12:43,286
Hey, you're Tom Tucker.

190
00:12:43,575 --> 00:12:44,610
Hey!

191
00:12:44,695 --> 00:12:47,493
Oh, God, I'm s... That was rude. I apologise.

192
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:49,968
Wow.

193
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:55,208
I'm a little teapot, short and stout

194
00:12:55,295 --> 00:12:58,093
Here is my handle, here is my spout

195
00:12:58,175 --> 00:13:01,326
When I get all steamed up, hear me shout

196
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:05,851
Lois, it looks as if Puddles has done it again!

197
00:13:05,935 --> 00:13:07,971
Goodness! He's wet everything.

198
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:10,285
Ha! Ha! Ha!

199
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:13,970
I swear, I don't even remember doing it.
I don't understand this.

200
00:13:14,055 --> 00:13:16,888
Now, Brian, we know
you're not doing this on purpose,

201
00:13:16,975 --> 00:13:20,172
but maybe we should consider... crating.

202
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:23,053
- Oh, God.
- Or you could be an outside dog.

203
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,251
Huh? Would you like that?

204
00:13:25,335 --> 00:13:27,610
Huh? Outside?

205
00:13:29,055 --> 00:13:32,650
Oh, oh, and how embarrassed was I
when the word "crate" came up!

206
00:13:32,735 --> 00:13:36,967
I thought I was past this.
I travelled the world, for God's sake.

207
00:13:37,055 --> 00:13:40,934
- You know how much I spent?
- Obviously we haven't hit the real issue yet.

208
00:13:41,015 --> 00:13:45,327
Drop it. Tell me, Brian,
the last accident you remember,

209
00:13:45,415 --> 00:13:48,009
did anything unusual happen to trigger it?

210
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:50,086
Oh, no, it was a normal day.

211
00:13:55,055 --> 00:13:59,094
- Oh, Catwoman?
- Peter, no Catwoman today. I'm tired.

212
00:13:59,175 --> 00:14:04,408
What's the matter? Is the mighty Catwoman
afraid of a little Catwoman melting spray?

213
00:14:04,495 --> 00:14:06,611
Peter, no. Peter...

214
00:14:06,695 --> 00:14:08,686
All right! OK!

215
00:14:08,775 --> 00:14:11,448
Enough, Batman. I don't...

216
00:14:11,535 --> 00:14:14,686
Not so mighty now, are you, Catwoman?

217
00:14:14,775 --> 00:14:17,369
- Peter!
- Take that! Take that!

218
00:14:17,455 --> 00:14:19,605
I spit water at you!

219
00:14:19,695 --> 00:14:22,687
Peter! Peter! Batman, I can't breathe.

220
00:14:22,775 --> 00:14:24,003
Peter!

221
00:14:24,855 --> 00:14:29,929
Oh, I'm using my special cat power
to get Batman all wet.

222
00:14:30,015 --> 00:14:31,812
Meow!

223
00:14:32,255 --> 00:14:34,052
Meow!

224
00:14:43,815 --> 00:14:45,931
You know, just the usual stuff.

225
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:50,213
- All that running water. That's gotta be it!
- Mm-hm.

226
00:14:50,295 --> 00:14:55,005
- Brian, tell me about Lois.
- Lois. Well, she's a fantastic woman.

227
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:58,212
She's compassionate
and charming, attractive.

228
00:14:58,295 --> 00:15:01,810
Well, stunning really.
I guess you could say I really...

229
00:15:01,895 --> 00:15:04,853
- Love her?
- No, of course not.

230
00:15:04,935 --> 00:15:06,926
Me and Lois? That's sick.

231
00:15:07,015 --> 00:15:09,609
- Come on, she's my best friend's wife.
- Mm-hm.

232
00:15:09,695 --> 00:15:12,812
Look, I love Lois, but I'm not in love with her.

233
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:16,171
Mm-hm. Who are you trying
to convince, Brian, me or you?

234
00:15:17,815 --> 00:15:20,204
Oh, Brian, Brian. What a mess.

235
00:15:21,575 --> 00:15:23,930
Don't get antsy. I got three minutes left.

236
00:15:27,975 --> 00:15:30,011
So what the hell, Brian? You cured yet?

237
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:34,168
I don't wanna have to live with plastic
on the furniture like some Italian family.

238
00:15:34,255 --> 00:15:39,375
- My therapist's figured out my problem.
- What does Sigmund Fraud think it is?

239
00:15:39,455 --> 00:15:41,525
He, uh... thinks I'm in love.

240
00:15:41,615 --> 00:15:43,173
Oh, my God!

241
00:15:43,255 --> 00:15:45,246
You can talk!

242
00:15:49,335 --> 00:15:52,213
- Never mind.
- Does this girl love you back?

243
00:15:52,295 --> 00:15:55,048
- I... I can't imagine.
- You gotta find out for sure.

244
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:58,969
You don't wanna spend your life
wondering what could have been.

245
00:15:59,055 --> 00:16:01,649
- Sir, I need a decision.
- Uh, uh...

246
00:16:01,735 --> 00:16:03,646
Uh, salad.

247
00:16:03,735 --> 00:16:05,726
No, wait! Soup! Soup!

248
00:16:05,815 --> 00:16:08,204
But it was too late.

249
00:16:08,295 --> 00:16:13,767
And to this day I still lay awake at night
wondering about the soup that got away.

250
00:16:13,855 --> 00:16:17,689
Thanks, Peter.
I'm gonna go find out how she feels.

251
00:16:20,015 --> 00:16:23,212
- I've taken you for granted.
- Get a room!

252
00:16:26,575 --> 00:16:29,647
- Hey, you, the news is on.
- Where is everybody?

253
00:16:29,735 --> 00:16:32,932
Stewie's taking a nap
and Peter and the kids are out.

254
00:16:33,015 --> 00:16:35,813
- Come sit with me.
- Oh, OK.

255
00:16:37,655 --> 00:16:39,646
Huh, huh.

256
00:16:45,415 --> 00:16:47,133
Ohhhhh!

257
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:52,973
And now Part 3 of Asian correspondent
Tricia Takanawa's special report on sex. 

258
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:54,807
Thank you, Diane.

259
00:16:54,895 --> 00:16:58,092
Sex-some people have it anonymously.

260
00:16:58,175 --> 00:17:01,167
"What kind of person would do that?"
you might ask.

261
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:03,928
Well, I'm about to find out.

262
00:17:04,015 --> 00:17:07,246
I just picked up
a complete stranger in a hotel bar

263
00:17:07,335 --> 00:17:12,011
and he's in the bathroom right now,
possibly doing drugs.

264
00:17:12,095 --> 00:17:15,770
Watch as I have sex with
this potentially dangerous man,

265
00:17:15,855 --> 00:17:18,847
as we take you in-depth and undercover.

266
00:17:18,935 --> 00:17:22,530
I've never had a Spanish chick before. Olé!

267
00:17:22,935 --> 00:17:27,451
It is so refreshing to see something
other than violence on the news.

268
00:17:27,535 --> 00:17:30,971
- Your tail keeps hitting me.
- If it's bothering you, I can stop.

269
00:17:31,055 --> 00:17:34,889
That's OK. The breeze feels good.
It's so warm in here.

270
00:17:36,415 --> 00:17:38,167
Ooh.

271
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,692
That's better.

272
00:17:40,775 --> 00:17:44,211
I'd take my sweater off,
but I'm afraid it's attached to my skin.

273
00:17:45,655 --> 00:17:47,452
Mm.

274
00:17:47,535 --> 00:17:49,093
Smooth.

275
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,930
Well, I'd better go start dinner.

276
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,728
Oh!

277
00:17:58,815 --> 00:18:01,204
Well, well, well!

278
00:18:01,895 --> 00:18:03,487
How long have you been there?

279
00:18:03,575 --> 00:18:06,772
I came about the time you started
pummelling her with your tail.

280
00:18:06,855 --> 00:18:09,369
- You shut up.
- You love her.

281
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:13,414
Ha! Oh, oh, this is so good,
it just has to be fattening.

282
00:18:13,495 --> 00:18:16,612
- I said shut up!
- Oh, by the way, nice rap.

283
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:22,691
"I'd take my sweater off, but I'm afraid it's
attached to my skin." Ha! Ha! Ha! Imbecile.

284
00:18:24,335 --> 00:18:26,929
Britney and Amber were,
like, "Let's go to the mall."

285
00:18:27,015 --> 00:18:30,132
I was, like, "I'll go to the mall."
Then Amber wasn't gonna go.

286
00:18:30,215 --> 00:18:34,413
So I went to the mall, and you're not
gonna believe it-they both showed up!

287
00:18:34,495 --> 00:18:38,773
Hold on. Meg, Meg, I'm sorry.
That is a really boring story.

288
00:18:38,855 --> 00:18:41,892
I haven't been this bored
since that stupid drive-in movie.

289
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:50,813
This sucks!

290
00:18:50,895 --> 00:18:53,409
Lois, this pasta-better than Italy.

291
00:18:53,495 --> 00:18:55,725
It's just my noodle caboodle.

292
00:18:55,815 --> 00:18:58,852
But I did use a different brand
of potato chips for the crust.

293
00:18:58,935 --> 00:19:02,564
Your culinary prowess is surpassed
only by your unfailing grace

294
00:19:02,655 --> 00:19:08,013
and the uncommon, sometimes haunting,
glow of sensuality that surrounds you.

295
00:19:08,095 --> 00:19:11,246
- It's just noodle caboodle.
- Hey, what are these hard things?

296
00:19:11,335 --> 00:19:13,724
M&M's. I ran out of paprika.

297
00:19:13,815 --> 00:19:17,933
- Magnificent.
- Up, up. Stewie wants to go uppie.

298
00:19:18,015 --> 00:19:20,245
You want me to pick you up, sweetie?

299
00:19:20,335 --> 00:19:22,405
Mama's skin's so soft.

300
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,293
My goodness, you're affectionate tonight!

301
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:28,014
Well, let me give my big boy a kiss.

302
00:19:29,815 --> 00:19:33,694
Another! Another! Yes!
Mama has candy kisses!

303
00:19:33,775 --> 00:19:35,766
All right, that's enough!

304
00:19:37,535 --> 00:19:39,765
I mean, would you all excuse me, please?

305
00:19:42,255 --> 00:19:45,804
Stewie, did... did you unhook Mommy's bra?

306
00:19:51,255 --> 00:19:53,450
- Uh, hi.
- Well, hello, Brian.

307
00:19:54,255 --> 00:19:56,894
- I... I think we should talk.
- Sure.

308
00:20:02,775 --> 00:20:06,324
Lois... did your heart
ever want to ask something

309
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:10,408
but your head was too afraid
of what the answer might be?

310
00:20:10,495 --> 00:20:12,486
Oh. Oh, God.

311
00:20:13,175 --> 00:20:17,726
Sometimes it's best
not to ask those questions.

312
00:20:17,815 --> 00:20:21,524
Sometimes we should cherish
what we already have,

313
00:20:21,615 --> 00:20:25,972
like a very special friendship,
let's say like the one you and I share,

314
00:20:26,055 --> 00:20:29,968
that someone like me wouldn't change
for anything in the world.

315
00:20:31,695 --> 00:20:35,005
Someone like me wouldn't change it
for anything in the world either.

316
00:20:35,095 --> 00:20:37,325
I'm glad.

317
00:20:41,015 --> 00:20:45,213
To be clear-we were talking about me being
in love with you and you rejecting me, right?

318
00:20:45,295 --> 00:20:47,286
- Yes.
- I was just making sure.

319
00:20:49,655 --> 00:20:52,215
Say we were drunk
and knew we wouldn't remember?

320
00:20:52,295 --> 00:20:55,207
I'd have to be really, really... No!

321
00:21:02,815 --> 00:21:05,488
I tell you, Peter,
I wish I'd taken this up years ago.

322
00:21:05,575 --> 00:21:08,885
My great-great-great uncle Angus Griffin
invented the game.

323
00:21:08,975 --> 00:21:13,366
So we're all clear on the rules, then?
No Jews and no blacks.

324
00:21:13,455 --> 00:21:14,285
Aye.

325
00:21:16,055 --> 00:21:19,525
- You're like the Arnold Palmer of golf.
- Yeah, life is good.

326
00:21:19,615 --> 00:21:23,528
I'm seven years old, and if I play my cards
right, I've got seven years ahead of me.

327
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:27,403
- Whatever happened with your lady friend?
- We decided to stay good friends.

328
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:31,852
There are a lot of different kinds of love,
and ours was perfect the way it was.

329
00:21:31,935 --> 00:21:36,053
So she dumped you, huh? To hell with her.
She'll probably end up with some idiot.

330
00:21:36,135 --> 00:21:38,126
Serves her right!

331
00:21:40,815 --> 00:21:41,804
Damn.

332
00:21:42,575 --> 00:21:43,564
Damn.

333
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:45,289
Damn.

334
00:21:45,855 --> 00:21:46,924
Damn.

335
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:48,448
Mulligan.

336
00:21:48,535 --> 00:21:49,729
Damn.

337
00:22:16,775 --> 00:22:19,448
