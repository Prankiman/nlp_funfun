30
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,538
Hi, everybody.

31
00:01:15,539 --> 00:01:18,703
You know how I've been dieting
like a maniac the last couple weeks?

32
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,997
Aw, damn it, that means
we're having people over.

33
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:23,459
We're having people over!

34
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,334
I just got off the phone with my mom,

35
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,962
and all the Pewterschmidts are
coming here for Thanksgiving.

36
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:30,339
I can't believe
you invited the whole family.

37
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,966
You know I hate big Thanksgivings.

38
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:33,718
Don't worry, Peter, it's gonna be fun.

39
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,678
And I can handle
most of the prep myself.

40
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:37,471
I just need you to go to the market

41
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,098
and get some extra napkins.

42
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,018
- That's not so bad.
- Oh. Pick up some wine for the adults.

43
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:43,184
I can do that.

44
00:01:43,185 --> 00:01:45,396
A-And put the extra leaf
in the dining room table.

45
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,483
Oh, stop it. It's so simple.

46
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,902
Yeah, right. That table
ain't been opened in five years.

47
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,405
It'll be fine. Just don't drink
while you do it.

48
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:57,742
And for God's sake, don't lose
your temper with Chris.

49
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:00,369
All right, one, two, three.

50
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,579
Hup!

51
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,182
One more time.

52
00:02:04,183 --> 00:02:05,207
Hup!

53
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,585
Okay, all right, bend the knees.

54
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:09,045
Let's give it a good pull.

55
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,421
Hup!

56
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,256
Yeah, I think one side is stuck.

57
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,383
Do you, son? Okay, on three.

58
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,093
One, two, three.

59
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,345
Hup!

60
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:19,930
Hup! Hup!

61
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,099
Hup! Hup! Hup!

62
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,062
I think it's still stuck.

63
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,521
Oh, is that right?

64
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,898
Lot of narration.

65
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:31,167
It's like opening a table
with Ken Burns.

66
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,195
Um, why don't you go easy on that stuff?

67
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:36,447
This "stuff" is
the only thing stopping you

68
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:38,616
from getting
so karate-chopped right now.

69
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,284
Okay, big pull, on three.

70
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,952
All right, one, two, three.

71
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,079
Hup!

72
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,122
It's this one side, it's just stuck.

73
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,166
I know it's stuck!

74
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:47,792
Everyone sees it's stuck!

75
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:50,127
Are there voices you're hearing
shouting, "It's not stuck"?

76
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,921
'Cause if you hear any argument

77
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,964
from anybody who says it isn't stuck,

78
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:57,385
you send them to me, and I will
so karate-chop them in the face!

79
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,303
Got it?!

80
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,097
I'm not sure that that's...

81
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,974
What?! What aren't you sure about?

82
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:04,975
Hup!

83
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,561
Hup! Hup! Hup!

84
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,897
Hey, Chris. Table looks stuck.

85
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:13,184
Oh, really?
"Sky blue," says star witness.

86
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,117
You know what's crazy
about this time of year?

87
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:23,119
Everything is pumpkin spice.

88
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,538
We all follow your Twitter feed, Joe.

89
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,748
God, Thanksgiving
is such a pain in the ass.

90
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,413
I hate hosting.

91
00:03:29,414 --> 00:03:31,168
I hear you, Peter.
I hate Thanksgiving, too.

92
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:34,296
Bonnie's sister is married
to a real show-off.

93
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,341
Denise, Wendell, it's great to see you.

94
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,429
- Wendell.
- Joseph.

95
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,183
It's just Joe. I think you know that.

96
00:03:44,184 --> 00:03:46,142
My Thanksgiving's also a nightmare.

97
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:49,854
Donna's cousins are two-thirds
of Tony! Toni! Toné!

98
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,939
- Which ones?
- The "E" and the "I."

99
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,691
Aw, no Tony with a "Y."

100
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:54,859
That is correct.

101
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,111
We lack the alpha Tony.

102
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,196
Well, at least you guys
celebrate with your families.

103
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:02,700
Last year I spent Thanksgiving
with my old blow-up sex dolls.

104
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,197
Here you go, Carla.

105
00:04:04,198 --> 00:04:06,036
See? We can do other things together.

106
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,038
How's the turkey? I made it myself.

107
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,458
Oh, don't look so surprised.

108
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,210
Ah. Someone's getting sleepy.

109
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,378
Must be the tryptophan.

110
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,046
I'll put a pot of coffee on.

111
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,955
Janet, coffee? Carla, coffee?

112
00:04:17,956 --> 00:04:19,967
Dina, coffee? Sasha, coffee?

113
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,677
Dad, coffee?

114
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,430
I wish I had given you
more siblings, Glenn.

115
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,640
You know, sometimes I envy
the guys in the town jail.

116
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,476
They get a turkey dinner on Quahog

117
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:31,060
and don't have the hassle
of hosting their families.

118
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:32,730
Well, yeah, but they're in prison.

119
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:35,954
Nah, jail isn't prison.
Prison is big and scary.

120
00:04:35,955 --> 00:04:38,724
Jail is just a sleeping deputy
with keys that can be grabbed

121
00:04:38,725 --> 00:04:41,945
by a long broom handle
or a mischievous dog.

122
00:04:41,946 --> 00:04:43,657
Do black people ever go to jail?

123
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,534
No. They go to prison.

124
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,078
Well, maybe going to jail
is what we should do.

125
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,920
- Peter, that's ridiculous.
- H-H-Hear me out, hear me out.

126
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:54,418
We'll commit a small crime
and get put in jail for a couple days.

127
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,545
- That's insane!
- Peter, Peter, you're crazy!

128
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,130
- Ridiculous!
<i>- Lump Monkeys!</i>

132

133
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,820
Guys, what if we all go to Vermont?

134
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,103
Let's just do Peter's thing.

135
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,606
Okay, if we want to get arrested,

136
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:18,025
the best way to do it is
to get caught on the Ring app

137
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,777
stealing people's packages.

138
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,469
I forgot to steal the package.

139
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,304
I think this is probably enough.

140
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:50,307
I don't know exactly what this is,

141
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,768
but this... this is crime.

142
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,103
Swanson!

143
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,564
Police Superintendent Chalmers.

144
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:59,650
My brother is superintendent
of the schools in Springfield.

145
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:02,486
Our parents divorced
when we were very young.

146
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,488
I was raised entirely by our mother,

147
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,739
he by our father.

148
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,742
We've never met.
There's a lot of backstory.

149
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,203
And you four are under arrest.

150
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,543
I can't believe the plan worked.

151
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,297
Here we are, the city jail.

152
00:06:22,714 --> 00:06:24,967
What's going on? Why aren't we stopping?

153
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:27,344
You guys think you're the
first ones to have this idea?

154
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,556
The jail's already full of dads
getting out of Thanksgiving.

155
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,641
Well, if we're not going to Quahog jail,

156
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,018
where are we going?

157
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,186
The only place where
there's room for the weekend:

158
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,647
the state penitentiary.

159
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,442
You guys thinking what I'm thinking?

160
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:44,028
Wacky mug shot montage.

161
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,369
Hey, uh, are my friends coming?

162
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,038
No, they're all calling lawyers.

163
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,374
You used your one call on
this party photo booth guy.

164
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,003
Eh, we'll see who has
more fun this weekend.

165
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,224
Yeah, it just doesn't seem right.

166
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,809
We're in here,
and everyone on Wall Street

167
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,478
is free as a bird.

168
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:20,814
Joe, now is not the time for
your bland political musings.

169
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,525
This sucks. The courts are
closed for Thanksgiving,

170
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,903
which means we can't even
go before a judge till Monday.

171
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,696
That's five whole days here.

172
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,531
What the hell are we gonna do?

173
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,326
Well, if we're congress,
we'll do nothing.

174
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:35,079
All right, that one was sharp.
Good job, Joe.

175
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,373
And you know, maybe-maybe prison
won't be so bad.

176
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:38,874
Maybe we just got to
make the best of it.

177
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,292
Like those guys over there. Look.

178
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,879
They're playing leapfrog.
No one's jumping, though.

179
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,256
And that guy in the back
definitely has to get up higher.

180
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,591
Who taught these guys how to play?

181
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,967
Peter, please stop watching it.

182
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,637
Guys, I think we're in trouble here.

183
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:52,846
Come on, we're gonna be fine.

184
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,765
Joe, you should be
more terrified than any of us.

185
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,767
What if someone figures out
you're a cop?

186
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:59,061
It's not gonna happen.
I spent years undercover.

187
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,355
I'm a master of disguise.

188
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:02,940
What? You're in a wheelchair.

189
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,692
You can't disguise yourself as anything.

190
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,194
Is that so,<i> Dad?</i>

191
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,405
Chris? But that's impossible.

192
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,532
I've seen Chris standing up many times.

193
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,075
Have you?

194
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,369
Hey, Chris, I got two tickets
for the Sox.

195
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,247
- Want to go?
- You got it, Dad.

196
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,207
Oh, charley horse.

197
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,875
Oh, another charley horse, huh?

198
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,252
Well, you sit tight, Chris.

199
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,422
I can just take Joe's
brother-in-law Wendell.

200
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,798
Christopher.

201
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:31,428
It's just Chris. I think you know that.

202
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,809
The conjugal visit room is being used.

203
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,728
So, does your foot reach?

204
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,896
Peter, enough. You ruined Thanksgiving.

205
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,275
I have to host 20 people by myself.

206
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,943
- You smoke now?
- Yeah.

207
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,319
I have a husband in prison.

208
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,197
That's who smokes, genius.

209
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,119
Stewie, why do you look like
1976 Elton John?

210
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,912
I'm trying to keep a low profile.

211
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,789
You know that old sitcom premise

212
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,750
where the kid has two dates to the prom?

213
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,168
Well, I, um...

214
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:07,796
I may sorta, kinda be engaged
to four prisoners.

215
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,631
You're what? Stewie, that's crazy.

216
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,425
Oh, relax, Brian,
I'm just humoring them.

217
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:12,509
It's not serious.

218
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,136
Stewie, don't forget,

219
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,679
we're meeting DJs tomorrow.

220
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,765
Sure thing, Clint.

221
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,516
His mother thinks it's<i> her</i> wedding.

222
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,809
But we'll see.

223
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,352
How did you even meet these guys?

224
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,104
Easily. They were my pen pals.

225
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,647
You have prison pen pals?

226
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,357
Yes. A lot of people write prisoners.

227
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,693
Even Hollywood celebrity Kal Penn.

228
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,320
Kal Penn writes a prisoner?

229
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,280
Yeah. Ken. Lives in California.

230
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,282
You've never heard of
Kal Penn's pen pal Ken

231
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,492
in the Cal pen?

232
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,202
How could I possibly
have heard of Kal Penn's

233
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,453
pen pal Ken in the Cal pen?

234
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,038

- What are you talking about?

244
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,597
Phil Spector's in this prison.

245
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,892
Kid, I know talent and shooting
waitresses in the mouth,

246
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,352
and you've got talent.

247
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,982
We're gonna make a record.

248
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,787
God, every crevice
of this prison is terrifying.

249
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,205
Eh, it's not so bad.

250
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,499
I made one-eye contact with Bill Cosby.

251
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,334
Well, well, well.

252
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:30,087
Three "wells" is never a good sign.

253
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,838
- I think you guys have our lunches.
- Called it.

254
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:34,675
Uh, sorry, sir.
We don't want any trouble.

255
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,593
Yeah, we-we'll sit somewhere else.

256
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,262
Come on, guys,
let's avoid confrontation.

257
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:39,555
And whatever happens,

258
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,598
let's make sure
we're not goaded into fights

259
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,725
by simple playground taunts.

260
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,563
Damn. I was hoping for chicken.

261
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:51,233
Nobody calls me chicken.

262
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,111
Peter, no!

263
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,614
Aw, damn it, I lost a front tooth.

264
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,700
Well, hopefully in the prison yearbook

265
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,744
I'll just look
like a cute kindergartner.

266
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,870
<i>Mad Dog, next time, I'm asking</i>

267
00:11:07,871 --> 00:11:10,288
<i>for the "top bunk".</i>

268
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:13,091
<i>LOL. Love Pete.</i>

269
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:18,802
<i>I'm starving.</i>

270
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,304
We haven't eaten since we got here.

271
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,598
That's 'cause other prisoners
keep taking our meals.

272
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,433
And God knows what else
they're gonna do to us.

273
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,934
We have three more days here,

274
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,603
and we're not gonna survive
three more minutes.

275
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,062
That's 'cause you don't have a gang

276
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,939
- to protect you.
- A gang?

277
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,983
Yeah, when you're in a gang,
no one will mess with you.

278
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,819
That's why everyone joins one.

279
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,153
I used to be in a gang.

280
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,238
It was called the Republican party.

281
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,487
Our friend is very political.

282
00:11:40,488 --> 00:11:42,409
So, how do we get
into one of these gangs?

283
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,494
Actually, you guys showed up
at the perfect time.

284
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,330
Tomorrow is the start
of Prison Rush Week.

285
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,290
Get in one, and you're home free.

286
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,125
That's a great idea!

287
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:53,546
Let's celebrate by pretentiously
analyzing some prison wine.

288
00:11:56,633 --> 00:12:00,469
Okay, I'm getting notes of, um...

289
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,472
uh, well, feces.

290
00:12:12,813 --> 00:12:14,691
Man, getting in a gang

291
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,276
is gonna be harder than I thought.

292
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,070
Speak for yourself, Peter.

293
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,863
What gang is this?

294
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,198
We're the Not Cops.

295
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:24,284
We're all<i> definitely</i> not cops.

296
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,869
So you think firemen are cool?

297
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,081
Firemen cook spaghetti.

298
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,541
And I think y'all know who I joined.

299
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,377
Are you now Kareem Abdul-Jableeveland?

300
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,712
I am Kareem Abdul-Jableeveland.

301
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,798
Hey, you know Muslims
can't drink alcohol, right?

302
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,842
I am Cleveland "Hurricane" Carter.

303
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,220
Well, Quagmire,
guess it's just you and me now.

304
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,347
Sorry, Peter, I'm in MS-13.

305
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,057
- What? How?
- It was easy.

306
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:49,393
- I said I was loco.
- Loco!

307
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,019
<i>- Si.</i>
<i>- Muy</i> loco.

308
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,479
Well, I can be loco.

309
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,398
I have a teardrop tattoo on my cheek.

310
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,691
Where? I don't see it.

311
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:56,901
Not-not that cheek.

312
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,237
Peter, that's
an unwiped watermelon seed.

313
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,823
- Loco?
- No. No loco.

314
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,784
Hey, Peter,
is that your baby over there?

315
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,247
We want fun. We want upbeat.
And for our dance,

316
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,708
we want "You Belong with Me"
by Taylor Swift.

317
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,210
Great, great. I also have
some more classic options,

318
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,546
- like "At Last."
- Okay.

319
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:21,258
So... so, what I need
is someone I can work with.

320
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,845
Can you be that person?

321
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,726
There you guys are.
I haven't seen you all day.

322
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:33,020
Me and the Not Cops
were watching<i> Die Hard</i>

323
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,771
and<i> not</i> commenting

324
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,024
on the believability of the police work.

325
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,568
Could John McClane
really foil a giant heist

326
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,778
outside his jurisdiction,
then just walk away

327
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,447
and do zero paperwork?

328
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,782
We don't know or care,
'cause we're not cops.

329
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,617
And I got my law degree.

330
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,954
I am now Cleveland J. Roman J. Israel,

331
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,540
and I will be wearing
wine-colored suits.

332
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,917
- You look crazy.
- Well, in his defense,

333
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,128
the movie was set in the '70s,
wasn't it?

334
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,629
No, it's modern-day.

335
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,133
Oh, my stars.

336
00:14:01,134 --> 00:14:03,133
All right, everyone, that's lanch.

337
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:06,037
I mean, lunch. Sorry, it's my first day.

338
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:08,466
This sucks.

339
00:14:08,467 --> 00:14:10,482
Everyone's eating lanch but me.

340
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:12,141
I'm never gonna find a gang.

341
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,311
Hey. You look like
you could use a friend.

342
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,938
Well, let's just say in prison,

343
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,232
this guy comes off.

344
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,443
I meant my gang.
We're looking for members.

345
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,779
- I-I bet you'd fit right in.
- Really?

346
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,238
You only have to do one thing first.

347
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,990
As the new white guy in prison,

348
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,951
you have to shiv the new black guy.

349
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,748
Oh, you guys are<i> that</i> kind of gang.

350
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,204
This is prison.

351
00:14:36,205 --> 00:14:37,957
No one survives on their own.

352
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,501
So it's either him or you.

353
00:14:40,502 --> 00:14:42,339
Man, I don't want to hurt Cleveland.

354
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,925
But I don't want to die.
And it would be nice

355
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:47,636
to have people to go
to Smash Mouth concerts with.

356
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,638
Wait, you guys go
to Smash Mouth concerts, right?

357
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,934
We're Nazis, Peter. We like Smash Mouth.

358
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,359
Come on, there's got to be a way
you'll let me in the gang

359
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,819
without shivving Cleveland.

360
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,321
Ooh, ooh, I got an idea.
There was this prison movie,

361
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,156
and-and there was this guy
who wanted to win over

362
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,117
the other prisoners,
and you know what he did?

363
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,786
He ate seven eggs. It was amazing.

364
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,121
So, you bring me seven

365
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:16,039
or some other reasonable amount
of eggs...

366
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,624
Peter, I know it's 50 eggs.

367
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,167
Ah, you're a film buff.

368
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:22,879
Yeah. Before this, I was
in the USC directors program.

369
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,214
Well, if you can call it that.

370
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:25,841
You think you're learning about film,

371
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,635
but, really, you're getting
a degree in politics.

372
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,387
I know,
everything is so political.

373
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,722
<i>So</i> political. Best advice I ever got:

374
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,016
whatever business you think you work in,

375
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,309
you really work in sales.

376
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,311
Because you're always selling yourself.

377
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,313
Yeah, wow, that is... that is good.

378
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,899
- You are smart.
- Well, I didn't say it.

379
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,401
- I'm just repeating it.
- Well, still,

380
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:45,861
y-you recognized its value.

381
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,655
That-That's not nothing.

382
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,742
Well, we're so happy you're all here.

383
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,411
We thought it might be fun

384
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:57,247
to kick things off
with a game of Heads Up!

385
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,915
- Daddy, do you want to start?
- No.

386
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,750
You just hold this up to your head,

387
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,920
and then we're gonna give you
clues to help you guess it.

388
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,672
I only like games with sticks.

389
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,174
Okay, ready?

390
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:08,634
Go.

391
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:11,970
Okay. It's a show.

392
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,054
<i>Annie Get Your Gun.</i>

393
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,181
No, it's on TV.

394
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,707
Oh.<i> Poirot?</i>

395
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,521
What is that? I've never heard of that.

396
00:16:18,522 --> 00:16:21,104
Uh, it's a Belgian detective on PBS.

397
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,480
We just love it.

398
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,567
It's about seven castaways.
There's a professor

399
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,736
a-and a millionaire a-and a movie star.

400
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:28,737
<i>- Poirot!</i>
- No.

401
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,197
We already said it's not<i> Poirot.</i>

402
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,532
It's about people who took
a three-hour tour.

403
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,117
No, it's not.
It's about a Belgian detective.

404
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,368
It's on PBS.

405
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:38,205
The title character is played
by Bob Denver.

406
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,707
- It's pronounced "David Suchet."
- Who's that?

407
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,710
- I'm gonna guess Poirot.
- It's not<i> Poirot!</i>

408
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,338
Damn it, just pass!

409
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,424
Okay, this is a movie...

410
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,301
<i>Roman J. Israel, Esq.</i>

411
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:52,553
Yay!

412
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,317
Come on, Peter, it's him or you.

413
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,402
And-and he's not so great.

414
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,737
Don't forget, he's the one who told you

415
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,489
all those<i> Schoolhouse Rock!</i> Spoilers.

416
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,574
I had no idea
that bill would become a law.

417
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,117
Sorry, Peter.

418
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,577
My gang said I wasn't really loco

419
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:18,995
unless I shivved someone,

420
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,748
and you're the one guy
without gang protection, so...

421
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,291
Sorry, Quagmire.

422
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,961
As a Not Cop, I have to shiv
a guy in the Latin gang

423
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,171
and then blame it on Cleve...

424
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,131
No one made me do this.

425
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:33,052
I'm just sick of your overt racism.

426
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,305
Guys, guys, stop.

427
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,015
Stop. Look at us.

428
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,518
We're shivving each other
on Thanksgiving.

429
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,353
Oh, wait, no one shivved Cleveland.

430
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:46,189
But what are we doing?

431
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,440
What are all of us doing?

432
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,651
Fighting in here amongst ourselves

433
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,987
while Brooks is out there
waiting for all of us,

434
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,154
bagging groceries,

435
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,448
adapting to this new world seamlessly...

436
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,783
Brooks hung himself.

437
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,159
Oh, my stars.

438
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,703
The point is, in life,

439
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:02,539
you need to be thankful
for what you have.

440
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,744
I wasn't, and it got me in here.

441
00:18:05,745 --> 00:18:09,655
I let down my family,
especially my wife.

442
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:12,470
I just wish she was here
so I could tell her I'm sorry.

443
00:18:12,471 --> 00:18:14,077
I am here, Peter.

444
00:18:14,078 --> 00:18:16,511
Not now, prison ladyboy
who talks like my wife

445
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,887
to please me sexually.

446
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,890
No, Peter, we're here.

447
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,737
Lois! What are you doing here?

448
00:18:23,738 --> 00:18:25,747
I thought you were having
Thanksgiving with your parents.

449
00:18:25,748 --> 00:18:27,897
Chris got caught
watching cousin Katie pee,

450
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,482
so that kind of ended things.

451
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,401
Well, I wanted to get caught. That's...

452
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:33,153
It's part of it.

453
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:36,364
And the truth is, Peter,
we're not a family without you.

454
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,189
Can you ever forgive me?

455
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,491
Of course I can, Peter.

456
00:18:40,492 --> 00:18:43,413
- Hi, Peter.
- Who's your little friend?

457
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:44,748
Not now, Prison Lois.

458
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:46,457
So it's over?

459
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,002
And what was Venice?

460
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:49,744
Same thing it always was, babe:

461
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:51,921
a dream we both wanted to believe.

462
00:18:54,928 --> 00:18:57,969
- Peter, who was that?
- Not now, Front-Sex Lois.

463
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,555
The important thing is,
my days of selfishness

464
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,776
and red-wig twinks are over.

465
00:19:02,777 --> 00:19:04,893
I'm ready to come home with you.

466
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,995
But, Peter,
you're in here till next week.

467
00:19:06,996 --> 00:19:08,772
Not anymore.

468
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:10,451
Hi, I'm the warden

469
00:19:10,452 --> 00:19:12,275
and definitely not a psychotic prisoner

470
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,844
who just stabbed the warden
and stole his clothes.

471
00:19:14,845 --> 00:19:17,072
Shh, shh!
Everyone, the warden's talking.

472
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,282
By the rules of prison
and<i> The Love Boat,</i>

473
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,784
you've made up,

474
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:24,544
which means you get to leave
wiser and happier.

475
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:36,853
I love you, Lois.

476
00:19:36,854 --> 00:19:38,386
I love you, Peter.

477
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:44,791
Hey, Lois, one day, let's go to Venice.

478
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:48,104
- You promise?
- I said it, didn't I?

479
00:19:49,145 --> 00:19:50,676
Donna!

480
00:19:50,677 --> 00:19:52,774
- Bonnie!
- Sex doll!

481
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:55,819
Oh, yeah!

482
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,614
All right, guys, settle down.

483
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:07,080
Well, we're certainly glad
to have you home, Peter,

484
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,623
but I hope you learned your lesson.

485
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,785
I learned a hard lesson, Lois.

486
00:20:10,786 --> 00:20:12,253
But it's not all bad.

487
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:14,087
I got to make a license plate
for our car

488
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:17,019
- that says "butthole."
- Isn't that too many letters?

489
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,335
Excellent question, Chris,
and yes, it is.

490
00:20:19,336 --> 00:20:22,011
But I took off a "T"
and the "E" at the end.

491
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,732
I felt that was the right way to go.

492
00:20:23,733 --> 00:20:25,724
Trust me, people will get it.

493
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:28,560
What's buthol?

494
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,687
- That's not how you say it.
- Yeah, I've heard of buthol.

495
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:32,355
It's some kind of alternative fuel.

496
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,732
You're ruining a smart joke.
