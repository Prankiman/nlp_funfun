What are you
doing over there?

6
00:00:50,853 --> 00:00:52,486
I'm on hold
with tech support.

WOMAN (Indian accent): Thank you
for holding. How can I help you?

00:00:59,562 --> 00:01:02,529
Well, for starters, you can keep
talking with that lovely accent.

12
00:01:02,565 --> 00:01:05,532
Amazing. One second of a
stranger's voice on a phone

full Bollywood.

I... I assume
she's in India.

Padma. That was
my mother's name.

So what seems to be the problem?

22
00:01:21,751 --> 00:01:23,384
Well, one problem I have

23
00:01:23,419 --> 00:01:25,052
is that I have too much money.

Then why don't you just
buy a new computer?

25
00:01:27,089 --> 00:01:28,389
What? I-I...

26

bursting your balls.

Well, you're a feisty one.

Uh, actually, my computer froze

30
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:37,064
right in the middle
of a story I'm writing.

31
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:38,399
Oh, you are a writer?

32
00:01:38,434 --> 00:01:39,733
Are you famous?

33
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:41,235
By choice, no. No.

34
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,570
Sometimes fame brings
a lot of unwanted attention.

35
00:01:43,606 --> 00:01:45,406
I mean, look at
William Shakespeare.

36
00:01:45,441 --> 00:01:47,408
William Shakespeare.
Aye.

37
00:01:47,443 --> 00:01:48,676
Nice collar,
you fruit.

38
00:01:48,711 --> 00:01:49,677
Thank ye.

39
00:01:49,712 --> 00:01:50,744
Hey, Shakespeare.

40
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,413
What's the title
of your next play?

41
00:01:52,448 --> 00:01:55,082
You should call it
<i>Homosexual Collar Guy.</i>

42
00:01:55,117 --> 00:01:57,751
Ah, thy japes and jabs cut me
to the quick, squire.

43
00:01:57,787 --> 00:01:59,086
What does that
even mean?

44
00:01:59,121 --> 00:02:00,087
I know.

45
00:02:00,122 --> 00:02:01,755
It means, "I use
this collar as a bib

46
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:03,424
for when I
service guys."

47

Thank ye, thank ye.

48
00:02:07,763 --> 00:02:09,129
So, how'd you
like the collar?

49

Huh, there's no one there.

52
00:02:19,475 --> 00:02:20,941
Must have been
some kids knocking.

00:02:22,311 --> 00:02:24,278
Oh, for God's
sake, Joe.

55
00:02:24,313 --> 00:02:26,947
Can't you put a tall flag on the
back of your chair or something?

56
00:02:26,982 --> 00:02:30,951
I apologize for the difficulty
my paralysis causes you.

57
00:02:30,986 --> 00:02:32,720
Hey, Peter. Good news.

58
00:02:32,755 --> 00:02:34,722
Bonnie's out of town,
so I have an extra ticket

59
00:02:34,757 --> 00:02:37,725
for Tuesday night bingo
down at the Allendale Mill.

60
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,393
Why the hell would I
want to go to bingo?

61
00:02:39,428 --> 00:02:40,728
Oh, it's a blast.

62
00:02:40,763 --> 00:02:43,397
There's the thrill of the game,
people bring snacks,

63
00:02:43,432 --> 00:02:45,733
plus you'll hear some
pretty unfiltered opinions

64
00:02:45,768 --> 00:02:47,735
about those jokers
in Washington.

65
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,870
Yeah, that sounds
perfectly terrible.

66
00:02:49,905 --> 00:02:51,205
You know what, Joe?

67
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,873
Peter would love
to go with you.

68
00:02:52,908 --> 00:02:54,208
What?!
Terrific.

69
00:02:54,243 --> 00:02:56,110
I'll pick you up at 6:00.

70
00:02:56,145 --> 00:02:57,444
What'd you do that for?!

71
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,779
Peter, he's your friend.

72
00:02:58,814 --> 00:03:00,781
Who knows?
It might be fun.

73
00:03:00,816 --> 00:03:02,449
(sighs)
All right, I'll go.

74
00:03:02,485 --> 00:03:03,784
But I'm not happy.

75
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:06,286
You know how much I hate
being told what to do.

76
00:03:06,322 --> 00:03:07,654

77
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,767
You know, Padma,
I love Indian food.

78
00:03:19,802 --> 00:03:22,603
But I'd have to say my least
favorite curry is Ann.

79

(chuckles)

80
00:03:23,806 --> 00:03:25,773
She's... she's
a newscaster here.

81
00:03:25,808 --> 00:03:27,775
I... I wish I could have
slipped that in earlier.

82
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,109
PADMA:
Oh, no, I know her.

83
00:03:29,145 --> 00:03:31,111
She's internationally despised.

84
00:03:31,147 --> 00:03:33,113
So, are you done rebooting?

85
00:03:33,149 --> 00:03:35,449
Look, (sighs) uh,
I have to come clean.

86
00:03:35,484 --> 00:03:38,786
Um, my computer wasn't
actually broken this time.

87
00:03:38,821 --> 00:03:41,121
Uh, I just wanted
to talk to you again.

88
00:03:41,157 --> 00:03:43,157
I like talking
to you, too, Brian.

89
00:03:43,192 --> 00:03:45,492
Oh, hey, is that Padma
from tech support again?

90
00:03:45,528 --> 00:03:46,493
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

91
00:03:46,529 --> 00:03:48,162
Oh, cool.
Ask her a question for me.

92
00:03:48,197 --> 00:03:50,497
How come over there
they just talk on the phone,

93
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:51,832
and over here
they're all doctors?

94
00:03:51,867 --> 00:03:53,507
Get out of here. Lois
said you're supposed

95
00:03:53,536 --> 00:03:55,176
to sit on the potty
for one hour straight.

96
00:03:55,204 --> 00:03:56,837
I'm taking a break.
I got bored.

97
00:03:56,872 --> 00:03:58,772
And you've been on the phone
for more than an hour.

98
00:03:58,808 --> 00:04:00,274
I'm sorry.
Can you give me a sec?

99
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:01,608
Look, I know it's crazy,

100
00:04:01,644 --> 00:04:03,610
but I honestly feel
a connection to this woman.

101
00:04:03,646 --> 00:04:05,846
More than I have
to anyone in a long time.

102
00:04:05,881 --> 00:04:08,182
That's nice, Brian, but
you're from different worlds.

103
00:04:08,217 --> 00:04:09,183
She's in India.

104
00:04:09,218 --> 00:04:10,317
That's a lot to overcome.

105
00:04:10,352 --> 00:04:11,985
People in love can
overcome anything.

106
00:04:12,021 --> 00:04:13,320
I guess you're right.

107
00:04:13,355 --> 00:04:15,689
I mean, look at
Jeb Bush and his wife.

108
00:04:15,724 --> 00:04:18,325
Honey, do you think
I'll ever be president?

109
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,462
No, no, no.

110

Stewie!

111

Yeah, but come on.

Look it up, man.
Google her.

114

I know what
she looks like.

115
00:04:33,342 --> 00:04:36,310
Oh, I see you came

You're the Big Cheese?

119
00:04:39,682 --> 00:04:40,981
I usually bring
a variety wheel

120

Do you not know
about time zones?

159
00:06:07,536 --> 00:06:08,835
Oh, uh, yeah, oh, that's right.

160
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:10,504
You guys are on metric.

161
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:11,838
Oh, you're in here?

162
00:06:11,874 --> 00:06:13,173
Yeah, I'm on the phone.

163
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,175
Is, uh, is Chris down
in the laundry room?

164
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,343
Yeah, I think so.

165
00:06:16,378 --> 00:06:18,011
(sighs) Okay, looks
like this is gonna be

166
00:06:18,047 --> 00:06:20,013
a stander-upper
in the garage.

167
00:06:20,049 --> 00:06:21,014
Uh-oh, six percent.

168
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,149
Better hustle.

169
00:06:22,184 --> 00:06:24,151
It's so nice to talk
to you, Brian.

170
00:06:24,186 --> 00:06:25,819
You make me feel wonderful.

171
00:06:25,854 --> 00:06:27,821
God, if only you
weren't so far away.

172
00:06:27,856 --> 00:06:29,823
I wish I could just somehow
magically appear there

173
00:06:29,858 --> 00:06:31,158
and meet you in person.

174
00:06:31,193 --> 00:06:33,827
Oh, Brian, that would
be like a dream.

175
00:06:33,862 --> 00:06:34,828
Okay, I should go.

176
00:06:34,863 --> 00:06:36,830
I have 11,000 people on hold.

177
00:06:36,865 --> 00:06:38,498
Good-bye, Padma.

178
00:06:38,534 --> 00:06:39,833
What the hell's
going on?

179
00:06:39,868 --> 00:06:41,168
Somebody's screaming
in the garage.

180
00:06:41,203 --> 00:06:42,502
Why are you still up?

181
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:43,837
Because I'm in love.

182
00:06:43,872 --> 00:06:45,172
Oh, with that
Indian chick?

183
00:06:45,207 --> 00:06:46,506
What was her
name? Dot?

184
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:48,175
No, it's not Dot,
it's Padma.

185
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,010
And I have to be with her.

186
00:06:50,045 --> 00:06:52,512
Stewie, I'm going to India.

187
00:06:52,548 --> 00:06:54,181
(gasps) Oh, my God,
I'm going with you.

188
00:06:54,216 --> 00:06:56,717
My yoga class will
be so jealous.

189
00:06:56,752 --> 00:06:59,386
Hey, everyone, the guy
I told you about, Brian,

190
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:01,388
he's taking me to India!

191
00:07:01,423 --> 00:07:03,523
(squealing)
Oh, my God!

192
00:07:06,142 --> 00:07:08,142
(Indian music playing)

193
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,824
We finally made
it, Brian.

194
00:07:23,859 --> 00:07:24,824
We're in India.

195
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,826
Excuse me, man with no pupil,

196
00:07:26,862 --> 00:07:29,496
where can we get
a taxicab around here?

197
00:07:29,531 --> 00:07:30,830
All right,
let's do it, Stewie.

198
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:32,165
Let's go find Padma.

199
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,834
Shouldn't be hard in this
dreamy land of wonder.

200
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,838
I can already smell the
enlightenment and tranquility.

201
00:07:37,873 --> 00:07:38,838
(inhales)

202
00:07:38,874 --> 00:07:40,874
(indistinct chatter)

203
00:07:42,645 --> 00:07:44,945
(coughing)

204
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,946
This is wonderful,
isn't it, Brian?

205
00:07:46,982 --> 00:07:48,648
It's so tranquil,
I'm tearing up.

206
00:07:48,683 --> 00:07:50,150
Come on, I think
I see a cab

207
00:07:50,185 --> 00:07:52,185
with less than
nine people in it.

208
00:07:57,392 --> 00:07:59,025
All right,
it's winning time.

209
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,693
Let's get this show
on the road.

210
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:02,362
After all, it's not
called "bing-stop,"

211
00:08:02,397 --> 00:08:04,364
it's called "bing-go!"

212
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,365
(laughing)

213
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,699
That's very clever.

214
00:08:06,735 --> 00:08:08,701
Yeah, and, uh...
uh, maybe if I win,

215
00:08:08,737 --> 00:08:10,703
I'll yell, "bing-Joe."

216
00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:11,871
Don't force it, Joe.

217
00:08:11,907 --> 00:08:13,039
Yeah, be quiet, Joe.

218
00:08:13,074 --> 00:08:14,541
Me and the gang are trying
to hear our numbers.

219
00:08:14,576 --> 00:08:15,875
"You" and the gang?

220
00:08:15,911 --> 00:08:17,043
I'm the one who
brought you here.

221
00:08:17,078 --> 00:08:18,211
Yeah, well, you
know something?

222
00:08:18,246 --> 00:08:19,879
The <i>Mayflower</i> also
brought fungus,

223
00:08:19,915 --> 00:08:21,548
which then became
the Potato Famine.

224
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,216
What the hell are
you talking about?

225
00:08:23,251 --> 00:08:24,717
I don't know, I've had,
like, four Ensures.

226
00:08:24,753 --> 00:08:26,052
I'm out of my mind.

227
00:08:26,087 --> 00:08:28,721
Peter, I brought you here
to have fun, not take over.

228
00:08:28,757 --> 00:08:30,390
Look, Joe, I'm a
little busy right now,

229
00:08:30,425 --> 00:08:32,725
so I'm gonna have the Somali
pirate from <i>Captain Phillips</i>

230
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:34,060
tell you something.

231
00:08:34,095 --> 00:08:36,062
Joe, look at me.

232
00:08:36,097 --> 00:08:37,730
Look at me.

233
00:08:37,766 --> 00:08:39,766
He is the bingo captain now.

234
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,276
I tell you, I love
it here, Brian.

235
00:08:50,312 --> 00:08:51,611
The sounds,
the colors.

236
00:08:51,646 --> 00:08:52,946
You know, this is
where the Beatles came

237
00:08:52,981 --> 00:08:54,280
to ruin their music.

238
00:08:54,316 --> 00:08:55,281
Yeah, yeah, that's great.

239
00:08:55,317 --> 00:08:56,416
Anyway, Padma works
in Bangalore,

240
00:08:56,451 --> 00:08:58,284
so we got to hurry
and catch the train.

241
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,553
(sighs) Can't believe
we're really in India.

242
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:01,621
Oh, look over there.

243
00:09:01,656 --> 00:09:02,622
There's cute little
kids are playing

244
00:09:02,657 --> 00:09:04,424
Cowboys and Indians
and Indians.

245
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:06,092
I'm gonna shoot you
with my six-gun.

246
00:09:06,127 --> 00:09:08,094
I'm gonna shoot you
with my bow and arrow.

247
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:09,762
I'm just going to stand
here wearing a shirt

248
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:11,598
that appears
to be a jacket.

249
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:13,633
♪ ♪

250
00:09:19,241 --> 00:09:21,541
Do you think all those
chickens had to buy tickets?

251
00:09:21,576 --> 00:09:23,209
I don't know,
but I'm starving.

252
00:09:23,245 --> 00:09:25,945
What I wouldn't give right now
for a big juicy steak.

253
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:27,113
How dare you?

254
00:09:27,148 --> 00:09:28,781
To us, cows
are sacred!

255
00:09:28,817 --> 00:09:30,783
That's right, you
are disrespecting

256
00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:32,118
our entire culture.

257
00:09:32,153 --> 00:09:35,421
And why did Wes Anderson come
here to make his worst movie?

258
00:09:35,457 --> 00:09:37,757
Stewie, what do we do?
Quick, hit the red buttons!

259
00:09:42,497 --> 00:09:44,130
Wow, that came in handy.
Yeah.

260
00:09:44,165 --> 00:09:45,965
Now let's get out of here.
Let's see what their wieners look like.

261
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:47,634
Yeah. Yeah, no,
let's get out of here.

262
00:09:51,206 --> 00:09:53,172
Okay, I'm off to bingo.

263
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,507
Peter, what are
you wearing?

264
00:09:54,543 --> 00:09:56,175
Oh, you mean
my bingo cape?

265
00:09:56,211 --> 00:09:57,844
That's our holiday
tablecloth.

266
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:00,179
I'm sorry, Lois, but my
people have come to expect

267
00:10:00,215 --> 00:10:02,181
a certain degree of pageantry.

268
00:10:02,217 --> 00:10:03,516
Don't wait up.

269
00:10:03,552 --> 00:10:04,851
We may go to Denny's.

270
00:10:04,886 --> 00:10:06,286
Is Joe going with you?

271
00:10:06,321 --> 00:10:07,620
Oh, "Crybaby Joe"?

272
00:10:07,656 --> 00:10:08,955
Nah, he doesn't come anymore.

273
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,623
I think he resents my skill.

274
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:12,559
Peter, bingo was
Joe's favorite thing.

275
00:10:12,594 --> 00:10:14,627
Now, you go over there
and take him with you,

276
00:10:14,663 --> 00:10:15,962
or I don't want
you going at all.

277
00:10:15,997 --> 00:10:17,964
Hey, hey, hey, don't try
to take this away from me.

278
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:19,966
This is the only thing
I've ever been good at.

279
00:10:20,001 --> 00:10:22,769
Well, this and timing
my farts to a thunderstorm.

280
00:10:22,804 --> 00:10:24,871
Why don't we all go ahead and
turn to page six in the handout?

281
00:10:24,906 --> 00:10:26,873
(thunder crashes)
Ah...

282
00:10:26,908 --> 00:10:28,942
The first thing you're
gonna notice is a bar graph.

283
00:10:28,977 --> 00:10:31,644
And what that is is to indicate
our international sales,

284
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,179
(thunder crashes)

285
00:10:33,214 --> 00:10:34,548
which peaked, of course,
- Oh, yeah.

286
00:10:34,573 --> 00:10:35,283
during the last quarter.

287
00:10:35,283 --> 00:10:37,417
But now we're expecting
that to drop off

288
00:10:37,452 --> 00:10:39,018
as we enter the
colder weather.

289
00:10:39,054 --> 00:10:41,020
(farts)

290
00:10:41,056 --> 00:10:42,755
(thunder crashes)

291
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,824
The storm's moving away.

292
00:10:44,859 --> 00:10:46,859
(horn honking)
(indistinct chatter)

293
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,762
(flies buzzing)

294
00:10:49,798 --> 00:10:50,830
We made it!

295
00:10:50,865 --> 00:10:52,198
This is where Padma works!

296
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:55,835
I feel like I owe every bus
in America an apology.

297
00:10:58,206 --> 00:10:59,639
So, we haven't discussed
what you're going

298
00:10:59,674 --> 00:11:00,940
to do if she's a pig.

299
00:11:00,976 --> 00:11:02,342
She's already
beautiful to me.

300
00:11:02,377 --> 00:11:04,911
And you know,
we'll see.

301
00:11:10,285 --> 00:11:13,686
(indistinct chatter)

302
00:11:13,722 --> 00:11:15,588
My God, how you
gonna find her?

303
00:11:15,624 --> 00:11:17,064
There are hundreds
of people in here.

304
00:11:17,092 --> 00:11:19,492
Don't worry, I
thought of that.

305
00:11:19,527 --> 00:11:20,827
PADMA: Thank you
for calling tech support.

306
00:11:20,862 --> 00:11:21,995
How can I help you?

307
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,030
I'll tell you how.

308
00:11:23,064 --> 00:11:24,297
Stand on your desk.

309
00:11:24,332 --> 00:11:25,332
Brian?

310
00:11:25,367 --> 00:11:26,666
Padma, just do it.

311
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:29,836
Oh, boy.

312
00:11:29,871 --> 00:11:31,170
Are you Padma?

313
00:11:31,206 --> 00:11:32,739
No, I am Ranita.

314
00:11:32,774 --> 00:11:34,774
There is a python in my cube.

315
00:11:36,978 --> 00:11:38,578
Brian?

316
00:11:38,613 --> 00:11:39,545
Padma!

317
00:11:39,581 --> 00:11:40,747
I can't believe this!

318
00:11:40,782 --> 00:11:42,215
Why are you here?

319
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,417
Because I was having
a technical issue

320
00:11:44,452 --> 00:11:45,852
with my heart.

321
00:11:45,887 --> 00:11:47,453
Ugh, 16 hours on a plane,

322
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:49,288
and <i>that's</i> what you
came up with?

323
00:11:49,324 --> 00:11:51,691
I am touched you came
all this way to see me.

324
00:11:51,726 --> 00:11:53,326
I'm so glad I did.

325
00:11:53,361 --> 00:11:56,329
You're even more beautiful
than I imagined.

326
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,933
Well, I have to admit
you two do make a cute couple.

327
00:12:00,969 --> 00:12:04,237
But then again, so did Chris
Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow.

328
00:12:04,272 --> 00:12:06,005
Do you take this woman
to lecture you

329
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,708
about trans fats for as long
as you both shall live?

330
00:12:08,743 --> 00:12:09,976
I do.

331
00:12:10,011 --> 00:12:11,544
And do you take this man to be

332
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:14,113
a watered-down Bono
until death do you part?

333
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:15,448
I do.

334
00:12:15,483 --> 00:12:17,483
I now pronounce you
pretentious and terrible.

335
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,486
You may name your daughter
after a fruit.

336
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:21,721
(animals bleating)

337
00:12:21,756 --> 00:12:23,756
(indistinct chatter)

338
00:12:26,327 --> 00:12:27,660
So, this is my town.

339
00:12:27,696 --> 00:12:29,462
I have lived here
my whole life.

340
00:12:29,497 --> 00:12:31,998
Well, if you were born here,
then it must be a magical place.

341
00:12:32,033 --> 00:12:33,800
Yes, let's go get
sandwiches

342
00:12:33,835 --> 00:12:36,235
at that New Delhi
I keep hearing about.

343
00:12:36,271 --> 00:12:37,737
(plays two rimshots)

344
00:12:37,772 --> 00:12:39,772
Thanks, Ganesha.

345
00:12:39,808 --> 00:12:42,008
I am so happy
that you are here.

346
00:12:42,043 --> 00:12:45,078
In fact, my family is
having a big party tonight.

347
00:12:45,113 --> 00:12:47,313
You must both come
as my guests.

348
00:12:47,348 --> 00:12:48,748
Oh, an Indian party!

349
00:12:48,783 --> 00:12:50,817
I hope they play that one song
with the shrieking, nasal,

350
00:12:50,852 --> 00:12:54,487
atonal woman over the bongos
and tambourines.

351
00:12:54,522 --> 00:12:57,490
(woman singing atonally)

352
00:13:02,897 --> 00:13:04,063
You seem nervous.

353
00:13:04,099 --> 00:13:05,898
Are you worried
about meeting Padma's family?

354
00:13:05,934 --> 00:13:07,734
Yeah. Well, that,
and this is always

355
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:09,469
what it looks
like on <i>Homeland</i>

356
00:13:09,504 --> 00:13:10,904
right before there's
a drone strike.

357
00:13:10,939 --> 00:13:13,673
Oh, my, you both
look so elegant.

358
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,008
Thanks, I did a little
shopping today.

359
00:13:16,044 --> 00:13:17,477
Not me.
Mine is actually

360
00:13:17,512 --> 00:13:19,245
an Aladdin costume
from last Halloween.

361
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,114
I never travel without it.

362
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:22,782
(dinging)

363
00:13:22,817 --> 00:13:24,083
Family, guests,

364
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:26,886
and monkeys who have
wandered in to steal fruit,

365
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:30,656
it is my honor to welcome you
to this engagement celebration.

366
00:13:30,692 --> 00:13:31,692
Oh, "engagement"?

367
00:13:31,726 --> 00:13:33,025
So, who's getting married?

368
00:13:33,061 --> 00:13:34,293
I am.

369
00:13:34,329 --> 00:13:36,129
What?!

370
00:13:36,164 --> 00:13:37,930
Padma, my beloved daughter.

371
00:13:37,966 --> 00:13:40,166
Dhiraj, my future son-in-law.

372
00:13:40,201 --> 00:13:42,468
Please, come
and meet one another.

373
00:13:42,504 --> 00:13:44,170
Welp, that's a Punjab
to the figs.

374
00:13:44,205 --> 00:13:46,038
Where's the bar?

375
00:13:47,475 --> 00:13:49,709
Everyone, you are all
so kind to come tonight,

376
00:13:49,744 --> 00:13:52,311
and it is so nice
to meet you, Dhiraj.

377
00:13:52,347 --> 00:13:56,082
But something happened today,
and I can no longer marry you.

378
00:13:56,117 --> 00:13:57,650
Padma, what is it?

379
00:13:57,685 --> 00:13:59,519
My true love is here tonight.

380
00:13:59,554 --> 00:14:01,921
He has come to me
all the way from America.

381
00:14:01,956 --> 00:14:04,190
His name is Brian Griffin.

382
00:14:04,225 --> 00:14:06,559
And my heart belongs to him.

383
00:14:06,594 --> 00:14:09,495
(all gasp)

384
00:14:09,531 --> 00:14:11,030
Quick, everyone's
looking at the dog!

385
00:14:11,065 --> 00:14:12,832
Go, go, go!

386
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:20,036
Padma, you cannot
call off the wedding!

387
00:14:20,071 --> 00:14:23,373
I have already paid a large
dowry to Dhiraj's family!

388
00:14:23,408 --> 00:14:25,508
But it would be wrong
to marry someone I do not love.

389
00:14:25,544 --> 00:14:28,077
The one I love is Brian.

390
00:14:28,113 --> 00:14:30,980
Sir, what if I were to repay you
for all you've spent?

391
00:14:31,016 --> 00:14:33,716
Would Padma then be free
to marry whoever she wanted?

392
00:14:33,752 --> 00:14:34,951
(gasps)
Brian!

393
00:14:34,986 --> 00:14:36,085
You would do that?

394
00:14:36,121 --> 00:14:37,921
Yes.
I love you, Padma,

395
00:14:37,956 --> 00:14:40,223
and-and I'd do anything
to be with you.

396
00:14:40,258 --> 00:14:42,225
I suppose that
might be possible.

397
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,127
Great, just give me
a chance to raise the money,

398
00:14:44,162 --> 00:14:46,095
so I can marry your daughter
and make her happy.

399
00:14:46,131 --> 00:14:48,965
Oh, so you don't
have the money?

400
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,302
He's holding onto an Applebee's
gift card with $1.62 on it.

401
00:14:52,337 --> 00:14:54,070
I do not know
Applebee's.

402
00:14:54,105 --> 00:14:56,172
Is it like our
Colonel Chutney's?

403
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,874
Does Colonel Chutney's
make you sick?

404
00:14:57,909 --> 00:14:59,008
Not every time.

405
00:14:59,044 --> 00:15:01,044
Then, no,
it's very different.

406
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,716
I mean, my wife and I have
never said the words

407
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,218
"open marriage," but...

408
00:15:08,253 --> 00:15:09,486
Oh, hey, Lois!

409
00:15:09,521 --> 00:15:11,187
Peter, it's time
to come home

410
00:15:11,223 --> 00:15:13,690
and give Joe back
his stupid little activity.

411
00:15:13,725 --> 00:15:15,758
I appreciate that,
Lois.

412
00:15:15,794 --> 00:15:16,960
First of all, this
is my favorite thing

413
00:15:16,995 --> 00:15:18,695
in the world now, so no.

414
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,463
And second of all, we're
about to play a new round,

415
00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:21,764
so start taking
your pants off,

416
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,333
'cause when I win,
I want you ready.

417
00:15:23,368 --> 00:15:24,901
Peter, if it wasn't for Joe,

418
00:15:24,936 --> 00:15:26,803
you wouldn't know
about bingo anyway.

419
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:30,273
This meant everything to him,
and you've taken it away.

420
00:15:30,308 --> 00:15:32,442
As a friend, do the right thing

421
00:15:32,477 --> 00:15:35,245
and give Joe back
the happiness he found here.

422
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,815
(sad music playing)

423
00:15:41,353 --> 00:15:44,654
Joe, gag on my fat dauber.

424
00:15:45,957 --> 00:15:47,690
Damn it, I didn't want
to have to do this,

425
00:15:47,726 --> 00:15:49,325
but you've left
me no choice!

426
00:15:49,361 --> 00:15:51,194
Kids, get in here!

427
00:15:51,229 --> 00:15:52,795
Yay! Time with Dad!

428
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,632
That's a bingo for me!

429
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:57,400
All right,
how do you play?

430
00:15:57,435 --> 00:15:58,835
"Free space"?!

431
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,703
Wow! What's that about?!

432
00:16:00,739 --> 00:16:02,105
I call I sit
next to Dad!

433
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,339
(sighs)

434
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,541
All right, forget this.

435
00:16:04,576 --> 00:16:05,708
Let's all go home and each do

436
00:16:05,744 --> 00:16:07,744
our own individual media things.

437
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,148
(Indian music playing)
(indistinct chatter)

438
00:16:13,885 --> 00:16:15,518
Stewie, I don't think
this is gonna work.

439
00:16:15,554 --> 00:16:16,986
We're never gonna
raise enough money

440
00:16:17,022 --> 00:16:18,621
to pay back
Padma's father.

441
00:16:18,657 --> 00:16:20,423
Trust me, Brian, there are
a billion people here,

442
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,692
and almost every one
of them has a tapeworm.

443
00:16:22,727 --> 00:16:24,594
Yes, excuse me,
I have a tapeworm.

444
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:26,396
All right, very good.
Lie down on your stomach.

445
00:16:26,431 --> 00:16:28,431
This won't hurt a bit.

446
00:16:34,706 --> 00:16:36,406
Hey, how are you guys?

447
00:16:36,441 --> 00:16:37,640
Oh, you're a lady.

448
00:16:37,676 --> 00:16:38,808
And you sound
American.

449
00:16:38,843 --> 00:16:40,209
How long have you
been in there?

450
00:16:40,245 --> 00:16:42,078
I originally just came
for my junior year,

451
00:16:42,113 --> 00:16:45,582
but I fell in love
with the place.

452
00:16:45,617 --> 00:16:47,350
Stewie, there's no way
I'm sitting here all day

453
00:16:47,385 --> 00:16:49,419
watching tapeworms
come out of butts.

454
00:16:49,454 --> 00:16:51,187
I'm doomed.

455
00:16:51,222 --> 00:16:53,523
I'll never be able
to pay for Padma's dowry.

456
00:16:53,558 --> 00:16:54,824
I don't understand.

457
00:16:54,859 --> 00:16:57,093
In movies, everything in India
always turns out great.

458
00:16:57,128 --> 00:16:59,929
Julia Roberts ate or loved
or prayed or something.

459
00:16:59,965 --> 00:17:01,664
I don't, I don't know.
I didn't see it.

460
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,732
Wait a minute!

461
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:04,400
Movies about India.

462
00:17:04,436 --> 00:17:06,836
I know how I can make the money!

463
00:17:06,871 --> 00:17:08,738
♪ ♪

464
00:17:08,773 --> 00:17:10,840
Who wants to be

465
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,242
a millionaire?

466
00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:17,780
Our next contestant comes

Brian Griffin!

What brings you to India, Brian?

469
00:17:22,721 --> 00:17:23,853
I'll tell you what brought me.

470
00:17:23,888 --> 00:17:25,021
True love.

471
00:17:25,056 --> 00:17:26,923
STEWIE:
He's breaking up a marriage!

472
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:30,693
All right, let's get started.

473
00:17:30,729 --> 00:17:33,696
First question--
"Which retired Indian cricketer

474
00:17:33,732 --> 00:17:35,865
"has scored over
18,000 runs

475
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,767
in ODI competition?"

476
00:17:37,802 --> 00:17:39,502
Um, O...?
Wha...?

477
00:17:39,537 --> 00:17:41,771
O-ODI?
What?

478
00:17:41,806 --> 00:17:44,073
Is it A) Anil Kumble,

479
00:17:44,109 --> 00:17:46,976
B) Mahendra Singh Dhoni,

480
00:17:47,012 --> 00:17:49,979
C) Sachin Tendulkar,

481
00:17:50,015 --> 00:17:52,415
or D) Jiminy Cricket?

482
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:55,451
Well, I know, I know
it's not Jiminy Cricket.

483
00:17:55,487 --> 00:17:58,655
Unless Jiminy's
based on a real person.

484
00:17:58,690 --> 00:17:59,889
I need an answer.

485
00:17:59,924 --> 00:18:00,923
You know, the more I say it,

486
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:02,358
the more it does sound Indian.

487
00:18:02,394 --> 00:18:03,693
(Indian accent):
Jiminy Cricket.

488
00:18:03,728 --> 00:18:06,729
D) Jiminy Cricket, final answer.

489
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,034
I'm sorry,
that is incorrect.

490
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:12,502
Thank you for playing!

491
00:18:12,537 --> 00:18:13,836
We'll be right back

492
00:18:13,872 --> 00:18:16,506
after this message
from the Indian Census Bureau.

493
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:17,607
Too many people!

494
00:18:17,642 --> 00:18:19,442
Stop with the people!

495
00:18:22,647 --> 00:18:24,013
Padma, I'm sorry.

496
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:25,381
I still haven't
raised the money.

497
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:26,649
But I'm working on it.

498
00:18:26,685 --> 00:18:28,084
There is no longer a need.

499
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:29,752
My father has
solved the problem

500
00:18:29,788 --> 00:18:32,355
by promising Dhiraj
the hand of my younger sister.

501
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,357
Oh, Padma, I meant
to ask you, are there, like,

502
00:18:34,392 --> 00:18:36,292
Bengal tigers just
running loose in the cities?

503
00:18:36,327 --> 00:18:37,627
I don't know.

504
00:18:37,662 --> 00:18:39,462
In America, are there
annoying talking babies

505
00:18:39,497 --> 00:18:40,997
always interrupting?

506
00:18:41,032 --> 00:18:42,999
Okay, it's been
a long trip.

507
00:18:43,034 --> 00:18:45,334
Let's not say anything
we're gonna regret.

508
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,470
Wait a minute, so if,
if Dhiraj is marrying

509
00:18:47,505 --> 00:18:49,639
your sister, that means
we can be together!

510
00:18:49,674 --> 00:18:51,674
Actually, about that.

511
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,477
I think watching you try to
answer that question out there,

512
00:18:54,512 --> 00:18:56,312
I realized something.

513
00:18:56,347 --> 00:18:58,548
You know nothing
of my country or my culture.

514
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,483
Well, tha-that was a
really tough question.

515
00:19:00,518 --> 00:19:01,884
No, it wasn't.

516
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,621
Everyone in India knows
who Sachin Tendulkar is.

517
00:19:05,657 --> 00:19:08,357
Brian, I am deeply touched
that you came all this way

518
00:19:08,393 --> 00:19:10,860
to find me,
but the truth is, you and I

519
00:19:10,895 --> 00:19:12,628
have very little in common.

520
00:19:12,664 --> 00:19:13,763
Well, I could learn!

521
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:15,331
I mean, I mean,
there's got to be

522
00:19:15,366 --> 00:19:17,834
an old <i>Carmen Sandiego</i> episode
on India or something.

523
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:20,069
STEWIE:
Brian, Brian, punt, punt.

524
00:19:20,105 --> 00:19:21,771
I know you would try,
Brian.

525
00:19:21,806 --> 00:19:23,239
But when I look
inside myself,

526
00:19:23,274 --> 00:19:25,641
I realize I do not
want to marry you.

527
00:19:25,677 --> 00:19:28,277
Mostly, I just did not
want to marry Dhiraj.

528
00:19:28,313 --> 00:19:30,213
I am so sorry.

529
00:19:30,248 --> 00:19:33,182
Have I answered all of your
questions to your satisfaction?

530
00:19:33,218 --> 00:19:35,451
No! I came halfway
around the world for you!

531
00:19:35,487 --> 00:19:37,086
You said I was your true love!

532
00:19:37,122 --> 00:19:38,554
Well, by coming here,

533
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,990
you saved me from a lifetime
of unhappiness.

534
00:19:41,025 --> 00:19:44,026
And I will always
love you for that.

535
00:19:44,062 --> 00:19:46,062
Good-bye, Brian.

536
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:50,166
A peck on the cheek?

537
00:19:50,201 --> 00:19:52,535
Was that worth
an $8,000 coach ticket?

538
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,803
You know what?

539
00:19:53,838 --> 00:19:55,638
It's about the journey,
not the destination.

540
00:19:55,673 --> 00:19:56,939
No, it's not.

541
00:19:56,975 --> 00:19:58,641
This sucked
and you failed.

542
