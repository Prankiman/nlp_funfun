00:00:37,567 --> 00:00:39,635
Oh, Lois, I'm so glad
you were able

13
00:00:39,702 --> 00:00:41,036
to make it
to dinner tonight.

14
00:00:41,104 --> 00:00:42,771
Oh, me, too, Mom.

15
00:00:42,839 --> 00:00:43,972
We haven't seen
you in ages.

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,207
Oh, there you are.

17
00:00:45,275 --> 00:00:47,109
Did you find
the new bathroom okay?

18
00:00:47,177 --> 00:00:48,710
Uh-huh.

19
00:00:48,778 --> 00:00:51,280
I'm so sorry about
your father keeping us.

20
00:00:51,347 --> 00:00:52,948
He's probably down
at the dock

21
00:00:53,016 --> 00:00:54,783
tinkering with that
darn yacht of his.

22
00:00:54,851 --> 00:00:56,185
Oh, that's okay, Mom.

23
00:00:56,252 --> 00:00:57,853
We'll just have to
entertain ourselves for...

24
00:00:57,921 --> 00:00:59,321
Hey, Babs,
settle something for us.

25
00:00:59,389 --> 00:01:01,823
I wanted to bring, um,
an owl on this trip,

26
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:03,192
but Lois wouldn't let me.

27
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:04,927
Could you have
accommodated an owl?

28
00:01:04,994 --> 00:01:06,962
Well, I suppose there's
some room in the owlery,

29
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:08,797
but I can't be certain.

30
00:01:08,865 --> 00:01:10,499
I'll take that as a yes.

31
00:01:10,567 --> 00:01:12,201
You owe Dr. Hoo an apology.

32
00:01:12,268 --> 00:01:13,735
Hey, can we change
the channel?

33
00:01:13,803 --> 00:01:15,304
I'm tired of watching old ships.

34
00:01:15,371 --> 00:01:17,940
Peter, that's not a TV,
it's a painting.

35
00:01:18,007 --> 00:01:19,441
Actually, Lois,
it is a TV.

36
00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:22,077
It's the PBS show
<i>Old Ships.</i>

37
00:01:22,145 --> 00:01:24,413
Good, I hate PBS.

38

I don't know, maybe...
Maybe you had to see the first three

50
00:01:53,743 --> 00:01:55,544
to get this, but I...
I am completely lost.

51
00:01:55,612 --> 00:01:56,878
Lois, you said
there would be

52
00:01:56,946 --> 00:01:58,247
other men my
own age here.

53
00:01:58,314 --> 00:01:59,948
But there aren't,
and I'm bored.

54
00:02:00,016 --> 00:02:01,950
Look, Peter, why don't you
just grab a book

55
00:02:02,018 --> 00:02:03,619
off the shelf and be quiet?

56
00:02:03,686 --> 00:02:04,853
No! Books are jerks.

57
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:06,188
Stop acting like a brat.

58
00:02:06,256 --> 00:02:08,156
What about a picture book?

59
00:02:08,224 --> 00:02:10,826
Only if it has a mirror
at the end of it,

60
00:02:10,893 --> 00:02:12,728
and it says,
"How about you?"

61
00:02:16,432 --> 00:02:18,333
Oh, wow,

62
00:02:18,401 --> 00:02:20,802
look at these old photos
of you and Dad.

63
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,337
This must be
around the time

64
00:02:22,405 --> 00:02:24,206
you guys were
first dating, huh?

65
00:02:24,274 --> 00:02:25,474
Oh dear, yes.

66
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:28,877
Ah, your father was
so handsome back then.

67
00:02:28,945 --> 00:02:31,280
I remember the day we met.

68
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:40,322
<i>BARBARA: It was one of those lovely,</i>
<i>warm summer days by the shore.</i>

69
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,191
<i>Perfect giant beach ball</i>
<i>weather.</i>

70
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:46,228
Would you like another
John Barrymore and soda?

71
00:02:46,296 --> 00:02:47,829
Ah, yes.
Thank you, Clarence.

72
00:02:47,897 --> 00:02:49,231
How are things
in Terriblehood?

73
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:50,265
Terrible, sir.

74
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:51,233
Good, good.

75
00:02:52,302 --> 00:02:54,136
Ah! You dumb bitch!

76
00:02:54,203 --> 00:02:56,238
<i>BARBARA: My friend and I</i>
<i>held our breath,</i>

77
00:02:56,306 --> 00:02:58,774
<i>wondering which one of us</i>
<i>he was talking to.</i>

78
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,244

<i>And from there,</i>

80

Boy, you can
take a punch,

81
00:03:08,751 --> 00:03:10,919
but at the same time,
you cowered a little bit.

82
00:03:10,987 --> 00:03:12,454
Now, that's a woman.

83
00:03:12,522 --> 00:03:13,855

00:03:13,923 --> 00:03:15,857
I love you, Pussycup.

Oh, I always love hearing
that story, Mom.

I got a story about a fat guy
who's starving and bored.

Look, Peter,
if you're that hungry,

137
00:05:52,148 --> 00:05:53,949
go down to the dock
and find Daddy,

138
00:05:54,016 --> 00:05:55,183
and we'll get
dinner started.

139
00:05:55,251 --> 00:05:56,818
You're not gonna get
dinner started.

140
00:05:56,886 --> 00:05:59,488
She's gonna tell that sloppy
old Spanish maid to do it.

141
00:05:59,555 --> 00:06:01,423
And she will, but only
because she needs money

142

143

Ah, that was excellent.

When I clenched it,
you took your fingers away.

You were right

00:06:45,868 --> 00:06:46,835
(gasps)

156
00:06:46,903 --> 00:06:47,836
Mr. Pewterschmidt,

157
00:06:47,904 --> 00:06:49,804
you're having an affair?!
Ew!

158
00:06:49,872 --> 00:06:51,506
No, no, this is my sister.

159
00:06:51,574 --> 00:06:53,608
- Ew!
- No, no, no, I'm impotent.

160
00:06:53,676 --> 00:06:56,244
- Ew!
- I mean, she looked at me while I did it to myself.

161
00:06:56,312 --> 00:06:57,245
Ew!

162
00:06:57,313 --> 00:06:58,246
I mean, she's a man.

163
00:06:58,314 --> 00:07:00,315
Ew!

164
00:07:00,383 --> 00:07:02,918
We need more Es and Ws
down here now!

165
00:07:02,985 --> 00:07:03,952
MAN:
We're trying!

166
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,420
We're running out of letters!

167
00:07:05,488 --> 00:07:07,589
Just turn the Ms upside down
and send them down here!

168
00:07:07,657 --> 00:07:09,090
You can't just do that!

169
00:07:09,158 --> 00:07:10,458
There's a lot of paperwork
before you can...

170
00:07:10,526 --> 00:07:11,893
I don't care!
I'll take the heat!

171
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:13,194
Just turn them over
and send them down!

172
00:07:18,878 --> 00:07:20,979
Mr. Pewterschmidt,
you're having an affair?!

173
00:07:21,047 --> 00:07:23,014
Now, look, Griffin,
you better not breathe a word

174
00:07:23,082 --> 00:07:24,583
about what you saw here.

175
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,151
But how can you be
having an affair?

176
00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:27,185
What about Babs?

177
00:07:27,253 --> 00:07:28,353
That's not your concern.

178
00:07:28,421 --> 00:07:29,888
You didn't see anything.

179
00:07:29,956 --> 00:07:31,723
Remember that
or I'll ruin you.

180
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:32,891
Okay, okay, I promise.

181
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,593
I'll be as quiet
as a church mouse.

182
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,428
Hey, Billy, I was
gonna have a party

183
00:07:36,496 --> 00:07:37,896
at the rectory
this evening.

184
00:07:37,964 --> 00:07:41,266
Do you like sacramental wine
and mouse Russell Crowe movies?

185
00:07:41,334 --> 00:07:42,934
Oh, boy, do I!

186
00:07:43,002 --> 00:07:44,703
Hey, can my sister come?

187
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,171
No! She'd ruin it!

188
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,076
Now, remember,
you keep your mouth shut

189
00:07:51,143 --> 00:07:52,310
about what you saw.

190
00:07:52,378 --> 00:07:53,845
Yes, sir,
Mr. Pewterschmidt.

191
00:07:55,147 --> 00:07:57,949
Oh, there you are, boys.

192
00:07:58,017 --> 00:07:59,618
Sorry, sweetheart,
I lost track of time.

193
00:07:59,685 --> 00:08:00,952
Right, Peter?

194
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,922
(forced laugh)

195
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:06,124
I'm Peter.

196
00:08:06,192 --> 00:08:07,192
Well, let's eat, huh?

197
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,593
You must be starving, Peter.

198
00:08:08,661 --> 00:08:10,095
What am I, on trial here?!

199
00:08:10,162 --> 00:08:12,664
Uh, maybe you should just
eat something, Peter.

200
00:08:12,732 --> 00:08:14,299
Go on, put some food
in your mouth.

201
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:15,767
Y... Y... Yes, sir,
I sure will,

202
00:08:15,835 --> 00:08:17,969
Mr. Cooterschmidt...
Pewterschmidt! Oh, God!

203
00:08:20,172 --> 00:08:21,973
Peter, are you feeling all right?

204
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,275
Oh, he's fine.

205
00:08:23,342 --> 00:08:25,710
You know how hungry a man
gets after a day at sea.

206
00:08:25,778 --> 00:08:26,745
He eats with porpoise.

207
00:08:26,812 --> 00:08:27,779
Ha-ha! Oop!

208
00:08:27,847 --> 00:08:29,347
Peter, for God's sake,

209
00:08:29,415 --> 00:08:31,216
you're always an embarrassment
at the table.

210
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:33,218
You should've seen him
when we had dinner

211
00:08:33,286 --> 00:08:34,686
with Paul McCartney's ex-wife.

212
00:08:34,754 --> 00:08:37,122
He kept playing footsie
with her under the table.

213
00:08:37,189 --> 00:08:39,991
(giggling)

214
00:08:41,193 --> 00:08:42,260
(loud thunk)

215
00:08:42,328 --> 00:08:43,662
Oh, my God,
I'm so sorry!

216
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,833
Um, hey, guys?

217
00:08:48,901 --> 00:08:50,936
Uh, I...
I got a problem.

218
00:08:51,003 --> 00:08:53,338
- Um, you know how Lois has that dad?
- Yeah.

219
00:08:53,406 --> 00:08:55,640
Well, we were there
the other night for dinner,

220
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,709
and I caught him cheating
with some bimbo.

221
00:08:57,777 --> 00:08:59,277
- Oh, my God!
- You're kidding!

222
00:08:59,345 --> 00:09:01,046
Anyway, he told me
not to tell anybody,

223
00:09:01,113 --> 00:09:03,582
but I'm having a real hard time
not telling Lois.

224
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:05,050
How could you not?

225
00:09:05,117 --> 00:09:07,719
Peter, once entered into,
marriage is a sacred bond:

226
00:09:07,787 --> 00:09:11,189
An alliance blessed by God
and hallowed by the community.

227
00:09:11,257 --> 00:09:13,091
That's why I'll never opt for
the matrimonial condition.

228
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,826
It wouldn't be fair to
the historical framework

229
00:09:14,894 --> 00:09:16,194
of the institution.

230
00:09:16,262 --> 00:09:18,763
But for those who do,
and then turn their back

231
00:09:18,831 --> 00:09:21,099
on its long-standing
convictions? Shame!

232
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:23,535
This is unwelcome news, Peter.
Very unwelcome.

233
00:09:23,603 --> 00:09:25,837
Yeah, I know,
but I don't know what to do.

234
00:09:25,905 --> 00:09:27,439
It's really hard
keeping my mouth shut.

235
00:09:27,506 --> 00:09:28,740
Actually, you know
something, Peter.

236
00:09:28,808 --> 00:09:30,675
This... This could be
an opportunity for you.

237
00:09:30,743 --> 00:09:32,911
- What do you mean?
- Well, Lois's dad is loaded.

238
00:09:32,979 --> 00:09:35,080
Y... You could probably get him
to pay through the nose

239
00:09:35,147 --> 00:09:36,581
to keep your mouth shut.

240
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:38,650
Yeah, you could really
milk this thing, Peter.

241
00:09:38,718 --> 00:09:40,452
Huh, I never thought of it like that.

242
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,753
Wait a minute.
You're not serious.

243
00:09:41,821 --> 00:09:43,054
That's totally unethical.

244
00:09:43,122 --> 00:09:44,456
Yeah, Brian,
no one cares what you think.

245
00:09:44,523 --> 00:09:45,724
Peter, you could
make him your slave!

246
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,892
Oh, man.
He'd hate that even more

247
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,361
than he hates sitcom
two-parters.

248
00:09:49,428 --> 00:09:50,895
Tootie, it's 8:29!

249
00:09:50,963 --> 00:09:53,365
Now either try that beer
or dump it down the sink! Wait!

250
00:09:53,432 --> 00:09:56,701
Oh! Now, I have to wait a whole
week to find out if she gave in

251
00:09:56,769 --> 00:09:58,103
to peer pressure
at that drinking party!

252
00:10:01,307 --> 00:10:04,042
(door shuts)

253
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,478
Carter!
Carter, wake up!

254
00:10:06,545 --> 00:10:08,613
(snorts)
It's o... It's okay, Lois.

255
00:10:08,681 --> 00:10:09,881
Daddy's just taking
your temperature.

256
00:10:09,949 --> 00:10:11,349
Wh... What?

257
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:12,450
Wh... What is it?

258
00:10:12,518 --> 00:10:14,219
I heard a noise downstairs.

259
00:10:14,286 --> 00:10:16,388
(sighs)
I'll go have a look.

260
00:10:16,455 --> 00:10:17,522
It's probably just the wind.

261
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,590
The wind, dear.

262
00:10:18,658 --> 00:10:19,991
Is that how you say that?

263
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:21,459
I've only seen
that word written.

264
00:10:25,531 --> 00:10:27,832
(water splashing)

265
00:10:30,503 --> 00:10:32,237
Hi, Mr. Pewterschmidt.

266
00:10:32,304 --> 00:10:34,673
Griffin! What the hell
are you doing in my house?!

267
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,242
Well, I was getting ready
to watch a movie on your big TV,

268
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:39,210
but first I thought I'd use
your hot bubbly toilet.

269
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:40,478
That's not a toilet!

270
00:10:40,546 --> 00:10:42,013
Hey, when's it go down,
by the way?

271
00:10:42,081 --> 00:10:43,381
It's just doing a lot
of loop-de-loops.

272
00:10:43,449 --> 00:10:45,183
Get the hell out of there,
you son of a bitch!

273
00:10:45,251 --> 00:10:48,319
Oh, no, no. No, you don't get
to talk to me like that anymore.

274
00:10:48,387 --> 00:10:49,921
Not unless you want me to blab

275
00:10:49,989 --> 00:10:51,122
about what happened
on the yacht.

276
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,692
What are you getting at,
Griffin?

277
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:56,528
That's right, you're gonna start
doing a lot of stuff for me.

278
00:10:56,595 --> 00:10:57,495
Like what?

279
00:10:57,563 --> 00:10:58,596
Well, for starters,

280
00:10:58,664 --> 00:11:00,098
- you got more than one limo?
- Yeah.

281
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,933
You and me are gonna
do a limo joust.

282
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:03,802
What the hell is that?

283
00:11:05,871 --> 00:11:07,138
All right, you ready?

284
00:11:07,206 --> 00:11:08,440
I don't want to do this.

285
00:11:08,507 --> 00:11:10,308
Go!
(tires squealing)

286
00:11:10,376 --> 00:11:11,242
(tires squealing)

287
00:11:26,025 --> 00:11:28,960
PETER: That went exactly
as I wanted it to go.

288
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:35,633
All right here's
your Mike and Ikes

289
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:37,102
with all the
Ikes taken out.

290
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:39,104
I hope you were careful,
'cause I swear to God,

291
00:11:39,171 --> 00:11:41,539
if I find one Ike in there,
I'm going straight to Babs.

292
00:11:41,607 --> 00:11:42,707
It's fine,
I double-checked.

293
00:11:42,775 --> 00:11:44,809
Here's your Mikes.
What's next?

294
00:11:44,877 --> 00:11:46,344
Next, I want you
to fly to France

295
00:11:46,412 --> 00:11:48,046
and tell French people
that a good-looking,

296
00:11:48,114 --> 00:11:49,781
depressed guy
smoking a cigarette

297
00:11:49,849 --> 00:11:51,382
is not a movie.

298
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,251
(clearing throat)

299
00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:54,786
(over loudspeakers):
People of France,

300
00:11:54,854 --> 00:11:57,088
a good-looking, depressed guy

301
00:11:57,156 --> 00:11:58,723
smoking a cigarette

302
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,525
is not a movie,

303
00:12:00,593 --> 00:12:03,394
and your sirens sound like
gay guys having a threesome.

304
00:12:03,462 --> 00:12:07,432
(European-style siren blaring)

305
00:12:12,138 --> 00:12:14,072
All right, you got my
catch phrases for me?

306
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:17,108
I just want you to know
this was a huge pain in the ass.

307
00:12:17,176 --> 00:12:19,177
"Peter's New Catch Phrases,
by Carter Pewterschmidt."

308
00:12:19,245 --> 00:12:20,879
Title's all business.
I like that.

309
00:12:20,946 --> 00:12:22,747
Also, I've been under
the weather lately,

310
00:12:22,815 --> 00:12:24,649
so it may not be
my best work.

311
00:12:24,717 --> 00:12:26,217
"Shape up
or show me your balls."

312
00:12:26,285 --> 00:12:27,252
That's good.

313
00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:28,419
Really?

314
00:12:28,487 --> 00:12:29,687
How about this one?

315
00:12:29,755 --> 00:12:31,089
"In your face, Nancy Grace."

316
00:12:31,157 --> 00:12:32,257
Oh, I love it.

317
00:12:32,324 --> 00:12:34,325
Oh, man, there are a lot
of good ones here.

318
00:12:34,393 --> 00:12:37,295
"Fire alarm?
I <i>am</i> the fire alarm."

319
00:12:37,363 --> 00:12:39,097
"Find your own
beach house, Crabby."

320
00:12:39,165 --> 00:12:40,999
"Put that in your
office and frame it."

321
00:12:41,066 --> 00:12:42,367
That last one's kind of lame.

322
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:44,536
Did you get down to the one
at the bottom there?

323
00:12:44,603 --> 00:12:46,070
Which one?

324
00:12:46,138 --> 00:12:48,306
- "On your mark, get set, terrible."
- No, this one here.

325
00:12:48,374 --> 00:12:50,608
"If you've got a problem,
take it up with my butt.

326
00:12:50,676 --> 00:12:52,710
He's the only one
that gives a crap."

327
00:12:52,778 --> 00:12:54,312
- Oh, my God, that's it.
- Yeah.

328
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,747
- That... That's the one.
- I thought you'd like...

329
00:12:55,815 --> 00:12:56,981
You are amaz...

330
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:57,949
LOIS:
Peter, dinner.

331
00:12:58,017 --> 00:12:59,584
Take it up with my butt,

332
00:12:59,652 --> 00:13:01,553
'cause he's the only one
who gives a crap.

333
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,289
LOIS:
Wow, what a great sentence.

334
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,395
You know, Lois,
I've noticed Peter and Carter

335
00:13:10,462 --> 00:13:12,630
spending a lot of time
together lately.

336
00:13:12,698 --> 00:13:14,799
It's nice to see them
finally getting on.

337
00:13:14,867 --> 00:13:16,734
I know. Who would
have thought, huh?

338
00:13:16,802 --> 00:13:18,636
PETER: Boy, I can't wait
to get this home.

339
00:13:18,704 --> 00:13:21,105
You know, I keep not laughing
at <i>The Big Bang Theory,</i>

340
00:13:21,173 --> 00:13:23,741
and I figure it's got
to be the television, you know?

341
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:27,445
TV this size... Forget it, it'll have me
laughing till I got snots falling out of my nose.

342
00:13:27,513 --> 00:13:29,747
Carter, where are you
taking our television?

343
00:13:29,815 --> 00:13:31,216
I'm giving it to Peter.

344
00:13:31,283 --> 00:13:32,884
What?! Why?

345
00:13:32,952 --> 00:13:34,986
Yeah, why, Carter?
(sighs)

346
00:13:35,054 --> 00:13:37,055
(mechanically):
Because Peter is the best

347
00:13:37,122 --> 00:13:40,091
and he is awesome and he makes
better laser sounds than I do.

348
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:41,326
(makes laser sounds)

349
00:13:41,393 --> 00:13:42,894
Damn right.
You hear that, Lois?

350
00:13:42,962 --> 00:13:44,596
And he's not just saying that

351
00:13:44,663 --> 00:13:46,497
'cause I covered for him
about his affair.

352
00:13:46,565 --> 00:13:47,765
What?

353
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,902
Carter, is this true?

354
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:54,272
Yes, it's true.

355
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,841
Oh... Oh, dear!
(cup breaking)

356
00:13:56,909 --> 00:13:58,476
(sobbing)

357
00:14:02,248 --> 00:14:04,549
Well, on your mark,
get set, terrible.

358
00:14:04,617 --> 00:14:05,917
(laughing)

359
00:14:05,985 --> 00:14:08,219
No, no, but I...
I understand that this is bad.

360
00:14:13,864 --> 00:14:15,634
You stupid fat bastard!

361
00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:17,240
How could you tell her
I had an affair?!

362
00:14:17,408 --> 00:14:18,042
We had a deal!

363
00:14:18,084 --> 00:14:20,252
Look, I think you're blowing
this out of proportion, Carter.

364
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,587
She's divorcing me!

365
00:14:21,655 --> 00:14:23,122
Well, I don't blame her.

366
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:25,291
Daddy, how could you
do this to Mom?

367
00:14:25,358 --> 00:14:26,825
You two were perfect together.

368
00:14:26,893 --> 00:14:28,727
It was such a close marriage.

369
00:14:28,795 --> 00:14:30,596
You know, maybe the two
of you splitting up

370
00:14:30,664 --> 00:14:31,964
is a blessing in disguise.

371
00:14:32,032 --> 00:14:35,167
I mean, there are obviously some
problems in your relationship.

372
00:14:35,235 --> 00:14:37,703
Who knows, maybe some time apart
could be just what you need.

373
00:14:37,771 --> 00:14:41,073
Yeah, plus think of all the fun stuff
you can do as a single guy.

374
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:42,574
Like... Like going to loud,
awful bars

375
00:14:42,642 --> 00:14:44,543
and not being able to heart
the mediocre-looking chick

376
00:14:44,611 --> 00:14:45,711
next to you say
something stupid.

377
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:47,046
It's going to be awesome.

378
00:14:47,113 --> 00:14:48,714
I don't know how to do
anything like that.

379
00:14:48,782 --> 00:14:50,115
It's easy.

380
00:14:50,183 --> 00:14:52,084
I'll help you meet some women,
Mr. Pewterschmidt.

381
00:14:52,152 --> 00:14:54,320
Come on, it's been fifty years
since I've been on a date.

382
00:14:54,387 --> 00:14:56,255
Well, how'd you get that chick
on the boat, then?

383
00:14:56,323 --> 00:14:57,823
You know how
in that movie

384
00:14:57,891 --> 00:14:59,892
- Liam Neeson gets his daughter back?
- Yeah.

385
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:02,361
Well, that was one of the girls
their dad didn't get back.

386
00:15:10,303 --> 00:15:11,537
What kind of joint is this?

387
00:15:11,604 --> 00:15:12,738
Where's the cigarette girl?

388
00:15:12,806 --> 00:15:14,473
Yeah, they don't
have those anymore.

389
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,141
Peter, I don't know about this.

390
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:18,577
I have no idea what women
are like nowadays.

391
00:15:18,645 --> 00:15:20,212
Last time I was on the dating scene,

392
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,315
Joe McCarthy was on a rampage
looking for anything red.

393
00:15:23,383 --> 00:15:25,217
Oh, back then I called
my penis Joe McCarthy.

394
00:15:25,285 --> 00:15:26,452
Look, relax, will ya?

395
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,487
Here, I got these off a web site

396
00:15:28,555 --> 00:15:30,889
that tells you good things
to say when hot women walk by.

397
00:15:30,957 --> 00:15:32,391
Ooh, here comes a hot one.

398
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:34,159
Say the first thing on the list.

399
00:15:34,227 --> 00:15:36,562
Um, I... I love getting
trendy cupcakes

400
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:38,430
in the middle of the
day for no reason.

401
00:15:38,498 --> 00:15:39,631
No way. So do I.

402
00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:40,833
Hi. I'm Paula.

403
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,167
Carter. How do you do?

404
00:15:42,235 --> 00:15:43,602
Hey, why don't you
and your friend

405
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,170
come join us over
at our table?

406
00:15:45,238 --> 00:15:46,572
Peter Griffin.
How do you do?

407
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,507
(sputtering laugh)

408
00:15:48,575 --> 00:15:50,376
We would...
We would love to.

409
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:54,713
Hey, girls, these are
my two new friends.

410
00:15:54,781 --> 00:15:56,415
Hello, ladies.
My name is Carter,

411
00:15:56,483 --> 00:15:58,751
and I require a tremendous
amount of calcium.

412
00:15:58,818 --> 00:15:59,952
Carter, come here.

413
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:01,620
Sit next to me.

414
00:16:01,688 --> 00:16:02,821
Oh, this is...
This is fun.

415
00:16:02,889 --> 00:16:04,089
We're having fun.

416
00:16:04,157 --> 00:16:05,724
Hey, what do you say
we get some drinks?

417
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:07,259
Hey, boy, boy,

418
00:16:07,327 --> 00:16:08,727
fetch me a John
Barrymore and soda

419
00:16:08,795 --> 00:16:10,195
and three Myrna Loys
for the women.

420
00:16:10,263 --> 00:16:11,230
(women gasp)

421
00:16:11,297 --> 00:16:12,464
Excuse me?

422
00:16:12,532 --> 00:16:14,633
What the hell is
your problem, you jerk?

423
00:16:14,701 --> 00:16:17,736
What? Does he belong
to somebody else?

424
00:16:17,804 --> 00:16:20,639
Come on, girls,
let's ditch this racist dick.

425
00:16:20,707 --> 00:16:22,408
What happened?
Did we get laid?

426
00:16:22,475 --> 00:16:24,510
You jackass. Those women
were coming on to you

427
00:16:24,577 --> 00:16:25,611
and you blew it.

428
00:16:25,678 --> 00:16:28,647
Now we got to go to another club
and start all over again.

429
00:16:28,715 --> 00:16:31,083
Peter, I don't want
to go to another club.

430
00:16:31,151 --> 00:16:33,318
I don't want women like that.

431
00:16:33,386 --> 00:16:35,954
I... I want Babs.

432
00:16:36,022 --> 00:16:37,356
Babs?

433
00:16:37,424 --> 00:16:39,024
You got a room full
of chicks like that

434
00:16:39,092 --> 00:16:40,325
and you're thinking
about Babs?

435
00:16:40,393 --> 00:16:42,027
She looks like someone
farted in a shoe.

436
00:16:42,095 --> 00:16:45,798
I had a moment of weakness, but I...
I know now that I was wrong.

437
00:16:45,865 --> 00:16:47,766
I need her, Peter.

438
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:49,001
I love her.

439
00:16:49,068 --> 00:16:51,003
You... You got to help me
get her back.

440
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,805
Well, it's probably
the right move anyway.

441
00:16:52,872 --> 00:16:54,540
Those girls seemed
kind of annoying.

442
00:16:54,607 --> 00:16:56,775
Look at them over there
taking a group picture together.

443
00:16:56,843 --> 00:16:58,277
I love you!

444
00:16:58,344 --> 00:16:59,445
I love you!

445
00:16:59,512 --> 00:17:01,079
We're all such good friends!

446
00:17:01,147 --> 00:17:03,749
You can tell by the way we're
pressing our faces together.

447
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,488
And that's where
fat girls come from.

448
00:17:11,724 --> 00:17:13,759
All right, if I've learned
anything from romantic comedies

449
00:17:13,827 --> 00:17:16,528
it's that the ex-wife always falls
in love with her husband again

450
00:17:16,596 --> 00:17:17,930
after he befriends a little kid.

451
00:17:17,997 --> 00:17:19,064
Okay.

452
00:17:19,132 --> 00:17:21,200
And the kid needs
to be really cute.

453
00:17:21,267 --> 00:17:23,202
So I ordered Jonathan Lipnicki.
(doorbell ringing)

454
00:17:23,269 --> 00:17:24,837
Ah, there's the cute
little guy now.

455
00:17:24,904 --> 00:17:26,438
Hang on.

456
00:17:26,506 --> 00:17:27,539
(door opening)

457
00:17:27,607 --> 00:17:29,708
PETER: Oh, my God!
What happened to you!

458
00:17:29,776 --> 00:17:32,277
Oh! Oh! We... We got to
get you to the hospital!

459
00:17:32,345 --> 00:17:33,846
Aah! Aah!
You're hideous!

460
00:17:33,913 --> 00:17:35,113
Who did this to you?!

461
00:17:35,181 --> 00:17:36,615
Oh, oh, where are my keys?

462
00:17:36,683 --> 00:17:38,217
Where's my keys?!
Where are my keys?!

463
00:17:38,284 --> 00:17:39,618
Peter, what about Babs?

464
00:17:39,686 --> 00:17:41,687
Forget about yourself
for a second, Carter.

465
00:17:41,754 --> 00:17:44,056
Look what has happened
to Jonathan Lipnicki.

466
00:17:44,123 --> 00:17:45,424
Oh, yeah.

467
00:17:45,492 --> 00:17:46,725
No, you're...
You're... You're right.

468
00:17:46,793 --> 00:17:48,160
You should probably
take care of that.

469
00:17:48,228 --> 00:17:49,962
I'll... I'll... I'll be...
I'll be here.

470
00:17:52,098 --> 00:17:53,332
All right, look, Carter,

471
00:17:53,399 --> 00:17:54,666
I think this will
definitely work.

472
00:17:54,734 --> 00:17:56,168
Now as soon as she sees you,

473
00:17:56,236 --> 00:17:57,769
you've got to do
exactly what I...

474
00:17:57,837 --> 00:17:59,738
Hey, whose Duesenberg is that
parked in the driveway?

475
00:18:01,741 --> 00:18:05,711
There's only one man I know
who drives a Duesenberg.

476
00:18:05,778 --> 00:18:12,251
♪ And I will buy you
laudanum and rhubarb cakes ♪

477
00:18:12,318 --> 00:18:18,824
♪ to balance out your
fragile body's humors. ♪

478
00:18:18,892 --> 00:18:21,460
Oh, Babs, I don't
wish to overwhelm you

479
00:18:21,528 --> 00:18:23,762
with my passions,
but I must say this.

480
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,264
I'm ever so content.

481
00:18:25,331 --> 00:18:28,000
Oh, I am too, Rodginald.

482
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:30,002
Do you think perhaps one day,

483
00:18:30,069 --> 00:18:32,971
if we should marry,
that I could sit beside you?

484
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,374
Yes, I think that would be fine.

485
00:18:35,441 --> 00:18:38,043
Get away from my wife,
you rascal!

486
00:18:38,111 --> 00:18:41,013
Oh, such language
in the presence of a lady.

487
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,082
If it's a row you want,
I will cleave you in twixt!

488
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,852
Hang... Hang on, Carter, I think
I know how to take this guy down.

489
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,986
Penis.

490
00:18:48,054 --> 00:18:49,788
(gasps)

491
00:18:49,856 --> 00:18:52,457
Carter, get out of here this instant!

492
00:18:52,525 --> 00:18:54,560
I don't ever want to see you again.

493
00:18:54,627 --> 00:18:56,628
Pussycup, please.

494
00:18:56,696 --> 00:18:59,398
Mrs. Pewterschmidt, Carter has
something important to say to you.

495
00:18:59,465 --> 00:19:02,067
I'll set the mood.

496
00:19:02,135 --> 00:19:06,405
(singing romantically):
♪ B-B-Bird, bird, bird ♪

497
00:19:06,472 --> 00:19:08,340
♪ B-Bird's the word. ♪

498
00:19:08,408 --> 00:19:11,743
♪ B-B-Bird, bird, bird, ♪

499
00:19:11,811 --> 00:19:14,379
♪ B-Bird's the word. ♪

500
00:19:14,447 --> 00:19:19,585
♪ Well, uh, don't you
know about the bird? ♪

501
00:19:19,652 --> 00:19:25,424
♪ Well, everybody knows
that the bird is the word. ♪

502
00:19:25,491 --> 00:19:28,093
Uh, Peter, I kind of want
to do this on my own.

503
00:19:28,161 --> 00:19:30,829
Babs, I need you.

504
00:19:30,897 --> 00:19:34,433
Cheating on you was the
worst mistake of my life.

505
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,303
I kneel before you a frightened soul
and a broken man.

506
00:19:38,371 --> 00:19:40,539
A man who has nothing
without you.

507
00:19:40,607 --> 00:19:42,374
Give me one more chance,

508
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:45,944
and I pledge to place above you
nothing... Not even myself...

509
00:19:46,012 --> 00:19:49,481
For all my time here,
and for time forever.

510
00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:52,351
Please, I beg you.

511
00:19:53,586 --> 00:19:57,389
Carter, what you did
was unforgivable.

512
00:19:57,457 --> 00:19:59,858
And as beautiful
as your words are,

513
00:19:59,926 --> 00:20:03,528
I... I just don't know
that they can fix what's done.

514
00:20:03,596 --> 00:20:06,231
I know I can't do it overnight,

515
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:08,567
but we can still have
a lot of years together.

516
00:20:08,635 --> 00:20:11,336
Please, just let me try.

517
00:20:11,404 --> 00:20:15,774
Carter, you had sex
with that woman.

518
00:20:15,842 --> 00:20:18,844
So, no, I can't trust you.

519
00:20:18,911 --> 00:20:22,781
But at my age, I'm certainly
not going to remarry either.

520
00:20:22,849 --> 00:20:26,118
So, if you'd like
to move back in

521
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:29,721
and take things slowly,
one step at a time,

522
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:32,324
I suppose I can
give you the chance

523
00:20:32,392 --> 00:20:33,859
to earn my trust again.

524
00:20:33,926 --> 00:20:36,028
That sounds like a lot of work.
Go to hell!

525
00:20:36,095 --> 00:20:37,496
Carter, what... What... What...
What are we here for?

526
00:20:37,563 --> 00:20:38,597
What are we here for?

527
00:20:38,665 --> 00:20:39,831
All right... All right, fine.

528
00:20:39,899 --> 00:20:43,301
I'm... I'm...
I'm gonna try.

529
00:20:48,474 --> 00:20:50,142
Come here, you.

530
00:20:59,886 --> 00:21:02,521
Hey look, I found
a genie's lamp.

531
00:21:02,588 --> 00:21:04,289
PETER:
Oh, no?

532
00:21:04,357 --> 00:21:05,924
Okay, maybe next week.

533
00:21:06,334 --> 00:21:10,354
