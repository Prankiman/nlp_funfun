12
00:00:36,554 --> 00:00:38,221
Okay, Brian, here we are.

13
00:00:38,255 --> 00:00:39,789
Hey, thanks for fitting in
the ride to school

14
00:00:39,824 --> 00:00:41,624
in between your texts.

15
00:00:41,659 --> 00:00:42,725
Totally, Chris, totally.

16
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,594
I'm sure it'll all
work itself out.

17
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:45,895
And good luck on that thing.

18
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,531
You know, that was a stroller,
not a speed bump.

19
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:55,138
Uh-oh. This looks like trouble.

20
00:00:55,172 --> 00:00:57,974
I'll know they're bullies
if they use my full name.

21
00:00:58,008 --> 00:00:59,309
Well, look who it is.

22
00:00:59,343 --> 00:01:00,510
Chris Griffin.

23
00:01:00,544 --> 00:01:01,511
Oh, boy.

24
00:01:01,545 --> 00:01:02,679
Hey, fat ass.

25
00:01:02,713 --> 00:01:04,447
Your boobs are bigger
than your sister's.

26
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:06,249
Oh, yeah? Well...

27
00:01:06,283 --> 00:01:08,952
you have a sister as well.

28
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:10,720
That's your comeback?

29
00:01:10,754 --> 00:01:11,721
(bullies laugh)

30
00:01:11,755 --> 00:01:12,722
Oh, man!

31
00:01:12,756 --> 00:01:14,824
Oh, my God. Poor Chris.

32
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:17,760
He's a social outcast
like Scarface.

33
00:01:17,795 --> 00:01:18,995
Okay, we have a deal.

34
00:01:19,029 --> 00:01:21,297
You bring the money,
I get you the coke.

35
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:22,966
You got it, Scarface.

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,033
Oh, my God!

37
00:01:24,068 --> 00:01:25,368
You can see that?

38
00:01:25,402 --> 00:01:27,437
The doctor said
you wouldn't be able to!

39
00:01:27,471 --> 00:01:28,972
Yes, everyone can see that.

40
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:30,406
That's why we call
you Scarface.

41
00:01:30,441 --> 00:01:33,343
Whoa, whoa, whoa! "We"?

42
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:41,351
Well, I have officially seen
every video ever on YouTube.

43
00:01:41,385 --> 00:01:43,520
Got to say,
there's not a bad one.

44
00:01:43,554 --> 00:01:46,289
I need these shipping invoices
filed immediately.

45
00:01:46,323 --> 00:01:49,259
I'll be right back.

46
00:01:49,293 --> 00:01:50,293
There she goes again.

47
00:01:50,327 --> 00:01:51,394
How come she always skips out

48
00:01:51,428 --> 00:01:52,462
when there's work to do?

49
00:01:52,496 --> 00:01:54,430
She's just taking
a smoke break.

50
00:01:54,465 --> 00:01:56,266
A deaf person smoking.

51
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,967
That's-that's weird.

52
00:01:58,002 --> 00:01:59,302
Why is that weird?

53
00:01:59,336 --> 00:02:00,737
That... I mean, there's
no reason that that's weird,

54
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:02,672
but it-it-it is weird, right?

55
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:04,374
Yes, Griffin, it's weird.

56
00:02:04,408 --> 00:02:06,509
Wait, so you mean to tell me,
if I ever want to get out

57
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:08,344
of something, all I got
to do is take a smoke break?

58
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:09,379
Well, I suppose.

59
00:02:09,413 --> 00:02:11,047
But you don't smoke.

60
00:02:11,081 --> 00:02:14,784
Well, actually I do.

61
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:51,788
All right, Griffin.

62
00:02:51,822 --> 00:02:53,089
You're clearly a smoker.

63
00:02:53,123 --> 00:02:54,891
Enjoy your break.

64
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:57,327
Wow, I can use smoking
to get out of anything.

65
00:02:57,361 --> 00:03:00,630
Finally, I'm above the law
like my 14th century ancestor

66
00:03:00,664 --> 00:03:03,533
King of Denmark Griffin.

67
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:05,234
More wine! More women!

68
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:06,636
More table!

69
00:03:08,872 --> 00:03:10,873
(laughing)

70
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:13,276
(groaning)

71
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,911
I'm having a heart attack!

72
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,846
Is anyone at the table a doctor?

73
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,847
I am!

74
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:20,249
Come here! Hurry! Run!

75
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:23,786
"But the very far-away doctor
couldn't make it in time."

76
00:03:23,821 --> 00:03:27,757
And that's why here in Denmark
we have very small tables.

77
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:37,266
Okay, Stewie, time to
change your diaper.

78
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:40,536
Ooh! Oh, smoke break!

79
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:42,538
Well, this is
how Scott Caan was raised,

80
00:03:42,573 --> 00:03:44,574
and he turned out okay.

81
00:03:48,012 --> 00:03:50,213
Hey, Dad, want to hear a story
about my day at school?

82
00:03:50,247 --> 00:03:52,081
It's about my hot
friend Melissa.

83
00:03:52,116 --> 00:03:53,182
Okay.

84
00:03:53,217 --> 00:03:54,884
She didn't wear a
bra to school today.

85
00:03:54,918 --> 00:03:56,219
Okay.

86
00:03:56,253 --> 00:03:58,921
And someone spilled water
all over her white shirt.

87
00:03:58,956 --> 00:04:00,256
Okay.

88
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,225
And it was cold, so you
could see everything.

89
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:03,960
Okay.

90
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,229
Then she left and I realized
I was all alone...

91
00:04:06,263 --> 00:04:08,898
Smoke break!

92
00:04:13,137 --> 00:04:14,370
Hey, Chris?

93
00:04:14,405 --> 00:04:17,173
I-I wanted to talk about
what happened at school...

94
00:04:17,207 --> 00:04:18,941
Is that a dead gerbil in there?

95
00:04:18,976 --> 00:04:20,176
That's a fur fish.

96
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:21,711
It's a weird species.

97
00:04:21,745 --> 00:04:23,379
You put them in there,
and they swim like hell

98
00:04:23,414 --> 00:04:25,815
for, like, 30 seconds,
and then they go to sleep.

99
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,684
This joker still
hasn't woken up.

100
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:29,619
Get up, lazy!

101
00:04:29,653 --> 00:04:30,653
You know, the way those kids

102
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:32,288
were picking on you
today in school.

103
00:04:32,322 --> 00:04:33,790
You really got to stand
up for yourself.

104
00:04:33,824 --> 00:04:35,825
Stewie, it's not so easy.

105
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,428
What would you say if I said,
"Hey there, shorty"?

106
00:04:38,462 --> 00:04:41,297
I'd say, "Have another
doughnut, you albino gorilla."

107
00:04:41,331 --> 00:04:43,332
Oh, yeah? Well...

108
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:45,635
you have a sister as well.

109
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:49,639
Oh, Stewie, I-I could never
come up with stuff like you do.

110
00:04:49,673 --> 00:04:51,207
Of course not.
You're sweet and simple.

111
00:04:51,241 --> 00:04:53,276
But even you could learn
enough to outsmart

112
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,777
those cretins at your school.

113
00:04:54,812 --> 00:04:56,312
And they'll respect you for it.

114
00:04:56,346 --> 00:04:58,214
In fact, I'll teach you how.

115
00:04:58,248 --> 00:04:59,582
Why would you do that for me?

116
00:04:59,616 --> 00:05:01,117
I'm your brother, Chris.

117
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:02,952
We're a team and we've got
to look out for each other.

118
00:05:02,986 --> 00:05:05,488
Like Owl and Costello.

119
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:06,756
I mean the fellow's
name on first base.

120
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,458
Who.
The fellow playing first base.

121
00:05:08,492 --> 00:05:10,093
Who.
The guy on first base.

122
00:05:10,127 --> 00:05:12,295
Who.
I'm asking you who's on first!

123
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:14,697
Who.
That's what I'm asking you!

124
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:18,634
Nothing will ever be funnier
than misunderstandings.

125
00:05:24,608 --> 00:05:25,742
All right, Chris,
here they come.

126
00:05:25,776 --> 00:05:26,976
Now, remember what we practiced.

127
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,611
Now, what are you gonna call
the one in the middle?

128
00:05:28,645 --> 00:05:30,313
Isosceles triangle?

129
00:05:30,347 --> 00:05:31,414
What?! Come on, Chris!

130
00:05:31,448 --> 00:05:32,482
We worked on this all night.

131
00:05:32,516 --> 00:05:35,284
I know! I also had
a geometry test!

132
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,652
Well, how'd that go?

133
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:42,859
Hey, look who it is.

134
00:05:42,893 --> 00:05:44,193
Dorky Pig.

135
00:05:44,228 --> 00:05:45,595
Go on, Chris. It's now or never.

136
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:46,929
Let them have it.

137
00:05:46,964 --> 00:05:47,964
Nice muscles.

138
00:05:47,998 --> 00:05:50,233
What, do you belong to a gym?

139
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,701
Oh, for God's sake, Chris.

140
00:05:51,735 --> 00:05:53,770
Here, put me on your back
and repeat what I say.

141
00:05:53,804 --> 00:05:57,440
Quick! Here they come!

142
00:05:57,474 --> 00:05:59,776
You're even uglier
up close, Griffin.

143
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,278
Okay, now say...
(indistinct whispering)

144
00:06:02,312 --> 00:06:04,914
I heard you were born
out of your mom's butt.

145
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,917
I heard that from your mom
while I was doing her.

146
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,252
You're a butt baby.

147
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,521
That's why you've got moles
all over your chest.

148
00:06:11,555 --> 00:06:13,689
Leftover birth dook.

149
00:06:13,724 --> 00:06:15,324
(all laughing)

150
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:17,260
Oh, man!
Griffin schooled him!

151
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:18,561
I can't believe I'm
moving tomorrow,

152
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:20,863
and I won't get to see
how this works out.

153
00:06:20,898 --> 00:06:23,266
Wow, Stewie, we're gonna
work perfectly together.

154
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,802
Like Sherlock
Holmes and Watson.

155
00:06:25,836 --> 00:06:26,969
Watson, a clue!

156
00:06:27,004 --> 00:06:29,038
The intruder has
tracked in a red clay,

157
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:32,341
which can only be found near
London's homosexual bathhouse.

158
00:06:32,376 --> 00:06:33,643
Amazing, Holmes.

159
00:06:33,677 --> 00:06:34,744
How did you know that?

160
00:06:34,778 --> 00:06:37,246
Just from, like,
books and stuff.

161
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:43,052
Your turn.

162
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,889
You know, Peter, it's so nice

163
00:06:46,924 --> 00:06:48,624
that after all these years
we've been together,

164
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,092
we can still...
Smoke break!

165
00:06:50,127 --> 00:06:52,128
What? Peter, what are you
doing down there?

166
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,196
Nothing.

167
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,964
Well, it doesn't
seem like nothing.

168
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,600
(coughing)

169
00:06:57,634 --> 00:06:59,836
Peter, since when
are you a smoker?

170
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,270
Put that out right now!

171
00:07:01,305 --> 00:07:03,105
Smoking is highly addictive.

172
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,307
I'm not addicted.

173
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,908
I just need a couple
every hour or so,

174
00:07:05,943 --> 00:07:07,443
so I don't go
completely insane.

175
00:07:07,477 --> 00:07:09,545
Peter, that's exactly
what addicted means.

176
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,380
You have a serious problem.

177
00:07:11,415 --> 00:07:12,882
Cigarettes will kill you.

178
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,884
Relax, Lois.
I can quit any time I want.

179
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:17,320
Look, I'll toss
this one out right now.

180
00:07:18,555 --> 00:07:21,290
I'm so sorry I threw you
out the window!

181
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,295
Hey, man, can you keep it down?

182
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,464
Sorry.
Wait, whose bedroom are you in?

183
00:07:28,498 --> 00:07:29,465
Meg's.

184
00:07:29,499 --> 00:07:30,633
Okay, that's fine then.

185
00:07:34,975 --> 00:07:36,343
Where's Dad?

186
00:07:36,377 --> 00:07:39,612
Your father got up early
and went for a run.

187
00:07:40,915 --> 00:07:42,649
Ah, nothing
like an after-run mint

188
00:07:42,683 --> 00:07:45,552
to get rid
of that jogger's breath.

189
00:07:45,586 --> 00:07:47,420
Okay, now sit down
and have some breakfast.

190
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,255
I made your favorite--
waffles and...

191
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,591
Hey, uh, did anybody get
the paper today?

192
00:07:55,363 --> 00:07:56,830
Ah, nothing
like an after-paper mint

193
00:07:56,864 --> 00:07:59,632
to get rid
of that paper-getting breath.

194
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:01,427
You know, I feel like
these waffles could use

195
00:08:01,435 --> 00:08:03,303
a little fresh air.
Come on, boys.

196
00:08:03,337 --> 00:08:04,304
Peter, sit down.

197
00:08:04,338 --> 00:08:06,339
You need your breakfast.

198
00:08:15,216 --> 00:08:17,584
Oh, Peter,
I meant to tell you.

199
00:08:17,618 --> 00:08:20,220
Remember my cousin Sylvia's
husband Robert? Well...

200
00:08:20,254 --> 00:08:21,855
Does this story
have an end?!

201
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:23,456
Peter, I just started.

202
00:08:23,491 --> 00:08:24,991
Oh, Meg's out of milk.
I'll get you a carton.

203
00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:26,059
Hey, good story, Lois.

204
00:08:26,093 --> 00:08:27,994
You wrapped it up nicely.

205
00:08:33,033 --> 00:08:34,667
I know it's technically
not illegal,

206
00:08:34,702 --> 00:08:37,303
but it seemed wrong when
your music teacher wrapped

207
00:08:37,338 --> 00:08:39,939
a trash bag around his waist
so he could change pants.

208
00:08:39,974 --> 00:08:42,075
BOY:
Hey, Jew-bacca!

209
00:08:42,109 --> 00:08:45,678
Passover's stupid and I'm gonna
prove it by breaking your nose.

210
00:08:45,713 --> 00:08:46,913
Hey!

211
00:08:46,947 --> 00:08:49,015
Why don't you pick on someone
your own religion

212
00:08:49,049 --> 00:08:50,884
who can fight for themselves?

213
00:08:50,918 --> 00:08:52,285
And you're not so tough.

214
00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:54,387
You frequently opt
out of swim class

215
00:08:54,422 --> 00:08:57,123
because of your gross
microcephalic penis.

216
00:08:57,158 --> 00:08:58,458
It's not gross!

217
00:08:58,492 --> 00:08:59,659
It's special.

218
00:08:59,693 --> 00:09:02,429
I can use it
to reset my cable box.

219
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:06,032
Hey, Chris, what you did there
for that sweaty Jew?

220
00:09:06,066 --> 00:09:07,634
That was really nice.

221
00:09:07,668 --> 00:09:09,068
Back away, foul wench!

222
00:09:09,103 --> 00:09:12,605
Your wide hips hold
no temptation for me!

Uh... I mean...

224
00:09:14,308 --> 00:09:15,508
you have...

225
00:09:17,144 --> 00:09:18,411
...a-a vulva...

226
00:09:18,446 --> 00:09:20,413
and fallopian tubes.

227
00:09:20,448 --> 00:09:22,115
Finally!
A guy who listens!

228
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:25,351
Here's my number.

00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,028
Well, you know, at first
it was a way to get out of work,

232
00:09:35,062 --> 00:09:37,030
but then I discovered
it's a delightful habit

233
00:09:37,064 --> 00:09:39,098
that has lots of benefits.
Yeah? Like what?

234
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:41,267
Like I get to punctuate
tough conversations

235
00:09:41,302 --> 00:09:42,902
by ashing a cigarette.

God, there's, like, no one hot

00:10:06,026 --> 00:10:08,228
Okay, students, take your seats.

245
00:10:09,763 --> 00:10:11,564
First off, we have a new rule:

246
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:14,634
no more asking the gym teachers
if they went to college.

247

They did not.

Next, it's time for nominations
for student body president.

Come on, you're getting
crucified out there!

Do you think I can jump

I don't know.
The hell I can't!

Yeah, I guess
your fingertips grazed it.

Yeah, that counts
as a dunk.

290
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:51,764
Dr. Hartman, we're here for you
to help Peter quit smoking.

291
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:54,100
Mrs. Griffin, I can't do
that. It's an addiction.

292
00:11:54,134 --> 00:11:56,436
I can't even get my
son to quit being gay.

Well, you got to do something!
He's killing himself!

(groans) All right, how many Vicodins for
you guys to just leave me alone?

00:12:01,942 --> 00:12:03,176
Forty.

296
00:12:04,478 --> 00:12:07,180
Well, it's too bad
Dr. Hartman couldn't help us.

297
00:12:07,214 --> 00:12:09,182
I guess we should go
to the Stop Smoking Clinic

298
00:12:09,216 --> 00:12:11,584
and then maybe get
a couple bottles of wine.

Ready to go to school?

Well, actually, Chris,
I've got good news.

301
00:12:20,694 --> 00:12:22,662
Aw, I'll take
the bad news first.

302
00:12:22,696 --> 00:12:24,464
No. What? There
is no bad news.

303
00:12:24,498 --> 00:12:26,599
Oh, all right. Then give me
the good news first.

304
00:12:26,634 --> 00:12:29,602
(sighs) The good news is, I've taught
you everything you need to know

305
00:12:29,637 --> 00:12:30,803
to fend for yourself.

306
00:12:30,838 --> 00:12:33,506
So from now on, you can
go to school without me.

307
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,641
What are you talking about?

You're coming to school with me

Let me out! You can't keep me
in here forever!

313
00:12:43,984 --> 00:12:45,485
I have too many plans
for the future!

314
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,153
I'll never win a Nobel Prize!

315
00:12:47,187 --> 00:12:48,955
I'll never be a member
of Parliament!

316
00:12:48,989 --> 00:12:51,224
I'll never get to express
disappointment with young people

Stupid younger generation.

00:12:55,062 --> 00:12:58,031
Back in my day, we had
Katy Perry, Justin Bieber.

320
00:12:58,065 --> 00:12:59,766
That was real music.

321
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,801
(slurping sounds)

322
00:13:10,911 --> 00:13:12,545
Lois, why do all the people
in here look

323
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:13,880
like Emperor Palpatine?

324
00:13:13,914 --> 00:13:16,015
Because they're all
heavy smokers, Peter.

325
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,850
I'm gonna sign you in.

326
00:13:19,253 --> 00:13:23,623
Would the driver of a 1978
Camaro please move your car?

327
00:13:23,657 --> 00:13:25,658
(others coughing)

328
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:29,662
Man, how the hell
am I gonna quit smoking?

329
00:13:29,697 --> 00:13:32,699
I wish smoking
could just quit me instead.

330
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:34,300
Thank you
for meeting me here.

331
00:13:34,334 --> 00:13:36,803
I have something
very important to tell you.

332
00:13:36,837 --> 00:13:38,938
I have something
important to tell you, too.

333
00:13:38,972 --> 00:13:41,941
Peter, I think we
should see other people.

334
00:13:42,976 --> 00:13:44,610
(tearfully):
Okay.

335
00:13:46,947 --> 00:13:50,383
Uh, good, that's what
I was gonna say, too.

336
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:52,985
Excuse me, I'm Mr. Stone
with the ad agency

337
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,987
of Anderson, Wheeler
and Thirdname.

338
00:13:55,022 --> 00:13:58,725
And I think you'd be perfect for
our new anti-smoking campaign.

339
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:01,260
Me? You'd want me on TV?

340
00:14:01,295 --> 00:14:02,595
Even though I'm hideous?

341
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:04,530
Sure. Have you seen
<i>Boardwalk Empire?</i>

342
00:14:04,565 --> 00:14:06,933
It's just a crap-fest
of faces.

343
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:09,535
There is one catch: if you're
gonna be our spokesman,

344
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,204
you have to keep smoking.

345
00:14:11,238 --> 00:14:13,272
We need you to stay wrinkled
and sickly.

346
00:14:13,307 --> 00:14:15,975
But my wife brought me here
to quit smoking.

347
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:17,710
(chuckles)
Wives, huh?

348
00:14:17,745 --> 00:14:19,645
O-Okay,
now I'm on your side!

349
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,847
Oh, this is awesome!

350
00:14:20,881 --> 00:14:22,115
I'm gonna be on TV!

351
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:24,117
But no more talk
of quitting, right?

352
00:14:24,151 --> 00:14:26,119
You got it. So, um,

353
00:14:26,153 --> 00:14:27,873
does somethin' like this
pay a lot of money?

354
00:14:27,888 --> 00:14:29,856
What do you think
a lot of money is?

355
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,692
I-I don't want to say.
I'm embarrassed.

356
00:14:37,117 --> 00:14:40,086
ANNOUNCER: And now a word from
the American Lung Association.

357
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,455
Oh, hey, hey, guys! Here
comes one of my TV spots!

358
00:14:42,489 --> 00:14:44,724
Hi, Peter Griffin,
sickly smoker.

359
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,793
This is your heart.

360
00:14:46,827 --> 00:14:49,295
This is your heart
on cigarettes.

361
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,797
Any questions?

362
00:14:50,864 --> 00:14:52,599
Yeah, where'd you get
that heart?

363
00:14:54,535 --> 00:14:56,603
Hey, Peter, now that
you're a celebrity,

364
00:14:56,637 --> 00:14:58,605
could I get a picture
of you to put on the wall?

365
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,872
Sure, here you go.

366
00:14:59,907 --> 00:15:01,374
Thanks, man.

367
00:15:01,408 --> 00:15:03,249
I'll put you up next
to these black celebrities

368
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,645
who are just
confusing strangers to you.

369
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:07,180
Who's Marlin Johnson?

370
00:15:07,214 --> 00:15:09,515
Oh, come on, man.
Stand-up comedian?

371
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:12,719
He got that whole thing
about the "Oh-Ee-Oh-Ee-Hey-Yo."

372
00:15:12,753 --> 00:15:15,588
(laughing): I can't even
get through it.

373
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,590
BLACK MAN: Hey! You talkin'
'bout Marlin Johnson?

374
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,993
You know it!
Oh-Ee-Oh-Ee-Hey-Yo!

375
00:15:20,027 --> 00:15:22,629
(chuckles)
That's right.

376
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,800
Hey, Lois.

377
00:15:27,835 --> 00:15:30,403
Peter, I saw your ad on TV,
and I got to say,

378
00:15:30,437 --> 00:15:32,805
I'm glad you're finally
doing the right thing.

379
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,475
Yeah, it feels good
to be helping people.

380
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:38,144
Peter, what are you doing?!
I thought you quit!

381
00:15:38,178 --> 00:15:40,213
Hey, if George Michael
doesn't have to give up butts,

382
00:15:40,247 --> 00:15:42,248
why should I?

383
00:15:44,285 --> 00:15:47,186
I'm serious.
You have to stop smoking!

384
00:15:47,221 --> 00:15:49,141
Have you looked in the mirror?
You look terrible.

385
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,590
Eh, what do you care?

386
00:15:50,624 --> 00:15:52,992
It's not like you have to look
at my face when we have sex.

387
00:15:53,027 --> 00:15:55,194
Not since we started
role-playing.

388
00:15:55,229 --> 00:15:57,196
Peter, I'm ready.

389
00:15:57,231 --> 00:15:59,999
Okay, now put on yours.

390
00:16:00,034 --> 00:16:03,336
Wow, isn't it weird that
we both picked Mario Lopez?

391
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,605
Yes, Peter.
It's very weird.

392
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:09,509
Yeah, it shows that we both
go Latino but soft Latino.

393
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,316
Day five of my imprisonment
inside Chris' backpack.

394
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,484
Feces and the buildup thereof
continues to be

395
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,886
my number one problem.

396
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,288
I think a teacher saw me
the other day but said nothing.

397
00:16:22,323 --> 00:16:24,090
I waved and he looked away.

398
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,166
This could be my chance
to escape this canvas cage!

399
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,201
(grunting)

400
00:16:39,273 --> 00:16:40,273
(toilet flushes)

401
00:16:44,411 --> 00:16:46,546
That sounds like an open door.
Which way is out?

402
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,414
STUDENT: God, I love walking
in the hall!

403
00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:49,782
There! That way!

404
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:53,720
Must escape!

405
00:16:55,989 --> 00:16:58,324
(slurred):
Must... escape.

406
00:17:01,595 --> 00:17:04,330
Mu...
(mumbling)

407
00:17:05,332 --> 00:17:08,234
You're gonna die in there.

408
00:17:11,271 --> 00:17:13,106
Welcome back,
Mr. Griffin!

409
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,374
You look terrible!

410
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,975
Thanks, man named Sandy!

411
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:17,977
Oh, hey, uh, you know,
I don't know if you're the guy

412
00:17:18,011 --> 00:17:19,979
to talk to about this,
but when I went to my trailer

413
00:17:20,013 --> 00:17:22,515
this morning, there was
a hairy naked guy in it.

414
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:23,850
We don't provide trailers.

415
00:17:23,884 --> 00:17:25,510
We're just next door
to a trailer park.

416
00:17:25,535 --> 00:17:26,085
Ah.

417
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,855
That would explain the violent
lovemaking that followed.

418
00:17:28,889 --> 00:17:30,456
Listen, Peter, we need to talk.

419
00:17:30,491 --> 00:17:33,926
I'm sorry to tell you this, but
we no longer need your services.

420
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:35,395
Wait... What?

421
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,330
How could you do that?!

422
00:17:37,364 --> 00:17:38,731
Well, I went to a NASCAR event

423
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,200
and realized you're just
an average-looking man.

424
00:17:41,235 --> 00:17:42,869
Please! I'll do anything
to keep my job!

425
00:17:42,903 --> 00:17:44,704
N-Name anything you want
and I'll do it!

426
00:17:44,738 --> 00:17:46,739
Touch your toes.

427
00:17:49,176 --> 00:17:51,144
Please give me
something else!

428
00:17:51,178 --> 00:17:54,147
I'm sorry, Peter,
it's over.

429
00:17:57,084 --> 00:17:59,719
(creepily): Why are your eyes
crying, Peter?

430
00:17:59,753 --> 00:18:01,320
They fired me, Larry!

431
00:18:01,355 --> 00:18:04,323
Come on. Let's go kidnap
my neighbor's dog

432
00:18:04,358 --> 00:18:07,226
and tell them
we don't have it.

433
00:18:12,766 --> 00:18:14,467
Good morning, students.

434
00:18:14,501 --> 00:18:17,136
First of all, I don't care
what the courts say,

435
00:18:17,171 --> 00:18:19,138
let's thank
the Christian god together.

436
00:18:19,173 --> 00:18:20,940
Now then, we're here today

437
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,142
for the presidential candidate
debate.

438
00:18:23,177 --> 00:18:25,678
Okay, remember,
people think I'm smart now.

439
00:18:25,712 --> 00:18:28,014
So it's got to be clever
and it's got to pop.

440
00:18:28,048 --> 00:18:30,283
I'm done! I'm not
saying another word.

441
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,218
You can't hold me prisoner
in here forever!

442
00:18:32,252 --> 00:18:35,621
Why not?
Name one person who loves you.

443
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:39,592
Wow. Not a
proportional response.

444
00:18:39,626 --> 00:18:41,794
All right, let's begin
with an opening statement

445
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:45,264
from the perpetually upbeat
black kid.

446
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:46,539
Thanks for letting me go first.

447
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:48,768
I got an hour-and-a-half drive
home after this.

448
00:18:48,802 --> 00:18:50,436
You're not getting it,
Chris, are you?

449
00:18:50,471 --> 00:18:52,505
You were being bullied
day in and day out,

450
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:53,940
so I tried to help you.

451
00:18:53,974 --> 00:18:55,541
I tried to be a good brother.

452
00:18:55,576 --> 00:18:57,343
And you've repaid me with abuse.

453
00:18:57,377 --> 00:18:59,846
You're the bully, Chris Griffin.

454
00:19:02,883 --> 00:19:05,418
Oh, my God.
You're right.

455
00:19:07,754 --> 00:19:11,724
PRINCIPAL SHEPHERD: And now an opening
statement from our second candidate,

456
00:19:11,758 --> 00:19:14,260
the King of the Zingers,
Chris Griffin.

457
00:19:14,294 --> 00:19:16,762
(cheering and applause)

458
00:19:16,797 --> 00:19:18,431
Go easy on me, Chris.

459
00:19:18,465 --> 00:19:20,433
My sister has M.S.

460
00:19:20,467 --> 00:19:22,702
I'm worried what you're
gonna do with that.

461
00:19:22,736 --> 00:19:25,037
I'm out. I'm not running.

462
00:19:25,072 --> 00:19:26,639
And neither is she.

463
00:19:26,673 --> 00:19:28,474
I knew you'd
have something.

464
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:29,809
No, you don't understand.

465
00:19:29,843 --> 00:19:31,978
I'm dropping out
of the election.

466
00:19:32,012 --> 00:19:33,279
(murmuring)

467
00:19:33,313 --> 00:19:34,614
I'm a big fraud,

468
00:19:34,648 --> 00:19:36,616
and I've treated people
terribly.

469
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:40,419
Much like Jeff Zucker
when he ran NBC.

470
00:19:41,455 --> 00:19:42,588
I'm sorry, Stewie.

471
00:19:42,623 --> 00:19:43,923
Can you forgive me?

472
00:19:43,957 --> 00:19:46,759
Well, I may no longer be
on your back,

473
00:19:46,793 --> 00:19:50,096
but I'll always be on your side.

474
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,967
(sighs)
All right,

475
00:19:55,002 --> 00:19:57,169
this election is postponed.
Go back to class.

476
00:19:57,204 --> 00:19:58,504
Oh, and another thing,

477
00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:00,973
stop making fun of teachers
who don't have cars.

478
00:20:01,008 --> 00:20:05,144
Life's not as easy as you think
it's gonna be right now.

479
00:20:10,817 --> 00:20:13,786
You know, Chris, what you did on
that stage took a lot of guts.

480
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,187
Thanks, Stewie.

481
00:20:15,222 --> 00:20:17,723
And thanks to you, I'm no
longer getting bullied.

482
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:18,925
Well, that's great.

483
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:21,127
I guess we put those bullies
in their place, huh?

484
00:20:21,161 --> 00:20:23,329
Yeah. Two of them
shot themselves.

485
00:20:23,363 --> 00:20:25,698
Oh, that's so good
to hear, Chris.

486
00:20:25,732 --> 00:20:27,867
Are they done?
They're-they're all done?

487
00:20:27,901 --> 00:20:29,402
Okay, all right,
let's finish ours.

488
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:33,005
Well, I finally quit smoking and
I'm ready to go back to normal!

489
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,607
Peter, that's not
how it works.

490
00:20:34,641 --> 00:20:36,943
The damage you've done
is irreversible.

491
00:20:36,977 --> 00:20:39,278
Yeah, Lois is right.
As bad as you look,

492
00:20:39,313 --> 00:20:41,881
the damage you've done
to your heart and your lungs is,

493
00:20:41,915 --> 00:20:44,216
no doubt, exponentially worse.
What?!

494
00:20:44,251 --> 00:20:47,431
Well, try cuttin' to the outside
of the house over some music.

495
00:20:47,432 --> 00:20:49,400
That usually works.

496

497
00:20:53,438 --> 00:20:55,172
