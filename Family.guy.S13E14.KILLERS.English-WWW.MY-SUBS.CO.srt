12
00:00:34,143 --> 00:00:37,210
Say, you fellas know
if Jerome serves dessert here?

13
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:38,912
I got a real hankering
for pudding.

14
00:00:38,948 --> 00:00:40,347
That's so weird.

15
00:00:40,382 --> 00:00:42,816
I was just thinking about
pudding on the way over here.

16
00:00:42,851 --> 00:00:44,618
Okay, well,
you two are clearly in love,

17
00:00:44,653 --> 00:00:46,186
but I could also go
for some pudding.

18
00:00:46,221 --> 00:00:47,654
Why we all got pudding
on the brain?

19
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:48,922
It's got to be
that new billboard

20
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:50,891
advertising pudding
on the highway.

21
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,492
We all drove past it
on the way here.

22
00:00:52,528 --> 00:00:53,994
Huh.
Well, that's no surprise.

23
00:00:54,029 --> 00:00:56,163
Everyone in my house
can get very excited

24
00:00:56,198 --> 00:00:58,098
by a good ad campaign.

25
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:04,605
(tires screeching)

26
00:01:08,344 --> 00:01:10,043
Lois! Lois, it's back!

27
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:12,079
I heard, Peter!
I heard!

28
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:13,480
Kids, kids, it's happening!

29
00:01:13,515 --> 00:01:15,549
Get your coats!
This is what we practiced for!

30
00:01:15,584 --> 00:01:18,085
(barking, cheering)

31
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,419
I love you, Dad!

32
00:01:19,455 --> 00:01:20,587
I love you, too, sweetheart!

33
00:01:20,623 --> 00:01:22,589
None of the past matters!

34
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:24,825
Oh, yeah, I seen
that pudding billboard.

35
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,428
It's that one that says
"CBS Outdoor Advertising" on it.

36
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:31,698
Yeah, but right above that is,
like, a big guy eating pudding.

37
00:01:31,734 --> 00:01:33,000
I don't remember none of that.

38
00:01:33,035 --> 00:01:35,268
I just remember
"CBS Outdoor Advertising"

39
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:37,971
on the bottom and three pigeons
sitting on top.

40
00:01:38,007 --> 00:01:40,173
You're bad at looking
at billboards.

41
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:41,708
Hey, we should go
check it out right now.

42
00:01:41,744 --> 00:01:44,444
Ordinarily I'd say no, but
that adult kickball league

43
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,947
is coming in for drinks,
so let's get out of here.

44
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,782
Guys, check it out.

45
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,451
I've got flip-up shades
on my flip-up shades.

46
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:53,420
Dude, you are the worst.

47
00:01:53,455 --> 00:01:56,590
Hey, we're all the worst.

48
00:02:03,232 --> 00:02:04,731
That's real
pudding in there.

49
00:02:04,767 --> 00:02:06,066
What? No, it isn't.

50
00:02:06,101 --> 00:02:09,036
They wouldn't put real pudding
on a billboard, Peter.

51
00:02:09,071 --> 00:02:11,438
Do you have any idea how
crippled you sound right now?

52
00:02:11,473 --> 00:02:12,973
Peter, it's not real pudding.

53
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,242
God, sometimes I just want
to shake some sense into you.

54
00:02:15,277 --> 00:02:17,477
Big talk for a guy
who looks like a dad

55
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:19,079
at a Dave Matthews'
concert.

56
00:02:19,114 --> 00:02:21,048
Everybody hates how
you dress, right, Joe?

57
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,450
Sorry, I stay out
of fashion debates.

58
00:02:23,485 --> 00:02:25,619
I've been burned
one too many times.

59
00:02:25,654 --> 00:02:27,988
Hey, guys,
notice anything different?

60
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,956
Yeah, Minetti's got
a hot new look.

61
00:02:29,992 --> 00:02:32,693
The whole thing,
it just works.

62
00:02:32,728 --> 00:02:34,728
(growling):
Minetti.

63
00:02:34,763 --> 00:02:36,496
Look, there's only one
way to settle this.

64
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:39,199
I am climbing that billboard
to prove it's real pudding.

65
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,171
Moisturizer?

66
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,206
Sure.
Okay.

67
00:02:48,177 --> 00:02:51,311
We getting on
into the chappy season.

68
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,882
Peter, be careful
up there!

69
00:02:55,918 --> 00:02:58,185
Is this being
careful enough, Joe?

70
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,053
Okay. All right.

71
00:03:02,324 --> 00:03:04,024
(screams)

72
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,559
Peter, are you okay?!

73
00:03:05,594 --> 00:03:08,195
All right, there's no pudding,
but there is a kid up here.

74
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,696
QUAGMIRE:
Don't hold him like that.

75
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:10,864
Oh, my God!

76
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,733
Peter, that's the lost
Nicholson kid!

77
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,501
He's been missing for a week!

78
00:03:14,536 --> 00:03:16,036
Oh, yeah.

79
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:18,605
They arrested a
custodian 'cause of you.

80
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,874
Peter, stay put.
I'll call this in,

81
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,443
and we'll get a crew
out here to help you both down.

82
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,945
(sighs) All right,
but can you hurry it up?

83
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,613
I got band practice later.

84
00:03:26,648 --> 00:03:28,081
(salsa music playing)

85
00:03:28,117 --> 00:03:29,616
PETER:
<i>I love playing the maracas.</i>

86
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:30,851
<i>They're so fun.</i>

87
00:03:30,886 --> 00:03:32,219
<i>I wonder what's in them.</i>

88
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:35,088
<i>Sand or rice probably.</i>

89
00:03:35,124 --> 00:03:36,723
<i>Maybe it's little shells.</i>

90
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:39,059
<i>Oh, no, what if it's bones?</i>

91
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,594
<i>No, no, bones are too big.</i>

92
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:42,863
<i>But baby bones aren't.</i>

93
00:03:42,898 --> 00:03:45,799
<i>No, no, no, nobody would kill</i>
<i>a bunch of babies for maracas.</i>

94
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:47,901
<i>How would you kill</i>
<i>all those babies anyway?</i>

95
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,570
<i>I'd probably put them in a tub.</i>

96
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,773
<i>You could kill, like,</i>
<i>eight at a time that way.</i>

97
00:03:52,808 --> 00:03:54,407
<i>Plus, it softens them up,</i>

98
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,576
<i>so you can get</i>
<i>the bones right out.</i>

99
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:58,612
<i>Joe just had a baby.</i>

100
00:03:58,647 --> 00:04:00,447
<i>And I got a baby at home.</i>

101
00:04:00,482 --> 00:04:02,482
<i>I got a tub.</i>

102
00:04:03,485 --> 00:04:05,252
Peter, you seem off today.

103
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:07,047
Are you thinking
about killing infants again?

104
00:04:07,055 --> 00:04:08,121
No.

105
00:04:08,157 --> 00:04:10,924
<i>Now you got to kill them, too.</i>

106
00:04:16,532 --> 00:04:17,964
Mikey, you're safe!

107
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,534
Thank you so much
for finding my boy.

108
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:22,335
Thank you for
finding<i> her</i> boy.

109
00:04:22,371 --> 00:04:24,504
I'm the stepfather.

110
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,144
Peter Griffin,
in recognition of your heroism

111
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,247
in helping to rescue
little Mikey Nicholson,

112
00:04:34,283 --> 00:04:38,752
I'd like to present you
with this key to the city.

113
00:04:38,787 --> 00:04:41,421
Now don't forget to water
the plants every other day

114
00:04:41,456 --> 00:04:43,023
and change the cat's litter.

115
00:04:43,058 --> 00:04:44,624
I'll see you in two weeks.

116
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,359
No parties.

117
00:04:47,396 --> 00:04:48,728
Thank you, Mayor West.

118
00:04:48,764 --> 00:04:51,431
You know, some of you
out there are calling me a hero.

119
00:04:51,466 --> 00:04:52,899
Others are calling me a hoagie.

120
00:04:52,935 --> 00:04:55,402
Those of you from Connecticut
are calling me a grinder.

121
00:04:55,437 --> 00:04:57,037
I guess what
I'm trying to say is

122
00:04:57,072 --> 00:05:00,040
I'm not just pieces of meat
between pieces of bread.

123
00:05:00,075 --> 00:05:03,476
I am a man
who unintentionally saves kids.

124
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,079
Wow.

125
00:05:06,114 --> 00:05:07,280
20 years on the force,

126
00:05:07,316 --> 00:05:09,015
and no one's ever clapped
for me.

127
00:05:09,051 --> 00:05:11,384
Except for that one
sarcastic gay guy.

128
00:05:12,921 --> 00:05:14,588
Great observation.

129
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:17,557
I know you mean the opposite
of what you're saying.

130
00:05:17,593 --> 00:05:20,393
Fact is, when I saved that boy,
I wasn't thinking.

131
00:05:20,429 --> 00:05:22,562
I don't think. I just do.

132
00:05:22,598 --> 00:05:25,365
I wanted to see if a billboard
had real pudding in it,

133
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,534
so I climbed up there
and came out a hero.

134
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:29,703
It's just like Gandhi
always said,

135
00:05:29,738 --> 00:05:31,972
eat as much as you want
and do whatever,

136
00:05:32,007 --> 00:05:34,074
and don't be afraid
to hit each other.

137
00:05:37,412 --> 00:05:38,879
Way to go, Dad.

138
00:05:38,914 --> 00:05:41,648
Peter, that thing you
said about not thinking

139
00:05:41,683 --> 00:05:43,683
and just doing stuff,
did you mean that?

140
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:44,851
Sure I did, Joe.

141
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:46,119
I never stop to think.

142
00:05:46,154 --> 00:05:48,255
That's why I've had ringworm
11 times.

143
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,156
I will roll in anything.

144
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:53,093
You know what, you're right.

145
00:05:53,128 --> 00:05:55,362
And it's time I do
the same thing.

146
00:05:57,165 --> 00:05:58,231
Hey, Chief. It's Swanson.

147
00:05:58,267 --> 00:05:59,733
I quit.

148
00:05:59,768 --> 00:06:01,167
Joe Swanson.

149
00:06:01,203 --> 00:06:03,270
I don't know
if Ray Swanson's quitting.

150
00:06:03,305 --> 00:06:05,038
You'd have to ask him.

151
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,207
Okay, you just called me
Ray again.

152
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:10,877
I just want to confirm that
you understand that this is Joe.

153
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:13,513
No, not "see you tomorrow."

154
00:06:13,548 --> 00:06:16,149
Joe, what are you doing?
You can't quit your job.

155
00:06:16,184 --> 00:06:18,218
Well, that's
the other thing, Bonnie.

156
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,552
You and I are done, too.

157
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:20,687
What?!

158
00:06:20,722 --> 00:06:22,455
I'm leaving you.

159
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:24,491
(whoops) New Joe!

160
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:29,029
Wow. I can't remember the
last time Joe shot his gun.

161
00:06:29,064 --> 00:06:30,597
I know. That bullet's
been rolling around

162
00:06:30,632 --> 00:06:32,732
in his junk drawer for years.

163
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,434
Hey, Ma, guess where I am?

164
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:36,069
Yeah, can you hear it?

165
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,037
Flying through the air.

166
00:06:37,072 --> 00:06:38,939
I don't know what he shot at.

167
00:06:38,974 --> 00:06:41,041
I guess I'll just have
to find out when I land.

168
00:06:41,076 --> 00:06:42,742
(chuckles)
No, don't put Terry on.

169
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:44,144
You-you can just tell him.

170
00:06:44,179 --> 00:06:46,479
H-Hey. Hi, Terry.

171
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:57,709
Oh, God.

172
00:06:57,745 --> 00:06:58,777
What?
"What?"

173
00:06:58,812 --> 00:06:59,911
You know what.

174
00:06:59,947 --> 00:07:01,246
I think it looks good.

175
00:07:01,282 --> 00:07:03,515
You are, you are just
trying anything, aren't you?

176
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,450
Just searching for
an identity, man.

177
00:07:05,486 --> 00:07:07,586
And you think this
is gonna be it, huh?

178
00:07:07,621 --> 00:07:09,454
Oh, God, whatever.

179
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,156
Peter, I'm worried
about Joe.

180
00:07:11,191 --> 00:07:13,025
You know, not only
did he quit his job,

181
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,193
he's moved out and gotten
his own apartment.

182
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:17,796
Oh, I feel terrible for
Bonnie and the kids.

183
00:07:17,831 --> 00:07:20,198
Ah, they'll be fine.
They'll bounce back.

184
00:07:20,234 --> 00:07:22,467
Just like Humpty Dumpty did
after his fall.

185
00:07:22,503 --> 00:07:24,670
My God, it's a miracle!

186
00:07:24,705 --> 00:07:27,039
You were able to put me
back together again.

187
00:07:27,074 --> 00:07:29,141
Yeah, it was actually
a pretty simple procedure.

188
00:07:29,176 --> 00:07:31,343
Maybe next time go straight
to a medical professional

189
00:07:31,378 --> 00:07:33,912
and skip the horses
and illiterate servants.

190
00:07:33,947 --> 00:07:36,715
Well, that is the last time
I drink and masturbate

191
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,884
on top of a high wall.

192
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,423
Wait, wait, Quagmire, hold up.

193
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,224
I got a great knock.

194
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,427
(knocking "Shave and a Haircut")

195
00:07:48,462 --> 00:07:50,462
(giggles)
Oh, I got to remember that.

196
00:07:50,497 --> 00:07:52,664
Oh, hey, guys.
How's it going?

197
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,999
(gently):
Hey, buddy.

198
00:07:54,034 --> 00:07:55,267
How you doing?

199
00:07:55,302 --> 00:07:56,468
You okay?

200
00:07:56,503 --> 00:07:58,070
Everything okay?

201
00:07:58,105 --> 00:08:00,839
I'm talking like this
because I'm being very careful

202
00:08:00,874 --> 00:08:02,808
not to upset you,
and for some reason

203
00:08:02,843 --> 00:08:05,143
this is the voice people use
to do that.

204
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:06,611
I'm great.
Come on in.

205
00:08:06,647 --> 00:08:08,647
Check out the new pad.

206
00:08:08,682 --> 00:08:09,848
Whoa!

207
00:08:09,883 --> 00:08:11,316
You got an air hockey table?

208
00:08:11,352 --> 00:08:13,418
Yep. Wanted it, got it.

209
00:08:13,454 --> 00:08:14,986
That's the new Joe.

210
00:08:15,022 --> 00:08:16,321
And check this out.

211
00:08:16,357 --> 00:08:17,856
It's the gun
that no-leg sprinter used

212
00:08:17,891 --> 00:08:19,825
to kill his girlfriend.

213
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,293
Oh, my God!

214
00:08:21,328 --> 00:08:24,062
Eh, anyone who's kind of fast
gets a free pass from me.

215
00:08:24,098 --> 00:08:26,164
What kind of person
would want to buy that?

216
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,332
I'll tell you who.

217
00:08:27,368 --> 00:08:28,667
The kind of guy
who's always got

218
00:08:28,702 --> 00:08:31,603
butterscotch candies
for his friends.

219
00:08:31,638 --> 00:08:34,239
Okay, now that's pretty cool.

220
00:08:34,274 --> 00:08:36,341
I got to be honest,
Joe, we came over here

221
00:08:36,377 --> 00:08:37,943
because we were
worried about you,

222
00:08:37,978 --> 00:08:39,878
but these candies tell
me you're doing great.

223
00:08:39,913 --> 00:08:41,012
I've never been better.

224
00:08:41,048 --> 00:08:42,848
I was living my life all wrong.

225
00:08:42,883 --> 00:08:43,883
But not anymore.

226
00:08:43,917 --> 00:08:45,951
No more thinking, just living.

227
00:08:45,986 --> 00:08:48,019
Well, it seems like you made
the right choice, Joe.

228
00:08:48,055 --> 00:08:49,788
I mean, I ain't seen
anyone this happy

229
00:08:49,823 --> 00:08:52,457
since the invention
of the penny-farthing bicycle.

230
00:08:52,493 --> 00:08:54,559
Eureka! Watch it go.

231
00:08:54,595 --> 00:08:56,228
Higher than you,
faster than you,

232
00:08:56,263 --> 00:08:57,362
better than you.

233
00:08:57,398 --> 00:08:59,698
Everyone just stop inventing
stuff now,

234
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:01,600
'cause no one
will ever top this.

235
00:09:01,635 --> 00:09:03,435
(laughter)
Oh, no!

236
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,903
Keep rakes away.

237
00:09:04,938 --> 00:09:07,339
I expressly said no rakes
allowed on the street

238
00:09:07,374 --> 00:09:10,375
when I am riding my
futuristic machine.

239
00:09:10,411 --> 00:09:12,711
(groans)

240
00:09:12,746 --> 00:09:14,513
Children, this is progress!

241
00:09:14,548 --> 00:09:17,949
How can you turn a blind eye
to progress?!

242
00:09:17,985 --> 00:09:19,751
(groaning)

243
00:09:19,787 --> 00:09:23,588
I expressly said "no rakes."

244
00:09:27,628 --> 00:09:28,927
'Sup, ladies?

245
00:09:28,962 --> 00:09:30,662
Oh, we're not ladies, you.

246
00:09:30,697 --> 00:09:31,857
Hey, what's with
the suitcase?

247
00:09:31,865 --> 00:09:33,365
I got a surprise.

248
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,567
What would you guys think
of a road trip?

249
00:09:35,602 --> 00:09:36,802
Yeah!
All right, I'm in!

250
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:37,837
Awesome, road trip!

251
00:09:37,871 --> 00:09:40,205
I love being super pumped
for 15 minutes

252
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,040
and then bored out of my mind
for eight hours.

253
00:09:42,042 --> 00:09:43,074
Where we going?

254
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,976
Well, I was thinking
Niagara Falls.

255
00:09:45,012 --> 00:09:46,178
Niagara Falls?

256
00:09:46,213 --> 00:09:47,312
Ain't that just for lovers?

257
00:09:47,347 --> 00:09:48,447
Nah, it's for everybody.

258
00:09:48,482 --> 00:09:49,748
It's great to just stand there

259
00:09:49,783 --> 00:09:51,917
and let Mother Nature spray it
all over your face.

260
00:09:51,952 --> 00:09:55,654
Donna's big fat aunt is in town,
so I can definitely go.

261
00:09:59,693 --> 00:10:02,260
Man, I am filling
these Gatorade bottles

262
00:10:02,296 --> 00:10:03,628
as fast as I'm drinking them.

263
00:10:03,664 --> 00:10:04,896
Ah, sweet! Cows!

264
00:10:04,932 --> 00:10:06,031
Let's tip them over.

265
00:10:06,066 --> 00:10:07,933
What? You want
to tip over some cows?

266
00:10:07,968 --> 00:10:09,601
Hell yeah!

267
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:14,306
This is gonna
be so boss.

268
00:10:14,341 --> 00:10:16,041
I can't wait.

269
00:10:16,076 --> 00:10:19,611
This is the hardest thing
I've ever done in my life.

270
00:10:19,646 --> 00:10:20,812
All right, cow.

271
00:10:20,848 --> 00:10:24,182
This is what you get
for standing.

272
00:10:24,218 --> 00:10:25,784
That...

273
00:10:25,819 --> 00:10:27,219
was awesome.

274
00:10:27,254 --> 00:10:28,720
PETER:
<i>I want to kiss that cow,</i>

275
00:10:28,755 --> 00:10:30,555
<i>but I don't want it</i>
<i>to be my idea.</i>

276
00:10:30,591 --> 00:10:33,024
Hey, Peter, you should
kiss that cow.

277
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,893
<i>All right, Peter,</i>
<i>that was fortuitous.</i>

278
00:10:34,928 --> 00:10:36,127
<i>But play it cool.</i>

279
00:10:36,163 --> 00:10:37,395
Oh, Cleveland, I couldn't.

280
00:10:37,431 --> 00:10:40,298
Okay. Quagmire,
you should kiss that cow.

281
00:10:40,334 --> 00:10:41,633
Sure, why not?

282
00:10:41,668 --> 00:10:43,235
<i>(screams)</i>

283
00:10:48,008 --> 00:10:49,908
JOE:
Okay, they're sleeping.

284
00:10:49,943 --> 00:10:52,043
We're gonna have to party
in the bathroom.

285
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,945
Be careful around
the really fat one.

286
00:10:53,981 --> 00:10:55,714
He's kind of like my boss.

287
00:10:55,749 --> 00:10:57,616
QUAGMIRE:
What? Who-who's there?

288
00:10:58,652 --> 00:11:00,252
Joe, what the hell
are you doing?

289
00:11:00,287 --> 00:11:01,920
I went to
a high school kegger party.

290
00:11:01,955 --> 00:11:03,121
Made a few new friends.

291
00:11:03,156 --> 00:11:05,457
This is Chrysalis,
Ichabod and Cancer.

292
00:11:05,492 --> 00:11:07,626
Oh, I see
three young men

293
00:11:07,661 --> 00:11:09,494
who could use the
tickle monster.

294
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,329
Uh, that's a bad read, Pete.

295
00:11:11,365 --> 00:11:12,697
Joe, it's 3:00
in the morning.

296
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:13,865
We're trying to
get some sleep.

297
00:11:13,901 --> 00:11:15,267
You guys are lame.

298
00:11:15,302 --> 00:11:17,168
We're gonna go smoke
something called "croak."

299
00:11:18,305 --> 00:11:20,138
God, what the hell
has gotten into Joe?

300
00:11:20,173 --> 00:11:21,406
I don't know, Quagmire.

301
00:11:21,441 --> 00:11:23,108
Maybe you could
ask the tickle monster!

302
00:11:23,143 --> 00:11:24,463
(laughing)
Stop it! Here he comes!

303
00:11:24,478 --> 00:11:25,944
No! Get away!
He's gonna get ya!

304
00:11:25,979 --> 00:11:27,045
Look out!

305
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,180
Great, now I'm fully up.

306
00:11:39,893 --> 00:11:42,594
Here we are, guys,
Niagara Falls.

307
00:11:42,629 --> 00:11:44,229
We showed them.

308
00:11:44,264 --> 00:11:45,964
We showed them all!

309
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:47,999
Showed who? What the
hell's he talking about?

310
00:11:48,035 --> 00:11:49,301
I don't know.

311
00:11:49,336 --> 00:11:51,369
I stopped listening to him
back at the drive-thru

312
00:11:51,405 --> 00:11:54,239
when he leaned out the window
and ordered a "fur burger."

313
00:11:54,274 --> 00:11:56,708
That's not funny;
that's just nasty.

314
00:11:56,743 --> 00:11:59,911
Plus, there's people waiting
behind you!

315
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,617
Wow. You know, when
you see it up close,

316
00:12:05,652 --> 00:12:07,218
it really is
incredible.

317
00:12:07,254 --> 00:12:09,821
Yeah. Holy crap,
it's beautiful.

318
00:12:09,856 --> 00:12:13,325
In the future, I believe
there will be water wars.

319
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,560
You know, Lois always dreamed
about coming here,

320
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:17,162
and now I know why.

321
00:12:17,197 --> 00:12:19,965
She was even
saving money for it.

322
00:12:24,504 --> 00:12:25,971
You made it, Lois.

323
00:12:26,006 --> 00:12:27,472
You made it.

324
00:12:27,507 --> 00:12:28,707
Didn't I tell you guys?

325
00:12:28,742 --> 00:12:30,809
It's the most magnificent place
in the world.

326
00:12:30,844 --> 00:12:33,511
And the greatest place
to end it all.

327
00:12:33,547 --> 00:12:34,913
Good-bye, fellas.

328
00:12:41,212 --> 00:12:43,779
Oh, my God, Joe killed himself!

329
00:12:43,814 --> 00:12:45,214
It's so weird
that he argued

330
00:12:45,249 --> 00:12:47,249
over the price
of breakfast this morning.

331
00:12:47,284 --> 00:12:49,017
(sobs)
It makes no sense!

332
00:12:49,053 --> 00:12:50,185
JOE:
Damn it!

333
00:12:50,221 --> 00:12:51,286
Joe?

334
00:12:51,322 --> 00:12:53,722
(gasps)
Joe, you're alive!

335
00:12:53,757 --> 00:12:55,157
Are you hurt?

336
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:56,792
I'm not sure.

337
00:12:56,827 --> 00:12:58,560
Well, hang in there, Joe,
we'll get some help.

338
00:12:58,596 --> 00:13:00,729
No! Just let me die!

339
00:13:00,764 --> 00:13:02,030
Oh, no, can't do that, Joe.

340
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:03,066
We're friends.

341
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:04,366
We look out for each other.

342
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:05,681
I mean, you supported me
that day

343
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:08,070
I accidentally wore
Lois's jeans.

344
00:13:09,073 --> 00:13:10,606
Peter, you know
you're wearing...

345
00:13:10,641 --> 00:13:12,708
I know. I think
there was a mix-up.

346
00:13:12,743 --> 00:13:16,311
Oh, thank you, Jazzercize.

347
00:13:18,349 --> 00:13:19,949
Don't worry, Joe.
They're coming for you.

348
00:13:19,984 --> 00:13:22,517
MAN:
Yay! My backpack.

349
00:13:24,588 --> 00:13:25,821
Hang in there, Joe.

350
00:13:25,856 --> 00:13:27,689
After they get that lady's hat,
you're next.

351
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:28,991
WOMAN:
Thank you.

352
00:13:29,026 --> 00:13:30,659
It's windy up here.

353
00:13:30,694 --> 00:13:32,694
(truck beeping)

354
00:13:37,501 --> 00:13:39,101
Joe, what the hell
is wrong with you?

355
00:13:39,136 --> 00:13:40,669
Why would you try
to kill yourself?

356
00:13:40,704 --> 00:13:42,838
Why do you think? I'm worthless.

357
00:13:42,873 --> 00:13:45,307
But y-you've been so happy
these last few days.

358
00:13:45,342 --> 00:13:46,408
I've been manic.

359
00:13:46,443 --> 00:13:48,076
Do you think Andy Dick
is happy?

360
00:13:48,112 --> 00:13:49,511
I couldn't imagine, no.

361
00:13:49,546 --> 00:13:51,613
Look, when I saw Peter
become a hero,

362
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:54,349
I guess it reminded me
of all the things I can't do.

363
00:13:54,385 --> 00:13:56,318
I'm a cop who can't save anyone.

364
00:13:56,353 --> 00:13:58,687
I'm a husband
in a legless marriage.

365
00:13:58,722 --> 00:14:00,289
My whole life is a joke.

366
00:14:00,324 --> 00:14:03,091
But somehow, as soon
as I decided to kill myself,

367
00:14:03,127 --> 00:14:04,626
I actually felt free.

368
00:14:04,662 --> 00:14:05,994
Almost giddy.

369
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:09,164
I can finally kiss
this worthless life good-bye.

370
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,532
Let me get
this straight.

371
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:12,501
The whole point of bringing
us to Niagara Falls

372
00:14:12,536 --> 00:14:13,902
was just to
kill yourself?

373
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,971
I'm sorry I tricked
you guys into coming.

374
00:14:16,006 --> 00:14:18,907
I just wanted to spend
my last week with my best pals.

375
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:21,109
Well, not for nothing, but
you could've taken us all

376
00:14:21,145 --> 00:14:23,178
to Disney World and shot
yourself in the room.

377
00:14:23,213 --> 00:14:25,213
Come on, Joe, there's plenty
of reasons to live.

378
00:14:25,249 --> 00:14:26,948
Like, like, you're handsome.

379
00:14:26,984 --> 00:14:28,850
You have a handsome face.

380
00:14:28,886 --> 00:14:30,319
Well, he's got
a good chin.

381
00:14:30,354 --> 00:14:31,687
I don't know
about handsome.

382
00:14:31,722 --> 00:14:33,155
Yeah, he's not handsome,
but I will say this,

383
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,589
he keeps a good lawn.

384
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,892
Yeah, some might say the second
best lawn in the neighborhood.

385
00:14:36,927 --> 00:14:38,927
Hey, wait, where's Joe?

386
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,363
Joe, wait!

387
00:14:41,398 --> 00:14:43,398
(truck beeping)

388
00:14:47,271 --> 00:14:49,071
I stink at this.

389
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:54,609
Anywhere is fine.

390
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:56,778
Guys, this is
unnecessary.

391
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:58,313
Give me my chair back.

392
00:14:58,349 --> 00:15:00,449
No, we can't trust you
not to kill yourself.

393
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:01,884
Yeah, then you'd be
the tenth friend

394
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:03,785
who's killed himself
in front of me.

395
00:15:03,821 --> 00:15:04,821
Is that true?

396
00:15:04,855 --> 00:15:06,421
One, two, three,
four, five,

397
00:15:06,457 --> 00:15:07,723
six, seven...

398
00:15:07,758 --> 00:15:09,791
those two girls and...

399
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:11,226
Yeah, yeah, ten.

400
00:15:11,261 --> 00:15:12,861
Look, you guys,
what we really need to do

401
00:15:12,896 --> 00:15:14,963
is bring him back to Quahog
where we can get him some help.

402
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,164
That's a good idea.

403
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,466
We should just go home.

404
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:18,734
Yeah, I guess
you're right.

405
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:20,569
It's too bad we already
bought those tickets

406
00:15:20,604 --> 00:15:22,070
for the Whirlpool
Aero Car.

407
00:15:22,106 --> 00:15:24,473
That's $16
we're not getting back.

408
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:26,475
Yeah, what a waste of money.

409
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,443
It is only a ten-minute
ride, you know.

410
00:15:28,479 --> 00:15:30,178
Okay, we'll do
the Whirlpool Aero Car,

411
00:15:30,214 --> 00:15:31,847
and then take Joe
back to Quahog.

412
00:15:31,882 --> 00:15:34,049
What about
the White Water Walk?

413
00:15:34,084 --> 00:15:35,550
Okay, okay, Whirlpool Aero Car,

414
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:38,954
then White Water Walk,
then we bring Joe back.

415
00:15:38,989 --> 00:15:40,389
Well, you can't do
Niagara Falls

416
00:15:40,424 --> 00:15:41,824
without riding the
<i>Maid of the Mist.</i>

417
00:15:41,825 --> 00:15:43,325
Yeah, let's do everything.
Great!

418
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,228
And, guys, remember,
the pool towels go home with us.

419
00:15:46,263 --> 00:15:48,330
They got no way
of accounting for those.

420
00:16:00,177 --> 00:16:03,478
Well, this has just been
one heck of a fun day.

421
00:16:03,514 --> 00:16:04,713
Yeah. Yeah, you know,

422
00:16:04,748 --> 00:16:06,515
seeing the natural beauty
of this place

423
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,417
is actually making me
feel much better.

424
00:16:08,452 --> 00:16:11,153
Hey, you mind opening that door?

425
00:16:11,188 --> 00:16:13,588
Get a little breeze in here?

426
00:16:13,624 --> 00:16:15,357
Sure.

427
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:18,794
Peter, no!

428
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:24,599
I don't regret it.
The breeze is nice.

429
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:30,972
(screaming)

430
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:37,345
Oh, crap, I'm losing my grip!

431
00:16:37,381 --> 00:16:40,048
You buy your jeans
at Wal-Mart?

432
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,051
No, somebody who lost theirs
at the church did.

433
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:45,020
You wear
lost-and-found jeans?

434
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,355
I waited the mandatory week.

435
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:48,957
Hang on, guys!

436
00:16:54,064 --> 00:16:56,164
(screaming)

437
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,040
Don't worry, I'm coming!

438
00:17:18,722 --> 00:17:20,155
What's that thing he's on?

439
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,090
It's a chair with wheels!

440
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,593
He's an absolute dream.

441
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:45,780
Guys, keep swallowing water.

442
00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:47,816
We'll drink our way
out of this.

443
00:18:06,803 --> 00:18:09,938
Guys, grab on to my legs!

444
00:18:09,973 --> 00:18:11,473
(grunting)

445
00:18:12,476 --> 00:18:13,742
Got it!

446
00:18:13,777 --> 00:18:15,810
Ew. You know, this is actually
the first time

447
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:17,379
I've ever touched Joe.

448
00:18:17,414 --> 00:18:19,314
Don't worry, I gotcha.

449
00:18:27,591 --> 00:18:29,057
Oh, thank God, Joe.

450
00:18:29,092 --> 00:18:30,392
I thought I was dead!

451
00:18:30,427 --> 00:18:32,427
I even pictured
my own funeral.

Yeah, definitely.

All right, okay,
don't anyone sing anything else

488
00:19:54,478 --> 00:19:56,311

We got to record this.

Wait, wait, we got to remember
the other one.

494
00:20:05,656 --> 00:20:07,022
What was it, Joe?

495
00:20:07,057 --> 00:20:09,791
(sighs) It's gone.

496
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:16,598
Well, that was kind of a weird
trip, but I'm glad we went.

497
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:18,199
Yeah, I love
Niagara Falls.

498
00:20:18,235 --> 00:20:20,802
I was the only black man
ever to go there.

499
00:20:20,837 --> 00:20:22,804
The tourists were
taking pictures of me.

500
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:24,739
One of them thought
I was a bear.

501
00:20:24,775 --> 00:20:25,940
Hey, guys.

502
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:27,676
Wow, Joe, you got your job back?

503
00:20:27,711 --> 00:20:28,743
Sure did.

504
00:20:28,779 --> 00:20:29,844
How'd you pull that off?

505
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,713
Ah, they always need more cops.

506
00:20:31,748 --> 00:20:33,314
Turns out not many people

507
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:36,518
want to probably get shot
for $24,000 a year.

508
00:20:36,553 --> 00:20:37,585
And what about Bonnie?

509
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:39,187
How you getting her back?

510
00:20:39,222 --> 00:20:40,455
Well, I got a plan for that.

511
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,357
I hired some guys
to come to the house

512
00:20:42,392 --> 00:20:45,181
on Tuesday and assault her,
and I'll come in and save her,

513
00:20:45,182 --> 00:20:48,011
and she'll be so grateful,
she'll have to take me back.

514
00:20:48,191 --> 00:20:49,390
Joe, today's Tuesday.
