00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,663
Guys, this is the best
dirty bookstore in town.

4
00:00:35,696 --> 00:00:38,569
Family-owned, great hours,
and lots of parking in the rear.

5
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:39,472
Get it?

6
00:00:41,383 --> 00:00:43,979
Wow, you usually expect
these places to be dirty.

7
00:00:44,006 --> 00:00:47,095
Nah, it's pretty clean. Carol Burnett
works part-time as a janitor.

8
00:00:51,898 --> 00:00:54,521
You know, when she tugged
her ear at the end of that show,

9
00:00:54,537 --> 00:00:56,941
she was really saying
good-night to her mom.

10
00:00:57,072 --> 00:00:59,671
I wonder what she tugged
to say good night to her dad?

11
00:01:03,368 --> 00:01:05,273
Whatcha staring at, Joe?

12
00:01:05,297 --> 00:01:09,194
These dolls all look really
surprised for some reason.

13
00:01:09,226 --> 00:01:13,851
I... wonder what they're
all so surprised about.

14
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:14,960
What?!

15
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,213
You never seen a
handicapped man before?!

16
00:01:17,255 --> 00:01:20,110
They're polyurethane
sex toys, Joe.

17
00:01:20,157 --> 00:01:22,201
They're not capable
of judgment.

18
00:01:22,255 --> 00:01:25,510
And even if they were,
who cares? They're whores.

19
00:01:25,555 --> 00:01:27,590
Wow, an old-time penny show.

20
00:01:27,627 --> 00:01:29,912
"The Naughty Flapper Girl. "

21
00:01:29,977 --> 00:01:31,853
Oh, hot! She's voting!

22
00:01:33,707 --> 00:01:35,840
Yeah, you break all the rules, huh?

23
00:01:35,886 --> 00:01:38,960
Yeah, that's right,
vote for Taft, you dirty girl.

24
00:01:39,028 --> 00:01:41,491
Hey, Quagmire, what's through that door?

25
00:01:41,525 --> 00:01:44,890
Oh, that's the exit. 'Course, in this
place, every exit's also an entrance.

26
00:01:48,465 --> 00:01:51,341
<i>Make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh</i>

27
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:54,651
<i>Don't you know all the
world loves to laugh</i>

28
00:01:54,737 --> 00:01:57,972
<i>I always try and find
the hottest chick in the place</i>

29
00:01:58,026 --> 00:02:00,933
<i>I crack her on the noggin
with a lamp or a vase</i>

30
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:03,831
<i>And then when she's unconscious
I do stuff to her face</i>

31
00:02:03,878 --> 00:02:06,851
<i>Make 'em laugh, make 'em laugh,
make 'em laugh!</i>

32
00:02:11,826 --> 00:02:14,670
Meg, I need you to baby-sit
Stewie tomorrow afternoon.

33
00:02:14,695 --> 00:02:17,303
Mom! You know I go to
the mall on Saturdays.

34
00:02:17,348 --> 00:02:18,873
I mean, I do have a life.

35
00:02:18,898 --> 00:02:20,942
Hey, what time is it?
We're gonna miss the movie!

36
00:02:20,985 --> 00:02:23,463
Yeah! Let's go, everyone.

37
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,880
Wow, Peter, that's a book, isn't it?

38
00:02:42,905 --> 00:02:44,753
That's the first time I've
seen you reading something

39
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,751
that didn't later turn out
to just be a sandwich.

40
00:02:46,765 --> 00:02:49,331
Eh, it's an erotic book.
I bought it at that sex shop.

41
00:02:49,397 --> 00:02:52,791
I got to tell you, I've read 4 chapters
of this, and it's not sexy at all.

42
00:02:52,837 --> 00:02:55,821
"Much Ado About Humping. "
Well, sounds sexy.

43
00:02:55,848 --> 00:02:57,423
Peter, would you put that away!

44
00:02:57,438 --> 00:02:59,402
I don't like you reading
smut at the table.

45
00:02:59,428 --> 00:03:01,333
Yeah, if only this were smut, Lois.

46
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:03,861
"He rubbed her shoulder sensually. "

47
00:03:03,907 --> 00:03:07,633
What the hell is that? That's not sexy.
You can't do somebody in the shoulder.

48
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:09,823
Why don't you and
that book get the room?

49
00:03:09,866 --> 00:03:11,540
D- Did you hear what I said, Brian?

50
00:03:11,568 --> 00:03:13,732
- I said, why don't you and that...
- That book get a room, yeah.

51
00:03:13,768 --> 00:03:15,083
Okay, I just wanted
to make sure you heard.

52
00:03:19,285 --> 00:03:21,483
Hey, guys, tell me if
this letter sounds all right.

53
00:03:21,508 --> 00:03:23,210
"Dear Reek Publishing,"

54
00:03:23,276 --> 00:03:26,141
"I was highly disappointed
by your erotic novel. "

55
00:03:26,198 --> 00:03:27,751
"Here's what I would've wrote:"

56
00:03:27,806 --> 00:03:31,902
"It was past midnight when the
blonde, smokin'- hot lab assistant"

57
00:03:31,947 --> 00:03:35,391
"who looked a little like Heather
Locklear, only with bigger jugs,"

58
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,260
"was grabbed and thrown
on to the lab table. "

59
00:03:38,377 --> 00:03:42,803
"He ripped off her lab coat, and she
grabbed his metallic extension. "

60
00:03:43,045 --> 00:03:45,373
"Oh, did I mention he was a robot?"

61
00:03:45,445 --> 00:03:47,221
"Cause that's kind of important. "

62
00:03:47,265 --> 00:03:49,181
"Yeah, a robot. "

63
00:03:49,238 --> 00:03:50,353
"Awesome. "

64
00:03:50,425 --> 00:03:53,130
Whoa! That is hot!
I got to get a copy of that.

65
00:03:53,168 --> 00:03:55,500
Yeah, you got some serious
talent there, Peter.

66
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:56,210
Really?

67
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:58,423
I'm no school administrator,

68
00:03:58,456 --> 00:04:02,172
but there's an extension program
going on in my trousers.

69
00:04:05,018 --> 00:04:08,052
"And then Captain
Leroy Hot Dog' Zanzibar"

70
00:04:08,077 --> 00:04:12,190
"and Gina from my work got in the
backseat of his really cool spaceship. "

71
00:04:12,226 --> 00:04:16,120
"Gina was finally wearing that
tank top I got her and nothing else. "

72
00:04:16,175 --> 00:04:20,670
"Zanzibar knew he couldn't control
his space horniness any longer,"

73
00:04:20,717 --> 00:04:22,541
"and then they totally did it. "

74
00:04:22,658 --> 00:04:25,112
"And if I'd have been there,
I would've been, like,"

75
00:04:25,145 --> 00:04:26,513
"Ah, sweet. "

76
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:27,781
Eh? What do you think?

77
00:04:27,808 --> 00:04:30,100
You certainly do paint a picture, Peter.

78
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:32,700
I felt like I was right
there on planet Niptune.

79
00:04:32,736 --> 00:04:35,783
You're not the only one. Everyone
down at the bar wanted a copy.

80
00:04:35,815 --> 00:04:38,383
Wow! Maybe you should
think about publishing it.

81
00:04:38,435 --> 00:04:41,641
Hey, if you ask daddy, he might even
give you some money to do it yourself.

82
00:04:41,696 --> 00:04:44,471
That's a great idea, Lois!
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

83
00:04:44,496 --> 00:04:46,580
If this works out, I could
make more money

84
00:04:46,608 --> 00:04:48,600
than when I had that
rat farm in the basement.

85
00:04:48,765 --> 00:04:50,620
Armando, do you have the rent?

86
00:04:50,646 --> 00:04:53,602
We are trying, Senor
Griffin, but the land,

87
00:04:53,646 --> 00:04:56,931
she gives us nothing.
There is no sunlight.

88
00:04:56,976 --> 00:04:58,842
It's been two months, Armando.

89
00:04:58,868 --> 00:05:01,063
You're putting me in a
real awkward position here.

90
00:05:01,088 --> 00:05:03,601
Oh, please, Senor Griffin,
just one more week.

91
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,060
I will pay you double.

92
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:07,553
Perhaps we can work out
another arrangement.

93
00:05:07,677 --> 00:05:11,161
Oh, please, senor, not my beloved!

94
00:05:11,207 --> 00:05:13,213
Armando, Armando...

95
00:05:13,275 --> 00:05:15,452
it is for the children.

96
00:05:18,137 --> 00:05:19,511
<i>Dios mio.</i>

97
00:05:23,737 --> 00:05:24,911
He takes the beam.

98
00:05:24,956 --> 00:05:26,402
The spectators hold their breath

99
00:05:26,435 --> 00:05:27,701
as Stewie Griffin

100
00:05:27,855 --> 00:05:29,661
is America's last hope...

101
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:31,392
to take home the gold.

102
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,090
Oh, oh, did you see that, Mitch?

103
00:05:34,116 --> 00:05:37,122
I sure did, Cathy that was impressive.
Here comes the dismount.

104
00:05:37,175 --> 00:05:39,312
Hey, Stewie, I just took a nap.

105
00:05:39,337 --> 00:05:40,902
You want an eye booger?

106
00:05:41,506 --> 00:05:43,591
Oh, damn you, Chris!
Look what you've done!

107
00:05:43,616 --> 00:05:46,701
I'm training for the Olympics,
and I need absolute concentration!

108
00:05:47,876 --> 00:05:48,911
Look at him.

109
00:05:48,936 --> 00:05:50,402
Look how fat he is.

110
00:05:56,408 --> 00:05:58,573
Oh, my God, that was
even cooler than playing

111
00:05:58,585 --> 00:06:00,542
with the speech function
on my Macintosh.

112
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,531
So, computer, what are you
thinking about right now?

113
00:06:04,566 --> 00:06:06,640
<i>Stewie is cool.</i>

114
00:06:13,968 --> 00:06:16,521
- What do you want, homo?
- Listen, uh, Mr. Pewterschmidt,

115
00:06:16,548 --> 00:06:18,823
you're a businessman,
I'm a businessman,

116
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:22,230
and I've got a proposal that
I guarantee you can't refuse.

117
00:06:22,278 --> 00:06:24,571
See, I wrote this erotica
book, and I was hoping

118
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:27,002
you could loan me
$7 billion to publish it.

119
00:06:27,025 --> 00:06:28,653
How about I loan you five dollars?

120
00:06:28,678 --> 00:06:31,651
It's at the bottom of this jar
of barbed wire and salt.

121
00:06:34,735 --> 00:06:37,491
Why do you keep these things together?

122
00:06:39,216 --> 00:06:41,851
All right, who wants to
buy some Peterotica?

123
00:06:41,876 --> 00:06:43,350
- Ten bucks a pop.
- I'll take one.

124
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,093
- Me, too!
- Hey, give me one of those.

125
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,722
I look forward to having a raging semi!

126
00:06:47,776 --> 00:06:51,033
Wow, Peter, you're going
into the publishing business?

127
00:06:51,065 --> 00:06:54,173
Yep. Mr. Pewterschmidt gave me
five dollars for these Xeroxes,

128
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,051
and I haven't looked back.

129
00:07:14,048 --> 00:07:16,651
I'm such a huge fan of Peterotica.

130
00:07:16,678 --> 00:07:18,311
There you go.
Thanks for reading.

131
00:07:18,335 --> 00:07:21,470
Hi. Would you be offended
if I told you your prose

132
00:07:21,497 --> 00:07:24,260
suggests a male-working class
version of Emily Bronte?

133
00:07:24,288 --> 00:07:24,930
No.

134
00:07:24,948 --> 00:07:27,982
Would you be offended if I said I'd
like to use your ass as a bongo drum?

135
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:28,783
Yes.

136
00:07:28,797 --> 00:07:32,343
Well, then we are on
two different wavelengths.

137
00:07:33,265 --> 00:07:36,041
Peter Griffin. Thanks for reading.

138
00:07:43,436 --> 00:07:45,960
<i>Welcome to Peterotica on tape.</i>

139
00:07:46,097 --> 00:07:49,490
<i>I'm Betty White reading
"The Hot Chick Who Was Italian,"</i>

140
00:07:49,515 --> 00:07:52,272
<i>"or Maybe Some Kind of Spanish,"
by Peter Griffin.</i>

141
00:07:52,686 --> 00:07:53,953
<i>Chapter One.</i>

142
00:07:54,305 --> 00:07:57,433

seen this one hot chick. "</i>

<i>"Or maybe some kind of Spanish. "</i>

145
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:04,094
Oh, yeah!
Getting hot in here.

146
00:08:04,137 --> 00:08:06,033
I'd better take my shirt off.

147
00:08:12,427 --> 00:08:15,391
Wow! You know, from the other
side, that's kind of annoying.

148
00:08:18,325 --> 00:08:20,203
Happy birthday, darling.

149
00:08:20,576 --> 00:08:24,260
Oh, honey, a fur coat!
Thank you.

150
00:08:24,308 --> 00:08:27,392
Well, it's not real fur. It's actually
made from bald eagle,

151
00:08:27,436 --> 00:08:31,393
and it's weather-treated with a mixture
of whale skin oil and children's tears.

152
00:08:32,848 --> 00:08:33,633
Yes?

153
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:36,310
Mr. Pewterschmidt, I'm Scott
Greenberg, attorney at law.

154
00:08:36,336 --> 00:08:38,963
My client was injured
listening to this audio book.

155
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:41,502
We're suing you for
every penny you've got.

156
00:08:41,536 --> 00:08:42,710
What? Why?

157
00:08:42,748 --> 00:08:45,780
You're liable as publisher.
I'm here to cease your assets.

158
00:08:49,026 --> 00:08:50,430
Griffin!

159
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:54,100
Well, Mr. Greenberg i'd like to see
you try to cease my assets after

160
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,740
battling the Rancor.

161
00:09:19,596 --> 00:09:22,222
Didn't realize Greenberg
was a Jedi name.

162
00:09:27,886 --> 00:09:29,982
- Hey, Mr. Pewterschmidt.
- Hello, Peter.

163
00:09:30,008 --> 00:09:31,760
- What's up?
- Good... Oh, damn it.

164
00:09:31,776 --> 00:09:33,543
- I mean, not much.
- What you got there?

165
00:09:33,557 --> 00:09:35,323
- This? It's a gun.
- Oh yeah?

166
00:09:35,338 --> 00:09:38,102
- Yeah, i'm going to kill you.
- Daddy, what are you doing?

167
00:09:38,115 --> 00:09:40,272
Your fat bastard husband ruined me!

168
00:09:40,287 --> 00:09:41,751
I lost my home, my money,

169
00:09:41,778 --> 00:09:43,992
and, perhaps just as serious,
my wife left me!

170
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:47,170
- Mom left you?
- Yeah. She ran off with Ted Turner.

171
00:09:47,198 --> 00:09:48,662
God only knows what they're doing.

172
00:09:48,687 --> 00:09:50,521
Should we give Elmo a bath?

173
00:09:50,538 --> 00:09:52,601
- Yeah!
- Should we give Telly a bath?

174
00:09:52,645 --> 00:09:54,960
- Yeah!
- Should we give Ernie a bath?

175
00:09:54,998 --> 00:09:57,700
No! Ernie doesn't like the monster!

176
00:09:57,777 --> 00:10:00,400
Look, you can stay with us
if you want, you filthy hobo.

177
00:10:00,426 --> 00:10:03,370
You shouldn't be embarrased about
mooching off your kids at age 70.

178
00:10:03,396 --> 00:10:04,761
Go to hell, fat head!

179
00:10:04,797 --> 00:10:06,503
Have I use that one?
No, I haven't.

180
00:10:06,525 --> 00:10:07,383
Yeah, fat head.

181
00:10:07,405 --> 00:10:09,330
Daddy, don't talk to Peter like that.

182
00:10:09,356 --> 00:10:11,372
All you've done his hole
life is treat him like crap.

183
00:10:11,395 --> 00:10:14,492
Now he's offering to help you.
The least you can do is be grateful.

184
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:15,631
Mmm... all right.

185
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:17,360
That is settled. You stay with us.

186
00:10:17,385 --> 00:10:18,692
I promise, you'll love it here.

187
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:21,103
Even more than Julia
Roberts loves herself.

188
00:10:21,298 --> 00:10:23,451
Hi, i'm Julia Roberts.

189
00:10:23,628 --> 00:10:26,093
You know, a lot of people
died in the tsunami.

190
00:10:26,187 --> 00:10:27,472
But don't worry.

191
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:28,673
I didn't.

192
00:10:28,698 --> 00:10:31,562
And i'll be here to
entertain you and love

193
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:34,642
my life for many, many years to come.

194
00:10:35,097 --> 00:10:38,702
Me...
Me...

195
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:41,453
Meeeee...!

196
00:10:48,455 --> 00:10:50,681
- Daddy you're not dressed.
- Huh?

197
00:10:50,706 --> 00:10:53,343
Oh, yeah. Couldn't figure that one out.
You've still a guy for that.

198
00:10:53,367 --> 00:10:56,423
Mom, I can't believe you
came out of that belly.

199
00:11:00,987 --> 00:11:02,261
What is that?

200
00:11:02,297 --> 00:11:04,573
Daddy, did you, um...

201
00:11:04,647 --> 00:11:07,033
use the bathroom
this morning?

202
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:09,160
- Yeah.
- And did you remember to...

203
00:11:09,196 --> 00:11:11,032
clean up after wets.

204
00:11:11,075 --> 00:11:13,012
Um, no. I was hoping you'd...

205
00:11:13,035 --> 00:11:15,512
Oh, daddy! No, no!

206
00:11:15,527 --> 00:11:16,463
OK. Brian?

207
00:11:16,466 --> 00:11:18,562
Oh, God, no. No, no, no, no.

208
00:11:18,585 --> 00:11:19,372
I'll do it.

209
00:11:19,408 --> 00:11:22,341
Daddy, I never thought you'd
be so lost without your money.

210
00:11:23,135 --> 00:11:26,880
You right, Lois. Who the hell am
I kidding? I can't live like this.

211
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,763
I should never have come here.

212
00:11:28,816 --> 00:11:31,422
Oh, I hate to see daddy like this.

213
00:11:31,466 --> 00:11:33,750
Maybe there's something you
can do to help cheer him up.

214
00:11:33,808 --> 00:11:35,930
Don't worry, Lois,
I know just what to do.

215
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:39,313
I am going to teach your father
how to be a regular guy.

216
00:11:39,345 --> 00:11:40,791
You think you can do that?

217
00:11:40,817 --> 00:11:43,210
Sure, I've steered our family
through bigger problems.

218
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:46,023
Like when we were cartoon
sketches on the Tracy Ullman Show.

219
00:11:46,218 --> 00:11:48,702
Well, that's the end of Puss.

220
00:11:48,738 --> 00:11:51,241
He was the best cat anyone ever had.

221
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:54,450
Hey, Lois, what do you say we
go downtown and buy a dog?

222
00:11:54,488 --> 00:11:56,443
Hey, wait a minute.
You already have a dog.

223
00:11:56,476 --> 00:11:58,673
- So long, Puss.
- We'll miss you.

224
00:11:58,698 --> 00:12:01,891
It's gonna be quite a different
place with him gone, that's for true.

225
00:12:05,507 --> 00:12:07,733
All right, Cathy, it looks
like Stewie Griffin

226
00:12:07,766 --> 00:12:09,731
is preparing to begin the floor routine.

227
00:12:09,786 --> 00:12:12,290
That's right, Mitch, and as we
watch Griffin doing this,

228
00:12:12,336 --> 00:12:15,672
I want to remind everyone
that this is absolutely not gay.

229
00:12:31,097 --> 00:12:32,730
Boy, that was really gay.

230
00:12:32,756 --> 00:12:36,181
No, no. Didn't you just hear the
announcers? They said it's not gay.

231
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:37,983
Ha, ha. Stewie one, you zero.

232
00:12:38,697 --> 00:12:39,950
What are we doing here?

233
00:12:39,977 --> 00:12:42,243
Listen, I know you're upset
about losing your money,

234
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:45,461
so I wanted to show you it's not
so bad living like a regular guy.

235
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:55,220
- So, these people live here?
- No, this is a bus.

236
00:12:55,256 --> 00:12:57,802
People ride it to get
places that they need to go.

237
00:12:58,568 --> 00:12:59,920
You look familiar.

238
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,161
I was your gardener for 12 years.

239
00:13:02,718 --> 00:13:04,731
You look different without
my lawn under you.

240
00:13:04,756 --> 00:13:06,841
I don't take the lawn
with me when I go.

241
00:13:06,867 --> 00:13:08,772
Well, I was right to
trust you with it, then.

242
00:13:10,295 --> 00:13:12,860
Now, this is called waiting
in line at the movies.

243
00:13:12,896 --> 00:13:14,412
It's what us regular people do.

244
00:13:14,446 --> 00:13:16,550
Trust me, it makes it
that much more special

245
00:13:16,576 --> 00:13:18,952
when we finally get inside
and see Renee Zellweger

246
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,912
doing her whole scrunch-face routine.

247
00:13:25,676 --> 00:13:28,912
Oh, no, these ants are
ruining our picnic.

248
00:13:28,956 --> 00:13:32,181
You meant this picnic
is ruining our ants.

249
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,830
<i>So don't try to deny it, pretty baby</i>

250
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:39,090
<i>You've been down so long
you can hardly see...</i>

251
00:13:40,618 --> 00:13:43,533
You know, Peter, what you
showed me today was just awful.

252
00:13:43,558 --> 00:13:44,701
What are you talking about?

253
00:13:44,716 --> 00:13:47,501
I really don't see what's so great
about being a regular person.

254
00:13:47,538 --> 00:13:50,031
The bus smells like crap,
the movie theater is sticky,

255
00:13:50,047 --> 00:13:52,573
and Renee Zellweger should only
be the cute friend at best.

256
00:13:52,617 --> 00:13:54,950
You know, I never thought
about it till now, but...

257
00:13:55,118 --> 00:13:57,620
maybe being a regular
person does suck.

258
00:13:57,766 --> 00:14:00,730
My God, is this what my
whole life is destined to be?

259
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:02,402
Not unless you do something about it.

260
00:14:02,446 --> 00:14:03,463
Yeah, but what?

261
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:04,413
Carter,

262
00:14:04,447 --> 00:14:06,793
hand me my thinking grenades.

263
00:14:06,977 --> 00:14:08,902
- Where'd you get these?
- Shh. Carter,

264
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:10,041
I'm thinking.

265
00:14:15,808 --> 00:14:17,511
<i>Oh, my God, he's dead!</i>

266
00:14:17,577 --> 00:14:19,203
That might work.

267
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:21,990
<i>What's happening?!</i>

268
00:14:22,018 --> 00:14:23,140
I got it.

269
00:14:23,168 --> 00:14:27,151
Carter, somehow you and me
are going to find a way to get rich.

270
00:14:27,177 --> 00:14:28,693
Now you're talking my language.

271
00:14:28,726 --> 00:14:30,431
All right, then, let's do it.

272
00:14:32,817 --> 00:14:34,223
Hi. I'm Betty White.

273
00:14:34,235 --> 00:14:37,213
I just got a subpoena
regarding an erotic novel,

274
00:14:37,237 --> 00:14:39,712
and I'm looking for the
son of a bitch responsible.

275
00:14:43,176 --> 00:14:45,542
All right, Peter, how are we going to
do this? How are we going to get rich?

276
00:14:45,555 --> 00:14:48,363
Well, I say we start out
small, Carter. Here's my plan.

277
00:14:48,395 --> 00:14:51,403
I'll distract Lois while you
steal money from her purse.

278
00:14:52,217 --> 00:14:54,053
Lois, look at me!
Look at me! Look at me!

279
00:15:03,767 --> 00:15:05,990
Ka-kaw! I've got her wallet.
Ka-kaw!

280
00:15:06,025 --> 00:15:08,692
- Daddy, what are you doing?
- Look at the unicycle!

281
00:15:09,298 --> 00:15:11,493
Well, she's got ten dollars in here.

282
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:15,070
And it cost me $900 for the
six weeks of unicycle lessons.

283
00:15:15,106 --> 00:15:16,951
So, we're a little in the red right now.

284
00:15:16,997 --> 00:15:19,783
But you've got to spend money to
make money, champ. Moving on.

285
00:15:22,815 --> 00:15:24,673
All right, now we play it cool.

286
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:29,581
Hey, Meg, uh, we're trying
to make some money and, um...

287
00:15:29,948 --> 00:15:32,833
would you like to buy some pot
from your granddaddy and me?

288
00:15:32,877 --> 00:15:33,961
Um...

289
00:15:34,085 --> 00:15:36,681
- Wow, sure.
- Oh, fantastic.

290
00:15:37,548 --> 00:15:40,591
- What the hell was that for?
- Now we have to pot and the money.

291
00:15:42,585 --> 00:15:44,280
You sure this is going to work, Peter?

292
00:15:44,305 --> 00:15:46,610
All I know is, there's a
lot of money to be made

293
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:49,240
in these stupid teen dramas
they keep putting on TV.

294
00:15:49,267 --> 00:15:50,941
And we're going to get our share.

295
00:15:57,608 --> 00:15:59,172
<i>I don't want to wait</i>

296
00:15:59,466 --> 00:16:02,751
<i>for my lunch to get colder</i>

297
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:06,613
<i>Why can't I eat it now?</i>

298
00:16:07,395 --> 00:16:09,003
<i>I don't want to wait</i>

299
00:16:09,495 --> 00:16:12,771
<i>for da-da-da new Toyota</i>

300
00:16:12,845 --> 00:16:16,471
<i>I want the car that's got a lot of gas</i>

301
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:19,530
Come on, Joey, I want to be with you.

302
00:16:19,557 --> 00:16:22,253
Dawson, I'm just not ready
to give up my virginity.

303
00:16:22,307 --> 00:16:23,433
Come on.

304
00:16:23,467 --> 00:16:24,121
No.

305
00:16:24,135 --> 00:16:26,871
I promised myself that I'd save
it for the man that I marry.

306
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:28,403
Come on, that's stupid.

307
00:16:28,468 --> 00:16:30,431
I'm, I'm just not
comfortable, you know?

308
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,790
I don't...
This is like the '90s, man.

309
00:16:32,816 --> 00:16:34,660
I mean, it's like, everybody's...

310
00:16:34,805 --> 00:16:38,452
Come on, you saw me on that boat.
I was wearing a blazer.

311
00:16:38,475 --> 00:16:40,423
- Uh? Come on.
- No! I just... I...

312
00:16:40,455 --> 00:16:42,500
I don't want to, all right?
I don't want to right now.

313
00:16:42,517 --> 00:16:45,311
I told you, I'm not comfortable.
I think you could respect that,

314
00:16:45,358 --> 00:16:46,102
you know.

315
00:16:46,115 --> 00:16:48,321
I do res...
I totally respect you.

316
00:16:48,495 --> 00:16:50,292
Makes me want you more, you know.

317
00:16:50,386 --> 00:16:51,950
Come on, man, let's just...

318
00:16:52,026 --> 00:16:53,351
Let's just go nuts.

319
00:16:53,378 --> 00:16:55,563
- No. I said I don't...
- Come on!

320
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:57,753
No! No! Peter, stop!

321
00:16:57,775 --> 00:16:59,543
Just stop, all right?
Turn off the camera.

322
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:02,600
- God, I'm sorry, Mr. Pewterschmidt.
- I don't want to do this anymore,

323
00:17:02,618 --> 00:17:04,372
all right? You know
what? You went too far.

324
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,641
- What?
- You went too far.

325
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:07,583
This is character.
That's how... I mean...

326
00:17:07,605 --> 00:17:09,123
- He's that kind of...
- No, forget it, forget it.

327
00:17:09,135 --> 00:17:10,840
You know what? It's just
weird, man. It's just weird.

328
00:17:10,867 --> 00:17:11,572
You're weird.

329
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,012
All right, just get off it.

330
00:17:13,327 --> 00:17:14,833
Let's just do something
else to make money.

331
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,302
And we will be back.

332
00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:24,681
Stand back, Brian.
I'm preparing for my vault.

333
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,181
You can't vault inside the living
room. You're going to get hurt.

334
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,572
Yeah, I'll get hurt right
on to a Wheaties box.

335
00:17:29,585 --> 00:17:30,753
I don't see that happening.

336
00:17:30,777 --> 00:17:32,972
Yeah, who cares what
you say. You're a dog.

337
00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:34,452
You can't see colors.

338
00:17:34,525 --> 00:17:37,253
Which means you can't see
the colors of the American flag.

339
00:17:37,297 --> 00:17:38,200
Commie.

340
00:17:43,716 --> 00:17:45,362
I think I'm okay.

341
00:17:53,687 --> 00:17:54,740
Oh, God!

342
00:17:54,795 --> 00:17:56,023
Somebody!

343
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:59,353
Do I take it out or do I leave it in?

344
00:18:01,757 --> 00:18:03,873
- Got it. We'll rob a train.
- Love it.

345
00:18:10,608 --> 00:18:11,900
All aboard.

346
00:18:15,008 --> 00:18:16,761
All right, everybody, this is a...

347
00:18:16,788 --> 00:18:18,340
Hey, where the hell is everybody?

348
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:22,180
Oh, we haven't had a paying customer in
months. Nobody rides the train anymore.

349
00:18:22,605 --> 00:18:24,461
Oh, well, for God's sake.

350
00:18:26,128 --> 00:18:27,510
Are you robbers?

351
00:18:27,568 --> 00:18:28,363
Yeah.

352
00:18:29,177 --> 00:18:31,023
Well, you could take my wallet.

353
00:18:31,046 --> 00:18:33,411
My MasterCard's in there.
Although, to be honest,

354
00:18:33,435 --> 00:18:35,983
I'll probably just cancel it
before you can use it, so...

355
00:18:39,155 --> 00:18:40,583
Give me that hole punch!

356
00:18:42,576 --> 00:18:45,163
Is this your hole punch
or the train company's?

357
00:18:45,198 --> 00:18:46,231
Well, that's, you know,

358
00:18:46,265 --> 00:18:49,140
I got to pay for that.
That comes out of my paycheck...

359
00:18:49,186 --> 00:18:50,283
if you take it.

360
00:18:50,728 --> 00:18:51,623
Oh, really?

361
00:18:52,496 --> 00:18:54,813
Well, I can't in all good
conscience take that, then.

362
00:18:55,197 --> 00:18:56,123
Oh, good...

363
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:57,612
- Thank you... I guess.
- Yeah.

364
00:18:57,646 --> 00:19:00,271
- I'm a working man myself.
- No, it's tough out there.

365
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,820
- You can't, you know...
- It's tough, it is.

366
00:19:04,295 --> 00:19:07,210
All right, well, uh, can you stop
this thing, so we can get off?

367
00:19:07,256 --> 00:19:09,890
Uh, no.
I mean, I'd love to,

368
00:19:09,926 --> 00:19:12,560
but it stops at the
pre-designated stops.

369
00:19:12,597 --> 00:19:14,893
I don't have control over that.

370
00:19:14,985 --> 00:19:16,851
- The engineer does that.
- Well, uh...

371
00:19:17,878 --> 00:19:19,710
Well, how much are tickets?

372
00:19:19,738 --> 00:19:22,641
Well, for this, this is
a first-class cabin,

373
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:23,880
it's 25 bucks.

374
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:26,460
And we're the robbers.

375
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:29,733
- OK, um, how much is coach?
- Uh, $12 for coach.

376
00:19:29,906 --> 00:19:31,173
Well, he's a senior.

377
00:19:31,198 --> 00:19:33,671
You know what, that's fine.
Just give me two coach tickets.

378
00:19:34,978 --> 00:19:36,241
All right, thank you.

379
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:38,622
Oh, wow, when did Mama Mia!
come to the Oakdale?

380
00:19:38,648 --> 00:19:40,610
Oh, yeah, what, uh,
just a week ago, I think.

381
00:19:40,626 --> 00:19:44,242
Oh, well, we should go.
Do you want to go see Mama Mia!?

382
00:19:44,286 --> 00:19:46,303
Peter, could I speak to
you over by the door?

383
00:19:49,495 --> 00:19:50,870
Good as new.

384
00:19:51,848 --> 00:19:53,481
Oh, come on!

385
00:19:56,056 --> 00:19:59,630
I give up. We're going to be
lower-middle class Americans forever.

386
00:19:59,688 --> 00:20:01,532
A fate worse than death.

387
00:20:01,587 --> 00:20:03,572
Seriously, we may as well just be dead.

388
00:20:03,608 --> 00:20:05,631
You know what, Peter, that's not true.

389
00:20:05,675 --> 00:20:08,230
In the time we've spent
together, I've learned something.

390
00:20:08,265 --> 00:20:11,080
When you're rich, you don't
own your possessions,

391
00:20:11,136 --> 00:20:12,992
your possessions own you.

392
00:20:13,026 --> 00:20:16,173
- Oh, Carter, darling.
- Babs, sweetheart!

393
00:20:16,197 --> 00:20:18,040
Honey, we're rich again.

394
00:20:18,068 --> 00:20:20,460
I divorced Ted Turner
and took half his money.

395
00:20:20,506 --> 00:20:23,152
- We own half of CNN.
- He-hey!

396
00:20:23,206 --> 00:20:25,201
- And TNT.
- Neat.

397
00:20:25,248 --> 00:20:27,411
All right, buddy, we did it, we're rich.

398
00:20:27,447 --> 00:20:29,810
We? Go to hell, you fat peasant!

399
00:20:29,846 --> 00:20:32,701
- Aw, crap.
- Peter, listen to me.

400
00:20:32,785 --> 00:20:34,463
Money doesn't matter.

401
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:39,251
Ten years ago Daddy offered to give
us $10 million, and I turned it down.

402
00:20:39,277 --> 00:20:41,811
- What?!
- Yes. And I'll always turn it down,

403
00:20:41,836 --> 00:20:44,670
because money just
complicates everything.

404
00:20:44,727 --> 00:20:47,780
We don't need money
because we have each other.

405
00:20:47,845 --> 00:20:52,813
Happiness isn't about buying expensive
things, it's about being together.

406
00:20:52,897 --> 00:20:55,863
It's not about taking expensive trips,

407
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:59,053
it's about holding each other
during a thunderstorm.

408
00:20:59,086 --> 00:21:01,900
And we have that kind
of happiness, Peter.

409
00:21:01,986 --> 00:21:05,223
Real happiness, because
we have each other.

410
00:21:05,608 --> 00:21:06,650
Yeah.
