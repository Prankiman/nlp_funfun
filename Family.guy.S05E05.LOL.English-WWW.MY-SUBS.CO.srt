00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:28,756
- Ow, damn it!
- Peter, are you all right?

2
00:00:28,757 --> 00:00:30,689
No, no, I think you should call somebody.

3
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,549
- Ma'am, are you all right?
- I can't...

4
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:33,566
breathe.

5
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:35,577
Oh, God, I think she punctured a lung.

6
00:00:35,578 --> 00:00:38,514
Damn it, look at my foot.
It's already starting to swell up.

7
00:00:38,515 --> 00:00:41,909
God, I'm looking forward to this week.
Freaking swelled foot all week.

8
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,920
You know, we should... You should
probably go ahead and shut that off.

00:00:50,456 --> 00:00:52,996
Oh, hey, Quagmire, how was Florida?

11
00:00:53,031 --> 00:00:53,981
Oh, it was great.

12
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:57,043
And guess what? I smuggled a whole
bunch of fireworks back in my anus.

13
00:00:57,048 --> 00:00:59,970
Uh, Quagmire,
fireworks aren't illegal here.

14
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:02,110
You could have just put them in your car
and driven them up here.

15
00:01:02,116 --> 00:01:03,661
Yeah, that's just as fun.

16
00:01:07,887 --> 00:01:09,042
All right, Meg.

17
00:01:09,047 --> 00:01:13,013
You be David Koresh
and I'll be a heavy-handed FBI agent.

18
00:01:13,028 --> 00:01:13,842
Go!

19
00:01:16,935 --> 00:01:18,121
Hey, you.

20
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:21,092
You're a crazy person.
Come out of there, you.

21
00:01:22,655 --> 00:01:23,970
Quagmire, check it out.

22
00:01:23,977 --> 00:01:26,581
I took ten M-80s and stuck 'em all
together.

23
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:29,413
I call it Peter Griffin's bunker-busting

24
00:01:29,415 --> 00:01:31,171
mega-ultra-super...

25
00:01:32,528 --> 00:01:34,003
Holy crap!

26
00:01:35,547 --> 00:01:38,173
Oh, my God!
You blew off all your fingers!

27
00:01:38,176 --> 00:01:40,401
What happened?
Oh, my God!

28
00:01:40,406 --> 00:01:43,510
You know, no huge hurry, but
I'm sort of out of juice over here.

29
00:01:44,206 --> 00:01:45,472
Bone-dry.

30
00:01:46,275 --> 00:01:48,203
There's one of Dad's fingers.

31
00:01:48,216 --> 00:01:50,412
We have to hurry! I learned in Biology

32
00:01:50,418 --> 00:01:52,583
if you get them back soon enough,
they can be reattached.

33
00:01:52,587 --> 00:01:54,453
What's all the commotion?

34
00:01:55,838 --> 00:01:57,261
Hey, there's one of 'em.

35
00:02:00,727 --> 00:02:02,200
Peter, look out!

36
00:02:05,176 --> 00:02:06,592
Go on, Jesse.

37
00:02:06,596 --> 00:02:08,850
Make your peeps and poops.

38
00:02:09,936 --> 00:02:12,412
That's gonna feel good for Jesse.

39
00:02:39,906 --> 00:02:40,881
Damn it.

40
00:02:42,347 --> 00:02:44,521
Maybe if we make it mad,
it'll come down here

41
00:02:44,528 --> 00:02:46,103
and we can catch it and get the finger.

42
00:02:46,106 --> 00:02:47,062
Hey, bird.

43
00:02:47,065 --> 00:02:49,181
Your poop is white and green.

44
00:02:49,185 --> 00:02:52,040
You're the laughingstock
of the poop world.

45
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:55,673
Ah, yeah, ah, yeah,
I knew that would get you.

46
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:58,090
Ah, ah, come here.
You little son of a bitch, come here!

47
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,912
Hey, stop, stop it, stop pecking me!

48
00:03:04,095 --> 00:03:05,471
Ah, thanks, Joe.

49
00:03:05,478 --> 00:03:07,662
Let's plant a knife on him just
to be safe.

50
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:08,811
Eh... good thinking.

51
00:03:08,817 --> 00:03:10,623
Yeah, I know how these things go down.

52
00:03:16,377 --> 00:03:19,230
Uh, hey there. We were supposed
to have brunch this morning.

53
00:03:19,236 --> 00:03:21,621
Oh, yeah, sorry.
I- I had a late night.

54
00:03:21,627 --> 00:03:22,972
Late night, huh?

55
00:03:22,975 --> 00:03:25,280
- What's her name, Brian?
- What are you talking about?

56
00:03:25,285 --> 00:03:27,711
Oh, spare me the theatrics.
I see the signs.

57
00:03:27,718 --> 00:03:30,962
The excuses for why we can't hang out,
the inside-out collar.

58
00:03:30,968 --> 00:03:32,830
If I didn't recognize
what was going on here,

59
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:36,261
I'd have to be as dim as those retirees
I entertain every Thursday.

60

<i>There's a hole in the bottom of the sea</i>

62
00:03:44,988 --> 00:03:47,391
<i>There's a hole in the bottom of the sea</i>

63
00:03:47,755 --> 00:03:50,873
Whoa-ho-ho, all right.
We're getting a little faster here now.

64
00:03:50,876 --> 00:03:51,962
And you know what?

65
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:54,753
I think there's something else down there
in the bottom of the sea.

66
00:03:54,758 --> 00:03:57,083
Something that
you'll be able to relate to.

83
00:04:33,457 --> 00:04:35,980
Look, Brian, I think it's wonderful
you've found a young lady

84
00:04:35,986 --> 00:04:37,383
willing to stoop to your level.

85
00:04:37,388 --> 00:04:39,703
- When do I get to meet her?
- No, no, no way.

86
00:04:39,735 --> 00:04:42,023
Oh... I see.
I get it, she's hideous.

87
00:04:42,028 --> 00:04:43,181
She is not hideous.

88
00:04:43,185 --> 00:04:44,621
Oh, well, let me ask you something.

89
00:04:44,627 --> 00:04:45,953
Does she have an alibi?

90
00:04:45,955 --> 00:04:47,661
For what? Why would she need an alibi?

91
00:04:47,665 --> 00:04:49,911
So you're saying she does not
have an alibi?

92
00:04:49,927 --> 00:04:50,702
Well, no.

93
00:04:50,705 --> 00:04:53,252
Okay, so we've established
she ain't got no alibi.

94
00:04:53,256 --> 00:04:54,840
She ugly, she ugly!

95
00:04:54,847 --> 00:04:56,403
U- G-L-Y!

96
00:04:56,418 --> 00:04:58,370
She ain't got no alibi!
She ugly!

97
00:04:58,375 --> 00:04:59,360
Screw off.

98
00:04:59,385 --> 00:05:00,981
M, she's major ugly!

99
00:05:00,988 --> 00:05:02,613
O, she's fat and pugly!

100
00:05:02,627 --> 00:05:05,882
O, my God, no.
The cow says "moo. "

101
00:05:09,146 --> 00:05:11,670
Here's to Peter getting his fingers back.

102
00:05:11,675 --> 00:05:12,633
Thanks, Joe.

103
00:05:12,638 --> 00:05:14,492
Oh, boy, I tell you,
I haven't felt this good

104
00:05:14,495 --> 00:05:16,880
since I came up with that new place
to hide my porn.

105
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,062
Have a good day, sweetie.

106
00:05:34,537 --> 00:05:35,280
Hey, Greg.

107
00:05:35,288 --> 00:05:37,773
Afternoon, Mr. Griffin.
Mrs. Griffin out today?

108
00:05:37,776 --> 00:05:39,082
- Shoppin'.
- Ah.

109
00:06:11,578 --> 00:06:12,873
Ah, she's hot.

110
00:06:13,138 --> 00:06:15,720
All right, last call, fellas.
It's closing time.

111
00:06:15,728 --> 00:06:17,782
Aw, crap, I'm not even half-buzzed.

112
00:06:17,786 --> 00:06:19,881
Hey, what do you guys say
we take this party on the road?

113
00:06:19,885 --> 00:06:20,731
Fine by me.

114
00:06:20,736 --> 00:06:23,790
Skinemax doesn't kick in with the
really dirty stuff till about 3:00 anyway.

115
00:06:23,795 --> 00:06:27,433
They had one on last night
where the girl had a buttface

116
00:06:27,435 --> 00:06:29,711
but her breasts was immaculate.

117
00:06:33,587 --> 00:06:36,682
Peter, you sure it's okay
to beat the brewery after hours?

118
00:06:36,695 --> 00:06:38,702
Relax, Joe, this is where I work.

119
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,992
Besides, it sure beats the hell out
of last Saturday

120
00:06:40,998 --> 00:06:43,482
when we partied with that big-horned guy
from Legend.

121
00:06:43,495 --> 00:06:46,160
Hey, you guys want to go to IHOP?
Get some breakfast or something?

122
00:06:46,168 --> 00:06:49,322
Oh, God, I don't know, Big-Horned Guy.
It's like 3:00 a. m.

123
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:52,403
Oh, that sucks, man, I'm wide awake.
Hey, Quagmire, you want to...

124
00:06:53,968 --> 00:06:56,543
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, man. Are you okay?

125
00:06:56,545 --> 00:06:58,073
- No!
- I didn't see him.

126
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:02,742
Okay, okay, guys, here's one.

127
00:07:02,745 --> 00:07:05,992
If you were God,
who would you strike down first?

128
00:07:05,996 --> 00:07:08,560
Debra Messing. I find her insufferable.

129
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:09,862
French Stewart.

130
00:07:09,868 --> 00:07:13,581
What are you squinting about?
It's not even that bright.

131
00:07:13,588 --> 00:07:14,810
Yeah, he's terrible.

132
00:07:14,816 --> 00:07:17,053
What we need out there now
is another Tim Daly.

133
00:07:17,056 --> 00:07:19,462
- Who's Tim Daly?
- I don't even know who that is.

134
00:07:19,465 --> 00:07:21,153
- From Wings?
- Nope.

135
00:07:21,157 --> 00:07:22,663
Tim Daly. He was on Wings.

136
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:24,523
What, no-nobody here watched Wings?

137
00:07:24,525 --> 00:07:27,543
Is that the one where there's a guy and
he's like, uh, he's a pilot or something?

138
00:07:27,546 --> 00:07:30,021
There's two guys.
They're brothers and they're both pilots.

139
00:07:30,037 --> 00:07:32,583
And wasn't there a fat guy
with a moustache?

140
00:07:32,588 --> 00:07:34,430
That was Roy. He's hilarious.

141
00:07:34,432 --> 00:07:37,432
- Was this a cartoon?
- No, my, oh, my god, no!

142
00:07:37,446 --> 00:07:41,266
No, no, it took place in an airport.
Th-Th-The thing was on for ten years.

143
00:07:41,301 --> 00:07:43,701
And the, and the funny repair guy
was Lowell.

144
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:45,593
It made Tony Shalhoub's career.

145
00:07:45,595 --> 00:07:47,161
- Who?
- The tennis player?

146
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:50,300
God, you know what? Screw you guys.
I don't even know you.

147
00:07:50,517 --> 00:07:53,691
Crazy people.
Living under a rock, don't know Wings.

148
00:07:54,527 --> 00:07:56,061
I love Wings!

149
00:07:59,085 --> 00:08:00,962
All right, I want to be very clear
about this.

150
00:08:00,967 --> 00:08:03,663
You can meet her, chat for a minute,
and that's it. In and out.

151
00:08:03,668 --> 00:08:06,302
Oh, don't worry, Brian.
If she's as ugly as I think she is,

152
00:08:06,307 --> 00:08:08,040
I'll look at her once and then I'll go...

153
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:11,610
...all over the place.

154
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,810
Then you'll wipe it up and then we'll go.

155
00:08:13,817 --> 00:08:15,513
Hi, Brian.

156
00:08:15,548 --> 00:08:18,020
Oh, my God.
Who's your cute little friend?

157
00:08:18,026 --> 00:08:18,990
Oh, my.

158
00:08:18,996 --> 00:08:20,970
Hello. Stewie. Charmed.

159
00:08:20,976 --> 00:08:23,713
I'm Jillian. Come on in.
Who wants a drink?

160
00:08:26,197 --> 00:08:28,332
So, you gonna take back what you said?

161
00:08:28,335 --> 00:08:29,793
Brian, she's stunning.

162
00:08:29,796 --> 00:08:31,502
Okay, you met her, you can scram now.

163
00:08:31,508 --> 00:08:32,701
I shall do no such thing.

164
00:08:32,715 --> 00:08:35,672
Now, why in the world would you be
embarrassed about dating her?

165
00:08:35,676 --> 00:08:37,153
Oh, my God, Brian.

166
00:08:37,157 --> 00:08:40,660
I was watching something on TV
about this guy named Hitler.

167
00:08:40,866 --> 00:08:42,892
Somebody should stop him.

168
00:08:43,368 --> 00:08:45,702
Are her parents brother and sister?

169
00:08:45,705 --> 00:08:47,323
Can you please leave now?

170
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:50,683
Oh... now I get it. She's a moron.

171
00:08:50,685 --> 00:08:53,421
But a moron with large breasts
you can use as mountains

172
00:08:53,426 --> 00:08:56,533
for your Matchbox cars, or whatever
it is grown-ups do with large breasts.

173
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:57,913
Shut up, that's not it at all.

174
00:08:57,918 --> 00:09:00,060
Say, Jillian, I love what you've done
with the place.

175
00:09:00,068 --> 00:09:01,973
What is it? One bedroom, one bath?

176
00:09:01,987 --> 00:09:04,363
No, it's a whole apartment.

177
00:09:04,415 --> 00:09:07,451
Oh, God, outstanding.

178
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:11,751
So, Stewie. Do you work with Brian
at the detective agency?

179
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:14,151
Why, yes, as a matter of fact, I do.

180
00:09:14,156 --> 00:09:16,020
At the detective agency.

181
00:09:16,027 --> 00:09:18,221
That's got to be a tough job.

182
00:09:18,227 --> 00:09:22,072
I know Brian's work has him coming
and going at all hours of the night.

183
00:09:22,076 --> 00:09:23,980
I bet it does, I bet it does.

184
00:09:23,988 --> 00:09:25,652
Okay, well, Stewie has to go now.

185
00:09:25,656 --> 00:09:28,763
What are you talking about? I want some
more of Jillian's delicious lemonade.

186
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:30,540
I know, it's good, right?

187
00:09:30,546 --> 00:09:34,202
I just wish they didn't have to kill
so many lemons to make it.

188
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,332
Oh, this is fun, eh?

189
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:45,522
So, wait, Dupree moves in with
Kate Hudson and Matt Dillon?

190
00:09:45,528 --> 00:09:47,520
But they're newlyweds, right?

191
00:09:47,756 --> 00:09:50,732
Well, that's no time to have
a houseguest.

192
00:09:50,738 --> 00:09:51,721
Oh, gotta go.

193
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:54,681
Sorry, Angela. Every Tuesday morning,
I call my friend Cleveland

194
00:09:54,688 --> 00:09:57,472
and he describes every scene from
You, Me, and Dupree.

195
00:09:57,476 --> 00:10:00,240
Griffin, your workout put this week
is even worse than usual.

196
00:10:00,246 --> 00:10:01,943
Where the hell are those purchase orders?

197
00:10:01,947 --> 00:10:04,182
Eh, it's this bum hand.
I can't type with it.

198
00:10:04,198 --> 00:10:05,950
Well, that's not my problem.

199
00:10:05,985 --> 00:10:08,433
I need to see some improvement
by the end of the week

200
00:10:08,437 --> 00:10:09,430
or you're finished.

201
00:10:09,438 --> 00:10:11,370
Don't worry, I'll figure something out.

202
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:12,862
Oh, that's going to be Quagmire

203
00:10:12,867 --> 00:10:14,962
with Along Came Polly.
I gotta take that.

204
00:10:14,967 --> 00:10:17,123
All right, so as you know by this point
in the story,

205
00:10:17,127 --> 00:10:19,441
Ben Stiller doesn't like spicy food.

206
00:10:19,477 --> 00:10:21,900
Well, guess what's for dinner?

207
00:10:21,906 --> 00:10:24,180
No way.

208
00:10:26,195 --> 00:10:29,673
Boy, Lois, thanks so much for coming in
and helping me get my work done.

209
00:10:29,687 --> 00:10:31,910
Without you, Angela would have been
all over my case.

210
00:10:31,947 --> 00:10:33,142
Oh, it's all right, Peter.

211
00:10:33,156 --> 00:10:35,450
I know it's tough for you to work
with your hand injury.

212
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,640
Hey, you know, uh,
with you sitting there, it's, uh,

213
00:10:37,646 --> 00:10:39,343
it's kind of like you're my secretary.

214
00:10:39,718 --> 00:10:41,761
Let's not get carried away, Peter.

215
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,801
Now, please, I'm trying to finish
your work.

216
00:10:43,818 --> 00:10:46,510
You know, Lois, if I'm your boss,
I gotta look like a boss.

217
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:49,412
Finally, I have a reason to wear
this big bow tie and cigar

218
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,692
I bought at the Dress For Success store.

219
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:53,932
Peter, if you want this work
to get done...

220
00:10:53,936 --> 00:10:55,202
Lois, take a letter.

221
00:10:55,496 --> 00:10:57,392
"Dear Life Cereal,"

222
00:10:57,635 --> 00:10:59,703
"Where do you get off?"

223
00:10:59,788 --> 00:11:02,860
"Part of a balanced breakfast
and delicious?"

224
00:11:02,968 --> 00:11:05,300
"Who do you think you are?"

225
00:11:05,386 --> 00:11:08,160
"By now, you may have guessed
I'm speaking ironically"

226
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:11,331
"and have nothing but good things
to say about what you do. "

227
00:11:11,435 --> 00:11:14,810
"Life Cereal, do not change a thing. "

228
00:11:14,847 --> 00:11:17,072
"Signed, Peter Griffin.
Dictated but not read. "

229
00:11:17,075 --> 00:11:18,421
Lois, read that back to me.

230
00:11:21,427 --> 00:11:25,391
Oh, hey, Brian. Back from a hot booty
call with your idiot girlfriend?

231
00:11:25,395 --> 00:11:29,010
You know, think what you want, but you
don't see the side of Jillian that I do.

232
00:11:29,028 --> 00:11:32,413
Face it, Brian, she's dumber than a
Boston-area book report.

233
00:11:32,418 --> 00:11:36,203
The novel I chose to address
is Oliver Twist

234
00:11:36,206 --> 00:11:37,963
by Charles Dickens.

235
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:41,772
Queer name, right?
The book was actually not bad.

236
00:11:41,778 --> 00:11:43,963
For your information,
Jillian is very bright

237
00:11:43,977 --> 00:11:46,363
and she happens to be a
very talented photographer.

238
00:11:46,365 --> 00:11:47,821
Oh, that is so lame.

239
00:11:47,825 --> 00:11:51,190
Every hot girl who can aim a camera
thinks she's a photographer.

240
00:11:51,195 --> 00:11:53,890
Ooh, you took a black and white picture
of a lawn chair

241
00:11:53,896 --> 00:11:57,810
and its shadow and developed it at Sav-On.
You must be so brooding and deep.

242
00:11:57,816 --> 00:11:59,720
- Knock it off.
- No, I want to know, Brian.

243
00:11:59,728 --> 00:12:01,490
What, specifically, do you talk about?

244
00:12:01,496 --> 00:12:03,283
Uh, a lot of things.
Um...

245
00:12:03,337 --> 00:12:04,340
food,

246
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:05,263
um...

247
00:12:05,398 --> 00:12:08,030
the new seat covers
she just got for her Jetta.

248
00:12:08,086 --> 00:12:08,990
Um...

249
00:12:09,845 --> 00:12:13,553
- Real World / Road Rules Challenge.
- You hate MTV.

250
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:14,771
Pot helps.

251
00:12:14,778 --> 00:12:17,282
Look, you know, I don't have to justify
anything to you, all right?

252
00:12:17,288 --> 00:12:20,422
All that matters is Jillian and I have
a great time together.

253
00:12:20,437 --> 00:12:22,392
- We make each other laugh.
- Fine.

254
00:12:22,398 --> 00:12:25,370
But just tell me this, Brian:
does she laugh on her own

255
00:12:25,376 --> 00:12:27,913
or does she laugh only when you laugh?

256
00:12:28,588 --> 00:12:30,270
I thought so.

257
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:34,652
Hey.

258
00:12:35,108 --> 00:12:35,890
Yeah.

259
00:12:36,265 --> 00:12:37,111
Uh-huh...

260
00:12:37,645 --> 00:12:38,502
uh-huh.

261
00:12:39,245 --> 00:12:42,783
Uh, you gotta hit, uh, DVD and then menu
and then select.

262
00:12:43,466 --> 00:12:44,212
Yeah.

263
00:12:44,845 --> 00:12:47,690
Yeah, the DVD needs to be face up
when you put it in.

264
00:12:48,186 --> 00:12:49,042
Uh-huh.

265
00:12:49,637 --> 00:12:52,260
You should be able to see
the words Mr. 3000.

266
00:12:52,358 --> 00:12:53,213
Yeah...

267
00:12:53,598 --> 00:12:54,682
still nothing?

268
00:12:54,948 --> 00:12:56,250
Is it plugged in?

269
00:12:56,756 --> 00:12:58,090
Okay, so plug it in.

270
00:12:58,565 --> 00:12:59,393
Okay.

271
00:12:59,896 --> 00:13:01,052
Y- You got it?

272
00:13:01,085 --> 00:13:02,922
Is it... uh, okay. All right.

273
00:13:02,975 --> 00:13:04,721
No, no problem. All right.

274
00:13:04,937 --> 00:13:06,852
Uh, love you, too, Jilly bean.

275
00:13:07,136 --> 00:13:07,891
Okay.

276
00:13:08,698 --> 00:13:10,572
- What?
- Nothing. I didn't say anything.

277
00:13:10,596 --> 00:13:12,041
I need a drink.

278
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,911
Uh, hey, uh, Jilly bean?

279
00:13:16,006 --> 00:13:17,813
Hey, it's Brian again.

280
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,783
Uh, so, yeah, um...

281
00:13:19,808 --> 00:13:22,862
so I figured we could get together
tonight and maybe, um,

282
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:25,762
do all those things sexually
that we usually do.

283
00:13:25,766 --> 00:13:28,081
Um, what were those again?

284
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:32,283
No way, gross!
Oh, I mean, I mean, oh, oh, no.

285
00:13:32,285 --> 00:13:34,461
Yeah, I totally love how that feels.

286
00:13:40,328 --> 00:13:41,190
Hi.

287
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:45,420
You know, I've been noticing you
around the steno pool.

288
00:13:45,917 --> 00:13:48,461
You look good enough for a promotion.

289
00:13:48,465 --> 00:13:49,972
Peter, cut it out.

290
00:13:49,976 --> 00:13:52,831
Hey, that's no way to talk to your boss.

291
00:13:53,768 --> 00:13:55,353
Mmm, is that Pert?

292
00:13:55,355 --> 00:13:56,690
You know it is.

293
00:13:56,698 --> 00:13:58,681
Smell my Speed Stick?

294
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:04,290
Peter, what the hell are you doing?

295
00:14:04,296 --> 00:14:06,062
Lois, I'm gonna come right out with it.

296
00:14:06,067 --> 00:14:09,740
I think it would be so hot for you and
me to have sex in my office.

297
00:14:09,756 --> 00:14:13,262
Oh, my God.
There is no way that is gonna happen.

298
00:14:13,267 --> 00:14:15,722
You know, it's no wonder
you're so far behind in your work

299
00:14:15,727 --> 00:14:17,591
if this is how you behave at the office.

300
00:14:17,597 --> 00:14:19,543
Come on, just touch it. Touch yours.

301
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:22,970
Peter, no. I have work to do
so you can keep your job.

302
00:14:22,976 --> 00:14:26,233
Oh, look at me, I'm Lois.
I'm a worker. I make stuff on things.

303
00:14:26,237 --> 00:14:29,332
Oh, I'll file these later.
Oh, I got a phone. Nope, that's it.

304
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,623
Geez, Lois, I thought having you here
was gonna be fun,

305
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,740
but so far you're a bigger buzzkill
than Buzz Killington.

306
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:39,021
Oh, man, this is the best party
I've ever been to.

307
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,643
Evening, everyone.

308
00:14:41,735 --> 00:14:46,722
I thought it would be very droll if
we all sat down and looked at etchings.

309
00:14:46,796 --> 00:14:48,620
Would you like to join me, Peter?

310
00:14:48,646 --> 00:14:51,240
Uh, well, we-we're kinda partying here.

311
00:14:51,246 --> 00:14:53,140
Good! Hold this up.

312
00:14:53,505 --> 00:14:57,451
Now here's a fellow attempting
to ride a bicycle.

313
00:14:57,686 --> 00:14:59,863
But he's having some trouble, isn't he?

314
00:14:59,955 --> 00:15:01,830
Would you like to know why?

315
00:15:02,747 --> 00:15:03,813
Why?

316
00:15:03,816 --> 00:15:05,451
Because he's a Scot!

317
00:15:07,936 --> 00:15:12,900
Now, who here likes a good story
about a bridge?

318
00:15:17,435 --> 00:15:19,260
What the hell? Jillian, what...

319
00:15:19,298 --> 00:15:21,843
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, hi, Brian.

320
00:15:21,846 --> 00:15:24,662
It was so nice of you to invite
your girlfriend over for dinner.

321
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:27,130
- I invited her for dinner?
- Yes, you did.

322
00:15:27,146 --> 00:15:28,780
You wanted her to meet the family.

323
00:15:28,786 --> 00:15:31,782
Now, come here, Brian.
Come sit by your friend, Stewie.

324
00:15:31,846 --> 00:15:34,252
And then, think about this:

325
00:15:34,265 --> 00:15:36,951
have you ever seen the sun and the moon

326
00:15:36,988 --> 00:15:39,362
in the same place at the same time?

327
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,801
They're the same person!

328
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:44,492
- I know, right?!
- You're brilliant!

329
00:15:44,495 --> 00:15:46,462
Hey, Oogie!

330
00:15:47,006 --> 00:15:50,993
So tell us, Oogie,
where'd you find this one, huh?

331
00:15:50,995 --> 00:15:53,302
You two meet at a Mensa meeting?

332
00:15:53,436 --> 00:15:55,472
No, at a Quizno's.

333
00:15:55,508 --> 00:15:58,833
We both ordered the
Turkey Ranchand Swiss, no onions.

334
00:15:58,837 --> 00:16:00,333
Can you believe that?

335
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:03,552
No, wow.
What are the odds?

336
00:16:03,556 --> 00:16:06,731
Well, hey, what are the odds of
finding true love anywhere in the world

337
00:16:06,735 --> 00:16:08,051
says this observer.

338
00:16:08,057 --> 00:16:10,512
Hey, you wanna know something cool?

339
00:16:10,515 --> 00:16:14,420
I threw up a lot in high school,
so I don't get my period anymore.

340
00:16:14,485 --> 00:16:17,892
Wow, this is the one you've been
waiting for, huh, Brian?

341
00:16:19,258 --> 00:16:23,213
Are you serious?
Are you serious, Brian?

342
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:24,933
All right, you know what,
Lois, don't judge.

343
00:16:24,937 --> 00:16:27,212
Because you don't know what two people
are like when they're alone.

344
00:16:27,227 --> 00:16:29,860
Come on. Let's go out dancing.

345
00:16:29,868 --> 00:16:32,430
I don't know, I'm feeling kinda
cozy tonight. Kinda mellow.

346
00:16:32,435 --> 00:16:34,911
I just really want to go dancing...
Oh!

347
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:36,691
There it is again!

348
00:16:36,725 --> 00:16:38,270
What is that?

349
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:46,591
So, Jillian, what are your views
regarding homeland security?

350
00:16:46,596 --> 00:16:49,201
Do you think we should support
what the president is doing?

351
00:16:49,206 --> 00:16:52,053
Well, I just think, for starters,

352
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,271
that sometimes the government has things
they can't tell us

353
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:58,481
and, truthishly, we should just
accept that.

354
00:16:58,485 --> 00:16:59,633
Okay, goodnight, everyone.

355
00:16:59,636 --> 00:17:02,483
Oh, say, Jillian, before you go.
I forget.

356
00:17:02,496 --> 00:17:04,840
Do you know what the capital
of this state is?

357
00:17:04,876 --> 00:17:06,552
Um... Rhode Island City?

358
00:17:08,726 --> 00:17:11,251
It's like she's five!

359
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:20,161
Thanks for hanging out with my friends,
Brian.

360
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:22,490
Hey, come on.
We're-we're a legitimate couple, right?

361
00:17:22,495 --> 00:17:24,252
I- I should be able to talk
with your friends.

362
00:17:24,257 --> 00:17:26,241
So then the valet pulls up and I'm all,

363
00:17:26,247 --> 00:17:28,052
"That is so not my car. "

364
00:17:28,067 --> 00:17:30,023
But then it totally was.

365
00:17:30,137 --> 00:17:32,781
- That's happened to me!
- Me, too.

366
00:17:32,786 --> 00:17:34,351
Cars go fast.

367
00:17:35,406 --> 00:17:36,540
Oh, God.

368
00:17:36,608 --> 00:17:39,813
Yeah, I tell ya, if I had a nickel for
every time that happened.

369
00:17:40,215 --> 00:17:41,702
- Yeah...?
- What?

370
00:17:42,068 --> 00:17:45,072
What if you had a nickel
for every time that happened?

371
00:17:45,076 --> 00:17:46,850
No, nothing. It's just an expression.

372
00:17:46,856 --> 00:17:47,842
A what?

373
00:17:47,846 --> 00:17:50,551
Well, I was just saying
I do my share of dopey stuff.

374
00:17:50,556 --> 00:17:52,710
Like, oh, this... this one time

375
00:17:52,716 --> 00:17:55,731
I attended a speaker's colloquium
on federal judgeships

376
00:17:55,748 --> 00:17:57,213
and without realizing it,

377
00:17:57,215 --> 00:18:00,081
I kept calling William Rehnquist
"William Rhinequist. "

378
00:18:00,986 --> 00:18:02,990
Come on.
I mean, how... "doi. "

379
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:07,623
Anyone else have to go to
the littlegirls' room?

380
00:18:07,636 --> 00:18:08,811
I have new gloss!

381
00:18:08,818 --> 00:18:10,073
- I love gloss!
- Oh, that rocks!

382
00:18:10,086 --> 00:18:11,551
Gloss rhymes with hair!

383
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:15,293
Dude, that was painful.

384
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,273
What are you doing here?
Did you follow us?

385
00:18:17,277 --> 00:18:20,222
Brian, why can't you just admit
what's going on here?

386
00:18:20,236 --> 00:18:23,411
Okay, okay. Fine. Fine.
I'm gonna have to break it off.

387
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:27,200
But, boy, it's gonna be tougher than
the reviews for Our American Cousin.

388
00:18:27,267 --> 00:18:29,602
Blah, blah, blah, "Lincoln assassinated,"

389
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,941
blah, blah, blah,
"tragedy for our Republic. "

390
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,373
Uh... oh, look!

391
00:18:33,476 --> 00:18:36,110
"Ably performed by the entire ensemble. "

392
00:18:36,138 --> 00:18:38,033
<i>That's us! That's all of us!</i>

393
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,973
Morning, Lois, I need you to
proof read this and collate it for me.

394
00:18:43,358 --> 00:18:45,371
Peter, did you Xerox your penis?

395
00:18:45,378 --> 00:18:47,272
300 times. It's a flip book.

396
00:18:47,275 --> 00:18:48,830
Flip through it or you're fired.

397
00:18:48,886 --> 00:18:51,651
Oh, my God! This is disgusting.

398
00:18:51,657 --> 00:18:54,900
Peter, for the last time, I'm not
having sex with you in this office.

399
00:18:54,908 --> 00:18:56,991
Why the hell are you pushing
this so hard?

400
00:18:56,998 --> 00:18:59,853
Because, Lois, I already wrote the letter
to "Penthouse Forum,"

401
00:18:59,855 --> 00:19:03,162
and I don't wanna be made a liar
in the nudie magazine of record.

402
00:19:03,515 --> 00:19:04,451
All right.

403
00:19:04,468 --> 00:19:07,943
If I give you 30 seconds of making out,
will that shut you up?

404
00:19:07,948 --> 00:19:09,183
Let's see where it goes.

405
00:19:19,055 --> 00:19:21,581
Oh, God, you know this is pretty hot.

406
00:19:21,587 --> 00:19:23,413
Yeah, what'd I tell you, huh?

407
00:19:25,066 --> 00:19:27,123
Oh, God, Peter, let's do it.

408
00:19:27,128 --> 00:19:29,640
Let's do it right here, right now!

409
00:19:29,646 --> 00:19:30,981
Lois, Lois wait. Wait.

410
00:19:31,328 --> 00:19:32,903
Opie's right there.

411
00:19:33,545 --> 00:19:35,653
I want him to look, Peter.

412
00:19:43,427 --> 00:19:45,371
Well, that is the last of it.

413
00:19:45,378 --> 00:19:47,443
You are now all caught up with your work.

414
00:19:47,445 --> 00:19:50,210
Lois, I really appreciate you helping
me out this week,

415
00:19:50,218 --> 00:19:53,291
and I really appreciate
you having sex with me in my office.

416
00:19:53,295 --> 00:19:56,470
Well, that was my pleasure, too, Peter.

417
00:19:56,485 --> 00:19:58,042
Haa, I knew I'd get you.

418
00:19:58,046 --> 00:20:00,301
Just like Danny DeVito got Rhea Perlman.

419
00:20:00,307 --> 00:20:01,582
I don't know, Danny.

420
00:20:01,587 --> 00:20:03,642
Look, it's either me or nobody.

421
00:20:03,646 --> 00:20:04,402
Sold.

422
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:08,860
All right, Brian, you can do this.
You can dump her.

423
00:20:08,866 --> 00:20:09,951
Because once it's done,

424
00:20:09,957 --> 00:20:12,811
never again will you have to listen
to her talk like this?

425
00:20:12,866 --> 00:20:15,383
You know, where everything has
a question mark at the end of it?

426
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:17,003
With an upward inflection?

427
00:20:17,017 --> 00:20:18,692
At the end of every sentence?

428
00:20:18,697 --> 00:20:20,313
Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking?

429
00:20:20,317 --> 00:20:22,080
Oh, damn it. Now I'm doing it, too.

430
00:20:24,617 --> 00:20:26,690
Oh, hey, Oogie.

431
00:20:26,786 --> 00:20:28,272
Ooh, you look tense.

432
00:20:28,467 --> 00:20:30,523
Well, uh, Jillian, there's...

433
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:32,052
something we need to talk about.

434
00:20:32,075 --> 00:20:33,203
What is it?

435
00:20:33,728 --> 00:20:34,653
I, uh...

436
00:20:35,345 --> 00:20:37,640
just wanted to spend some time with you.

437
00:20:41,727 --> 00:20:44,872
What the hell? It took you three hours
to break up with her?

438
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:46,402
Uh, not exactly.

439
00:20:46,408 --> 00:20:48,062
Well, what were you doing in there?

440
00:20:48,495 --> 00:20:51,802
What's that smell? It smells like
sweat and anger and shame.

441
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:52,542
Yep.

442
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:55,503
Life's confusing when you grow up,
isn't it, Brian?

443
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:56,323
It is.

444
00:20:56,325 --> 00:20:58,522
- Can we play my mix tape?
- Yeah, go ahead.

445
00:21:01,105 --> 00:21:04,292
<i>Brian had sex with a really dumb girl</i>

446
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:06,563
<i>Now he's taking his friend Stewie</i>

447
00:21:06,587 --> 00:21:09,212
<i>To get some ice cream in his car...</i>

448
00:21:09,217 --> 00:21:10,702
Oh, you're a poor sport.
