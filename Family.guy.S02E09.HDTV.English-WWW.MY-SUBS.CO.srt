00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:05,000
"It seems today that all you see

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,300
"is violence in movies and sex on TV

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,000
"But where are those good,
old-fashioned values

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,100
"on which we used to rely?

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,900
"Lucky there's a family guy

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,600
"Lucky there's a man who'll
positively tell you

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,300
"all the things that make us

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,800
"laugh 'n' cry

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,800
"He's a family guy"

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,100
- We need to talk.
- Not now. The show's about to start.

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,800
Bryant Gumbel, Greg Gumbel...

12
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,700
...brothers, bike cops.

13
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,400
Gumbel 2 Gumbel, Beach Justice.

14
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,100
You talk to Matt Lauer lately?

15
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,200
Played 18 holes with him on Saturday.

16
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,500
Told him he was soft
in the Arafat interview.

17
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,900
- Oh, I like Matt.
- Me, too.

18
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,500
My purse!

19
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,300
Come on, Greg. Let's roll.

20
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,200
Taste that?
That's the taste of beach justice.

21
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,400
Are you crazy?

22
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,500
Yeah, me and Dad haven't missed
a Gumbel 2 Gumbel yet.

23
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,400
You're gonna miss this one, young man.

24
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,100
His report card came today.

25
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,700
No more TV until your grades improve.

26
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,000
Now get upstairs and study.

27
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,500
Don't worry. I'll talk to her.

28
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,700
After I get a little bit of courage
from my old friend, Mr. Jack Daniels.

29
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,200
Mrs. Daniels?

30
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,100
Is Jack in?

31
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,200
What?

32
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,000
Oh, my God! When?

33
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,000
Oh, I am so sorry.

34
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,200
Poor old Jack.

35
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,900
He was a wise man, but he just loved
playing with that wheat thresher.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,100
Always playing with that wheat thresher!

37
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,600
Honey, hold still and let me bathe you.
You're filthy.

38
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,400
I'm filthy?

39
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,000
You're the filthy one.
What do you say to that?

40
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,300
How dare you!

41
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,300
Hey, Stewie, I see your bum.

42
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,100
Take a good look, fat man.

43
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,600
And take pictures so I'll have something
to bring to court, you filthy pervert.

44
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,200
Hey, Lois, give Chris a break.
I mean, no TV?

45
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,000
He failed a class,
it's not like he felt up his cousin...

46
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,700
...in the garage
that Thanksgiving when I was 19.

47
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,500
I want you to help Chris.

48
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,800
Kids do better when parents
take an interest in their schoolwork.

49
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,800
I saw that on a two-part report on
Dateline Tuesday and Dateline Gatilsday.

50
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,100
What the hell is Gatilsday?

51
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,000
NBC invented a new day
so they could add another Dateline.

52
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,000
But the Gumbel show is sacred to us.

53
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,900
Bryant and Greg have
the kind of father-son relationship...

54
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,000
...I want me and Chris to have someday.

55
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,400
Peter, Bryant and Greg Gumbel
are brothers.

56
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,100
Nice. Just because they're black,
we can't learn anything from them?

57
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,000
If Chris gets his homework done,
you can watch it together next week.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Now come on. Help me get
the house ready for my mother.

59
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,000
She's coming to visit for exactly one week.

60
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,100
Bye, Mom.

61
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,700
Sheesh. What a week that was.

62
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,200
Okay, come on, let's watch the Gumbels.

63
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,700
Peter, I thought we agreed,
no TV until his homework is done.

64
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,100
- Mom, I'll do it after...
- Chris finished his homework.

65
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,900
In fact, I've been helping him study
every night this week.

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,100
Really?

67
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,900
Well, that's great. Enjoy your show, boys.

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You bet we will.

69
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,700
Tonight, Katie Couric guest stars
as a very perky crack whore.

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,100
Dad, when you said, "Chris finished his
homework," were you talking about me?

71
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,400
Because if you were,
I think you just lied to mom.

72
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,300
Chris, everything I say is a lie,
except that and that.

73
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,000
And that. And that. And that. And that.

74
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
And that.

75
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,800
This is an Action News 5 News Break.

76
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,100
- I'm Tom Tucker.
- And I'm Diane Simmons.

77
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,600
Tom has dared me to do the news topless.

78
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
I've got the goods, but have I got the guts?
Find out at 11:00.

79
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,700
If you're waiting for Gumbel 2 Gumbel,
you're out of luck.

80
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,900
That show has been canceled.

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,700
The full story, and maybe Diane's boobs,
tonight at 11:00.

82
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,100
- I can't believe this!
- I feel sick.

83
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,600
Only one thing to do.

84
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,100
We gotta save Gumbel 2 Gumbel,
and were gonna do it Griffin 2 Griffin.

85
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,200
- Let's roll!
- I'm with ya, Dad.

86
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,500
What do we do, write a letter?

87
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,100
I tried that once.
It got me in a lot of trouble.

88
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,800
"If you don't put Coach back on the air,
I'll be really upset.

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,400
"The skillful acting of Craig T. Nelson
will be missed a lot.

90
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,100
"Signed, Peter Griffin."

91
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,600
Come help me with the groceries.

92
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,700
Okay, honey.

93
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,000
Craig T. Nelson!

94
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,200
- Are you Peter Griffin?
- Yeah.

95
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,600
Make it quick.

96
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,700
Okay, we're gonna get our show
back on the air...

97
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,300
...and were not gonna be intimidated
by any slick executive types.

98
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,600
Look at Mr. Suave.

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,200
Wait. You can't go in there.

100
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,800
Just watch me!

101
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,300
I mean, you can't go in there,
because that door leads nowhere.

102
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,300
Use the door next to it.

103
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,400
All right, Callaghan, me and my son
want you to uncancel Gumbel 2 Gumbel.

104
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,700
We only air the show. We have
nothing to do with it being canceled.

105
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,100
I have all the episodes on tape
if you want to borrow them.

106
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,900
Okay, you want to play rough?

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,100
Until you bring the Gumbels back,
I am going on a hunger strike.

108
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,300
How about that, Callaghan?

109
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,900
Can you live with that on your conscience?

110
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,400
You gonna eat that stapler?

111
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,500
- You can't eat a stapler...
- Wanna split it?

112
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,500
Sorry. Me and my damn appetite!

113
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,800
It's not the first time it brought me trouble.

114
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,900
And in gridiron news,
little Johnny Gobraun...

115
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,900
...a terminally ill 8-year-old
who dreamed of playing quarterback...

116
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,900
...for New England got his wish today
thanks to the Grant-a-Dream foundation.

117
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,400
Gobraun takes the snap
and fades back to pass.

118
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,000
Here comes the rush. Oh, he's sacked!

119
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,200
Looks like little Johnny
should've wished for some blocking.

120
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,200
Chris, I just thought of a way
to get the Gumbels back on the air.

121
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,900
All right, Dad!

122
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,100
All we gotta do is tell
a little white lie. Just go with it.

123
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,500
Is this the Grant-a-Dream foundation?

124
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,400
- My son Chris is dying!
- Holy crap, no! Oh, my God!

125
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,700
That was the lie.

126
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,300
Oh, you sly boots.

127
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,400
Are you sure this will work?

128
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,800
Chris, this is just another one
of your crazy schemes.

129
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,700
This whole thing was your idea!

130
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,300
You'll find out.

131
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,500
Dad, you're not making any sense!

132
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,500
You just leave that to me.

133
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,200
Ah, yes. Here we go.

134
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,700
Chris Griffin.

135
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,800
Your dying wish is denied.

136
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,900
Thank you.

137
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,500
Wait a minute.
My son only has a short time to live.

138
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,100
All he wants is his favorite show
back on TV. How can you say no?

139
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:20,200
Mr. Griffin, everyone thinks
their dying child is special.

140
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,500
But these days, people who donate money
to our foundation...

141
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,800
...demand a little more bang for their buck.

142
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,400
We need sick kids we can package.

143
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,800
Like that one we put
on Hollywood Squares.

144
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,000
I'll take the dying boy to block.

145
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,600
Jeremy, is there anything lower
than absolute zero?

146
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,200
Yeah. My white-cell count.

147
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,500
I'm telling you, Chris is dying
ten times worse than those other kids.

148
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,400
He's got a very rare disease called
tumor-syphilis-itis-osis.

149
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,000
Sounds sexy. What are the symptoms?

150
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,100
What are the symptoms? Take a look!

151
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,300
He's growing nipples all over his body!

152
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,900
- They look like pepperonis.
- Who do you think you are?

153
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,300
My son happens to be very sensitive
about his extra nipples.

154
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,100
See, look. They're coming right off.

155
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,800
Nipples shouldn't just come off like that.

156
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,900
Why, that's the sickest boy I've ever seen!

157
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,600
Get me the president of television!

158
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,500
How about this?

159
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,800
A single white girl in the city
working at a magazine!

160
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,500
Yeah, that's good.
Yeah.

161
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,500
Do you guys hear yourselves?

162
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,400
This is the same old crap
over and over again.

163
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,900
We need to take a chance.
Try something different. Something fresh.

164
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,000
Excuse me.

165
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,600
- No calls!
- It's about a dying boy.

166
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,900
Hello? What's he got?

167
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,500
Sounds sexy.

168
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,100
Get me exclusive rights to his death
and you got a deal.

169
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,900
Congratulations,
Gumbel 2 Gumbel is back on the air!

170
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,100
All right, Dad!

171
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,100
I'm sorry we had to meet
under these circumstances.

172
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,000
Are you kidding? I may see you again.

173
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,500
I've two more kids,
and I've always wanted to see...

174
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,100
...new episodes of Star Trek.

175
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,000
Stewie, it's bath time. You're filthy again.

176
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,800
I'll show you filthy!

177
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,000
Yes, look at me! I'm a dirty, foul little boy!

178
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,400
I'm a nasty, squalid little hobo!

179
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,600
I say, Mother, you have your work cut out
for you now, don't you?

180
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,400
Okay, if you want to be dirty, be dirty.

181
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,000
Where do you think you're going?
I've defiled myself.

182
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,400
I need to be cleaned!

183
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,100
There you go, kiddo. All clean.

184
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,800
Blast! I'm frozen! I'm hypothermic!

185
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,900
Bloody hell, I'm a woman!

186
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,800
Take out your pencils and start your test.

187
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,900
Mr. McCloud, I didn't study for the test,
but I got a good reason.

188
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,400
I'm dying.

189
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,000
That's the lamest excuse I've heard since
Steinberg's Jewish High Holiday crap.

190
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,500
Take that hat off in my classroom!

191
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,600
But Mr. McCloud, I'm really dying.

192
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,700
I have a certificate to prove it.

193
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,800
My God! Tumor-syphilis-itis-osis!
And he still comes into school!

194
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,800
You're excused from the test,
you brave, brave boy.

195
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,600
You can learn something
from this fine young...

196
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,000
Damn it, Steinberg! Take that hat off!

197
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,300
Dad, Marcy Gibbons just called!

198
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,000
She heard that Chris is dying!

199
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,700
Your brother's okay.

200
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,700
That was just a little white lie
we came up with to save a TV show.

201
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,200
So he's not going to die?

202
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,500
No.

203
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,300
Boy, your face was priceless
when you thought he was.

204
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,500
You're a monster.

205
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,500
Chris was in on the whole thing.

206
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,100
Anyway, it's over and done with.

207
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:55,500
Anyway, it's over and done with.

208
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,400
What the hell is that?

209
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,200
"Oh, dyin' boy of Quahog

210
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,800
"Chris Griffin, you're so brave

211
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,200
"There's a smile on your face
and a bounce in your step

212
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,300
"as they dig your grave

213
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,100
"as they dig your grave"

214
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,700
Do I hear singing?
No! No singing.

215
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,100
Just us watching another
hilarious episode of Good Times.

216
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,000
The sitcom that's funnier
when you play it really loud.

217
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,300
Maxine is the lady who's feeling all right...

218
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,900
...thanks to the magic of Kid Dynomite!

219
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,600
Junior, where you been?

220
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,200
Dinner was three hours ago!

221
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,100
Oh, forget him, James.

222
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,700
- He's an idiot!
- Mama, what's wrong with you?

223
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,700
What's wrong with me?

224
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,400
My name is Florida!

225
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,400
Florida! That's the name of a state!

226
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,200
Why is my name Florida?

227
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,400
Oh, Lord!

228
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,500
Dynomite!

229
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,500
That is singing.

230
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,500
Peter, there's a candlelight vigil
on our front lawn.

231
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,100
Lois, that's ridiculous.
There's nobody out there.

232
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,700
You must be seeing things.

233
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,100
Peter, why are these people here?

234
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,400
"As they dig my grave,
as they dig my grave"

235
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,600
Hey, Dad, they're singing a song about me!

236
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,900
Hi, Mom.

237
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,300
Hello, Mr. Griffin.

238
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,300
We just came by to see if your son's
taken a media-friendly turn for the worse.

239
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,500
No. Everything's fine.
Thanks for checking. Bye-bye.

240
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,400
Mr. Griffin, the foundation
held up its end of the bargain...

241
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,000
...and got that crappy Gumbel show
back on the air!

242
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,500
- You owe us a body!
- What?

243
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,400
Excuse me for a minute.

244
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,100
You pretended Chris was dying
to save a TV show?

245
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,300
You're a monster!

246
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,400
Thank you.

247
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,600
You tell that man the truth!

248
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,300
Just out of curiosity...

249
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,500
- Shoot.
- What happens if he's not really dying?

250
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,300
You go to jail
for defrauding a charitable organization.

251
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,800
That's interesting.

252
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,300
Will you excuse us?

253
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,800
You're right!
There's only one way out of this!

254
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,500
Chris is all better! I cured him!

255
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,000
You cured him?

256
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,800
That's right. I have divine powers!

257
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,500
Okay. Safe drive.

258
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,100
What do you have to say to that?

259
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,500
I'm not going to jail,
Chris doesn't have to die...

260
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,400
...and best of all,
Gumbel 2 Gumbel is back on the air.

261
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,400
You're a great role model.

262
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,300
What kind of man devalues
the life of his child for a TV show?

263
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,800
Anyone who wouldn't pretend
their own son is dying...

264
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,600
...to get the Gumbels back on TV is a racist.

265
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,100
It's him! It's Peter Griffin!
The miracle healer of Quahog!

266
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,200
Heal me, O great one!

267
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,800
You see what your lies have done?
They think you're some kind of healer.

268
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,100
I'll handle it.

269
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,500
I read a book about this sort of thing once.

270
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,000
Are you sure it was a book?

271
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,200
Are you sure it wasn't nothing?

272
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,200
Oh, yeah.

273
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,300
These poor, deluded people
think you have divine powers.

274
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,900
Praise Peter!

275
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,500
- We are your servants.
- It's a miracle!

276
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,600
What would you have us do,
O great healer of Quahog?

277
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,000
There's really no need to do anything.
Paint my house.

278
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's bad enough to lie to your family...

279
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,700
...but how can you let these people
think you're a healer?

280
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,600
This is pure exploitation.

281
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,100
No, it's not.

282
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,000
Those films my cousin Rufus used to do
were pure exploitation.

283
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,000
From the cats
who brought you Caddyblack, Blackdraft...

284
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,300
...and Black Kramer v. Kramer,
comes a funky flick so bad...

285
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,600
...you gonna say, "Damn, that's funky."

286
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,700
Oh, you out of time, baby.

287
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,900
Damn!

288
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,600
Rufus Griffin stars in...

289
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,500
...Black to the Future.

290
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,400
We're talking Marty McSuperfly, dig?

291
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,800
Marty, I want to be your fine,
sweet-ass bitch.

292
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,600
Damn! Brother done kissed his mama!

293
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,600
Oh, yeah.

294
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,800
Get me Isaac Hayes.

295
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,500
Isaac, you know that new sound
you been looking for?

296
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,300
Well, listen to this!

297
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,300
Come on, Lois.
Stop being such a stick in the mud.

298
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm giving these saps hope.

299
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,500
And I'm getting the house painted for free.

300
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,900
It's win-freakin'-win, baby.

301
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,200
Hey, flathead, chop-chop.

302
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,300
Hey, great job on the lawn.

303
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,800
Now do it again,
and this time leave it a little longer.

304
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,000
Hey, Dad. Hurry up.
You're missing Gumbel 2 Gumbel.

305
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,700
They caught the guy,
and now they're interviewing him.

306
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,500
Purse snatching,
society's fault, or one man's cry for help?

307
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,400
What are you talking about?
I wanted her freakin' money.

308
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,600
What the hell's wrong with him?

309
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,000
Some other time, Chris.
Now, where's my shoes?

310
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,400
These people are worshipping you.

311
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,000
Don't you think there's someone
who might resent that?

312
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,500
A being who's all-knowing
and all-powerful?

313
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,900
Someone's got a pretty high
opinion of herself.

314
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,200
Not me, Peter. God. The real God.

315
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,700
What's the big deal?

316
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,400
So I told a little fib,
and now people think I'm God.

317
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,800
When did God ever say
He didn't want someone else...

318
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,100
...being worshipped like Him?

319
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,000
It's one of the Ten Commandments.

320
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,000
Come on. Those were written,
like, 200 years ago. Times have changed!

321
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,100
Okay, let's stay calm.

322
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,500
Lois, if you're scared,
I'll hold you until the lights are on again.

323
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,600
Dad, it's me.
Go to your room.

324
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,200
That's the last of them.

325
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,400
I still don't know how every light bulb
could go out at the same time.

326
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,800
Oh, my God.

327
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,000
Yes?

328
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,700
That's not funny.

329
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,300
Those fanatics are building
a golden idol of you on our lawn.

330
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,100
I look like a freakin' Emmy.

331
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,600
Hint-hint.

332
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,400
Damn it to hell!

333
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,500
This is embarrassing. I seem to have fleas.

334
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,200
That's never happened before.

335
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,200
Morning.

336
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,300
Chris, puberty hit you like a ton of bricks.

337
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,800
What do you mean?

338
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,900
Don't you see what's happening?

339
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,600
Of course I do, Lois.

340
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,600
Our fresh-faced little boy
is becoming a pock-marked...

341
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,900
...hideously disfigured man.
Sunrise. Sunset.

342
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,200
No. The light bulbs last night,
my fleas, Chris' pimples.

343
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,500
They're just like darkness,
gadflies, and boils.

344
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,100
Three of the plagues God visited upon
Egypt in the Old Testament.

345
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,100
Come on, there's a logical explanation
for all those things.

346
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,100
There was a power surge,
you don't bathe...

347
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,900
...and Chris has had acne problems
since the fourth grade.

348
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,000
The kids were all calling him Crisco
and Pizza Face...

349
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,900
...and Rootin'-Tootin' Raspberry.
Remember, Chris?

350
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,200
Now I do.

351
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,800
Meg, what's wrong?

352
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,800
I was giving Stewie a bath, and...

353
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,800
Trust me, Meg, at his age,
it's strictly involuntary.

354
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,200
No! The water,
it turned all red and goopy, like blood!

355
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,400
Blood?

356
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,800
How positively delightful.
It's as if someone stabbed Mr. Bubble!

357
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,200
My baby!

358
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,400
Get out there
and tell those people the truth.

359
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,700
Make them stop worshipping you
before it starts hailing in my house!

360
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,600
There's gotta be an explanation for all this!

361
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,300
You want an explanation? God is pissed!

362
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,600
Let's get out of here!

363
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,300
Stop it! Stop worshipping me!

364
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,100
I'm just a big fake...

365
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,700
...like the moon landing
and Marky Mark's hog in Boogie Nights...

366
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,900
...and Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman!

367
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,100
I don't mean
that completely untrue gay rumor.

368
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,400
They're just both really phony, just like me.

369
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,400
I'm sorry, okay? Now make it stop.

370
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,600
This is the final plague!

371
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,400
Good, it's starting to get really old.

372
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,000
The final plague is
the death of the first-born son.

373
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,400
- No! Stewie!
- The first-born son.

374
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,900
- Meg.
- Your wife.

375
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,100
Chris!

376
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,200
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

377
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,900
Hey, Dad, I can see a white light
at the end of a long tunnel.

378
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,100
Oh, that's great, son.
Light is good. Run towards the light.

379
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,500
No! Run away from the light!

380
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,300
Hey, Dad, do you think they got
Gumbel 2 Gumbel in heaven?

381
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,100
Yes, son, and there's no reruns
or commercials...

382
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,000
...and Kirstie Alley is still hot...

383
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,400
...and all those scrambled channels
come in clear as a bell.

384
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,600
Please don't take him, God. I'm sorry.

385
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,600
We think the Griffin guy gets it.

386
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,500
Good, good.
Peggy, turn off the plagues, please.

387
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,500
Yes, sir, Mr. Patterson.

388
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,200
She's new.

389
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,400
I think the plagues went away.

390
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,100
- So did the white light.
- Oh, honey!

391
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,200
Thank God! I mean, thank me!

392
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,500
Kidding! It was a joke!
