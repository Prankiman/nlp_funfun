<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

2
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:08,174
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

3
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:11,802
<i>But where are those
good old-fashioned values</i>

4
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:14,847
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

5
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:18,226
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

6
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:21,604
<i>Lucky there's a man
who positively can do</i>

7
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,189
<i>All the things that make us</i>

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,690
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:30,155

00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,245
Good evening, Quahog. Our top story:

12
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:39,914
a local Yankee fan's dream comes true

13
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:42,416
when he's diagnosed
with Lou Gehrig's disease.

14
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:43,793
But first...

15
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:45,836
Hey, the TV went out.

16
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,630
Huh.

17
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:50,841
Oh, my God, the Wi-Fi is out.

18
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,936
Okay, everyone calm down.

19
00:00:59,937 --> 00:01:01,477
I know how we'll get through this.

20
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:05,273
This is the story of
the greatest trilogy ever told,

21
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,024
<i>The Mighty Ducks.</i>

22
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,277
It was a time of great nonsense.

23
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:11,028
Dad, why don't you tell us
how you and Mom

24
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,613
fell in love and got married?

25
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,782
And in go the earbuds.

26
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,617
Terrific episode idea, Meg.

27
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,452
Well, it was the 1990s,

28
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:21,163
the decade of Viagra
but also Lorena Bobbitt,

29
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:24,166
so it was kind of
a yay-boo period for penises.

30
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,836
After graduating, your mom
and me moved to the city

31
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,170
with all our friends.

32
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,470
<i>I lived with my best friends,
Quagmire and Cleveland.</i>

33
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,681
<i>We were the kind of friends
who were all good-looking,</i>

34
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,933
<i>except for David Schwimmer.</i>

35
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,476
<i>And your mom lived across the hall</i>

36
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,395
<i>with her friends Bonnie and...</i>

37
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:45,813
<i>uh, Bonnie.</i>

38
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,315
<i>God, we desperately need to get</i>

39
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:49,275
<i>more female characters in this show.</i>

40
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:50,526
<i>I was the Chandler.</i>

41
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,600
<i>Not because of my sarcastic zingers</i>

42
00:01:52,601 --> 00:01:55,323
<i>but because I liked
to take 40 Vicodin a day.</i>

43
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:56,741
Guys, I've got big news.

44
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,492
Tell 'em, Quagmire.

45
00:01:58,493 --> 00:01:59,994
I got a promotion at Blockbuster!

46
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:05,041
Gleonard Quagmire,
that is fantastic news!

47
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,876
I know, right?
You know how I always felt

48
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,336
like I was stuck in second gear?

49
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:09,837
Well, this is a new gear!

50
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,589
Well, congratulations, Glenn!

51
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,050
This calls for a fountain dance.

52
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:19,555
<i>I was the least graceful
at fountain dancing.</i>

53
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,974
<i>I just swung my arms
and tried to fit in.</i>

54
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,225
<i>It was senseless.
We were in our clothes,</i>

55
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,894
<i>for God's sake. Everyone got wet.</i>

56
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,395
<i>It was cold. You know,</i>

57
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,813
<i>there were originally nine friends,</i>

58
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,446
<i>but three of 'em died of pneumonia.</i>

59
00:02:29,447 --> 00:02:32,735
<i>I'm still haunted
by Chad's shivering last words,</i>

60
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:35,237
<i>"Don't let Monica get Botox."</i>

61
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,328
<i>We also hung out at
our favorite café, Perk Place,</i>

62
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,205
<i>where we would all sweat like crazy</i>

63
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:45,915
<i>'cause everyone in the '90s
wore turtlenecks,</i>

64
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,167
<i>vests, and Jamiroquai hats.</i>

65
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,960
Lois, you look down. What's wrong?

66
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,755
Brad Pitt broke up with me
in a pretty public way.

67
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:55,424
I just don't know
if I'll ever date again.

68
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,885
Wait, I thought you and Dad
dated in high school.

69
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,136
Did you break up?

70
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,263
Uh-uh, story's not over, Meg.
Settle down.

71
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,641
Your father and I had dated
for a few years,

72
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,476
but I didn't know
if it was going anywhere.

73
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:08,938
So we decided to take a break
but remained close friends.

74
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,899
I actually briefly dated one
of our roommates, Barry.

75
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,110
He was one of them
what the fountain took.

76
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:17,113
My father had planned out
my whole life for me.

77
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,824
<i>He wanted me to marry one
of Quahog's up-and-comers,</i>

78
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,492
<i>Tom Tucker, Elmer Hartman,</i>

79
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:23,160
<i>Seamus or Billy Zane.</i>

80
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,955
<i>It's meeting the man of my dreams</i>

81
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:29,083
<i>And then meeting his beautiful wife</i>

82
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,793
<i>And isn't it ironic</i>

83
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,420
<i>Don't you think?</i>

84
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:35,965
<i>It's like rain...</i>

85
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,259
<i>On your wedding day.</i>

86
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,763
<i>Alanis Morissette was America's
sweetheart in the '90s.</i>

87
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,266
<i>She went on to become one
of the CDs in the garage.</i>

88
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,435
<i>Wait, Seamus had arms and legs?</i>

89
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:49,645
<i>Chris, I'm not sure
you have the green light</i>

90
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,147
<i>to just chime in whenever.</i>

91
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:54,817
Lois, let's go take a midnight
swim at Sharkbite Cove.

92
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,652
Oh, sounds wonderful, Seamus,

93
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,446
but I have other plans.

94
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:01,741
Okay, well, I'm definitely going.

95
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,455
Peter, why don't you admit it?

96
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,206
You still got the hots for Lois.

97
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,207
It's obvious.

98
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,293
Nah, we're broken up.
We're just friends now.

99
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,504
<i>Looking back, I realize he was right.</i>

100
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,840
<i>But the '90s was an exciting time,</i>

101
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,885
<i>and we wanted to experience
all it had to offer.</i>

102
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,511
Hey, guys, there's a great concert

103
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,555
in World Trade Center Plaza
this weekend!

104
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:25,973
Really? Who's playing?

105
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,017
They got Korn, Cranberries and Cake.

106
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,977
Oh, that sounds delicious.
But who are the bands?

107
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,312
They're opening with Cake.

108
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,397
Wait, shouldn't cake be last?
It's a dessert.

109
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,733
Korn is last.
Korn is a bigger draw than Cake.

110
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,693
Corn is not a bigger draw than cake.

111
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,361
- Cake is delicious.
- "No Doubt"?

112
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,155
Well, I'm glad
you agree with me, Quagmire,

113
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,657
but that still doesn't address
this issue of the order.

114
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,743
My last show was a Weezer concert.

115
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,037
Well, that's 'cause
everyone smokes nowadays.

116
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,164
What band did we see last time
at the Palladium?

117
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:51,207
It was, uh, Blur.

118
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,750
Yeah, I can't remember, either.

119
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:55,377
<i>It was a very confusing time in music.</i>

120
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,338
<i>Okay, time for another scene.</i>

121
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,757
<i>Let's transition
with a '90s guitar sting</i>

122
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,760
<i>that's way too long.</i>

123
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,896
<i>- Dad, what...
- H-Hang on, Chris.</i>

124
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,064
<i>It's not done yet.</i>

125
00:05:22,806 --> 00:05:24,073
<i>Okay, there we go.</i>

126
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,950
<i>What'd you do for a living, Dad?</i>

127
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,701
<i>What any of us
did never really mattered.</i>

128
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:28,869
<i>It was just "vague business."</i>

129
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,746
<i>But despite having broken up,</i>

130
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,748
<i>I would sometimes sneak away
to the Internet</i>

131
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,291
<i>to go flirt with your mom.</i>

132
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,627
Well, I'm gonna go move my bangs
with my pinky

133
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,046
in front of the mirror.

134
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,090
<i>- Welcome!</i>
- Shh, shh, shh, shh!

135
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,092
<i>- You've got mail!</i>
- Okay, good, but quiet.

136
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,426
<i>You've got male porn!</i>

137
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,970
Shh, shh, shh!

138
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,889
Peter, quit trying to flirt with
that clearly girlfriend of yours

139
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,267
and come watch giant box TV with us!

140
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,143
<i>We all watched</i> The X-Files,

141
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,563
<i>which would be Fox's last hit show.</i>

142
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,482
<i>And it was the heyday
of the multi-camera sitcom,</i>

143
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,568
<i>and Paul Reiser, its king,</i>

144
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:01,819
<i>was must-see.</i>

145
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,238
Perhaps I'll try this yogurt.

146
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,448
That's been in there since our wedding.

147
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,785
Perhaps... I won't.

148
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,499
Peter, admit it.

149
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,293
You're still in love with Lois.

150
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,420
Yeah, every time you see her,
you go, "Schwing!"

151
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,130
Which is, like, the sound

152
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,007
of being lifted by a boner, I think.

153
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,301
Yeah, but we decided
we wanted to see other people.

154
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:28,095
That's only 'cause she got tired
of waiting around for you.

155
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,597
Look, she loves you,

156
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,849
but she ain't gonna wait around forever.

157
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,975
<i>I knew they were right.</i>

158
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,351
<i>Your mom was the only one</i>

159
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,979
<i>I wanted to spend
the rest of my life with.</i>

160
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,856
<i>So I saved my money,
and, a few months later,</i>

161
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,190
<i>I bought a ring.</i>

162
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:43,404
So, did you enjoy your pesto with pesto?

163
00:06:43,405 --> 00:06:45,989
Does this smile give you your answer?

164
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,284
Lois, there's something
I want to ask you.

165
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,912
Will you marry me?

166
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,456
Oh, Peter, I'm-I'm so sorry, but...

167
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,917
I'm already engaged to Tom Tucker.

168
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,044
Passed over for Tom Tucker?

169
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,795
That's terrible.

170
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,298
What do you think of that,
fellow '90s star Joey Lawrence?

171
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,300
- Meh.
- Oh. Huh.

172
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,302
Okay, well, what would you think
if I told you

173
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,471
that Blossom would completely
drop out of show business

174
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,389
to get a PhD in neuroscience

175
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,059
and then come back
and make $15 million a year,

176
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,227
while you would work steadily
for 20 years,

177
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,063
lose all your hair and go bankrupt?

178
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,190
- Whoa!
- There it is!

179
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:24,445
Yeah, that's the...
That's the thing I wanted.

180
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,866
Where's Dad?

181
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,660
<i>You've got male porn!</i>

182
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:35,079
Peter, get in here and finish the story!

183
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,998
Sorry, I was just watching
some guy take it in the AOL.

184
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,084
<i>- Goodbye.</i>
- All right, where were we?

185
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:43,087
Mom just said
she got engaged to Tom Tucker?

186
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,798
Well, deep down,
I knew I loved your father,

187
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,550
but I guess I just caved
to my father's pressure.

188
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,552
And on my 28th birthday,

189
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,888
<i>he introduced me to my future husband.</i>

190
00:08:04,024 --> 00:08:09,571
<i>He's your king-to-be</i>

191
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:13,617
<i>A king to be forever</i>

192
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:17,287
<i>A king who'll do whatever</i>

193
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,082
<i>Her Highness</i>

194
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,670
<i>Desires</i>

195
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:28,925
<i>He's your king-to-be...</i>

196
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,844
Thanks, Ollie.

197
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,721
Good afternoon, Lois. I'm Tom Tucker,

198
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:34,888
your king-to-be.

199
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,223
In other news,

200
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,726
President Clinton sent me
a congratulatory cigar,

201
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,644
but it's a little moist.

202
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,730
<i>Well, I wasn't
gonna give up that easily.</i>

203
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:45,399
<i>So I decided I was gonna do
the most powerful thing</i>

204
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,402
<i>you could do in the '90s:
make a mixtape.</i>

205
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,404
Again, Peter, it's your mixtape,

206
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:53,240
but you've got "Cotton Eye Joe"
as song number two,

207
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,075
number four, seven and eight.

208
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,493
You think it should be
number three as well?

209
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,578
No!

210
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,455
<i>I made it number three as well.</i>

211
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,248
Oh, Peter, I got to say,

212
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,751
the fourth and fifth time
I heard "Cotton Eye Joe,"

213
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,419
it really got to me.

214
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,755
<i>I was so happy.</i>

215
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,173
<i>I knew Peter was the one</i>

216
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,759
<i>I wanted to spend
the rest of my life with.</i>

217
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,303
<i>But I dreaded having to tell my father.</i>

218
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,347
<i>Luckily, he was remarkably
understanding about it.</i>

219
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,142
I've decided to be remarkably
understanding about this.

220
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,436
- Really?
- Yes. And to prove it,

221
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,605
I'm going to pay
for Peter's bachelor party

222
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,148
at the MTV Beach House.

223
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,317
And I promise it's not part of a ruse

224
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,778
to destroy your affection
for Peter once and for all.

225
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,529
Oh, Daddy, thank you!

226
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,989
<i>I was thrilled.</i>

227
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,450
<i>Not only was
Carter letting me marry Lois,</i>

228
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:39,787
<i>but this was gonna be
the ultimate bachelor party.</i>

229
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,872
<i>The MTV Beach House was located</i>

230
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,333
<i>in the most hepatitis-rich part
of Florida,</i>

231
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,960
<i>known as Florida.</i>

232
00:09:46,793 --> 00:09:48,337
Whassup?!

233
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,047
Commercials.

234
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,216
No skipping those yet.

235
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,968
<i>We partied the same way
everyone in the '90s did,</i>

236
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,845
<i>spaced apart by a few feet,</i>

237
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,639
<i>dancing on our own.</i>

238
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,183
<i>Yeah, I was pretty
much the coolest guy there.</i>

239
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,810
<i>With the best legs.</i>

240
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,312
<i>There were these other idiots
there having a bachelor party,</i>

241
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,814
<i>but I didn't know 'em. They were losers.</i>

242
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,857
<i>- Joe?
- Who's that? Peter?</i>

243
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,818
<i>Yeah, get out of my story.
What the hell are you doing?</i>

244
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:14,321
<i>I'm telling the story of my
days at the MTV Beach House.</i>

245
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,906
<i>You get out of</i> my<i> story!</i>

246
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,284
<i>I'm about to tell how I met Daria.</i>

247
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:23,038
So, you partying hard
or hardly partying?

248
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,748
Hardly interested.

249
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,041
You're mean!

250
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,379
<i>La-la-la-la-la</i>

251
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,465
<i>La-la-la-la-la.</i>

252
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,134
<i>I even got to meet my heroes,</i>

253
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,095
<i>Mark McGrath, Pauly Shore
and Jamie Kennedy,</i>

254
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,721
<i>and we became friends.</i>

255
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,515
Guys, come be in my wedding.

256
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,767
Then we can all enter the 2000s
together as friends.

257
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,853
Sorry, Peter, but we can't go with you.

258
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,396
We're not allowed in the 2000s.

259
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:50,149
Yeah, we have to stay back here
in the '90s.

260
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,651
- Goodbye, Peter.
<i>- And then,</i>

261
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,696
<i>they all walked into the sea
and disappeared forever.</i>

262
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,114
Tell the world about us!

263
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,448
<i>I planned to,</i>

264
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,409
<i>but then I found a half-eaten hot dog</i>

265
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,744
<i>that only had a little bit
of sand on it.</i>

266
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,913
<i>And most of the sand was very brushable.</i>

267
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,416
<i>You can pretty much wash
a hot dog with soap and water,</i>

268
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,959
<i>and you can still eat it.</i>

269
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,795
<i>I danced for eight hours</i>
<i>straight on</i> The Grind,

270
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,298
<i>occasionally going into the pool to pee.</i>

271
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,383
<i>Also, for some reason,
I was the only guy</i>

272
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,552
<i>a bee was following the whole time.</i>

273
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,721
<i>Maybe it was 'cause of the
Country Time Lemonade powder</i>

274
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,931
<i>I'd been eating,
or 'cause me and Quagmire</i>

275
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,933
<i>were huckin' Capri Suns at each other.</i>

276
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,269
<i>But little did I know,
while I was dancing</i>

277
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,229
<i>and periodically peeing in the pool,</i>

278
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,440
<i>Carter was orchestrating a plan</i>

279
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,943
<i>to destroy my relationship
with your mom once and for all.</i>

280
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,778
Hey, you're Daisy Fuentes.

281
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,573
Oh,<i> that's</i> how I say my last name.

282
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,992
You're the hottest girl of 1990-this.

283
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,119
I've got a proposition for you.

284
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,752
Hey, there. You're all that
<i>and</i> a bag of chips.

285
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,670
What a cool phrase.

286
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,673
I hope it never sounds dumb and dated.

287
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:05,307
Look, Peter's wrestling
with Daisy Foo-en-taze!

288
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,606
<i>It all happened so fast.</i>

289
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:16,485
Oh. We're having fun
'cause it's not 9/11 yet. Mmm.

290
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,278
<i>But the next thing I knew,</i>

291
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,280
<i>I was kissing Daisy Fuentes.</i>

292
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:23,533
<i>And it was on national television.</i>

293
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,203
<i>I was home doing
what girls did at the time...</i>

294
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,413
<i>Looking at pictures of John Elway.</i>

295
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,541
My horse-toothed dreamboat.

296
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,502
Denver looks beautiful.

297
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:36,755
Peter?! How could you?!

298
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,842
<i>My heart shattered the moment I saw it.</i>

299
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:45,639
<i>I took your father's mixtape
and hucked it into the ocean.</i>

300
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,351
<i>Right then and there, I vowed
I would never see him again.</i>

301
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,159
She said "wood."

302
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,815
That was cool.

303
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,941
Yeah. Wood! Wood!

304
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,027
You're right! Wood.

305
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,172
Daddy, tell us more
about the black '90s.

306
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:22,154
Well, Magic Johnson got AIDS,
and I was like, "What?!"

307
00:13:22,155 --> 00:13:24,845
But then, he came back the
next season and scored 30 points

308
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:27,222
in a game where no one would touch him.

309
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:30,058
And he caught it through
heterosexual sex contact?

310
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,269
Well, that<i> is</i> magic.

311
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,563
Terrific. Thank you, Cleveland.

312
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,857
And thank you
to the entire Brown family,

313
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,859
whose last name escapes me
at the moment.

314
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,569
Terrific.

315
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,862
Thanks, Dad.

316
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,280
Now back to your story.

317
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:45,407
I had just lost the love of my life.

318
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,576
So as a way to forget my pain,

319
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:51,146
I threw myself into
a dot-com startup with Quagmire.

320
00:13:51,147 --> 00:13:53,582
<i>We were two ambitious
young entrepreneurs</i>

321
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,625
<i>at the height of the dot-com bubble.</i>

322
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,263
Oogle? Goo goo?

323
00:13:58,264 --> 00:14:00,714
Gah-gah goo? Gee-gee goo? Go... go go?

324
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:03,050
Keep saying baby words, Peter.
You're onto something.

325
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,593
We're close. We're circling it!

326
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,763
Goo-goo gah-gah? Oo... oogle?
Ooh eee ooh ah ah?

327
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,140
<i>Moments late, we'd found
a business idea destined</i>

328
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:13,518
<i>to change the tech world
forever: Googoogle.</i>

329
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,313
<i>A search engine for all
the info on the Goo Goo Dolls.</i>

330
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:19,608
People are always gonna need
information about them!

331
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,068
<i>We were on our way.</i>

332
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,736
<i>We rented office space,</i>

333
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:25,614
<i>and watching it gave us
the idea to rent office space.</i>

334
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,574
<i>Lumbergh.</i>

335
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:33,246
Uh, clearly,
we hadn't discussed the, uh,

336
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,831
<i>tone</i> of our work environment.

337
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,636
I should say we haven't.

338
00:14:36,637 --> 00:14:38,668
I thought this was
to be a place of business.

339
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,462
<i>We got over our initial differences,</i>

340
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,297
<i>and then spent the rest of the day doing</i>

341
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,091
<i>what everybody did in the '90s...</i>

342
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:47,094
<i>Debating what was better...</i>
Forrest Gump<i> or</i> Pulp Fiction.

343
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,970
<i>Forrest Gump</i> is ridiculous!

344
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:52,099
One guy does what he's told all
the time and makes millions.

345
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,477
But a girl goes off, tries to be
different, gets AIDS, and dies!

346
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:58,313
I find your argument shallow
and pedantic.

347
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,648
<i>I didn't see either one.</i>

348
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,483
<i>I saw</i> Ace Ventura<i> 50 times.</i>

349
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,777
<i>Laughed so hard, I crapped
myself in the theater.</i>

350
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,112
<i>Just thinking about it now makes me...</i>

351
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,239
<i>Ow!</i>

352
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,157
<i>Meanwhile, my wedding plans</i>

353
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,742
<i>with Tom Tucker were back on.</i>

354
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,494
Are you ready? I can't believe

355
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,329
the wedding is just two scenes away.

356
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,190
What's wrong, sweetie?

357
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:18,902
I guess I'm just not sure
if I'm doing the right thing.

358
00:15:18,903 --> 00:15:20,460
What if this is a mistake?

359
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,963
Trust me, you're doing the right
thing. It's gonna be great.

360
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,965
Now, listen, we don't have too
much time before the wedding,

361
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,508
so I want to go over something

362
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:27,968
regarding the father-daughter dance.

363
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:31,138
It goes, "Dallah-hollah
wallah-ballah-dallah Macarena,

364
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,181
wakka-lakka-chakka-hakka-bakka
Macarena."

365
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,683
Daddy, I don't think

366
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:36,852
"The Macarena" is
the best father-daughter dance.

367
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,354
Well, how about another song
from the '90s?

368
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:42,732
<i>Casey would waltz</i>
<i>with the strawberry blonde</i>

369
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:46,653
<i>And the band played on...</i>

370
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,780
What? Wrong '90s?

371
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,533
<i>Like everything stupid</i>

372
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,535
<i>in the '90s, Googoogle took off.</i>

373
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,830
<i>We celebrated in grand
dot-com bubble fashion:</i>

374
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,832
<i>by having an outrageous yacht party</i>

375
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,417
<i>with lobster fights and hookers.</i>

376
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,294
<i>We did Ecstasy,
which was terrible for you,</i>

377
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,379
<i>and only ever made me feel fantastic.</i>

378
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,214
<i>Kids, don't do it. It's too awesome.</i>

379
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,550
<i>They said it would burn a hole
in your brain,</i>

380
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,093
<i>- but show me the hole.
- Peter, that's enough.</i>

381
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,262
<i>If you hate pure, unconditional love</i>

382
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,723
<i>and experiencing the profound
harmony of the universe,</i>

383
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,892
<i>definitely do not try this drug.</i>

384
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,935
<i>There's also, like,
a 90% chance you'll hook up,</i>

385
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,270
<i>but really, no, don't do it.</i>

386
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:21,563
<i>Even if you don't hook up,
you don't care.</i>

387
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,064
<i>But you'll hook up, guaranteed.</i>

388
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,108
<i>Okay, Peter, let's move on.</i>

389
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,110
<i>And what was the name of that drug?</i>

390
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,403
<i>But despite our success,</i>

391
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,614
<i>something was missing.</i>

392
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,032
Peter, we did it!

393
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,868
What's the matter?
You still sad about Brandon Lee?

394
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,412
Yeah. I never heard of him
before he died,

395
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,206
but when he died, it was so sad.

396
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,960
But also, it's Lois.

397
00:16:40,961 --> 00:16:42,584
She's getting married tomorrow.

398
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,045
Somehow, all this success
feels meaningless,

399
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,796
knowing I'm about to lose her forever.

400
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,632
Peter, then you need
to stop that wedding

401
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:49,883
before it's too late.

402
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,593
But we've got a business to run.

403
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,428
You don't care about this business.

404
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,472
All you've ever cared about is Lois.

405
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:56,973
This is your last shot.

406
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,309
Peter, you get to that wedding.

407
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,727
<i>They were right.</i>

408
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,229
<i>So I decided to get there</i>

409
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,272
<i>the way everyone got around
in the '90s...</i>

410
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,027
<i>Propelled by an explosion.</i>

411
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,991
Do you, Lois
Commondenominator Pewterschmidt,

412
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:18,287
accept this man to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

413
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,500
Peter? What the hell
are you doing here?!

414
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:26,002
Lois, can I talk to you privately?

415
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,006
What is it, Peter?

416
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,801
Before you marry Tom, what's
the<i> Mortal Kombat</i> blood code?

417
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,177
I keep forgetting.

418
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:37,597
It's "A-B-A-C-A-B-B,"
but you can't do this now!

419
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,099
You're ruining my wedding!

420
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,809
Lois, if I didn't come here,

421
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,852
I'd regret it for the rest of my life.

422
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,605
I know I screwed up,
and I don't deserve you,

423
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,941
but I can't stop thinking
about you, day and night.

424
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,277
It's been this way since the day we met.

425
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:53,989
I fell in love with you then,
and I'll never stop.

426
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,199
Unless Daisy Fuentes felt something?

427
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,076
Uh, I didn't.

428
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,703
Lois, you're the only woman for me.

429
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:00,954
He cheated on you!

430
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:03,123
No daughter of mine is going
to marry a cheater!

431
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:04,499
Daddy's right.

432
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,501
Peter, I'm sorry, but you blew it.

433
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:10,046
I was in love with you, too,
but then you cheated on me.

434
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,048
You kissed Daisy Fuentes.

435
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:15,010
Lois, there's something you should know.

436
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:17,846
He didn't kiss me. <i>I</i> kissed<i> him.</i>

437
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,806
Because you felt something?

438
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,349
Because Carter paid me.

439
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,517
Well, that's something!

440
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,894
Daddy... is that true?

441
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,231
I only did it to protect you
from making a huge mistake!

442
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,984
Lois, I may not be
as smart or as handsome

443
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,153
as the guys your dad wants for you,

444
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:36,031
but I love you more
than all of 'em put together.

445
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,158
That's a fact. Just as sure

446
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:41,411
as the<i> Star Wars</i> movies are
a perfect isolated trilogy,

447
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:43,457
unmarred by additional canon.

448
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,448
Oh, Peter!

449
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,337
- Damn it, stop them!
<i>- One by one,</i>

450
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:53,757
<i>members of Lois' family tried
to stop me, but I laid 'em out.</i>

451
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,508
<i>There's something about punching someone</i>

452
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,926
<i>in a church that just feels good.</i>

453
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,894
<i>Cleveland picked us up
in a white Bronco.</i>

454
00:19:07,477 --> 00:19:09,939
Why did you have a white Bronco, Daddy?

455
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,067
I was driving my innocent friend O.J.

456
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:14,611
and his ex-wife's head down to Mexico.

457
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:16,404
<i>We eloped at Fenway Park,</i>

458
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,531
<i>which I paid 50 grand to rent out</i>

459
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,660
<i>the day before the dot-com bubble burst.</i>

460
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:25,081
I now pronounce this
the last straight marriage.

461
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,832
<i>And I think</i>

462
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,209
<i>I got swindled on the Fenway deal</i>

463
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,877
<i>because there was a game that night.</i>

464
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,254
<i>It's a hit!</i>

465
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,383
<i>No! That would have been
the game-winning run!</i>

466
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,343
<i>The Red Sox lose.</i>

467
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,261
Boo!

468
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,971
<i>I was having serious regrets</i>

469
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,599
<i>about my decision, but was
already pregnant with Meg,</i>

470
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,434
<i>so there was no backing out.</i>

471
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,811
Boo!

472
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,774
This bee's chasing me!
Somebody call Ace Ventura!

473
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,945
Ow!

474
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,910
<i>Aw.</i>

475
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,585
Wow, Mom and Dad. I feel like
I learned so much tonight.

476
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:15,505
And not just about you guys,
but also about the '90s.

477
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:18,299
Oh, there's a lot more to learn
about the '90, Meg.

478
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,009
Like, for instance, are you familiar

479
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,761
with a band called "Counting Crows"?

480
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,264
I think I might have heard them
in a Starbucks.

481
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:25,849
Yes, you have.

482
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,935
Anyway, their lead singer is
this thing called Adam Duritz.

483
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,646
He looks like if Marc Maron
had sex with a scarecrow

484
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,982
and gave birth to a baby made of hemp.

485
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,317
I always thought
he looked like the Cowardly Lion

486
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:39,195
in a suburban white high school
production of<i> The Wiz.</i>

487
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,239
- That's not what that is?
- No, Chris.

488
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,949
But actually, the joke's on us,

489
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,493
because this Sideshow Bob burnout slept

490
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,829
with a primo roster of '90s tail.

491
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,664
- Jennifer Aniston.
- No.

492
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,374
- Courteney Cox.
- What?!

493
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,418
- Winona Ryder.
- That guy?!

494
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,129
Christina Applegate,
Lara Flynn Boyle, Emmy Rossum.

495
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,506
Ooh, this is just making me angry.

496
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,969
- Mary-Louise Parker.
- I hear she's difficult.
