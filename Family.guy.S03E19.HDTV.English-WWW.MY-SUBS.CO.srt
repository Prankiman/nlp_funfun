"It seems today that all you see

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,840
"Is violence in movies and sex on TV

00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,520

good old-fashioned values

"He's a family guy

00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,920
Some of this stuff... you wonder
who would need it in bulk.

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,520
I mean, like watermelons.

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,320
Touché, CostMart.

13
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,520
- Brian, will you watch Stewie?
- Sure.

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,920
Please keep a close eye on him.
Remember what happened last time.

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,640
- Stewie, get down before you hurt yourself.
- Shut up! You're not my mother!

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,320
- Good God! Are you all right?
- Fine. Why do you ask?

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:04,120
Mmm, delicious. I will seriously
consider purchasing this product.

18
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,120
Oh, what have we here? May I partake?

19
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,240
Mmm.

20
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,920
Sausage-san.
Plan to buy for samurai buddies.

21
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,120
You don't have to keep moving to the back.
You can have as many as you want.

22
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,720
What are you talking about?

23
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,840
- Can I have more sausage?
- Yeah, me too?

24
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,120
They got a great deal on pianos if you buy
a four-pack. Meg, help me get these down.

25
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,240
- Lois?
- Oh, my gosh.

26
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,320
I don't believe this.

27
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,040
Ross Fishman, is that really you? I haven't
seen you since college. How are you?

28
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,040
Great. Wow, Lois! You haven't aged a bit.

29
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,040
Oh. Thank you.

30
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,440
This 12-pack of fungicide
is for my daughter Meg.

31
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,040
Help me.

32
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,040
- He's funny.
- Is it 1981?

33
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,840
Ah, yes, there you are!

34
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,840
You people at the Industrial Adhesives
Corporation know how to make a tasty glue.

35
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,840
Well, then, let the banquet begin.

36
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,920
- What are you doing? Don't eat that.
- For God's sake, don't be such a nerd.

37
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,040
I'm keeping an eye on you.
If Lois sees this, she'll kill me.

38
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,120
- You can let go of my hand now.
- You can let go of mine.

39
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,520
- Oh...
- Crap.

40
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,640
I can't tell you how wonderful
it's been to see you.

41
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,640
It's a crime that it's been so long.
We were so close.

42
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,120
We could get together for coffee, catch up.

43
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,640
Well... I don't know, Ross. I'm married now.

44
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,920
So am I. Does that mean we're not allowed
to stay in touch with old friends?

45
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,440
Tell you what. If you change
your mind, here's my card.

46
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,640
Look, Dad. They have 12-packs of kidneys!

47
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,440
You got to buy the cooler, too.
That's how they get you.

48
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,720
- OK, thanks.
- Well?

49
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,120
The good news is they make
a solvent that'll get us unstuck.

50
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,320
But it takes two weeks for delivery.

51
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,440
We're stuck like this for a bloody fortnight?!

52
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,240
- You cannot tell Lois about this.
- What if I do?

53
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:18,040
- I have pictures of you in her wedding dress.
- You said there was no film in that camera!

54
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,240
- Stewie, it's time to change your diaper.
- Mind if I watch?

55
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,240
And I'm ashamed of myself
that I let Peter's jealousy prevent me

56
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,640
from rekindling an old friendship
just because it was with a man.

57
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,320
Peter's not very understanding
when it comes to you and other men.

58
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,640
Like that time at the movies?

59
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,520
I... I... this is... My, this is terribly awkward.

60
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,320
But I... I wanted to tell you something.

61
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,920
But I... I seem to be
so charmingly befuddled.

62
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,920
- Ah, that Hugh Grant is so handsome.
- Oh, is that how it is?

63
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,640
Come here, you home-wrecking bastard!

64
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,840
Don't do it, Dad! He's bigger than you!

65
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,040
And when you went to that concert?

66
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,440
Thank you. Thank you very much.
This next one is for all the ladies out there.

67
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,320
Then there was last Saturday night.

68
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,320
- Oh, look at that handsome man.
- You son of a bitch!

69
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,320
I can't let Peter's irrational
emotions run my life!

70
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,640
I'm gonna call Ross and see
if it's not too late for his offer.

71
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,720
- Would you mind finishing up?
- Sure.

72
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,640
Yes, do you like cleaning my doody, Brian?

73
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:32,920
Say it. Say "I like cleaning your doody,
Stewie. " Ha! Don't forget the taint.

74
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,640
TC, fly the chopper around the island.
I'll talk to the women.

75
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,440
- Tattoo here will look out for the kidnappers.
- Higgins.

76
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,520
We'll need security to unlock
the gate for me. OK, Tattoo?

77
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,640
- It's Higgins.
- What?

78
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,640
The name is Higgins.

79
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,720
- What's your name?
- Tattoo.

80
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,520
Oh, Peter. I'm just...
gonna go out for a few hours.

81
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,520
So, I... I'll return in... a few hours.

82
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,040
Yeah, I'll do it when this is over.

83
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,720
Hey, Lois, can you grab me a beer?

84
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,720
- Lois?
- Dad, I think she went out.

85
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,720
- Then you be Lois.
- OK.

86
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,520
Lois, can you grab me a beer?
Oh, my God! You've really let yourself go!

87
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,520
Maybe if you bought me
nice clothes once in a while!

88
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,120
Peter Griffin, we know you're in there!
Come out with your hands up!

89
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,640
Fooled ya!

90
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,240
You sure did. What the hell is this?

91
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,040
The new police surveillance van.
We're going on a beer run. Wanna join us?

92
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,520
I quit drinking. I might be an alcoholic.

93
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,040
- What?
- Oh, my God!

94
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,840
Fooled ya! Come on. Let's go drink
till we can't feel feelings any more.

95
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,840
This van has the latest in
law-enforcement technology. Watch.

96
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,920
Suspect! Suspect!
You have the right to remain silent!

97
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,520
Sweet.

98
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,520
- Let me try.
- Cleveland, don't!

99
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,920
Minority suspect! Minority suspect!
Danger, he's got a gun!

100
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,520
Oh! Ow! Ow! Oh! Ow! Oh! Ow!

101
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,240
Hey, Joe! The van's gone!

102
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,840
It's got a cloaking device that
disguises it as two homeless guys

103
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,240
fighting over a wedge of cheese.

104
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,120
Peter, isn't that Lois
over there in that diner?

105
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,640
- Why would Lois be there? I already ate.
- Take a look.

106
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,840
Oh, my God! That is Lois!
Why the hell would she...

107
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,520
Whoa. I can see your skin cells.

108
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,720
I saw you on Scientific American.
You looked great.

109
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,120
- Please! Where my eyes are half-closed?
- God, just take the damn compliment!

110
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,640
- What is Lois doing with another man?
- Is it possible she's a whore?

111
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,720
Just on weekends? To help pay for
her mom's dialysis? As in my fantasy?

112
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,040
Let's start over. Hi, I'm Quagmire.

113
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,240
- I wish I knew what she was saying.
- I think I can help.

114
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,720
Oh, your wife and children are beautiful. It's
so good to catch up, Ross. I'm glad I called.

115
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,920
I'm glad you did, too.
Was your husband OK with you coming?

116
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,320
Uh... Yes, he turned out
to be just fine with it.

117
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,720
All right. Let's see what we can pick up.

118
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,640
Please don't spit in my eggs.
Please don't spit in my eggs.

119
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,240
Thank you for the eggs!
I hope he didn't spit in my eggs.

120
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,640
Doug, I spit in that guy's eggs.

121
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,840
Our armies are ready.
We will leave the sewers

122
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,440
and strike back at the humans
in the overworld.

123
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,720
I'm glad we both found someone
to make us happy.

124
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,720
I enjoy being with you, Ross.
I'm having a great time.

125
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,120
Oh, my God! That's who that is.
Ross Fishman, Lois's old boyfriend.

126
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,520
- We're losing them.
- I gotta hear more.

127
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,920
The power's not supposed to go that high!

128
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,440
Damn itch. I wonder who gave it to me.

129
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,640
Probably that skank who needed a ride.
Last time I do somebody a favour.

130
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,720
Oh, God! They must have heard me!
Oh, God! I can hear me!

131
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,520
Ugh! What the hell
do you think you're doing?!

132
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,920
I'm cleaning myself.

133
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,720
You were clean 15 minutes ago.
Now you're just on vacation.

134
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,720
So, Lois is seeing old boyfriends, huh?
Well, two can play at that game.

135
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,520
I just gotta find my little black book.

136
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,440
Ah, here it is.

137
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,120
- Brenda?
- Peter! Oh, my God. It's been 25 years!

138
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,520
Yeah. So, I guess you're married now, huh?

139
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,840
Yeah.

140
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,520
Hey, Ricky, you were right! I was pregnant!

141
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,440
Hey, what's up, Pete? Long time no see.

142
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,720
Patty, the years have been great to you.

143
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,720
- I owe that to my better half.
- Who is it, sir?

144
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,840
- Angie?
- Peter? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Come in!

145
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,040
Uh... what is all this stuff?

146
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,920
Peter, I have been waiting
for this moment for 25 years!

147
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,320
I haven't washed my hand
since you touched it.

148
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
Oh, my God! That's disgusting!

149
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,320
And look! Look! I left the toilet just
as it was the night we went to the prom.

150
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,720
It's the little piece of you
that's kept your memory alive.

151
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,320
But now I have you back.

152
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,520
Oh, well. At least I still have you.

153
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,640
You hungry?

154
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,240
Oh, crap.

155
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,520
Let me handle this.

156
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,920
You were going 65, fella. That's ten miles
over the... Why are you holding his hand?

157
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,920
- We met on the Internet.
- Shut up!

158
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,720
He lured me to the park with promises
of candy and funny stories.

159
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,120
- Ever hear of super industrial adhesive?
- Actually, yes, we have.

160
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,920
- Dad, why do you keep looking at the door?
- Oh, Meg. You and your drugs.

161
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,440
I wonder who that could be.

162
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,320
- Peter Gifford?
- My God! Dora, my old girlfriend.

163
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,720
What a surprise that you would look me up!
You always thought I was so handsome.

164
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,840
Peter, can I see you in the other room?

165
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,640
- Yeah, go. Say it.
- Should I?

166
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,320
- I can't.
- Just say it.

167
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,440
How far can you get this banana...
I can't say it. She's looking right at me.

168
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,440
What the hell is this about?

169
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,320
- It's about you and Ross Fishman!
- What?!

170
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,120
I saw you and him breaking
the Fifth Commandment!

171
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,720
Congress passes these things for a reason!

172
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,240
That's it! You're suffocating me
with your jealousy. I can't take it any more.

173
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,720
I'm calling a marriage counsellor.
I can't even have coffee with a friend!

174
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,040
- What is your problem?!
- You want to know what my problem is?

175
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,920
- I love too much!
- What are you talking about?

176
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,920
- Don't you see? We're alive!
- You're scaring me.

177
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:25,120
Good! Embrace the fear! Dance with me,
Lois. Dance the dance of life!

178
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,040
Maybe you should call that counsellor.

179
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,640
Mr and Mrs Griffin,
I've reviewed your situation.

180
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,440
- I have a suggestion.
- We'll do whatever it takes.

181
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,320
I'd like to put video cameras
in every room of your house

182
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,920
so I can observe your
uncensored behaviour.

183
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,120
Just like that show Big Brother.
Except somebody'll be watching.

184
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,720
I've looked through the footage.

185
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,720
I've compiled an accurate cross section
of your home life. Here are the results.

186
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,720
- Peter, give Chris a spanking.
- OK.

187
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,840
Chris, I'm watching the game.
You know what to do.

188
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,640
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

189
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,840
This hurts me more than it hurts you. Ow!

190
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,920
"Dear Diary, Kevin is so hot. "

191
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,120
"Today he was out
in the yard raking leaves. "

192
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,120
"God, I wish he'd throw me
into that pile of leaves. "

193
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,720
Hey, what's everybody...
Oh, my God! My diary! I hate you all!

194
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,920
Keep going.

195
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,840
No. It's step, hip, step, pivot.
Are you trying to piss off the volcano?

196
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,440
Get my back, would you?

197
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,440
Oh, that's it. Ooh, that feels good.

198
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,840
- Can you give me a hand with this jar?
- Oh, for heaven's sake, Peter.

199
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,640
Gotcha.

200
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,640
To be honest, I've never seen
such dysfunction.

201
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,720
Mr and Mrs Griffin, what I'm about
to suggest may seem unorthodox.

202
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,640
I recommend a trial separation, during which
time I advise that you date other people.

203
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,440
I believe this will help you
gather perspective.

204
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,520
- Date other people?!
- Oh, my God!

205
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,520
I realise this is upsetting.
That's why I've invited Howie Mandel

206
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,120
to lighten the mood by blowing up
a surgical glove with his nose.

207
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,040
This feels really weird, Lois.

208
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,240
I know. But maybe the doctor's right.
This time apart could be good for us.

209
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,920
I don't know. Splitting up didn't work
too well for Pacman and his wife.

210
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,320
- Forget about her.
- You're too good for her anyway.

211
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,240
- Cheer up, man.
- Hey, you want to eat us? Huh?

212
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,120
- We're turning blue!
- I've got nowhere to run.

213
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,720
He's gonna get us!

214
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,440
- Oh.
- Oh.

215
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,320
He's not budging.
Come on. Let's go to Qbert's.

216
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,440
- I appreciate you putting me up, Cleveland.
- Our house is your house, Peter.

217
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,320
I'd sit here and chat, but I need
to get back upstairs to Loretta

218
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,720
because it's our anniversary
and the getting's good.

219
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:18,240
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

220
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,040
When is it gonna be my turn?
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

221
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,840
You are welcome to stay
as long as you like.

222
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,240
Thanks, Muriel. So, what do you guys
do for fun around here?

223
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,840
We like to watch old movies
while listening to "Hotel California"

224
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,320
to see if it syncs up in a significant way.

225
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,720
And so far, no. Nothing has.

226
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,720
- Hello?
- Is Peter there?

227
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,440
Oh, hi, Quagmire. No, Peter's not home.

228
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,440
We're... we're having
some minor marital problems.

229
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:54,440
Our therapist has advised us
to date other people.

230
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,720
- Hey, Lois, you want to go out?
- What? I don't know, Glen.

231
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,240
Peter and I just separated.
I feel like I need more time.

232
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,040
- How about now?
- We are supposed to see other people.

233
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,240
I guess it's better to go out
with you than some sex pervert.

234
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,640
I'm in! Giggetty-gaggety-gaggety-goo!

235
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,240
Oh. God blast it!
Will you hold it for five seconds?!

236
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,840
OK.

237
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,440
So, Mr Griffin, how does it feel
to be a bachelor on the prowl again?

238
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,920
It's not as great as you'd think. I don't have
the same way with women that I used to.

239
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,040
That was nice. That was nice.

240
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,440
I had a great time with you today,
beautiful stranger. What's your sign?

241
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,120
Gross. I still think
you're neat, though.

242
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,920
You should try a video dating service.
That's how Muriel and I met.

243
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,120
Let me show you Mort's tape.
He was so charming.

244
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,640
Agh! Oh, my eyes! Could you please
turn down that very bright light?

245
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,440
It's burning my retinas.

246
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,640
Ladies, I'm a very desperate man.

247
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,840
My name is Mort and I live with my mother.
And I have very low standards.

248
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,440
Oh, God!
There's blood in my mucus!

249
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,120
Agh! What the hell is wrong with you?!

250
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,840
Hey, there's the mail! Oh, finally.

251
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,440
It takes an hour for the solvent to take effect.

252
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:35,440
What takes an hour? We could watch
Rita Rudner do five minutes of stand-up.

253
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,520
Ba-zing.

254
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,240
We're gonna have a swell time tonight, Lois.

255
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,640
Thank you for being such a good friend
and looking after me.

256
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,640
No problem. It's chilly out,
so I brought you a jacket.

257
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,440
- Oh. No, thanks. I'll be fine.
- Please?

258
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:58,320
Muriel and I feel that you need to follow
your therapist's advice and start dating.

259
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,720
- Jeez, Mort. I don't know if I'm ready.
- Come on, stud.

260
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,320
We've set it up for you
to go out with our niece.

261
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,040
Honey! Come on out here
and meet Peter Griffin.

262
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,440
This is our niece, Jennifer Love Hewitt.

263
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,240
- Nice to meet you.
- All right, I'm getting up.

264
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:17,920
Hi. Peter Griffin. We can go anywhere except
the disco. They don't let me in any more.

265
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,720
Ow! Crafty Mexicans and your glass candy.

266
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,520
- What's going on?
- There's a girl in that well.

267
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,840
- Oh, my God!
- Nobody has arms long enough to reach her.

268
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,240
Except that guy. But he's helping
that woman tickle a midget.

269
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,240
Tee-hee. Stop it. Tee-hee.

270
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,720
Oh, God, you want to rescue her, don't you?

271
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,040
It's times like this I wish they'd
used me for stem-cell research.

272
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,520
Help me!

273
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,320
It rubs the lotion on its skin,
or else it gets the hose again. Ha!

274
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,240
All right, I'm gonna lower you in.

275
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,720
I just noticed. How often do you see
a 17th-century well in this day and age?

276
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,640
- Hurry up. The glue's wearing off!
- All right, all right!

277
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,520
We're not stuck together any more.

278
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,920
- Thank God!
- You said it.

279
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,520
- Want to hold hands on the walk home?
- Sure.

280
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,040
Susie! Thank God you're all right!

281
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,640
Wait a minute. This isn't my little girl.

282
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,120
Hey, that was my wife!

283
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,240
- Tee-hee!
- Tee-hee!

284
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,640
- I Know What You Did Last Summer?
- Never heard of it.

285
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,640
- The Devil and Daniel Webster?
- Nope.

286
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,440
- Party of Five?
- Was that a porno?

287
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,240
Sometimes you gotta do a lot of crap
before they put you in anything decent.

288
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,840
The food here is fantastic.
This is where I took Lois on our first date.

289
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,240
You ordered a pie for an appetiser?

290
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,520
I'll go to the john and fire one out in five
minutes. That should make room for dinner.

291
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,920
- Here's your table, Mr Quagmire.
- Thanks. How about drinks?

292
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,320
Martini for you and the usual
roofie colada for your date?

293
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,840
No, no, no. I wouldn't bring...
A glass of wine.

294
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,320
Oh, my God! That's Jennifer Love Hewitt!

295
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,440
Wow! I wonder who she's here with.
She could date any man she wanted to.

296
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,320
There. Made lots of room.

297
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,520
That sign in the bathroom about washing
your hands, that's for the staff, right?

298
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,640
- Technically, yes.
- That's what I thought. Great.

299
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,640
Oh, man! These all look good,
every one of 'em.

300
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,320
- You want some bread?
- No!

301
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,720
Peter, is that you?

302
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,040
Peter?! Oh, no! I can't let him see me!

303
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,840
It's OK, Quagmire. We're just doing
what the therapist said to do.

304
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,240
Peter, I think it's great you're out
with Jennifer Love Hewitt.

305
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,640
Hi. I loved you in Heartbreakers.

306
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,920
You be on your best behaviour.

307
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,440
- Here you go, sweetheart. Open up.
- No!

308
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,240
There you go. Isn't this romantic?

309
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:02,040
That's it! You have got to be the most vile,
disgusting human being I've ever met!

310
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:06,240
And I have never been
more turned-on in my life.

311
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,240
Hold on, toots!
I don't care what our therapist says.

312
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,320
I won't stand by and watch my husband
lock lips with another woman! Beat it!

313
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,640
- What's your problem, grandma?
- You are!

314
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,120
And I only saw Heartbreakers on a plane!

315
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,240
And the flight was delayed,
so the headphones were free!

316
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,320
Wow. That was pretty cool, Lois.

317
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,440
I guess I finally understand...

318
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,840
You better run, you little bitch!

319
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,440
I guess I finally understand
how you can get so jealous sometimes.

320
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,640
Seeing her kiss you like that
just made me crazy.

321
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,840
I guess we're gonna have to learn
to control our jealousy... together.

322
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,040
Together.

323
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,920
Ma'am, you dropped your napkin.

324
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,440
Here's your drink, sir.

325
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,440
We'll work on it later. I love you, Lois.

326
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,240
I love you too, Peter.

327
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,920
What a couple of freaks.
God, I need a drink.

328
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,440
Waiter! Martini and a roofie colada.

329
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,840
