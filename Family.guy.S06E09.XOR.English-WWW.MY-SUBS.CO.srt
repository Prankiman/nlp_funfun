1
00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:39,518
And now back to G.I. Jose.

2
00:00:41,104 --> 00:00:43,339
Hey, guys, let's go swim
in the old quarry.

3
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,140
Yeah!

4
00:00:44,141 --> 00:00:45,423
Wait a minute, kids.

5
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:47,213
Don't go swimming
in that quarry.

6
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,342
It's dangerous.

7
00:00:48,437 --> 00:00:50,885
Wow, thanks, G.I. Jose.

8
00:00:50,886 --> 00:00:52,309
Hey, you guys want to buy

9
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:55,584
some gum or cotton candy
or a stuffed animal?

10
00:00:55,587 --> 00:00:57,370
How about an inflatable
mallet, huh?

11
00:00:57,374 --> 00:00:58,499
This is fun.

12
00:00:58,499 --> 00:01:00,374
You can hit your friend
on the head with it.

13
00:01:00,376 --> 00:01:02,561
But don't hit him on
the head with it.

14
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:03,612
Yeah, thanks.

15
00:01:03,615 --> 00:01:05,590
I don't really need
any of that stuff.

16
00:01:05,606 --> 00:01:07,922
You got any dents
you need hammered out?

17
00:01:07,945 --> 00:01:10,730
G.I. Jose

18
00:01:13,996 --> 00:01:15,192
Good evening,
I'm Tom Tucker.

19
00:01:15,197 --> 00:01:17,911
Coming up, important traffic
news that can't help you

20
00:01:17,915 --> 00:01:19,772
because you're some place
where a TV is.

21
00:01:19,778 --> 00:01:21,300
But first,
get ready, Quahog,

22
00:01:21,308 --> 00:01:23,972
because Barry Manilow will
be performing this weekend

23
00:01:23,975 --> 00:01:25,982
at the Quahog Performing Arts Center.

24
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:27,640
Barry Manilow.

25
00:01:27,746 --> 00:01:28,471
What a joke.

26
00:01:28,477 --> 00:01:29,360
So stupid.

27
00:01:29,546 --> 00:01:30,773
And boring as hell.

28
00:01:30,777 --> 00:01:31,691
Yeah, no kidding.

29
00:01:31,707 --> 00:01:33,562
You couldn't pay me
to go to that thing.

30
00:01:33,578 --> 00:01:34,691
Hey, you know what
we should do?

31
00:01:34,697 --> 00:01:36,352
We should go just as a goof.

32
00:01:36,356 --> 00:01:37,303
That'd be hilarious.

33
00:01:37,317 --> 00:01:39,092
Yeah, just look at
all the idiots.

34
00:01:39,106 --> 00:01:41,273
All the dumb ass
Manilow fans.

35
00:01:41,276 --> 00:01:41,953
Yeah.

36
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:44,651
I mean, he's got,
like, one good song.

37
00:01:44,658 --> 00:01:46,451
Yeah, I mean, "Mandy"
is not terrible.

38
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:47,763
Yeah, the
opening's okay.

39
00:01:47,895 --> 00:01:50,393
And I guess you can't
hate "Copacabana."

40
00:01:50,396 --> 00:01:51,681
Yeah, if you're
in the right mood.

41
00:01:51,687 --> 00:01:53,082
"Daybreak"
is a good song.

42
00:01:53,135 --> 00:01:53,822
Oh, yeah.

43
00:01:53,937 --> 00:01:55,000
That's a good song.

44
00:01:55,005 --> 00:01:56,641
And I like
"Weekend in New England.

45
00:01:56,645 --> 00:01:57,722
Yeah, that's a good one.

46
00:01:57,727 --> 00:01:58,760
"Looks Like We Made It."

47
00:01:58,777 --> 00:01:59,463
Yeah, it's not bad.

48
00:01:59,466 --> 00:02:00,123
Right?

49
00:02:00,777 --> 00:02:02,070
I love
Barry Manilow.

50
00:02:02,275 --> 00:02:03,582
Oh, my God, he's the best!

51
00:02:03,585 --> 00:02:04,941
I have everything
he's ever recorded!

52
00:02:04,945 --> 00:02:05,651
Me, too!

53
00:02:05,728 --> 00:02:06,651
In my car!

54
00:02:06,656 --> 00:02:08,040
We have to go
to that concert.

55
00:02:08,046 --> 00:02:09,433
We are going
to that concert.

56
00:02:09,805 --> 00:02:12,721
And I'm...

57
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:17,352
Ready to take a chance again

58
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:22,861
Ready to put
my love on the line

59
00:02:22,867 --> 00:02:27,430
With you
Been living with nothing

60
00:02:27,435 --> 00:02:29,551
to show for it

61
00:02:30,036 --> 00:02:34,781
You get what you get
when you go for it

62
00:02:34,786 --> 00:02:36,942
And I'm ready to take

63
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:42,171
A chance again with you

64
00:02:49,207 --> 00:02:51,181
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

65
00:02:51,186 --> 00:02:52,121
You're welcome.

66
00:02:52,128 --> 00:02:53,060
For this next song,

67
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:55,392
I'm gonna need some help
from a member of the audience.

68
00:02:55,395 --> 00:02:57,373
So, let's see, um...

69
00:02:57,387 --> 00:02:58,191

70
00:02:58,196 --> 00:02:59,001
Claire

71
00:02:59,006 --> 00:03:00,711
.Uh... no, I don't like that.

72
00:03:00,716 --> 00:03:01,941
Uh, what's yours?

73
00:03:01,945 --> 00:03:02,762
Harriet.

74
00:03:03,137 --> 00:03:04,661

Wow, that's exotic.

79
00:03:09,026 --> 00:03:11,642
All right, why don't you come upand join me on the stage?

80
00:03:12,115 --> 00:03:14,112
Go, go, go, go, go!Oh, my God!

00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,242
I hate you somuch rig now!

82
00:03:16,615 --> 00:03:20,081
The night goes into morning

83
00:03:20,087 --> 00:03:22,650
Just another day

84
00:03:23,806 --> 00:03:27,210
Happy people pass my way

85
00:03:28,316 --> 00:03:32,642
Looking in their eyesI see a memory

86
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:37,463
I never realizedhow happy you made me

87
00:03:37,488 --> 00:03:39,560
Oh, Quagmire Oh...!

88

Well, you came and you gavewithout taking

89
00:03:43,345 --> 00:03:44,573
I would never take from you,Barry.

90
00:03:44,578 --> 00:03:46,311
But I sent you away

91
00:03:46,316 --> 00:03:48,573
Oh, Quagmire

92
00:03:48,588 --> 00:03:53,192
You kissed me and stopped mefrom shaking

93
00:03:53,796 --> 00:03:55,870
And I need you today

94
00:03:55,877 --> 00:03:58,101
Oh, Quagmire.

95
00:03:58,637 --> 00:04:00,200
God, he's so talented.

96
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,760
You know he wrote all thoseKentucky Fried Chicken jingles.

97
00:04:02,765 --> 00:04:03,840
I don't care for them.

98
00:04:03,846 --> 00:04:06,713
Not after what happenedto Foghorn Leghorn.

99
00:04:06,727 --> 00:04:10,321
I say, I sayson, whatdo we got brewing in here?

100
00:04:10,398 --> 00:04:12,353

00:04:12,358 --> 00:04:14,372
of 11 herbsand spice... agh!

102
00:04:16,117 --> 00:04:16,973

00:05:00,568 --> 00:05:03,832
Aw, crap, I must've dropped itat the Barry Manilow concert.

"I dropped itat the concert."

129
00:05:11,298 --> 00:05:12,413
"The hooker took it."

130
00:05:12,417 --> 00:05:13,602
"It's withmy other family."

131
00:05:13,607 --> 00:05:14,631
That one was true.

132
00:05:14,635 --> 00:05:15,743

I'm so gladyou're home.

140
00:05:37,815 --> 00:05:40,633
While you were away,I tried to do the laundry.

141
00:05:40,638 --> 00:05:42,033
Your favorite shirt.

142

So, Peter, any luckfinding your wallet?

144
00:05:52,804 --> 00:05:54,639
No, and it's getting to bea pain in the ass.

145
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,684
I got no money.

146
00:05:55,686 --> 00:05:58,001
I couldn't even afford to getmy hair cut yesterday.

147
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:00,980
That'll befive dollars.

148
00:06:01,005 --> 00:06:02,313
Sorry, lost my wallet.

149
00:06:02,316 --> 00:06:03,713
But I alreadycut your hair.

150
00:06:03,975 --> 00:06:06,080
Yeah, well, guess there'snothing you can do about it now.

151
00:06:06,808 --> 00:06:08,433
That son of a bitch.

152
00:06:08,988 --> 00:06:10,390
And I can't rent movies anymore.

153
00:06:10,975 --> 00:06:13,683
Uh, yes, I'd like to rentthis copy of Garden State.

154
00:06:13,688 --> 00:06:15,443
Okay, I'll just needa picture ID.

155
00:06:15,446 --> 00:06:17,000
Oh, I don't have one.

156
00:06:17,006 --> 00:06:18,110
I'll rentit then.

157
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:30,282
It could've been me.

158
00:06:34,376 --> 00:06:38,200
Oh, my God, Peter,
your visa bill is $16,000!

159
00:06:38,338 --> 00:06:40,563
Somebody's been usingyour credit card.

160
00:06:40,628 --> 00:06:42,692
Didn't you cancel itwhen you lost your wallet?

161
00:06:42,697 --> 00:06:43,891
I hear whatyou're saying, Lois,

162
00:06:43,906 --> 00:06:45,410
but unlike my credit card,

163
00:06:45,417 --> 00:06:48,272
I'm carrying a very lowrate of interest.

164
00:06:49,396 --> 00:06:50,230
Let me see that.

165
00:06:50,487 --> 00:06:52,891
A big screen TV,a massage chair

Peter, someone has obviouslystolen your credit card.

168
00:06:57,738 --> 00:06:58,950
Well, here's thegood news, Brian.

169
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,893
Whoever the thief is,he's spending less
than my wife.

170
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:03,642
Wait, look at this.

171
00:07:03,648 --> 00:07:06,202
He eats at House of Chungevery day.

172
00:07:06,258 --> 00:07:07,503
House of Chung, huh?

173
00:07:07,538 --> 00:07:08,651
Come on, let's go, Brian.

174
00:07:13,317 --> 00:07:14,310
The place is packed.

175
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:16,180
How are we gonna figure outwho has your credit card?

176
00:07:16,328 --> 00:07:17,922
I got it, Brian.Smell my ass.

177
00:07:17,928 --> 00:07:19,202
What?Smell my ass.

178
00:07:19,337 --> 00:07:20,623
It's where I keep my wallet.

179
00:07:20,848 --> 00:07:22,750
Get the scent and then findthe guy that smells like me.

180
00:07:22,758 --> 00:07:23,722
Peter, that'sridiculous.

181
00:07:23,727 --> 00:07:24,991
Come on, boy,get the scent.

182
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,251
Cut it out!Get a good sniff.

183
00:07:26,295 --> 00:07:27,193
That's disgusting.

184
00:07:27,236 --> 00:07:28,723
You're an idiot,you know that?

185
00:07:28,825 --> 00:07:29,642
Wait a minute.

186
00:07:32,005 --> 00:07:32,980
Your wallet's

187
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,272
Oh, my God, it's you!

188
00:07:38,406 --> 00:07:39,600
James Woods.

189
00:07:42,097 --> 00:07:43,160
Hello, Peter.

190
00:07:43,316 --> 00:07:44,592
I've been expecting you.

191
00:07:44,615 --> 00:07:46,950
You stole my credit card,you son of a bitch.

192
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,113
What did I ever do to you?

193
00:07:48,116 --> 00:07:49,720
That's a goodquestion, Peter.

194
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:51,470
What did you everdo to me, hmm?

195
00:07:51,487 --> 00:07:54,070
What did you everdo to James Woods?

196
00:07:54,115 --> 00:07:55,861
Well, I locked youin a wooden crate

197
00:07:55,865 --> 00:07:57,091
and forgot to putan air hole in it.

198
00:07:57,098 --> 00:07:58,421
Forgot to putan air hole in it.

199
00:07:58,467 --> 00:07:59,871
Well, you kind ofhad it coming.

200
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,020
Look, Mr. Woods, just givePeter back his wallet.

201
00:08:02,035 --> 00:08:02,772
Oh, no, Brian.

202
00:08:02,777 --> 00:08:03,890
I'm justgetting started.

203
00:08:03,896 --> 00:08:05,943
Peter, youhumiliated me.

204
00:08:05,948 --> 00:08:07,830
You put methrough hell.

205
00:08:07,848 --> 00:08:10,291
And now you'regonna pay for it.

206
00:08:10,586 --> 00:08:11,911
So get ready...

207
00:08:12,687 --> 00:08:13,553
fatso.

208
00:08:18,816 --> 00:08:20,811
Lois, we found the guywho stole my wallet.

209
00:08:20,816 --> 00:08:22,101
You'll never guesswho it was.

210
00:08:22,108 --> 00:08:23,350
James Woods?

211
00:08:23,605 --> 00:08:24,753
Hello, stranger.

212
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:27,693
I don't recallinviting you into my home.

213
00:08:28,025 --> 00:08:30,540
Peter, he's been herefor four hours.

214
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:33,013
I told him to leave, but hekeeps saying he lives here.

215
00:08:33,018 --> 00:08:34,930
I say, this is moreuncomfortable

216
00:08:34,937 --> 00:08:37,283
than having James Bradyat a cocktail party.

217
00:08:37,418 --> 00:08:39,102
Right, so I gotmy hand gun

218
00:08:39,105 --> 00:08:42,273
and I'm just randomly firing itinto a crowd of people

219
00:08:42,275 --> 00:08:43,101
and then...

220
00:08:43,617 --> 00:08:44,700
And then what?

221
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:46,751
And nothing.Nothing.

222
00:08:46,756 --> 00:08:49,540
No, no,I'm anxious to hear
the conclusionof your story.

223
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:51,260
Ah, it's stupid.

224
00:08:51,826 --> 00:08:53,110
Stupid story.

225
00:08:53,716 --> 00:08:54,552
I'm calling the police.

226
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:55,791
That won't benecessary.

227
00:08:56,046 --> 00:08:57,143
I already did.

228
00:08:59,195 --> 00:09:01,853
Hello, Officer.Would you be kind enough

229
00:09:01,855 --> 00:09:03,492
to remove this trespasserfrom my home?

230
00:09:03,498 --> 00:09:05,110
What are you talking about?This is my house.

231
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,601
No, this house belongsto Peter Griffin.

232
00:09:07,605 --> 00:09:08,702
And that's me.

233
00:09:09,107 --> 00:09:10,750
Hmm... driver's license,

234
00:09:10,757 --> 00:09:14,141
Social Security card, passport,title to the house.

235
00:09:15,025 --> 00:09:16,961
This puts me in a tough spot.

236
00:09:16,965 --> 00:09:19,633
Joe, you can't possiblybelieve this.

237
00:09:19,668 --> 00:09:20,681
You know whoPeter is.

238
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,622
I know, Lois, but this manhas all the paperwork.

239
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:25,451
Oh, come on,this is identity theft.

240
00:09:25,456 --> 00:09:27,000
I hate to have to do this,

241
00:09:27,006 --> 00:09:28,880
but I'm afraid legallyI have no choice.

242
00:09:28,886 --> 00:09:30,963
I'm gonna have to ask youto leave, sir.

243
00:09:30,966 --> 00:09:31,802
Thanks, Joe.

244
00:09:31,887 --> 00:09:33,820
Clam later?We'll hoist a few?

245
00:09:33,825 --> 00:09:35,500
Sure, Peter.Joe!

246
00:09:36,395 --> 00:09:38,073
Hey, not so fast, pal.

247
00:09:38,076 --> 00:09:39,551
Those are my clothes.

248
00:09:39,695 --> 00:09:41,683
Oh, come on.You heard him, fella.

249
00:09:41,687 --> 00:09:44,422
Take 'em off.Right down to the poop sack.

250
00:09:45,268 --> 00:09:46,012
What?

251
00:09:46,248 --> 00:09:48,831
You don't all weara poop sack?

252
00:09:49,115 --> 00:09:50,341
Damn it, Bonnie!

253
00:09:50,388 --> 00:09:52,632
You lied to meabout the poop sack!

254
00:09:56,445 --> 00:09:57,561
Hello, family.

255
00:09:57,868 --> 00:09:59,013
Hello, honey.

256
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:01,140
Oh, schnoopy...

257
00:10:01,145 --> 00:10:02,650
Stop calling me that.

258
00:10:02,656 --> 00:10:03,783
I don't care whatthe law says,

259
00:10:03,786 --> 00:10:06,241
you're not Peter Griffin,you're James Woods.

260
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:07,852
I should've warned you,

261
00:10:07,856 --> 00:10:10,510
she can be a realbitch in the morning.

262
00:10:10,617 --> 00:10:12,040
Mom, this isreally weird.

263
00:10:12,147 --> 00:10:13,951
I want Dad back.I don't.

264
00:10:13,956 --> 00:10:16,230
Having a celebrity dadis a real thrill.

265
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:17,713
Not like the fake thrill

266
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,981
of running into yourex-girlfriend on the street.

267
00:10:20,616 --> 00:10:21,310
Rob?

268
00:10:21,395 --> 00:10:22,060
Hey!

269
00:10:22,115 --> 00:10:23,193
Hey!How are you?

270
00:10:23,197 --> 00:10:24,593
God, it's goodto see you.

271
00:10:24,647 --> 00:10:25,812
Good to see you, too.

272
00:10:25,855 --> 00:10:26,761
How's my dog?

273
00:10:26,766 --> 00:10:28,422
I'm sorry, your dog?

274
00:10:28,605 --> 00:10:30,832
Oh, I had togive him away.

275
00:10:30,835 --> 00:10:31,940
Gave him away!

276
00:10:32,026 --> 00:10:33,613
Well, Dave's allergic.Dave!

277
00:10:33,617 --> 00:10:35,440
All right,so there's a Dave.

278
00:10:35,447 --> 00:10:37,483
That's great.God, Dave sounds great.

279
00:10:37,495 --> 00:10:38,552
Yeah, he is.

280
00:10:38,556 --> 00:10:40,782
And his parentsare so sweet.

281
00:10:40,796 --> 00:10:43,013
Ah, met his parentsand they're sweet.

282
00:10:43,025 --> 00:10:44,692
Just older Daves, huh?

283
00:10:45,555 --> 00:10:47,602
What a family.God, it's good to see you.

284
00:10:48,085 --> 00:10:49,520
You won't get awaywith this, Woods.

285
00:10:49,526 --> 00:10:52,130
You know, you're not supposedto be in the house, Brian.

286
00:10:52,537 --> 00:10:54,130
You're more ofan outdoor dog.

287
00:10:54,137 --> 00:10:55,250
What the helldoes that mean?

288
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:56,980
This is so humiliating.

289
00:10:57,276 --> 00:10:58,801
For God's sake, I went to Brown

290
00:10:58,805 --> 00:11:01,392
and he's got me out heretied to a post like some kind...

291
00:11:04,026 --> 00:11:04,913
What the hell?

292
00:11:05,147 --> 00:11:08,062
This rope was a lot longer, andnow it's somehow gotten shorter.

293
00:11:08,507 --> 00:11:10,210
What sort of black magicis this?

294
00:11:10,277 --> 00:11:11,521
Brian, guess what?

295
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,313
I gave James Woodsyour novel to read,

296
00:11:13,315 --> 00:11:15,271
and you're not gonnabelieve this.

297
00:11:15,277 --> 00:11:16,113
Really?Did he like it?

298
00:11:16,206 --> 00:11:18,160
He wants to option itand make a movie!

299
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:18,702
Really?

300
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,283
No, he didn't really
respond to it.Oh.

301
00:11:20,287 --> 00:11:21,883
Listen, I needyour help.

302
00:11:21,885 --> 00:11:23,961
Run inside and get mea pair of scissors.

303
00:11:23,965 --> 00:11:26,323
Okay. I just hope Idon't get distracted.

304
00:11:26,476 --> 00:11:28,243
I am a baby, after all.

305
00:11:28,247 --> 00:11:31,851
Ooh, look, a brightlycolored dish towel!

306
00:11:32,207 --> 00:11:33,591
What did I comein here for?

307
00:11:34,065 --> 00:11:35,922
Brian, what are you doingtied to Meg's pole?

308
00:11:35,927 --> 00:11:37,221
James Woods did it.

309
00:11:37,437 --> 00:11:38,510
Hey, where'd youget the clothes?

310
00:11:38,515 --> 00:11:40,443
I always keep a spareat Quagmire's.

311
00:11:40,487 --> 00:11:41,422
I gotta tell you though,

312
00:11:41,427 --> 00:11:43,540
there was some weird stuffgoing on over there today.

313
00:11:43,955 --> 00:11:45,761
Hey, Quagmire can I...?Hang-Hang on a second.

314
00:11:45,775 --> 00:11:47,221
And that's why I contend

315
00:11:47,225 --> 00:11:49,202
that when Frost speaksof birch trees,

316
00:11:49,206 --> 00:11:51,473
he may very well betalking about himself.

317
00:11:51,475 --> 00:11:53,591
No, Glenn, that's not...Gloria, please.

318
00:11:53,596 --> 00:11:55,231
You wanna hearmy interpretation,

319
00:11:55,266 --> 00:11:56,772
or are you simply goingto tell me that I'm wrong?

320
00:11:56,775 --> 00:11:57,953
I'm simply pointing out...

321
00:11:58,036 --> 00:11:59,953
Yes. We know, you'revery well read.

322
00:11:59,966 --> 00:12:01,540
But this is poetrywe're talking about,

323
00:12:01,545 --> 00:12:05,062
and I think when it comes topoetry, you can't be wrong.

324
00:12:05,068 --> 00:12:05,940
What Peter?!

325
00:12:05,945 --> 00:12:07,700
Nothing, nothing.Sorry to interrupt.

326
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,802
The cedarsrepresent society.

327
00:12:09,806 --> 00:12:10,813
Sorryto interrupt.

328
00:12:11,047 --> 00:12:12,271
Listen, you gottaget out of here.

329
00:12:12,277 --> 00:12:14,232
If James Woods sees you,he's gonna call the cops.

330
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,002
I miss my family, Brian,
and I gotta see 'em.

331
00:12:17,596 --> 00:12:18,532
Well, well.

332
00:12:18,718 --> 00:12:20,820
A trespasser onmy property.

333
00:12:21,127 --> 00:12:23,091
That's the worst thing that'shappened to me since...

334
00:12:23,426 --> 00:12:24,593
You wouldn't!

335
00:12:24,728 --> 00:12:25,691
It's up to you, Peter.

336
00:12:25,698 --> 00:12:26,883
Either you leave now...

337
00:12:27,227 --> 00:12:29,411
or I set up one ofyour random flashbacks.

338
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,793
All right, all right,all right, okay.

339
00:12:30,807 --> 00:12:31,673
Peter, what do you care...?

340
00:12:31,675 --> 00:12:33,182
No, no, Brian,he's serious.

341
00:12:39,606 --> 00:12:40,901
I'll come back for you, Lois.

342
00:12:40,905 --> 00:12:43,722
And I'll set up all theflashbacks, just like I used to.

343
00:12:43,877 --> 00:12:45,413
Like the time I swallowedthat midget

344
00:12:45,418 --> 00:12:47,801
who played Mini-Me justso I could make you laugh.

345
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,472
You ready fordinner, Peter?

346
00:12:49,557 --> 00:12:51,460
Oh, yeah. In fact...

347
00:12:51,747 --> 00:12:55,271
my stomach has beentalking to me all day.

348
00:12:55,976 --> 00:13:00,663
I said my stomach hasbeen talking to me all day.

349
00:13:01,686 --> 00:13:03,273
Come on, say the line.

350
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:05,653
Oh, oh, there he is.

351
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,091
You know what, heslipped into my colon.

352
00:13:07,098 --> 00:13:09,241
Yeah, oh, damn it,he's smothered.

353
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,311
Uh, but-but, let... just,lemme just ask you this, Lois-

354
00:13:11,316 --> 00:13:14,420
if my stomach had said,"Hell yeah I'm hungry.

355
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:15,920
How 'bout some pork chops?"

356
00:13:15,926 --> 00:13:17,400
Would you havethought that was funny?

357
00:13:17,406 --> 00:13:18,651
Eh, not really.

358
00:13:18,988 --> 00:13:22,031
Ah. Well, then, this hasbeen an absolute misfire.

359
00:13:25,327 --> 00:13:27,172
Oh, this is just awful.

360
00:13:27,285 --> 00:13:29,730
James Woods isdestroying this family,

361
00:13:29,777 --> 00:13:31,670
and all just toget back at Peter.

362
00:13:31,755 --> 00:13:34,661
I know, he's doing allthe stuff Dad usually does.

363
00:13:34,668 --> 00:13:37,091
Right now he's upstairstalking to Meg.

364
00:13:37,225 --> 00:13:39,012
Now, Meg,you want to be thin

365
00:13:39,048 --> 00:13:40,662
like all theHollywood starlets, right?

366
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,262
Yeah, but I love to eat.

367
00:13:42,287 --> 00:13:44,541
Well, I've got a way thatyou can eat all you want

368
00:13:44,545 --> 00:13:46,922
and look likea Hollywood starlet.

369
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:50,663
Meg, let me introduceyou to Mr. Pukey.

370
00:13:50,725 --> 00:13:52,903
Hiya, Meg.Hi.

371
00:13:53,028 --> 00:13:54,023
Gosh, Mr. Pukey,

372
00:13:54,025 --> 00:13:56,761
you sure are good atmaking fat women hot.

373
00:13:56,767 --> 00:13:58,321
Wow, thanks.

374
00:13:58,518 --> 00:14:00,453
You think you could helpout my friend Meg here?

375
00:14:00,455 --> 00:14:03,872
Yeah, I think I couldgive her a... hand.

376
00:14:11,516 --> 00:14:12,910
Now close your eyes, Meg,

377
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:15,680
and let Mr. Pukeyhelp you out.

378
00:14:18,785 --> 00:14:21,631
When did ReeseWitherspoon get here?

379
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:29,160
Mr. Woods, how do I geta girl to like me?

380
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,611
Oh, Chris,I'm your father.

381
00:14:30,627 --> 00:14:31,632
Call me Dad.

382
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:35,173
Um, okay... Dad.

383
00:14:35,647 --> 00:14:37,753
How do I geta girl to like me?

384
00:14:37,757 --> 00:14:40,143
Well, there's a numberof ways, Chris.

385
00:14:40,148 --> 00:14:43,343
Uh, for example, uh,Kate Moss and I

386
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:45,083
had the same coke supplier,

387
00:14:45,086 --> 00:14:47,100
and he threwa punch social one day

388
00:14:47,117 --> 00:14:48,180
and we both happenedto be there.

389
00:14:48,228 --> 00:14:48,792
Next thing you know,

390
00:14:48,838 --> 00:14:51,763
we're both inthe back room, slam-bang.

391
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:52,743
I went bareback.

392
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:55,073
Wow, she soundslike assla act.

393
00:14:55,085 --> 00:14:57,112
Oh, not at all, Chris.No, not at all.

394
00:14:57,118 --> 00:14:59,072
Thanks, Dad.I feel better.

395
00:15:03,907 --> 00:15:05,400
Off I go on my merry way

396
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:07,911
Life is greatand I'm happy with my dad.

397
00:15:12,065 --> 00:15:13,483
What am I gonna do, Brian?

398
00:15:13,485 --> 00:15:16,243
James Woods has takenmy life and my family.

399
00:15:16,297 --> 00:15:18,033
I know, Peter,but identity theft

400
00:15:18,036 --> 00:15:19,560
is one of the hardestthings to fight.

401
00:15:19,567 --> 00:15:20,441
How you gonnahandle it?

402
00:15:20,446 --> 00:15:21,563
I don't know, Brian.

403
00:15:21,565 --> 00:15:23,963
All I know is,I sure do miss Lois.

404
00:15:24,717 --> 00:15:26,460
I gotta find a way to see her.

405
00:15:27,207 --> 00:15:30,022
And I think I just got an idea.

406
00:15:30,157 --> 00:15:32,703
A much better idea than whenI did magic for the blind.

407
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:35,983
Is this your card?

408
00:15:35,997 --> 00:15:36,751
I don't know.

409
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,673
Was it a red card?

410
00:15:38,777 --> 00:15:40,290
I don't knowwhat red is.

411
00:15:41,618 --> 00:15:43,053
Ta-da.

412
00:15:47,275 --> 00:15:48,420
You know what'samazing, Lois?

413
00:15:48,427 --> 00:15:52,452
A week from tomorrow,
it'll be 20 yearswe've been married.

414
00:15:52,456 --> 00:15:54,910
I married Peter Griffin,you lunatic!

415
00:15:54,915 --> 00:15:57,650
Uh, hello.I was there, see?

416
00:15:59,716 --> 00:16:01,673
Hi, everyone. Sorry I'm late.

417
00:16:01,676 --> 00:16:03,412
I brought friend homefor dinner.

418
00:16:04,935 --> 00:16:06,612
Mom... Dad...

419
00:16:06,618 --> 00:16:07,903
This is Scooter.

420
00:16:08,286 --> 00:16:10,480
Uh... hello, Scooter.

421
00:16:10,508 --> 00:16:11,381
Hey, everybody.

422
00:16:11,386 --> 00:16:12,920
Sure is swell of youto have me over.

423
00:16:12,926 --> 00:16:14,302
What's for eats, Mrs. G?

424
00:16:14,305 --> 00:16:16,893
Uh, meat loaf, Pe...I mean, Scooter.

425
00:16:16,897 --> 00:16:18,033
I hope you like it.

426
00:16:18,258 --> 00:16:20,533
Leapin' lizards,meat loaf is my favorite.

427
00:16:20,537 --> 00:16:22,410
Scooter, how come we'venever met you before?

428
00:16:22,418 --> 00:16:23,502
Shut up, Meg.

429
00:16:23,735 --> 00:16:24,701
You know, Scooter,

430
00:16:24,778 --> 00:16:27,203
we don't allow hatsat the dinner table.

431
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,470
Oh, my bad, Mr. G.Dad, no!

432
00:16:29,515 --> 00:16:31,230
Aha! I shouldhave known!

433
00:16:31,235 --> 00:16:32,862
Get out of myhouse right now,

434
00:16:33,185 --> 00:16:34,513
you son of a bitch.

435
00:16:55,067 --> 00:16:56,870
Well, that's it, Brian.

436
00:16:57,095 --> 00:16:58,290
I guess he's won.

437
00:16:58,647 --> 00:17:00,722
I guess he'sPeter Griffin now.

438
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:01,782
Wait a minute, Peter.

439
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:03,282
If he's Peter Griffin,

440
00:17:03,725 --> 00:17:06,071
then that means youcan be James Woods.

441
00:17:06,175 --> 00:17:08,033
That's a great idea, Brian.

442
00:17:08,148 --> 00:17:11,062
If I was a famous movie star,I wouldn't even want my family.

443
00:17:11,065 --> 00:17:12,142
No, no, Peter,I'm saying

444
00:17:12,148 --> 00:17:14,052
you can do to himwhat he did to you.

445
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:15,313
You can ruin him.

446
00:17:15,395 --> 00:17:18,340
I'll do it, I'll be James Woods.

447
00:17:20,048 --> 00:17:23,092
From this day forth,I am James Woods.

448
00:17:23,425 --> 00:17:26,310
And I'll stick to that story,even if nobody believes it.

449
00:17:26,315 --> 00:17:28,473
I'll tell you what nobodybelieves in: ghosts.

450
00:17:29,505 --> 00:17:31,611
Where did Robinson Crusoe go

451
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,073
With Fridayon Saturday night?

452
00:17:34,838 --> 00:17:36,261
Damn.Play me off, Johnny.

453
00:17:41,357 --> 00:17:43,010
You're probably wonderin'why he's in hell.

454
00:17:43,985 --> 00:17:45,503
Johnny liked little boys.

455
00:17:49,398 --> 00:17:50,283
The question is, Brian,

456
00:17:50,287 --> 00:17:52,612
how am I gonna make peoplethink I'm James Woods?

457
00:17:52,616 --> 00:17:54,002
The same wayhe did, Peter.

458
00:17:54,005 --> 00:17:55,853
Identity theftworks both ways.

459
00:17:56,035 --> 00:17:58,891
The first thing we're gonna dois get you a perfect fake I.D.

460
00:17:58,956 --> 00:18:00,353
I know a guy who does good work.

461
00:18:00,358 --> 00:18:02,400
You took a big riskcoming here, man.

462
00:18:02,406 --> 00:18:03,961
James Woods could beback any minute.

463
00:18:03,968 --> 00:18:05,290
I know. How fastcan you do it?

464
00:18:05,295 --> 00:18:07,593
As fast as Spider-Manwhen he gets laid.

465
00:18:07,806 --> 00:18:09,453
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

466
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:11,682
That's never happenedto me before.

467
00:18:11,686 --> 00:18:15,163
It's just... you'reso attractive
and it's been a while.

468
00:18:15,168 --> 00:18:15,981
I'gonna go.

469
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,643
You know, some people saythat's good for your hair.

470
00:18:22,907 --> 00:18:24,943
Welcome back to the, uh,program, ladies and gentlemen.

471
00:18:24,955 --> 00:18:27,792
Please welcomeour next guest, Mr. James Woods.

472
00:18:27,795 --> 00:18:28,810
Oh, James.

473
00:18:31,315 --> 00:18:33,070
Wait a minute,you're not James Woods.

474
00:18:33,098 --> 00:18:34,330
Oh, I believe I am.

475
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:35,562
Driver's license,

476
00:18:35,566 --> 00:18:37,782
Social Security card,American Express.

477
00:18:37,788 --> 00:18:39,353
What the hellis he doing?

478
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,602
Wow, I guess youare James Woods.

479
00:18:41,715 --> 00:18:43,280
So, uh, now, let meunderstand this,

480
00:18:43,285 --> 00:18:44,972
what are you hereto promote, James?

481
00:18:44,976 --> 00:18:47,373
Well, Dave, I havea hilarious new movie

482
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:48,970
coming outon HBO next month.

483
00:18:48,976 --> 00:18:50,363
It's all about 9-11.

484
00:18:50,367 --> 00:18:53,582
he movie's called September 11, 2000-Fun.

485
00:18:54,645 --> 00:18:57,812
No! No, no, no, no, no!

486
00:18:57,816 --> 00:19:00,840
James, that sounds unbelievablyoffensive to Americans.

487
00:19:00,846 --> 00:19:02,862
Well, you haven't heardwhat the movie's about.

488
00:19:03,168 --> 00:19:06,423
I play a window washerwho has just finished washing

489
00:19:06,457 --> 00:19:08,352
the last windowof the World Trade Center.

490
00:19:08,577 --> 00:19:10,603
And then I turn around to getoff the scaffold,

491
00:19:10,836 --> 00:19:12,601
and what do you thinkI see coming?

492
00:19:12,628 --> 00:19:13,541
A plane.

493
00:19:13,546 --> 00:19:15,362
And I go "Come on!"

494
00:19:15,845 --> 00:19:18,150
You know, it-it's real,real old style comedy.

495
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,841
You know, it-it's like,it's like two pies in the face,

496
00:19:20,986 --> 00:19:22,681
and one in a fieldin Pennsylvania.

497
00:19:22,687 --> 00:19:25,043
James, I don't want to hearanymore about this.

498
00:19:25,045 --> 00:19:27,152
And the voice of theplane is David Spade.

499
00:19:27,157 --> 00:19:27,770
What?!

500
00:19:27,777 --> 00:19:30,031
I would never workwith David Spade!

501
00:19:30,186 --> 00:19:31,582
That dwarf!

502
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,140
That skinny chicken!

503
00:19:36,037 --> 00:19:38,131
Well, Brian, it's beena productive week.

504
00:19:38,138 --> 00:19:39,440
I think I've successfully

505
00:19:39,448 --> 00:19:41,572
destroyed JamesWoods' reputation.

506
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:43,193
Here it is.

507
00:19:43,195 --> 00:19:46,632
Well, our top story continues to be
the fall of actor James Woods,

508
00:19:46,677 --> 00:19:48,321
who almost overnight has gone

509
00:19:48,326 --> 00:19:50,133
from America's most
beloved celebrity

510
00:19:50,165 --> 00:19:51,902
to America's most hated pariah.

511
00:19:54,156 --> 00:19:55,811
You're in a lot oftrouble, Griffin! You!

512
00:19:57,246 --> 00:19:58,291
Oh, no, sir.

513
00:19:58,296 --> 00:19:59,490
You're Peter Griffin.

514
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:00,763
I'm James Woods.

515
00:20:00,968 --> 00:20:02,573
You ruined my reputation.

516
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:05,331
And now you aregonna pay for it.

517
00:20:05,335 --> 00:20:07,520
We're gonna settlethis like men.

518
00:20:07,527 --> 00:20:09,470
All right, we'llsettle it like men.

519
00:20:09,517 --> 00:20:10,371

Okay, Brian, next time

534
00:20:41,195 --> 00:20:42,811
