14
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:46,294
LOIS: Peter, what the hell
are you doing?

15
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:48,014
I can't sleep, Lois.

16
00:00:48,102 --> 00:00:49,452
I'm too excited
for my birthday tomorrow.

17
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:51,687
(giggling)
Yeah!

18
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:53,473
Peter, would you get
in the damn bed?

19
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,625
I'm gonna have
the best birthday party ever.

20
00:00:55,693 --> 00:00:57,694
I gave out
all my invitations yesterday.

21
00:00:57,761 --> 00:00:59,912
Hey, Chris, um, I was wondering

22
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,581
if you'd like to come
to my party tomorrow.

23
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:03,516
Thanks, Dad.
I'd love to...

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,485
Oh no!
M-E-G.

25
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:06,703
Hey.

26
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:07,737
What are you guys
talking about?

27
00:01:07,805 --> 00:01:08,871
- Uh, nothing.
- Sports!

28
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,340
Birthday sports!
No, just sports!

29
00:01:10,407 --> 00:01:11,507
Oh.
Okay.

30
00:01:14,361 --> 00:01:16,429
Meg, you're not invited
to my party.

31
00:01:19,933 --> 00:01:22,835
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

32
00:01:22,903 --> 00:01:25,371
Why don't you open your
presents while I cut the cake?

33
00:01:27,057 --> 00:01:28,941
Whoa!

34
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:30,677
What planet is this?!

35
00:01:30,744 --> 00:01:32,195
It's not a pla...
Peter, it's Earth.

36
00:01:32,262 --> 00:01:33,413
It's a globe.

37
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,381
You use it to learn
where the countries are.

38
00:01:35,449 --> 00:01:38,167
You gave me an educational toy?

39
00:01:38,235 --> 00:01:40,036
What do you say
to Mr. Swanson?

40
00:01:42,373 --> 00:01:44,390
(groans)
Thank you.

41
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:47,677
Hey, Dad.
This came in the mail for you.

42
00:01:47,744 --> 00:01:49,011
A card?

43
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,446
Oh, look,
it's one of those cards

44
00:01:50,514 --> 00:01:51,948
where you can record
your own message.

45
00:01:52,015 --> 00:01:53,649
Come on!
Open it up.

00:02:57,981 --> 00:02:59,248
Yeah, I'm sure he's fine.

00:03:04,354 --> 00:03:05,588
Ooh, Zales!

89
00:03:05,656 --> 00:03:07,056
Eh, it's just the box, Peter.

90
00:03:07,124 --> 00:03:09,592
Tickets to "Foxy Boxing"?

91
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,877
Yeah, it's this cool thing

92
00:03:10,944 --> 00:03:12,662
where girls in bikinis
box each other.

93

Man, would you look at that?

00:03:22,723 --> 00:03:26,225
Two smokin' hot chicks
repeatedly striking each other.

97
00:03:26,293 --> 00:03:27,960
Yeah, it reminds me
of Thanksgiving.

98
00:03:28,028 --> 00:03:29,445
Why does it remind
you of Thanksgiving?

99
00:03:29,513 --> 00:03:31,347
'Cause this is where
I come for Thanksgiving.

ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please?

101
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:35,234
We've reached that
part of the evening

102
00:03:35,302 --> 00:03:37,837
when our house champion
takes on all challengers.

103
00:03:37,905 --> 00:03:40,840
Any of you lovely ladies like
to try your hand in the ring?

104
00:03:40,908 --> 00:03:41,924
Hey, Lois, what do you think?

105
00:03:41,992 --> 00:03:43,459
You want to fight
that lady's boobs?

106
00:03:43,527 --> 00:03:45,661
What? No.
I'm not fighting anyone.

107
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:48,147
Oh. Well, good thing
I made this plaster mold

108
00:03:48,215 --> 00:03:49,532
of your hand and forearm.

109
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,800
Hey, buddy!
Over here!

110
00:03:50,868 --> 00:03:53,536
I see a woman's hand
and forearm at table eight!

111
00:03:53,604 --> 00:03:55,471
Damn it, Peter!

112
00:03:55,522 --> 00:03:57,190
Please, Lois! Come on,
you got to fight her!

113
00:03:57,257 --> 00:03:58,291
- It's gonna be great!
- Come on, Lois!

114
00:03:58,358 --> 00:03:59,275
Get in there, take her down!

115
00:03:59,343 --> 00:04:00,359
- Come on!
- It'll be awesome!

116
00:04:00,444 --> 00:04:01,494
I'd really like to see that.

117
00:04:01,578 --> 00:04:02,962
(sighs)
All right, all right.

118
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,097
If it'll shut you all up,
I'll do it.

119
00:04:05,165 --> 00:04:06,666
(bell clangs)

120
00:04:09,086 --> 00:04:10,469
All right,
so how does this work?

121
00:04:10,537 --> 00:04:11,771
We gonna pretend
to hit each other

122
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:13,840
for a while, then maybe
kiss a little? Huh?

123
00:04:13,907 --> 00:04:16,559
(laughing)
I'm terrible.

124
00:04:16,627 --> 00:04:17,927
Hey, watch it.

125
00:04:17,995 --> 00:04:19,228
That was pretty hard.

126
00:04:19,296 --> 00:04:21,247
No, it wasn't.
Try this one.

127
00:04:21,331 --> 00:04:23,132
Stop that, young lady.

128
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,251
I'm just out here for fun...

129
00:04:25,335 --> 00:04:27,336
PETER: Yeah,
punch each other, you whores!

130
00:04:27,404 --> 00:04:30,072
Okay, you little bitch,
that's it!

131
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,324
You want to (bleep) with me?!

132
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:32,391
Let's go!

133
00:04:38,232 --> 00:04:41,167
No matter what you do
for the rest of your life,

134
00:04:41,235 --> 00:04:44,770
you'll always be garbage.

135
00:04:44,855 --> 00:04:46,755
(crowd cheering)

136
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:47,940
Oh, my God!

137
00:04:48,008 --> 00:04:50,092
I didn't know Lois
had that in her.

138
00:04:50,143 --> 00:04:51,310
Hey, is that your wife?

139
00:04:51,378 --> 00:04:53,212
You bet that's my wife.

140
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,047
Well, I got to say,
she's a natural.

141
00:04:55,115 --> 00:04:58,167
You know, she could make some
serious money as a professional.

142
00:04:58,235 --> 00:05:00,202
Wow, you...
You really think so?

143
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,971
Oh, sure.
Women's boxing

144
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:03,823
is a rapidly growing
part of the field.

145
00:05:03,891 --> 00:05:06,492
You should consider your
wife competing for a belt.

146
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,995
Well, she did look like she knew
what she was doin' up there.

147
00:05:09,062 --> 00:05:10,763
Think about it.
Here's my card.

148
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,085
(chuckles)
What can I say?

149
00:05:16,136 --> 00:05:17,436
I really like watching her box.

150
00:05:17,504 --> 00:05:18,905
That means two things.

151
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:26,546
Hey, Lois, congrats

152
00:05:26,646 --> 00:05:28,497
on winning that
boxing match last night.

153
00:05:28,582 --> 00:05:30,132
I saw your picture
in <i>The Daily Growl.</i>

154
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,635
Brian, <i>The Daily Growl</i>
is not a real paper.

155
00:05:32,703 --> 00:05:33,869
What?
Yeah, it is.

156
00:05:33,937 --> 00:05:35,087
(squeaking)

157
00:05:35,155 --> 00:05:37,490
(laughing)
I like that sound.

158
00:05:37,557 --> 00:05:38,808
(squeaking)

159
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,509
Mom, since when
are you a boxer?

160
00:05:40,577 --> 00:05:41,944
I'm not, honey.

161
00:05:42,012 --> 00:05:44,580
Honestly, I don't know what
came over me last night.

162
00:05:44,648 --> 00:05:46,582
It was just one
of those crazy things

163
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,584
that sort of happened
after a few drinks.

164
00:05:48,652 --> 00:05:49,852
Morning, everyone!

165
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,837
Morning, champ!
Ya feelin' loose today?

166
00:05:51,888 --> 00:05:53,172
Peter, what are you doing?

167
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,573
What is all this?

168
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:55,841
I'm a fight promoter now.

169
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:57,376
And I got you another fight.

170
00:05:57,444 --> 00:05:59,595
You're boxing tonight
at the Quahog Civic Center.

171
00:05:59,663 --> 00:06:00,996
Are you out of your mind?

172
00:06:01,064 --> 00:06:03,999
No, Peter. That was a
one-time thing, all right?

173
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:06,302
I am not a boxer,
and I'm not fighting anyone else.

174
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,503
And that's final.

175
00:06:07,571 --> 00:06:08,938
All right, well,
how about this, then?

176
00:06:09,005 --> 00:06:11,741
I'll take you somewhere real
fancy and romantic for dinner,

177
00:06:11,808 --> 00:06:13,109
just the two of us.

178
00:06:13,176 --> 00:06:15,277
And in return, I get to try
and convince you to fight.

179
00:06:15,345 --> 00:06:17,513
Well, going out for
dinner would be nice.

180
00:06:17,581 --> 00:06:19,832
But I'm not changing my mind.

181
00:06:19,883 --> 00:06:22,835
Oh, gosh, I can't wait to
see this fancy restaurant.

182
00:06:22,903 --> 00:06:24,820
Oh, you're gonna love it, Lois.

183
00:06:24,888 --> 00:06:27,590
Here, put on these special
eating gloves I bought you.

184
00:06:27,657 --> 00:06:30,259
Why do I need to wear gloves
to eat in a fancy restaurant?

185
00:06:30,327 --> 00:06:32,461
'Cause it's so fancy that...

186
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:34,013
You know what?
I'm tired of this.

187
00:06:34,064 --> 00:06:35,214
I booked you a boxing match.

188
00:06:35,265 --> 00:06:36,732
Son of a bitch!

189
00:06:36,817 --> 00:06:39,602
Damn it, Peter. I told you,
I don't want to be a boxer!

190
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:41,504
Who the hell do you
think you are?!

191
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:43,105
There you go!
Use that anger!

192
00:06:43,173 --> 00:06:44,607
Hey, remember when
I said I think it's hot

193
00:06:44,674 --> 00:06:46,142
when you wear a sports bra
and gym shorts

194
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:47,309
underneath your dress?

195
00:06:47,377 --> 00:06:48,411
Yeah?

196
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:49,528
Now, put these shoes on.

197
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:50,780
Stop it, you jackass!

198
00:06:50,847 --> 00:06:54,166
I told you, I'm not fighting!

199
00:06:54,234 --> 00:06:56,836
I'm sorry, there's been
a terrible mistake.

200
00:06:56,903 --> 00:06:58,170
My idiot husband here
booked this match

201
00:06:58,238 --> 00:06:59,338
without my knowledge...

202
00:06:59,406 --> 00:07:00,773
(bell clangs)

203
00:07:00,841 --> 00:07:01,857
PETER:
She's from the Ukraine, Lois!

204
00:07:01,925 --> 00:07:03,058
She doesn't speak English!

205
00:07:03,126 --> 00:07:04,427
All right.

206
00:07:04,494 --> 00:07:06,562
(Lois speaking in
Ukranian dialect)

207
00:07:06,646 --> 00:07:08,230
PETER: She's from
the other part of the Ukraine!

208
00:07:08,298 --> 00:07:10,132
It's a different dialect!

209
00:07:12,352 --> 00:07:14,820
One, two, three.

210
00:07:18,508 --> 00:07:20,609
Hey! Whatcha doin'
down there, Lois?

211
00:07:21,978 --> 00:07:23,312
Aw, what's the matter?

212
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,548
Mad at little old me?

213
00:07:25,615 --> 00:07:28,384
In your imagination,
I've got long eyelashes.

214
00:07:28,452 --> 00:07:30,953
(growling)

215
00:07:43,116 --> 00:07:44,717
(panting)

216
00:07:44,784 --> 00:07:47,253
One! Two! Three!

217
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,454
Did you know where the Ukraine
was 'cause of my globe?

218
00:07:49,506 --> 00:07:50,956
No, I saw it in a book.

219
00:07:51,024 --> 00:07:53,943
You knew 'cause
of my globe, you dick.

220
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,245
Eight! Nine! Ten!

221
00:07:56,313 --> 00:07:57,730
We have a winner!

222
00:07:57,797 --> 00:07:59,415
(crowd cheering)

223
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:01,033
Well, what do you
think of that, Lois?

224
00:08:01,084 --> 00:08:02,284
You still mad at me now?

225
00:08:02,369 --> 00:08:04,119
Peter!
I feel great!

226
00:08:04,204 --> 00:08:06,255
I've never felt so in control.

227
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:07,756
I know the feeling.

228
00:08:07,841 --> 00:08:09,842
It's how I feel when
I burp really loud

229
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:11,243
in an underground
parking structure

230
00:08:11,294 --> 00:08:12,811
to assert my dominance.

231
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,314
(belches, belch echoes)

232
00:08:15,382 --> 00:08:17,349
Says the king.

233
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,055
All right, kids,
I'm off to train at the gym.

234
00:08:23,123 --> 00:08:25,758
Geez, Lois, you're really
taking this seriously, huh?

235
00:08:25,825 --> 00:08:27,593
Well, yeah, Brian,
why wouldn't I?

236
00:08:27,661 --> 00:08:29,161
I don't know, you've just never

237
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:30,563
really been
the aggressive type.

238
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,532
I mean, you're usually
so measured and collected.

239
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,569
I know, Brian, but when
I stepped into that ring...

240
00:08:36,636 --> 00:08:39,171
I don't know.
Something happened to me.

241
00:08:39,239 --> 00:08:41,907
It's like I tapped
into this primal wellspring

242
00:08:41,975 --> 00:08:44,743
of pent-up anger that
just needed to be released.

243
00:08:44,811 --> 00:08:46,845
Really? What do you
have to be angry about?

244
00:08:46,913 --> 00:08:50,516
Where are my flapjacks?!

245
00:08:50,584 --> 00:08:51,383
Huh?

246
00:08:51,451 --> 00:08:53,018
You will recall, last night,

247
00:08:53,086 --> 00:08:55,087
ere I drifted off into slumber

248
00:08:55,155 --> 00:08:57,256
with a nudie magazine
betwixt my legs,

249
00:08:57,324 --> 00:08:58,691
I spake thusly:

250
00:08:58,758 --> 00:09:01,193
"Lois, tomorrow morning,
I want flapjacks."

251
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:04,496
It was a simple message,
yet it has gone unheeded.

252
00:09:04,564 --> 00:09:06,131
(low growl)

253
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:07,967
All right, Peter,
give me a minute.

254
00:09:08,034 --> 00:09:10,436
For every five seconds
I do not have flapjacks,

255
00:09:10,503 --> 00:09:13,088
I shall break one window.

256
00:09:13,173 --> 00:09:14,907
Uh-huh.

257
00:09:14,975 --> 00:09:16,342
Look, Lois, it just seems to me

258
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:18,177
that this isn't necessarily
the healthiest thing

259
00:09:18,245 --> 00:09:19,778
for a woman your age
to be doing.

260
00:09:19,846 --> 00:09:21,247
(glass breaking)

261
00:09:21,314 --> 00:09:23,182
Brian, I'm 42,
I'm in the prime of my life,

262
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,750
and this is what
I want right now.

263
00:09:24,818 --> 00:09:25,884
You're sure about that?

264
00:09:25,952 --> 00:09:27,152
(glass breaking)

265
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,921
Meg, go make your
father some flapjacks.

266
00:09:28,989 --> 00:09:30,556
(sighs)
Okay, Mom.

267
00:09:30,624 --> 00:09:31,607
(glass breaking)

268
00:09:31,675 --> 00:09:32,875
PETER:
This is crazy!

269
00:09:32,943 --> 00:09:34,677
Is nobody really
making me flapjacks yet?

270
00:09:34,744 --> 00:09:38,013
At this point, you guys are
being as irresponsible as I am!

271
00:09:38,081 --> 00:09:40,583

00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:22,908
Well, it's broken, all right.

279
00:10:22,976 --> 00:10:24,159
Well, you got to fix her, Doc.

280
00:10:24,244 --> 00:10:25,344
There's a big fight coming up.

281
00:10:25,412 --> 00:10:26,412
She's got to defend her title.

282
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:28,914
Look, Peter, I don't think
there's gonna be any fight.

283
00:10:28,982 --> 00:10:30,015
What are you talking about?

284
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,318
Look at me.
I got a broken nose.

285
00:10:32,385 --> 00:10:35,754
I think this is a sign that maybe
it's time to hang up the gloves.

286
00:10:35,822 --> 00:10:37,339
What are you, out of your mind?

287
00:10:37,407 --> 00:10:39,174
Whoa, don't you give me
that attitude, Peter.

288
00:10:39,242 --> 00:10:41,810
Look, Lois, we're making a lot
of cash with this boxing thing.

289
00:10:41,878 --> 00:10:44,213
And I need money
for bourbon and anime.

290
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,482
(slurring): Well, I just
can't understand any of this.

291
00:10:46,549 --> 00:10:48,150
Everybody in Japan

292
00:10:48,218 --> 00:10:51,053
is either a ten-year-old girl
or a monster.

293
00:10:51,121 --> 00:10:52,855
I don't care about
the money, Peter!

294
00:10:52,922 --> 00:10:54,156
I don't care about boxing!

295
00:10:54,224 --> 00:10:56,291
The only reason I did
this in the first place

296
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:58,127
- was 'cause of you!
- What do you mean?

297
00:10:58,194 --> 00:11:00,329
Peter, sometimes
you're so insensitive,

298
00:11:00,397 --> 00:11:03,465
and you make me so angry,
I just want to clock you in the jaw.

299
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:06,785
Obviously, I can't do that,
so boxing was an outlet.

300
00:11:06,853 --> 00:11:10,556
Wait, you mean the reason
you fight so good is...

301
00:11:10,623 --> 00:11:13,008
Yeah, 'cause I'm making
believe I'm fighting you!

302
00:11:13,076 --> 00:11:16,512
Wow.
Am I that much of a bastard?

303
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:17,946
Sometimes, yes.

304
00:11:18,014 --> 00:11:20,015
Geez, Lois, I'm sorry.

305
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,284
I... I mean,
I don't mean to be,

306
00:11:22,352 --> 00:11:23,686
I just...

307
00:11:23,753 --> 00:11:26,288
Look, if you don't want
to fight anymore,

308
00:11:26,356 --> 00:11:27,790
you don't have to.

309
00:11:27,857 --> 00:11:29,058
Well, good.

310
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,727
And the truth is,
I suppose I kind of got

311
00:11:31,795 --> 00:11:33,629
most of it out of
my system anyway.

312
00:11:33,697 --> 00:11:35,631
Oh, I love you, Lois.

313
00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:37,766
I love you, too, Peter.

314
00:11:37,834 --> 00:11:41,286
Is it cool if I tell your insurance
that I gave you heart surgery?

315
00:11:44,657 --> 00:11:47,609
Ladies and gentlemen,
in honor of her retirement

316
00:11:47,677 --> 00:11:50,829
after seventeen consecutive victories,

317
00:11:50,897 --> 00:11:55,200
I hereby dedicate this statue
to Quahog's greatest fighter,

318
00:11:55,268 --> 00:11:57,086
Lois Griffin!

319
00:11:58,855 --> 00:12:00,839
(whistling, whooping)

320
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:03,225
I'm also having
a celebratory keg party

321
00:12:03,293 --> 00:12:05,027
back at my house later.

322
00:12:05,095 --> 00:12:08,797
You can tell your parents
that my parents will be there.

323
00:12:08,865 --> 00:12:10,733
(chuckles)
But they won't be.

324
00:12:10,817 --> 00:12:12,684
(cheering)

325
00:12:12,736 --> 00:12:15,904
And now a few words
from Lois Griffin herself.

326
00:12:17,323 --> 00:12:19,158
Thank you so much
for coming, everyone,

327
00:12:19,225 --> 00:12:22,644
and thank you for always
cheering me on at all my fights.

328
00:12:22,712 --> 00:12:23,679
WOMAN:
Hey, Griffin!

329
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:28,517
- Oh, my God, that's Deirdre Jackson!
- Who's that?

330
00:12:28,585 --> 00:12:31,370
Only the deadliest fighter
in all of women's boxing.

331
00:12:31,438 --> 00:12:33,572
She's killed three
people in the ring.

332
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,457
BRIAN:
Her fists are so dangerous,

333
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:37,593
she's not <i>allowed</i>
to be a lesbian.

334
00:12:37,677 --> 00:12:39,027
I know why you're
retiring, Griffin!

335
00:12:39,095 --> 00:12:40,062
You're scared!

336
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,030
Scared?
Of what?

337
00:12:42,098 --> 00:12:44,383
Of me! Look at these people,
giving you a statue

338
00:12:44,451 --> 00:12:45,951
for fighting a bunch of bums!

339
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,771
If you're so great,
why don't you prove it? Fight me!

340
00:12:48,838 --> 00:12:50,973
Look, I don't need
to prove anything.

341
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,842
I'm retired, and that's
the way it's gonna stay.

342
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,110
Oh, yeah?

343
00:12:55,178 --> 00:12:56,645
Hey, man,
you want a <i>real</i> woman?

344
00:12:56,713 --> 00:12:58,480
Why don't you bring
your pretty little self

345
00:12:58,548 --> 00:12:59,731
over to my apartment tonight,

346
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:01,033
and I'll show you
a <i>real</i> woman.

347
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,935
Oh, I'm ashamed!

348
00:13:03,002 --> 00:13:04,803
Hey, that's my husband
you're talking to!

349
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:06,989
Yeah? Well, what are
you gonna do about it?

350
00:13:07,056 --> 00:13:08,123
You gonna fight me?

351
00:13:08,191 --> 00:13:09,324
Look, I already said...

352
00:13:09,392 --> 00:13:10,959
Get down on your
hands and knees, fatty!

353
00:13:11,027 --> 00:13:11,894
Yeah! Yes, sir!

354
00:13:14,497 --> 00:13:16,832
Look at me, Griffin...
I'm milking me a cow!

355
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,167
Moo for me!

356
00:13:18,251 --> 00:13:19,301
- Moo.
- Louder!

357
00:13:19,385 --> 00:13:20,552
- Moo!
- Louder!

358
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,137
- Moo...!
- Louder!

359
00:13:22,205 --> 00:13:23,639
(sobbing):
Moo...!

360
00:13:23,706 --> 00:13:24,890
All right, that's it!

361
00:13:24,957 --> 00:13:26,675
You want a fight, you got one!

362
00:13:26,743 --> 00:13:28,710
Now, you get your
hands off my man

363
00:13:28,778 --> 00:13:30,512
before I break 'em off!

364
00:13:32,248 --> 00:13:33,749
(bleep)!
It's my parents!

365
00:13:33,817 --> 00:13:35,217
The party's off, everybody!

366
00:13:35,285 --> 00:13:36,685
Get the (bleep) out of here!

367
00:13:43,453 --> 00:13:44,803
<i>Good evening.
I'm Tom Tucker.</i>

368
00:13:44,871 --> 00:13:46,705
<i>Coming up next, a boxing match</i>

369
00:13:46,756 --> 00:13:49,207
<i>where the fighters
are bleeding before the fight?</i>

370
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:51,944
<i>We've got exclusive coverage of
tonight's women's boxing bout,</i>

371
00:13:52,012 --> 00:13:53,779
<i>Griffin versus Jackson.</i>

372
00:13:53,847 --> 00:13:57,049
<i>We're here live with contender Deirdre
Jackson outside her dressing room.</i>

373
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,269
<i>Deirdre, is it true you've
killed three women in the ring?</i>

374
00:14:00,337 --> 00:14:01,887
<i>Tonight it's gonna be four.</i>

375
00:14:01,955 --> 00:14:04,607
<i>Are you saying you intend
to kill your opponent?</i>

376
00:14:04,691 --> 00:14:08,143
<i>Let's just say you
don't want to miss round six.</i>

377
00:14:08,211 --> 00:14:10,429
(gasps)
Lois, you can't go out there!

378
00:14:10,497 --> 00:14:13,098
- What? Why not?
- Because if you step into that ring,

379
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,366
she's gonna kill you.

380
00:14:14,434 --> 00:14:15,601
No, she's not, Peter.

381
00:14:15,669 --> 00:14:17,670
What the hell kind
of talk is that?

382
00:14:17,737 --> 00:14:19,154
Now, I'm gonna win this thing.

383
00:14:19,222 --> 00:14:21,357
Look, Lois, you don't
have to do this for me.

384
00:14:21,424 --> 00:14:22,858
I know I make you
mad sometimes,

385
00:14:22,926 --> 00:14:25,194
but I thought we agreed
you'd hang up the gloves.

386
00:14:25,262 --> 00:14:28,130
I'll hang up the gloves
after I knock her ass out.

387
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:29,431
Peter, she milked your boobs,

388
00:14:29,499 --> 00:14:32,001
and there were a lot of
people I knew there.

389
00:14:32,068 --> 00:14:33,269
Now, let's go.

390
00:14:35,188 --> 00:14:39,091
MAN: Butt scratcher!
Get your butt scratcher here!

391
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:40,960
Now, since this is
a televised boxing match,

392
00:14:41,027 --> 00:14:42,127
I'm gonna be joined

393
00:14:42,195 --> 00:14:43,929
by a horribly disfigured
former fighter

394
00:14:43,997 --> 00:14:46,231
providing barely intelligible
commentary throughout.

395
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:48,100
Any thoughts on
the fight, Floyd?

396
00:14:48,151 --> 00:14:50,119
Uh, I... I think that they're...
They're gonna have,

397
00:14:50,186 --> 00:14:52,254
They are gonna be fightin'
Deirdre's last fight

398
00:14:52,322 --> 00:14:54,139
in the contrast
to the later one

399
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,941
is gonna be bet...
Better than usually.

400
00:14:56,009 --> 00:14:58,610
And how do you think that
helps her chances tonight?

401
00:14:58,678 --> 00:15:02,481
Well, the match lastin' the bout up
until the particular inaccuracy,

402
00:15:02,549 --> 00:15:06,285
particular unusually that should
be the ultimate determining factor

403
00:15:06,353 --> 00:15:07,820
in about the
twelve-round experience,

404
00:15:07,887 --> 00:15:09,655
the heart of a champion
margarine hat.

405
00:15:09,723 --> 00:15:11,357
Well, we'll be
watching for that.

406
00:15:11,424 --> 00:15:13,592
We'll be checking in with you
throughout the night, Floyd.

407
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,094
And happy 23rd birthday.

408
00:15:15,161 --> 00:15:16,228
You're welcome.

409
00:15:18,048 --> 00:15:21,633
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please?

410
00:15:21,701 --> 00:15:23,936
Introducing tonight's fighters.

411
00:15:24,004 --> 00:15:27,906
In this corner,
weighing in at 134 pounds,

412
00:15:27,974 --> 00:15:30,659
the top-ranked boxer
in all of Rhode Island,

413
00:15:30,744 --> 00:15:33,996
Deirdre "Action" Jackson!

414
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,266
(crowd jeering)

415
00:15:38,935 --> 00:15:42,037
I think every Italian
in Quahog is here.

416
00:15:42,105 --> 00:15:43,872
Yeah!
Go, white girl!

417
00:15:43,957 --> 00:15:46,775
Hey, yo, you're gettin'
your grinder on my grinder!

418
00:15:46,843 --> 00:15:50,946
And in this corner,
weighing in at 130 pounds,

419
00:15:51,014 --> 00:15:52,948
it's the Ovarian Barbarian

420
00:15:53,016 --> 00:15:55,517
and the Breast of All Time,

421
00:15:55,585 --> 00:15:58,404
let's put our hands together
for Quahog's own...

422
00:15:58,471 --> 00:16:00,356
Lois Griffin!

423
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,725
(crowd cheering,
whistling, whooping)

424
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:05,010
Okay, here's the rules.

425
00:16:05,078 --> 00:16:07,212
No hitting below the belt,

426
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,049
no rabbit punches,
no name calling,

427
00:16:10,116 --> 00:16:11,884
no making trouble
for unconventional couples

428
00:16:11,951 --> 00:16:14,620
who want to adopt babies,
'cause you know what,

429
00:16:14,687 --> 00:16:16,555
they ain't gettin'
the good babies, anyways.

430
00:16:16,623 --> 00:16:18,357
Okay, have a fun fight.

431
00:16:18,425 --> 00:16:19,925
Ding, ding.

432
00:16:19,993 --> 00:16:20,959
(bell clangs)

433
00:16:23,947 --> 00:16:25,280
You think you're tough?

434
00:16:25,348 --> 00:16:27,082
Well, let's see what you got!

435
00:16:28,785 --> 00:16:30,219
(punches cracking)

436
00:16:30,303 --> 00:16:31,387
(punches smacking)

437
00:16:31,471 --> 00:16:33,505
(punches cracking)

438
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:39,812
(punches cracking, thudding)

439
00:16:52,442 --> 00:16:54,710
Wow, she's really
hitting Mom hard.

440
00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:55,878
Good.

441
00:16:57,781 --> 00:16:59,064
(bell clangs)

442
00:16:59,115 --> 00:17:00,466
(panting)

443
00:17:04,621 --> 00:17:06,488
How you feeling, Lois?

444
00:17:06,556 --> 00:17:09,024
(gasping):
She... She's too str...

445
00:17:09,092 --> 00:17:10,876
She's too strong, Joe.

446
00:17:10,944 --> 00:17:13,095
I don't stand a
chance out there.

447
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:15,447
All right, Lois, you listen
to me and you listen good.

448
00:17:15,515 --> 00:17:16,915
I held your hand
during childbirth,

449
00:17:16,983 --> 00:17:19,485
I watched you raise three kids
on a shoestring budget...

450
00:17:19,552 --> 00:17:22,187
you never gave up then,
and you're not giving up now!

451
00:17:22,255 --> 00:17:24,056
'Cause you're the toughest woman
I've ever met.

452
00:17:24,124 --> 00:17:26,291
And if there was
a hall of fame for hearts,

453
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:29,061
yours would be the biggest one
in the whole damn building!

454
00:17:29,129 --> 00:17:30,863
QUAGMIRE: Peter, you're
in the wrong corner!

455
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,231
PETER:
Ah.

456
00:17:32,282 --> 00:17:34,383
All right, Lois, you listen
to me and you listen good.

457
00:17:34,451 --> 00:17:35,784
(bell clangs)
Damn it!

458
00:17:37,086 --> 00:17:38,620
(crowd jeering)

459
00:17:38,688 --> 00:17:40,622
Shut up!

460
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:42,357
Everybody shut up!

461
00:17:42,425 --> 00:17:44,460
This took a lot of courage!

462
00:17:44,527 --> 00:17:47,062
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
here we are at round six...

463
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,531
The round that Deirdre Jackson
predicted she'd kill Lois Griffin.

464
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:52,501
What do you think, Floyd, is she
gonna make good on that promise?

465
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:55,904
A broken promise is a lot
like a child's pinwheel.

466
00:17:55,972 --> 00:17:59,541
You have to b... Be yourself,
or at least within the confines.

467
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,746
All right, well, let's see
what's going on in the ring.

468
00:18:04,814 --> 00:18:06,048
(bell clangs)

469
00:18:07,817 --> 00:18:09,451
Finish this.

470
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:24,649
(slow-motion, vicious grunt)

471
00:18:26,703 --> 00:18:29,538
(crowd ooh-ing)

472
00:18:37,213 --> 00:18:38,797
One, two...

473
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:41,984
Lois, stay down.
Don't get up.

474
00:18:42,051 --> 00:18:43,385
You've got nothing to prove.

475
00:18:43,453 --> 00:18:45,604
Five, six...

476
00:18:45,672 --> 00:18:47,739
You get up, you die!

477
00:18:47,807 --> 00:18:49,208
(fierce grunt)

478
00:18:49,275 --> 00:18:51,293
I've had enough of you!

479
00:18:51,361 --> 00:18:53,345
("Eye of the Tiger" playing)

480
00:18:53,396 --> 00:18:56,231
(punches cracking, thudding)

481
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,817
♪ Risin' up, ♪

482
00:19:31,884 --> 00:19:34,519
♪ back on the street. ♪

483
00:19:34,587 --> 00:19:36,922
♪ Did my time,
took my chances... ♪

484
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,890
- Oh, get out of here.
- Yeah, okay.

485
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,659
(punches cracking)

486
00:19:51,904 --> 00:19:53,305
You're goin' down, Griffin!

487
00:19:55,074 --> 00:19:57,059
Not tonight, I'm not!

488
00:19:57,126 --> 00:19:58,377
(grunts)

489
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,281
(slow-motion thud)

490
00:20:12,325 --> 00:20:14,276
(cheering, whistling)

491
00:20:19,198 --> 00:20:20,899
Lois! You did it!

492
00:20:20,967 --> 00:20:22,818
I love you so much!

493
00:20:22,902 --> 00:20:24,553
And the winner is...

494
00:20:24,621 --> 00:20:27,039
Lois Griffin!

495
00:20:27,106 --> 00:20:29,774
Now, if everyone could just pick
up two chairs before you leave,

496
00:20:29,826 --> 00:20:31,960
we can get this place
cleaned up a lot quicker.

497
00:20:32,028 --> 00:20:33,795
Wow.
Well, what do you think, Floyd?

498
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,481
How did Lois Griffin do what
no other challenger could do

499
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:38,050
and knock out Deirdre Jackson?

500
00:20:38,117 --> 00:20:41,269
I... I have a strong headache
when I go to sleep and wake up.

501
00:20:41,337 --> 00:20:44,056
And how do you think that's going
to affect Jackson's next fight?

502
00:20:44,123 --> 00:20:46,508
My Puerto Rican wife got fat.

503
00:20:52,398 --> 00:20:54,683
Well, I gotta be honest,
Lois, I had my doubts,

504
00:20:54,751 --> 00:20:56,818
but you really held
your own in that ring.

505
00:20:56,886 --> 00:20:59,688
Thanks, Brian.
It was nice to go out a champion.

506
00:20:59,756 --> 00:21:01,390
Well, we're real proud
of you, Lois.

507
00:21:01,457 --> 00:21:04,292
And thanks to Deirdre,
I even got some of my own milk

508
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,245
to put on my cereal.

509
00:21:07,313 --> 00:21:09,398
OTHERS: Dad, come on! Oh, Peter!
Oh, for crying out loud!

510
00:21:09,465 --> 00:21:09,931
What? I'm fun.

511
00:21:10,131 --> 00:21:13,131
