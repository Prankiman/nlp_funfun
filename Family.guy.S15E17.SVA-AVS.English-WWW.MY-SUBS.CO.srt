11
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:41,240
Hey, guys, I didn't know you were
coming to the church raffle.

12
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,142
I will confess a mix-up to you.

13
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:46,347
I thought Donna said we were
going to the "church waffle."

14
00:00:46,348 --> 00:00:49,047
And we're only here for the
fantasy weekend at Fenway Park.

15
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:50,136
Fenway Park?

16
00:00:50,138 --> 00:00:52,127
Oh, yeah, the winner and
a friend get to hang out

17
00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:54,687
and practice with
retired Red Sox players

18
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:58,524
and then play in a real game,
right on the field at Fenway.

19
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:01,060
Oh, my God, that's always
been a dream of mine!

20
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,939
Well, that and tuning a guitar
in front of a live audience.

21
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:29,047
This was in perfect tune
when they handed it to me.

22
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:36,236
Next up, our fantasy weekend
for two at Fenway Park.

23
00:01:36,238 --> 00:01:37,553
Oh, man, this is it!

24
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,432
And the winner is...

25
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,033
Peter Griffin!

26
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:42,668
Holy crap, I won!

27
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:44,470
- Wow, good for you!
- Congratulations!

28
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:47,239
I like it when people
say your name out loud!

29
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,808
How exciting, Peter.

30
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:50,409
A weekend trip to Boston.

31
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,644
Yeah, and the best part is,

32
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,512
I don't even have to get on a plane.

33
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,141
I always have trouble at the airport.

34
00:01:58,002 --> 00:01:59,852
Sir, you're not allowed
to be on the carousel.

35
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:02,337
Well, then maybe you shouldn't
have named it such a fun word.

36
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:05,248
Uh, excuse me, excuse me, I'm not yours.

37
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,293
He's stealing me! I'm being stolen!

38
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,171
Excuse me, I think you've got mine.

39
00:02:10,594 --> 00:02:11,954
Oh, that's a good idea.

40
00:02:19,623 --> 00:02:21,874
- Oh, hey, Quagmire.
- Hey, Peter.

41
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,976
So I was just baking a coffee cake,

42
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,511
and I figured I'd bring it over,

43
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:26,979
'cause you like coffee cake.

44
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,980
Wow, thanks.

45
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,114
Yeah, yeah, no problem.

46
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:30,899
- So, who are you taking to Fenway?
- What?

47
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,026
Well, I was just thinking,
you have that extra ticket,

48
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:35,402
- maybe you'd want to...
- Peter, before you answer him,

49
00:02:35,404 --> 00:02:39,191
I've got that murdered jogger's
Discman you wanted last week.

50
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:40,593
Still bloody.

51
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:43,796
Hi, Peter. You know how
you like $40 cash?

52
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:46,464
Well, here's almost $40 cash.

53
00:02:46,465 --> 00:02:48,107
Guys, look, I know you all want to go,

54
00:02:48,108 --> 00:02:50,367
but I-I need a little more
time to figure this out.

55
00:02:50,368 --> 00:02:52,104
I mean, it's a tough decision.

56
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,940
Like what to do with that
big watermelon I bought.

57
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,144
Griffin, I just wanted to tell you...

58
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:59,712
that's a great outfit.

59
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:00,913
Keep it up.

60
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:01,914
I knew it.

61
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:04,142
I have to start trusting myself more.

62
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:07,019
Man, I don't envy you.

63
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,654
Whichever one of them
you bring to Fenway,

64
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,289
the other two will be mad at you.

65
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,590
I don't want to bring any of them.

66
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,592
Those guys are all way
better than me at baseball.

67
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,928
They'd just show me up
and ruin it for me.

68
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,062
Why don't you bring Lois?

69
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,330
She doesn't care about baseball,

70
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,232
and that way nobody gets
their feelings hurt.

71
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,750
Brian, that's a great idea.

72
00:03:21,752 --> 00:03:22,752
Thanks.

73
00:03:22,754 --> 00:03:27,705
- Is it new-tennis-ball great?
- It's three-new-tennis-balls great.

74
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,707
I'm gonna get 'em all,
I'm gonna get 'em all,

75
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,708
I'm gonna get 'em all!

76
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:38,584
Mom, you're really going to Boston?

77
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,319
I didn't even think you liked baseball.

78
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,121
Oh, I'm not going for baseball,

79
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:44,723
I-I'm going for shopping, the hotel spa,

80
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,325
and two days of being away

81
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,340
from you life-sucking turds.

82
00:03:48,342 --> 00:03:49,995
Anyway, be good.

83
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,131
And while we're gone, Brian's in charge.

84
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:53,148
Where is Brian?

85
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:56,802
What's up, bitches?

86
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,203
Oh, come on, Mom, really?

87
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,605
I'm in high school,

88
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,907
and you're still putting
the dog in charge?

89
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,576
Believe me, Meg, you want me in charge.

90
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,210
Stewie can be a bit of a handful.

91
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:06,078
He's right, you know.

92
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,714
I'm a total Taurus,
stubborn as they come.

93
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,049
All right, fine, Meg.

94
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,284
While we're away, you can be in charge.

95
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,553
Come on, Lois, time to get to Fenway.

96
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,822
Wow, Dad, you look awesome.

97
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:19,633
But I thought you were gonna
dress like a baseball player.

98
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:20,626
I am, Chris.

99
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:23,429
I'm the type of player who arrives
at the stadium in a suit.

100
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,331
With a tie knot as big as an apple.

101
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,766
That's how you know I got mon-ay.

102
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,252
All right, we'll see you guys Sunday.

103
00:04:31,655 --> 00:04:34,039
Okay, now you heard Mom
say I'm in charge,

104
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,066
so I just want to lay
a few ground rules.

105
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:36,678
Yeah.

106
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,043
I promise we're gonna have fun,

107
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,069
- but there will be a schedule just...
- Uh-huh.

108
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,837
- To keep everything running smoothly.
- Sure, got to have boundaries.

109
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,482
- And I may assign a chore or two...
- That's great, Meg.

110
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,618
- Because it's actually more fun...
- Sounds like you got it all worked out.

111
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,319
- When everyone pitches in.
- Hey, by the way...

112
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,887
Ah!

113
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:51,082
I'm gonna flush your
retainer down the toilet.

114
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:11,677
Look at this, Lois, the
Fenway Park locker room.

115
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:12,945
All right, Peter, I'm gonna go.

116
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:15,381
You want to hand me some cash
in front of the other men

117
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:16,882
so you feel powerful?

118
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:20,002
Instead, why don't you just
take my Minions Discover Card?

119
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,354
Hey, there, sluggers.

120
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,690
Welcome to Red Sox Fantasy Weekend.

121
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,225
Well, who's this?

122
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:28,293
We've never had a lady
come out for this before.

123
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:30,562
Oh, no, no, that's my wife,
she's just dropping me off.

124
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:33,365
Yeah, you're nice, but I'm not staying.

125
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,467
I don't know the first
thing about baseball.

126
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,403
Look, your spot's already paid for.

127
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:40,472
And besides, if you leave,
the teams will be lopsided.

128
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:43,275
So, as your coach, I insist
you stay and play with us.

129
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,643
Right, fellas?

130
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,913
Well, I don't know.

131
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,615
What do you think, Peter?

132
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,950
What do I think about sharing
fantasy baseball camp

133
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:53,052
with my wife?

134
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:55,654
Yeah, come on, let her play.

135
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:59,024
Wow, 1980s All-Star Wade Boggs!

136
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,393
Hey, would you mind standing
next to a star of today?

137
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,411
Sure.

138
00:06:03,514 --> 00:06:05,531
Man, what happened to our game?

139
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,900
David Ortiz, will you
pick him up like a baby?

140
00:06:07,907 --> 00:06:09,407
It's your weekend.

141
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,838
Now let me put this
baby bonnet on his head

142
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,156
and a cigar in his mouth.

143
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:16,942
So, what do you say?

144
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,377
Are you gonna let your wife play?

145
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,545
Absolutely.

146
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,013
Lois, stay here and play with us.

147
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:23,348
I can't say no to Baby Boggs.

148
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:25,660
Coochie-coochie-coo... Ah, he bit me.

149
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,969
Oh, my God, I can't believe I'm here.

150
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,671
Lois, see that wall there?

151
00:06:37,672 --> 00:06:39,939
They call that "the Green Monster."

152
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,476
And over there's where I threw a
D-cell battery at José Canseco.

153
00:06:43,477 --> 00:06:45,028
All right, let's play ball.

154
00:06:46,331 --> 00:06:48,481
Wow, you must be excited, Peter.

155
00:06:48,482 --> 00:06:51,351
Yep, guess I can cross this
one off my bucket list.

156
00:06:51,352 --> 00:06:54,771
All that's left now is
living the pueblo lifestyle.

157
00:06:56,274 --> 00:06:58,657
Peter, what the hell did
you do to the house?

158
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:02,529
I know, it seems pretty lame
until you realize I'm 58.

159
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,998
Now, if you'll excuse me, I
have to go lick the foot

160
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:08,511
of a fleshy, pale woman for<i> Real Sex 34.</i>

161
00:07:13,931 --> 00:07:16,409
Rupert, what do you think of
this fan fiction I wrote?

162
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,978
"Diego pressed Dora against the wall,

163
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:20,413
her bosom heaving,

164
00:07:20,414 --> 00:07:23,049
her hot Latina breath on his face.

165
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:26,753
For once, Diego was going
to do the exploring."

166
00:07:26,754 --> 00:07:28,788
Whew, just reading it...

167
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:30,223
<i>muy caliente.</i>

168
00:07:30,224 --> 00:07:32,459
Okay, Stewie, time for
you to get dressed.

169
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,811
Yeah, a closed door means
"come in," I guess.

170
00:07:35,859 --> 00:07:37,664
What the hell do you think you're doing?

171
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,632
Let's pick out a cute shirt for you.

172
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:41,501
Then I thought we can go to the park.

173
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:42,635
Or, how about this?

174
00:07:42,636 --> 00:07:44,821
I press my butt against
the wall and dook on it?

175
00:07:45,857 --> 00:07:47,006
Stewie!

176
00:07:47,007 --> 00:07:48,041
Don't do that!

177
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:49,209
You're messing with my schedule,

178
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,010
so I'm giving you wall poo.

179
00:07:51,011 --> 00:07:52,579
Stop that right now.

180
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,247
You just earned a time-out.

181
00:07:54,248 --> 00:07:55,749
A what? Let go of me!

182
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,983
Don't you walk away!

183
00:07:56,984 --> 00:07:59,452
Hey, don't bruise me, I'm
going dancing later.

184
00:07:59,453 --> 00:08:01,521
You listen to me, you little monster,

185
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,723
I take abuse from everybody around here,

186
00:08:03,724 --> 00:08:05,959
but I am not gonna take it from you.

187
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,194
Now sit here until I say you can get up.

188
00:08:08,195 --> 00:08:10,397
And if you move one muscle before then,

189
00:08:10,398 --> 00:08:12,599
I'll smack you in your weird head.

190
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,167
Hey, it's not weird.

191
00:08:14,168 --> 00:08:16,454
Mom says it's distinctive.

192
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,829
Griffin, you're up.

193
00:08:30,268 --> 00:08:32,185
It's always the fat one.

194
00:08:32,186 --> 00:08:33,086
I heard that.

195
00:08:33,087 --> 00:08:34,854
I said it right to you.

196
00:08:34,855 --> 00:08:35,716
You know what?

197
00:08:35,718 --> 00:08:37,290
Let's just get Lois up to bat.

198
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,425
Where's Lois?

199
00:08:38,426 --> 00:08:40,393
I'm right here, Coach.

200
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,829
Guess you don't have a
lot of babes out here.

201
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,131
Except for Babe Ruth.

202
00:08:47,101 --> 00:08:48,234
- Babe Ruth.
- Ha!

203
00:08:48,235 --> 00:08:49,952
That's funny 'cause she's hot.

204
00:08:53,808 --> 00:08:55,708
Ah, it's a little like tennis.

205
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:57,510
Uh, did you see that, Peter?

206
00:08:57,511 --> 00:08:58,878
I'm doing it all!

207
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,230
Damn it. This is supposed
to be my weekend.

208
00:09:12,544 --> 00:09:13,526
Stewie?

209
00:09:13,527 --> 00:09:14,661
What the hell's going on?

210
00:09:14,662 --> 00:09:15,929
Meg's awful!

211
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,631
She gave me a time-out and she
made me sit in this chair.

212
00:09:18,632 --> 00:09:21,034
My God, she put eye shadow on you, too.

213
00:09:21,035 --> 00:09:23,269
I might've gotten up from the chair.

214
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,771
Brian, Meg's lost her mind.

215
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,005
You've got to talk to her.

216
00:09:26,006 --> 00:09:27,674
Stewie, Lois put Meg in charge,

217
00:09:27,675 --> 00:09:29,976
and, honestly, once I knew that,

218
00:09:29,977 --> 00:09:31,177
I ate a pot cookie.

219
00:09:31,178 --> 00:09:33,012
So, um, yeah.

220
00:09:33,013 --> 00:09:34,447
So good luck with all that.

221
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,783
Uh, you got any cool DVDs?

222
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,151
Brian, please, I need help.

223
00:09:38,152 --> 00:09:39,185
Totally.

224
00:09:39,186 --> 00:09:40,386
Hey, where's Chris?

225
00:09:40,387 --> 00:09:42,689
I wonder if he'll play
Wii bowling with me.

226
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,858
All right, that's it, I'm
not just gonna sit here

227
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:46,392
and see what that psycho does next.

228
00:09:46,393 --> 00:09:47,393
All right, think.

229
00:09:47,394 --> 00:09:48,495
Ah!

230
00:09:48,496 --> 00:09:50,396
I shall fashion a makeshift ladder

231
00:09:50,397 --> 00:09:53,199
with my Diaper Genie entrails,
shimmy down to the yard,

232
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,968
and I'm free.

233
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,903
The trick, Chris, is
thinking of the wand

234
00:09:56,904 --> 00:09:59,239
as an extension of your arm.

235
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,374
Wow, I can't believe I'm pretend bowling

236
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:02,859
with a dog on drugs!

237
00:10:06,297 --> 00:10:07,797
Ah! Son of a bitch!

238
00:10:11,185 --> 00:10:12,552
Oh, my God, a baby!

239
00:10:12,553 --> 00:10:13,820
My name's Shelly.

240
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,255
I can't have any of my own.

241
00:10:15,256 --> 00:10:17,123
Would you like to come home with me?

242
00:10:17,124 --> 00:10:18,324
I love you so much.

243
00:10:18,325 --> 00:10:20,176
Ah! Everywhere's a nightmare!

244
00:10:32,323 --> 00:10:35,341
Wow, it's nice they put
on a banquet for you.

245
00:10:35,342 --> 00:10:37,443
It looks like I'm the only woman here.

246
00:10:37,444 --> 00:10:38,645
Yeah, they're ex-athletes,

247
00:10:38,646 --> 00:10:40,113
which means they're all divorced.

248
00:10:40,114 --> 00:10:42,115
In fact, their ex-wives are
having a banquet next door

249
00:10:42,116 --> 00:10:43,383
with their money.

250
00:10:45,986 --> 00:10:47,854
Oh, they're having fun.

251
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,989
They're doing a lot of pointing dancing.

252
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,295
Well, at least somebody's
having fun here tonight.

253
00:10:55,296 --> 00:10:58,064
Oh, you're just nervous about
the big game tomorrow.

254
00:10:58,065 --> 00:11:00,533
I-Is it 'cause of how pink
you turn when you run?

255
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:03,002
A couple guys mentioned
that today on the field.

256
00:11:03,003 --> 00:11:04,203
What? Who said that?

257
00:11:04,204 --> 00:11:06,072
I don't know, "N-Nomar" something.

258
00:11:06,073 --> 00:11:07,407
You met Nomar?!

259
00:11:07,408 --> 00:11:08,808
Hey, there you are.

260
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:10,977
We've been saving a spot
at the head table for you

261
00:11:10,978 --> 00:11:12,045
with all the Hall-of-Famers.

262
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,379
Oh, thanks.

263
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,181
Finally something's going my way.

264
00:11:15,182 --> 00:11:17,951
- Where should I...
- Not you. Lois.

265
00:11:17,952 --> 00:11:19,118
What?

266
00:11:21,622 --> 00:11:23,723
This is the one night of the year

267
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,192
they let me out of the scoreboard.

268
00:11:26,193 --> 00:11:29,295
Oh, I don't know if I deserve
to sit at the head table.

269
00:11:29,296 --> 00:11:30,897
No, no, we took a vote.

270
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,465
We all want to sit next to you.

271
00:11:32,466 --> 00:11:33,866
You're the only one
here who doesn't have

272
00:11:33,867 --> 00:11:36,302
a fistful of baseball
cards for us to sign.

273
00:11:36,303 --> 00:11:37,737
I wasn't gonna have 'em sign 'em.

274
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,505
I was just gonna tell 'em their stats.

275
00:11:39,506 --> 00:11:41,374
But this is Peter's weekend.

276
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,976
Aw, don't worry about Peter.

277
00:11:42,977 --> 00:11:45,044
Now, come on, Lois,
we've got you sitting

278
00:11:45,045 --> 00:11:46,913
right between Pedro Martinez

279
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,248
and Ted Williams' severed head.

280
00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:51,017
There's a special place in hell

281
00:11:51,018 --> 00:11:54,203
for whoever's responsible
for me ending up like this.

282
00:11:59,644 --> 00:12:02,395
Hey, Meg, is anybody gonna
eat this grilled cheese?

283
00:12:02,396 --> 00:12:04,897
No, don't eat that.
That's Stewie's lunch.

284
00:12:04,898 --> 00:12:06,733
Oh, my God, Stewie!

285
00:12:06,734 --> 00:12:09,485
I forgot, he's been in a
time-out for six hours.

286
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:14,474
Stewie? Oh, no, where is he?

287
00:12:14,475 --> 00:12:17,310
He's gone... I'm gonna
be in so much trouble.

288
00:12:17,311 --> 00:12:19,445
I tried to tell you,
watching Stewie wasn't easy.

289
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:22,582
Oh... Aw, man, this is terrible.

290
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,185
Stewie could be anywhere.

291
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,851
Sorry, I forgot my jacket.

292
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,642
Okay, everybody, we're gonna
do some double-play drills.

293
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,010
Oh, yeah, a little infield.

294
00:12:51,011 --> 00:12:52,478
Let's flash some leather, huh, guys?

295
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:54,147
Who wants to play second?

296
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:54,981
I will.

297
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,983
Lois, why don't you take second?

298
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,018
How could he not see that?

299
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:01,254
I even held up my arm
with my other hand.

300
00:13:01,255 --> 00:13:02,722
That is the most noticeable way

301
00:13:02,723 --> 00:13:03,856
to raise your hand.

302
00:13:03,857 --> 00:13:04,957
Okay, Griffin, you go out there

303
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:05,910
and be the base runner.

304
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,328
All right, Peter, show 'em what you got.

305
00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:10,897
Okay, Lois, catch the ball,

306
00:13:10,898 --> 00:13:12,398
and if your foot comes off the bag,

307
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,667
just tag Peter on any part of his body.

308
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,269
How could I miss, right?

309
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,004
It'll be like tagging a barn.

310
00:13:20,207 --> 00:13:22,675
Sorry, Peter, that's baseball.

311
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:26,729
I'll show you baseball, you
sexually unsatisfied wife!

312
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:34,003
Oh.

313
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:46,332
Yeah! Now, that's a
big-league slide, huh, coach?

314
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,934
Damn it!

315
00:13:47,935 --> 00:13:49,669
I think it's broken.

316
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,404
Griffin, what are you, an idiot?

317
00:13:51,405 --> 00:13:53,239
Yeah, an idiot who's gonna show up

318
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,341
on<i> SportsCenter</i> tonight.

319
00:13:55,342 --> 00:13:56,542
Coming up after the break,

320
00:13:56,543 --> 00:13:58,511
we'll have highlights of the
playoff game between...

321
00:13:58,512 --> 00:13:59,895
Streaking. Unrelated.

322
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,311
Yep, her leg is fractured.

323
00:14:07,312 --> 00:14:08,679
We should get her to the hospital.

324
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,215
My only medical training
is to say "Walk it off."

325
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:12,917
- Can you walk it off?
- No!

326
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,519
Oh, well, that's not good.

327
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,255
Okay, I'm gonna go fake-use
the phone in the dugout.

328
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,390
Peter, what the hell got into you?

329
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,826
Nothing. I was just trying to
play hard, like Pete Rose.

330
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:24,197
Look, I can even do the
Pete Rose haircut.

331
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:28,099
I bet you a thousand bucks
I have a drinking problem.

332
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,001
Guys, we got to get that leg set.

333
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,702
I guess I should ride in the ambulance.

334
00:14:31,703 --> 00:14:33,437
You think I'll be back
in time for the game?

335
00:14:33,438 --> 00:14:35,373
What? You're not playing in the game.

336
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,974
It's supposed to be a fun day out here,

337
00:14:36,975 --> 00:14:39,310
and you go nuts and
break your wife's leg.

338
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:40,945
It's not my fault, I'm all hopped up

339
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:43,091
on hard baseball card gum.

340
00:14:47,937 --> 00:14:51,355
Mmm, it's like eating a MasterCard.

341
00:14:51,356 --> 00:14:52,850
Let's get her out of here.

342
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,060
And you, you're done.

343
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,630
Clean out your locker!

344
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,198
Kicked out? I'm totally screwed.

345
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,733
Like those poor guys who had to come up

346
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:05,002
with a new ad campaign for Subway.

347
00:15:05,003 --> 00:15:06,504
Hey, I'm Mike.

348
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:09,073
I like sandwiches and people my own age.

349
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:12,426
<i> Subway... please don't
think of pedophilia.</i>

350
00:15:19,068 --> 00:15:20,918
You know what I'm
getting sick of saying?

351
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:23,955
"My husband did this to me,
but it's not what you think."

352
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:26,424
Please forgive me, Lois. I'm so stupid.

353
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,159
The reason I didn't bring my friends is

354
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,261
'cause I didn't want 'em
hogging the spotlight.

355
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,597
And then when I saw everyone
giving you all that attention,

356
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,966
I-I guess I kind of lost it.

357
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,801
You did a little.

358
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:39,170
But of course I forgive you.

359
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:42,006
I just don't understand
why you went so crazy.

360
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:43,874
Well, ever since I was little,

361
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,876
I was always the fat, uncoordinated kid

362
00:15:45,877 --> 00:15:47,511
that nobody wanted on their team.

363
00:15:47,512 --> 00:15:49,580
And I was excited that for one weekend,

364
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,315
if I could just step on that field

365
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:53,150
and get a hit at Fenway Park,

366
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:55,286
I could erase all that
and feel like a champ

367
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,921
for the first time in my life.

368
00:15:56,922 --> 00:16:00,524
But I'm not a champ, I'm a fat loser.

369
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:02,242
No wonder nobody ever picked me.

370
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,564
I picked you, Peter.

371
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:10,201
And to me and our kids, you
will always be a winner.

372
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,003
Thanks, Lois.

373
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,738
And you know what? If that's true,

374
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,473
I don't need to play in some stupid

375
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,074
fantasy baseball game.

376
00:16:17,075 --> 00:16:18,209
Well, guess what.

377
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,410
You're gonna play in that game,

378
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:20,778
and you're gonna get that hit.

379
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,847
And when you do, we're
all gonna be there

380
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:23,981
to cheer you on.

381
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:26,384
Really? Well, how's that gonna happen?

382
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,486
Peter, these guys have
been sexually harassing me

383
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,854
since the second I got here.

384
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,922
Either you play, or every
one of these Red Sox

385
00:16:31,923 --> 00:16:34,692
are going to jail... Even Ted Williams.

386
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,293
Mmm, new meat.

387
00:16:36,294 --> 00:16:38,829
I think we're gonna get along just fine.

388
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,531
This is the number-one fear

389
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:42,210
of only being a head.

390
00:16:46,322 --> 00:16:49,974
Brian, do you always listen to
the Sirius XM preview station?

391
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,742
Yeah, I'm thinking about
pulling the trigger,

392
00:16:51,743 --> 00:16:53,210
but they make you sign,
like, a two-year...

393
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:55,012
Guys, who cares about your dumb radio?!

394
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:56,914
We can't find Stewie anywhere.

395
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,385
Hello. Oh, hi, Mom.

396
00:17:01,386 --> 00:17:03,054
Hi, honey. How you doing?

397
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,388
How's Stewie?

398
00:17:04,389 --> 00:17:06,657
Oh, he's great. Not lost or anything.

399
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,626
How's fantasy camp going?

400
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,828
Uh, your father broke
my leg out of jealousy,

401
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,396
but that didn't ruin our honeymoon,

402
00:17:12,397 --> 00:17:13,731
and it's not gonna ruin this.

403
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:16,167
So listen, I want all you guys

404
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:18,002
to drive up to Boston this afternoon

405
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:20,071
to see your father play in the big game.

406
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:22,339
Uh, wow, we'd love to...

407
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,909
Mom, but we promised Stewie

408
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,579
we'd perform a puppet
show for him later today.

409
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,549
Oh, you can perform it for
all of us up here in Boston.

410
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,050
The game's in two hours.

411
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:34,819
Drive safely.

412
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,038
Crap! Now we got to find Stewie
<i>and</i> write a puppet show.

413
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,193
We could repurpose my one-act farce.

414
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:45,021
Or we could write something<i> fresh.</i>

415
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,363
Look, just because it's
already been written

416
00:17:46,364 --> 00:17:47,898
doesn't mean it's not fresh.

417
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:50,134
What did I just say? Shut up!

418
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:53,003
We're in trouble. <i>I'm</i> in trouble.

419
00:17:53,004 --> 00:17:55,005
Hey, what's this, a dickweed convention?

420
00:17:55,006 --> 00:17:56,040
Stewie!

421
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,374
Oh, thank God you're home!

422
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,909
Where the hell have you been?

423
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:01,345
As far away from<i> her</i> as possible.

424
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:02,780
I forgot her name, honestly.

425
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:05,791
- Who, Meg?
- Yes, yes, Meg. She's scary and mean,

426
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,018
and I don't ever want her
to be in charge of me.

427
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:10,154
Are you afraid of me, little guy?

428
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:14,194
Oh, Stewie, I'm really sorry
I left you in that time-out.

429
00:18:14,196 --> 00:18:17,628
I love you very much, and
I'm so happy you're home.

430
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:19,630
You're my little brother.

431
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:21,000
Can you forgive me?

432
00:18:21,626 --> 00:18:24,468
Well... all right.

433
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,208
Can I have your baby?

434
00:18:31,209 --> 00:18:32,381
Don't let her in!

435
00:18:39,976 --> 00:18:41,351
We're all proud of you, Peter.

436
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:42,753
N-Now, don't be nervous.

437
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:44,688
I ain't nervous, Lois...
I'm just sweating

438
00:18:44,689 --> 00:18:47,424
'cause I was too embarrassed to
get nude in the locker room,

439
00:18:47,425 --> 00:18:49,527
so I'm wearing all this
over long pajamas.

440
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,929
Ladies and gentlemen, now batting

441
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:56,100
for the Boston Red Sox, Peter Griffin!

442
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,869
Fair ball! Run, Peter! Run it out!

443
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,725
Peter's Brain.

444
00:19:21,726 --> 00:19:23,594
Yeah, uh, this is the Muscle Department.

445
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,262
What the hell is he doing?

446
00:19:25,263 --> 00:19:27,631
Uh, apparently, he's trying to sprint.

447
00:19:27,632 --> 00:19:29,900
Sprint? He got winded
walking to the plate.

448
00:19:29,901 --> 00:19:32,770
And he's been out in the
blazing sun for two days.

449
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,505
Has he had any water?

450
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,541
No. He told his wife there's
juices in the hot dogs.

451
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:39,443
Well, I'm sorry, I got no choice

452
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:41,795
but to call for a
complete muscle failure.

453
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:49,119
Look! Dad's planking,

454
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,821
from, like, eight years ago!

455
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:52,823
Is there a Neiman Marcus in Boston?

456
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:55,776
Peter! Get up! Get up and run!

457
00:19:57,479 --> 00:19:58,929
- Run, Peter!
- Come on, Dad!

458
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:01,949
- We love you!
- Copley Place. How far is that?

459
00:20:12,194 --> 00:20:16,005
<i>I ran like a champion that
day, pushing through the pain</i>

460
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,550
<i>of two torn hamstrings
and a ruptured groin,</i>

461
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,510
<i>to leg out the hit at Fenway Park</i>

462
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,513
<i>I had always dreamed of.</i>

463
00:20:23,421 --> 00:20:26,590
<i>But nobody noticed, 'cause the
account manager from B of A</i>

464
00:20:26,591 --> 00:20:29,026
<i>who was playing third base
had a massive coronary</i>

465
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:31,647
<i>trying to field my crappy little nubber.</i>

466
00:20:32,214 --> 00:20:35,599
<i>The hit was amazing, but
what made it even better</i>

467
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,502
<i>was that my family was there
to share the moment with me.</i>

468
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:41,005
<i>And on the car ride home,
they put on a puppet show</i>

469
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:44,008
<i>that made me laugh so hard
I crashed into a tollbooth</i>

470
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,043
<i>on the Mass Pike, totaling the car</i>

471
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:48,045
<i>and breaking Lois's other leg.</i>

472
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:49,847
<i>The casts kind of smell,</i>

473
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:52,549
<i>so I won't let her sleep in
the bedroom till they're off.</i>

474
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,351
