<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:08,174
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

3
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:11,928
<i>But where are those
good old-fashioned values</i>

00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:14,847
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

5
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:18,267
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

6
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:21,604
<i>Lucky there's a man who
positively can do</i>

00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,189
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,899

00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,124
Welcome, everyone.

12
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,626
My name is Von Jiener,

13
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,962
and I'm Vice President
of Creative Bankruptcy

14
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:47,338
for the Fox TV network,

15
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:48,965
which, at the time of this writing,

16
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,591
is still a thing that exists.

17
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,385
Just from looking at
your clothes and weight,

18
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:55,638
I can tell you all watch a lot
of free network television.

19
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,056
Am I right?

20
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,642
Excellent.

21
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,978
You have been selected
to be part of a focus group

22
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,437
that could affect one of America's

23
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:06,566
most beloved television shows:<i>
Family Guy.</i>

24
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:09,026
That woman looks exactly like me.

25
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,961
That's your reflection, Peter.

26
00:01:10,962 --> 00:01:12,488
Oh.

27
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,031
I'm beautiful.

28
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,950
As you may or may not care,

29
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:18,000
<i>Family Guy</i> is in its 17th season.

30
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:20,079
And since Fox is now owned by Disney,

31
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,164
which will someday be owned by Netflix,

32
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,000
which will someday be owned by Pornhub,

33
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:27,211
we have decided that<i> Family Guy</i>
is ready for a reboot.

34
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:30,006
Reboot? I thought they said
it was a couple of tweaks.

35
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,757
Yeah, we're supposed to
trust these idiots?

36
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,842
That woman has her finger up her nose.

37
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,930
That's still your reflection, Peter.

38
00:01:35,931 --> 00:01:39,015
Oh. She's beautiful.

39
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:41,350
Now, as most unfunny women
will tell you,

40
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,144
women are very funny.

41
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:45,146
That's why our first reboot
is built around

42
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:47,273
the very popular Louise.

43
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:50,192
- It's Lois.
- Whatever. The mom.

44
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:53,363
<i><i> This is our time</i>

45
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,825
<i>This is our moment</i>

46

<i>This is a short song for syndication.</i>

47
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,200
Lois!

48
00:02:03,202 --> 00:02:04,624
Going to work, huh?

49
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,542
Yes, Joe, I'm going to work.

50
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:10,004
Great! More and more women
are doing that.

51
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,136
Good morning, goddess.

52
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,138
You know, I just want
to say again that you were

53
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,890
totally right last night to bring up

54
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,017
that thing I did wrong 11 years ago.

55
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,353
And please feel free
to bring it up again anytime,

56
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:27,897
even if we're talking about
something completely unrelated.

57
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,231
Thank you, Peter, I will.

58
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:32,026
Oh, I-I know you will.

59
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,527
- Morning, Lois.
- Hey, girl.

60
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:36,238
Oh, hello, gay couple
who's constantly jogging.

61
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,946
What are you up to this morning?

62
00:02:37,947 --> 00:02:39,909
Just adopting and pucker-kissing.

63
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,078
Yeah, we're network TV gay,

64
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,580
so all we can do is adopt children

65
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,582
and pucker-kiss, no tongue stuff.

66
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,709
- Isn't that right, sweetie?
- Mwah!

67
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,920
Well, I'm off to my high-powered job

68
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:54,131
at a fashion magazine,
greeting card company or winery.

69
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,005
I can't wait to see which.

70
00:02:56,006 --> 00:02:59,261
<i>Oh, yay! It's a winery!</i>

71
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,263
Good morning, Judy Greer.

72
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,602
Morning, Lois.
How was your night last night?

73
00:03:03,603 --> 00:03:05,518
Great. I worked out, made dinner,

74
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,852
a little family time,

75
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,947
and had Peter's ankles
up in the air by 11:00.

76
00:03:08,948 --> 00:03:10,773
God, I admire you.

77
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,604
That's what you're here for, Judy Greer.

78
00:03:12,605 --> 00:03:14,318
Oh, I almost forgot.

79
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,993
Bert wants to see you in his office.

80
00:03:15,994 --> 00:03:18,114
- Oh? What about?
- He didn't say.

81
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,199
But it sounded hashtag serious.

82
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,826
Aw, meeting with the boss.

83
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,909
This is gonna be worse than
finding a spider in the kitchen.

84
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,622
Oh, my God.

85
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,666
Peter, there's a spider in here!

86
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,169
Yeah, I know, genius.

87
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:33,963
Hi, Lois.

88
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,214
I wanted to let you know

89
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,550
I'm considering you for a big promotion.

90
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,301
Really? That's amazing.

91
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,971
Well, the job's not yours yet.

92
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,597
It's between you and one other person,

93
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,933
Smarmy J. Tie-Straightener the Third.

94
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:49,183
I hit a gay jogger
on my way to work today.

95
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,736
Sorry I only satisfied you
twice tonight.

96
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,946
I found a pouch of
Big League Chew earlier,

97
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,239
and my jaw is worn out.

98
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,116
You did great, Peter.

99
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,952
Good night, perfect.

100
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:09,957
Aw, I just don't know what to do
about this thing at work.

101
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,922
I... Are we still talking about that?

102
00:04:12,923 --> 00:04:14,628
I mean, it's fine
if we are, w-we just...

103
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,963
We talked about it before dinner

104
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,965
and-and during dinner and after dinner.

105
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,259
No, you're right. I'll be fine.

106
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,137
Good night, Peter.

107
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,805
Oh.

108
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,391
I just want this promotion so bad.

109
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,393
Okay, so we are talking about it.

110
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,812
You know what? I'll make a vision board.

111
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,732
See my success and be my success.

112
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:38,110
My testosterone is so low I
could not have thought of that.

113
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,696
Would you like me to put on
our sleep ocean noises

114
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,823
with an occasional
shocking seagull screech?

115
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,827
Yes, thanks. I have a big day tomorrow.

116
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:48,329
Good night.

117
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,004
Excuse me.

118
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,923
May I have your attention, please?

119
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,466
Now, I know you're all wondering

120
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,927
who is going to get the big promotion,

121
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:07,473
and I'm proud to announce
that person is Smarmy...

122
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:10,351
Excuse me, where do I put
this briefcase full of money?

123
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:11,852
Uh, who are you?

124
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,230
I'm president of Wine and
Paint Night Incorporated.

125
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,857
Lois Griffin just landed my account

126
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,026
through her wit,
charm and professionalism.

127
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,320
Is that so? Well, in that case,

128
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,739
the big promotion goes to Lois Griffin!

129
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:37,503
What can I say? I love my wife.

130
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,047
Eh, it's my show.
Why shouldn't this be me?

131
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,257
'Cause I'm the funny one.

132
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:42,925
Not on this show you're not.

133
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,885
Or am I?

134
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,179
Ah, I thought we had one more face.

135
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,722
So, what did you think?

136
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,100
And please keep in mind
that your spontaneous comments

137
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,561
will affect the jobs
of hundreds of people.

138
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:56,188
Come on, you idiots, don't screw me.

139
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,023
The show is from a woman's perspective,

140
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,609
but it still felt like
it was written by a man.

141
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,571
Okay, well, what if I told you shut up?

142
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,406
Yeah, kind of changes things,
doesn't it?

143
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,699
Anyone else?

144
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,492
I'm sorry, I was scrolling
through the weather

145
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,618
in random cities.

146
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,079
Great! You're taking this
very seriously.

147
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,748
You know what, I don't
really get<i> Family Guy.</i>

148
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,166
What's so hard to get?

149
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,918
You just need to have
grown up in the '80s

150
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,086
but still be a teenager.

151
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:22,214
So, based on that one episode
featuring Lois,

152
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,092
how many of you would
likely watch a second?

153
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,510
Son of a bitch!

154
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,095
Anything else?

155
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,970
Huh, 76 in Santa Fe right now.

156
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,065
Hey, what's going on in that room?

157
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,984
It's a focus group of Arby's executives

158
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,320
watching us eat.

159
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,822
- Oh!
- No way!

160
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,032
- He ate it!
- People will eat anything!

161
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,408
50 bucks says the fat girl eats

162
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,993
a third Big Beef 'n Cheddar.
Who's on it?

163
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,494
- Okay.
- I'll take that. -You got it.

164
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,753
- Oh, come on, buddy.
- Don't do it.

165
00:06:54,755 --> 00:06:55,998
Here she comes.

166
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,487
All right, kid, take your time.

167
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,712
- Yeah!
- Gross! -Damn it!

168
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,672
Many recent shows have found success

169
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:07,134
by rebooting themselves as
gritty supernatural teen dramas,

170
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,886
like<i> Teen Wolf</i> or<i> Riverdale,</i>

171
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:12,306
which are watched by as many
as 6,000 people a year,

172
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:15,100
so we thought a similar approach
might work for<i> Family Guy.</i>

173
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,145
I'm guessing we're wrong,
but let's find out for sure.

174
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:27,488
<i>Ooh, ooh...</i>

175
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:31,201
<i>Ooh, ooh...</i>

176
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:38,830
<i>It's a show for teens</i>

177
00:07:38,831 --> 00:07:42,791
<i>A sexy show for teens</i>

178
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:46,298
<i>Something's not normal</i>

179
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,176
<i>But what does normal mean</i>

180
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:53,348
<i>In a world that's on fire?</i>

181
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:10,781
Hey, Goldman,
great job with sports today.

182
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,366
Thanks, Chris. We're almost ready

183
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,865
for the important sports game.

184
00:08:13,866 --> 00:08:16,203
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Ruth.

185
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,038
Good gender-fluid shower?

186
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,207
<i>Great</i> gender-fluid shower.

187
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,167
Dad, what are you doing here?

188
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,211
Putting my gender fluid in the shower.

189
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,587
Also, I'm the town sheriff,

190
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,214
but you don't find that out till later

191
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,398
because it's not relevant to the story.

192
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,968
Chris, there you are.

193
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,971
Patty, what's wrong?
Why aren't you in bitch class?

194
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,431
It's your sister Meg.

195
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,850
She's... dead.

196
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,310
I have to go.

197
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,312
Wait, where are you going?

198
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,231
I'm gonna go to a club
I'm too young to get into

199
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,858
and listen to a band that's on a label

200
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:49,237
owned by the same parent company
as the network.

201
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:53,949
Hey, who left their
gender fluid in the shower?

202
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,636
<i>Sexy rain</i>

203
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,724
<i>Sexy rain.</i>

204
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:26,774
So, what can I get for you sexy teens?

205
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,415
Um, how's the vegetarian lasagne?

206
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,945
Terrible, even at the best restaurants.

207
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,986
We'll have five of those.

208
00:09:33,987 --> 00:09:37,534
It just doesn't make sense.
Who would want to kill Meg?

209
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,203
Um, can we all be quiet?

210
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,789
We've been asked to nod
our heads while the band plays

211
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,958
the song our parent company
is aggressively marketing.

212
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,087
<i>One of us is Richard Gere's kid</i>

213
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,630
<i>Ooh</i>

214
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,340
<i>One of us is Richard Gere's kid</i>

215
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,674
<i>Ooh</i>

216
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,177
<i>One of us is Richard Gere's kid.</i>

217
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,964
I can't even with this.

218
00:09:56,965 --> 00:10:00,202
I'm gonna go get some air
and pebble-up my nipples.

219
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,821
<i>Interior club</i>

220
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:17,658
<i>Moments later.</i>

221
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,702
You guys, check it out.
Patty just got into

222
00:10:19,704 --> 00:10:21,829
the college for people
with bright futures.

223
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,414
Oh, cool. Is she still gonna
major in "lot to live for"?

224
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,208
Yep. I think she's the one kid

225
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,210
who's gonna get out of this sexy town.

226
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,255
- Patty?!
- I'll be right there.

227
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:34,383
I just have to drink a product-
placement beverage first.

228
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:37,845
Peach Coke? Stop.

229
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,100
- Patty!
- Where are you?

230
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,727
Patty, are you out here?

231
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:46,895
Patty?

232
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,022
Oh, I hope nothing happened

233
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,275
to the most disposable member
of our cast.

234
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:53,444
Guys, look!

235
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,114
She's dead.

236
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:00,325
Boy, she... she did stiffen up
those nips, didn't she?

237
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,161
Y'all ready for your lasagnas?

238
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,664
We're in the woods.

239
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,543
Guys, it's time to fire up
our superpowers,

240
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:12,796
because we're also
lesser-known Marvel characters.

241
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,926
And I'm your neighbor,
who you didn't know

242
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,846
was also a superhero, Captain Pedantic.

243
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,806
Are you here to protect Zac and I?

244
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,017
Zac and<i> me,</i> but yeah.

245
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,820
Now is when you find out
I'm the sheriff.

246
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,827
I'm laying...

247
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,704
on a pinecone.

248
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,999
He means<i> lying</i> on a pinecone.

249
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,125
Now what happens?

250
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,419
Now one of us will become
a breakout movie star

251
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,567
and leave the series,
wrecking it for the rest of us.

252
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:59,092
Yay, it's me!

253
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,261
- Sir, what did you think?
- Pass.

254
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,472
Okay. And how many of you would watch it

255
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:07,059
if the girls were wearing
white shirts and black bras?

256
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,686
Peter, did you write
the focus group questions?

257
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,438
What? Course not.

258
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,023
"And if you're impressed by the size of

259
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,775
"Alexander Skarsgard's penis,

260
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,860
that doesn't make you gay, right?"

261
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,486
Answer him!

262
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,495
I know you've been here all day,

263
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,789
but it's not like
you have jobs to go to,

264
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,250
so I'm going to show you
one more reboot idea.

265
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,460
Which Wi-Fi should we be logging onto?

266
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,379
Glendale Galleria Public.

267
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,964
Yeah, that's what I've been trying.

268
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,924
Sometimes networks will cancel a show

269
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,385
only to reboot it
with less-popular characters

270
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:44,012
from the original, while
the more-popular actors go on

271
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:48,600
to find greater success in
movies or ugly public divorces.

272
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:02,614
<i>On which we used to rely</i>

273
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,701
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

274
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:09,204
<i>Lucky there's a man who
positively can do</i>

275
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,790
<i>All the things that make us</i>

276
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:17,046
<i>He's... a... Fam... ily... Guy!</i>

277
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,300
<i>Family Guy Again is filmed</i>

278
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,635
<i>before a live studio audience.</i>

279
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,430
I'll get it.

280
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:31,310
Hello? Oh, hey there, Stewie.

281
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,562
Or should I say, "G'day, mate,"

282
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,564
since you're in Queensland,
Australia, where you moved

283
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:38,066
with Brian and Meg
after Mom and Dad died?

284
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,486
Oh, married life is pretty good.

285
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,281
No, still no kids,
but I've been practicing

286
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,825
a lot by myself.

287
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,410
Masturbating, yes.

288
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:52,039
Between you and me, I think
Tricia might be barren.

289
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,546
Uh, Stewie, I better go.
Tricia's giving me that look.

290
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,633
Okay, give my love to Brian and Meg,

291
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,261
and hopefully we can come down
there for the season finale.

292
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,097
No? You're just not gonna be
a part of this at all?

293
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,932
Okay, then. Bye, Stewie.

294
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,643
Chris, I'm standing here
in the living room

295
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:17,230
because I need to talk to you
about something very important.

296
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,482
Look, we've been through this.

297
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:21,068
It's my house,
and I want to wear shoes in it.

298
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,819
Chris, I offer you a choice.

299
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,364
You can either continue
wearing shoes in the house

300
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:30,411
or continue having sex with this
age-defying Eastern physique.

301
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:43,131
Chris, I'm lying here
listening to you toss and turn,

302
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,468
and wondering if there's
something you'd like to discuss.

303
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:49,513
I don't know.
It's just, it's been so hard

304
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,181
since Mom and Dad died

305
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:53,809
and Joe moved in
with all his big band records.

306
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,937
Joe!

307
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:58,480
Chris, I'm lying here

308
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:01,691
asking you to kick Joe out of the house.

309
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,152
What? He was my dad's
best friend for 20 years.

310
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,487
I can't do that.

311
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,990
Chris, I offer you a choice.

312
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,745
Luckily, I'm the town windower.

313
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,331
For me, every day is a pane.

314
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,459
<i>Can we please stop this?</i>

315
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,527
Yes?

316
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:23,004
If I give you back my Diet
Sprite, can I leave?

317
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,631
How did you feel about the show?

318
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,883
- I didn't like it.
- Could you be more specific?

319
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,511
I just don't like the people
or what they're saying or doing.

320
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,221
If you could sum up the show
with one sound,

321
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:32,556
what would it be?

322
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,516
- "Blech."
- For me, it was more like

323
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,852
the last squirt of
a plastic mustard bottle.

324
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,688
Is that<i> our</i> mustard?

325
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:42,732
No. I always bring one with me
in case the show is kind of...

326
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:47,070
- Everybody, shut up!
- Hey, it's that sheriff from<i> The Q.</i>

327
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,447
You people don't like anything.

328
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,823
Well, if you're all so smart,

329
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:52,200
what do you want to see
in a<i> Family Guy</i> reboot?

330
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,911
Yes, unemployable neck tattoo guy.

331
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,118
It's a Bible verse.

332
00:15:56,119 --> 00:15:57,838
Doesn't matter.
Anything above the Adam's apple

333
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:58,915
means drugs.

334
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,917
I like Netflix. Could you be Netflix?

335
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,586
Yeah, Netflix is awesome.

336
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:03,962
Of course it's awesome; it's Netflix.

337
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,715
Look, we're stuck being Fox.
We have to deal with it, okay?

338
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,176
- I watch Fox.
- No, you don't. Nobody does.

339
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,261
Yeah, I like shows
that are binge-worthy.

340
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,013
First of all,
"binge-worthy" is not a word,

341
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,514
it's a marketing tool.

342
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,308
You've been brainwashed, sir. But fine.

343
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:19,269
We'll make<i> Family Guy</i> binge-worthy.

344
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,088
See? Wasn't that terrible?

345
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:14,282
All right, we only have the room
till 6:00, so what else?

346
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,077
It's not 6:00 yet! What else?!

347
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:20,038
<i>Young Sheldon</i> is good.
How about<i> Young Family Guy?</i>

348
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,706
How about I murder your whole family?

349
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,167
- What about<i> BoJack Horseman?</i>
- Hard no.

350
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,378
- You'd get to be a horse.
- Hard yes.

351
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:29,965
- Normal words, but a horse guy.
- Can we please stop this?

352
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,925
You just asked for specifically that.

353
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:34,469
It's not 6:00! What else?

354
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,222
- I like that<i> Antiques Roadshow.</i>
- Fine.

355
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,431
And you're saying this is...?

356
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,849
George Washington's poop.
That's correct.

357
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,851
I have some news you might not like.

358
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,353
The poop is only two weeks old.

359
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:44,896
What? How can you be sure?

360
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,148
Well, for starters,
there's a Skittle in it.

361
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,277
Ah, the general had a sweet tooth, huh?

362
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:51,987
Um, that was horrible.

363
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,321
Eh, I'm gonna tweeze the Skittle out

364
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,489
and go back in a week.

365
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,783
I like those Netflix stand-up specials.

366
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,368
Great. Matter of fact, we filmed one

367
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:01,538
back when I was an all-setup-
no-punch-line comedian.

368
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,582
So, any of you out there have a futon?

369
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,167
Yeah, yeah, right?

370
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,919
I Ubered here tonight.

371
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,881
Man, Starbucks.

372
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,092
Facebook, huh?

373
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,220
And how about that new chip
in credit cards?

374
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,889
Anybody ever been to Georgia?

375
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,933
The new iPhone is large.

376
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,604
EDM music.

377
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,230
Boo! You stink!

378
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,859
Yeah! Dane Cook already
did all these halves of jokes.

379
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,444
Hey, hey, this is my job.

380
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,363
I don't go down to Burger King.

381
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,573
That was terrible.

382
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,867
Netflix should make 800 more of those.

383
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,327
All right, what else?
What else you guys want?

384
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,412
I like that thing James Corden does:

385
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,457
<i>- Carpool Karaoke.</i>
- I can do that.

386
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,667
Hi. You having a good night? I did.

387
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,419
Just had a devil's three-way.

388
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,004
You know, me and two guys.

389
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,923
I think that's just gay sex.
Why are you telling me all this?

390
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,884
Isn't this<i> Taxicab Confessions?</i>

391
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,053
No, this is<i> Carpool Karaoke.</i>

392
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,971
We're about to sing an Adele song.

393
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,097
Oh, that's gay.

394
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,266
Pull over by this hot guy
and let me out.

395
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,227
I thought I read you guys
were phasing out gay jokes.

396
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,104
That quote was taken out of context

397
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,272
and widely misunderstood.

398
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,815
All right, what's next, you sheep?

399
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,443
I like the Olympics.
Can you guys be the Olympics?

400
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:15,487
Well, NBC hogs all the good sports,

401
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,197
so we'll get stuck with the boring ones

402
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,991
that the announcers always
have to keep apologizing for.

403
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,992
Welcome back to pairs diving.

404
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:23,828
And once again,
we are so sorry for this.

405
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,205
Brian, anything to add?

406
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:28,041
No, just our deepest
condolences to a bored nation.

407
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,459
And we've got Lois down at the pool.

408
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,087
- Lois, anything?
- No. Guys, just so sorry

409
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,421
that any of this is happening.

410
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,507
I-I mean, even once every four years

411
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,258
seems like just way too much.

412
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,845
And they're up in the air,
and now they're in the water.

413
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,139
What is it again? A splash is bad?

414
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,724
Uh, yeah, I think so.

415
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,267
That's so stupid.

416
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,228
I'm sick of all the voices on your show.

417
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,979
- Can you change them up?
- To who?

418
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,648
I like Jon Benjamin voices.

419
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,775
Can you all be Jon Benjamin voices?

420
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,214
- Hey, Joe.
- Hey, Peter.

421
00:19:55,215 --> 00:19:57,904
- Hey, Quagmire.
- Hey, Cleveland. Giggity.

422
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,989
What can I get for you fellas?

423
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,034
Nobody touches<i> my</i> voice.

424
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,494
I liked all of that.

425
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,162
Um, except for the bartender.

426
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,708
Hey, guys, The Coffee Bean's
Wi-Fi doesn't need a password.

427
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,376
Everyone, the reboot is off.

428
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,378
It turns out
the executive who ordered it

429
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,714
was just a squirrel
who snuck into the office.

430
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,340
- What?
- Yes. But in fairness,

431
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,760
it was the same squirrel who
green-lit<i> Brooklyn Nine-Nine,</i>

432
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,345
the show that challenged the notion

433
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,098
that only attractive people
can be on television.

434
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:27,058
So, what does that mean?

435
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,478
It means<i> Family Guy</i>
is just fine as it is.

436
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,526
Well, the<i> Family Guy</i> reboot is off.

437
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:38,069
What other ideas do we have?

438
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,948
<i>Brooklyn Nine-Ten?</i>

439
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:45,161
It's possible
this guy only has one idea.

440
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:53,543
You know what, I'm glad, after all that,

441
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,587
they let us keep the show
the way it was.

442
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,547
Well, not exactly the way it was.

443
00:20:57,548 --> 00:21:01,092
Hey, buddy, I brought over
my big band records.

444
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,971
- They wanted more Joe.
- They wanted more Joe.

445
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,354
<i>Your show should have more Joe Swanson.</i>

446
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:26,409
<i>Your show should have more Joe Swanson.</i>
