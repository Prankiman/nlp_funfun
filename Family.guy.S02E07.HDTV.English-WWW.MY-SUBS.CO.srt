"It seems today that all you see

2
00:00:06,098 --> 00:00:09,295
"is violence in movies and sex on TV

3
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:13,264
"But where are those good,
old-fashioned values

4
00:00:13,372 --> 00:00:15,738
"on which we used to rely?

5
00:00:16,342 --> 00:00:19,175
"Lucky there's a family guy

6
00:00:19,612 --> 00:00:22,740
"Lucky there's a man who'll
positively tell you

7
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:24,476
"all the things that make us

8
00:00:24,617 --> 00:00:26,175
"laugh 'n' cry

"He's a family guy"

10
00:00:34,227 --> 00:00:36,388
It was a moving scene today
at Hatch Pond...

11
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:39,987
...as six members of the Pawtucket
fire department struggled valiantly...

12
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:42,761
...to save a fish's life
trapped under the frozen ice.

13
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:45,235
Rescue workers got the fish
out of the water...

14
00:00:45,338 --> 00:00:47,568
...but unfortunately it died shortly after.

15
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:49,474
Diane?

16
00:00:49,575 --> 00:00:51,975
Tom, another life
was tragically cut short today.

17
00:00:52,078 --> 00:00:55,844
Robert Kimble, founder of a local theater
group known as the Quahog Players...

18
00:00:55,948 --> 00:00:57,415
...passed away this afternoon.

19
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:58,346
Oh, my God!

20
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:02,919
Kimble was a hands-on director who
often appeared in his own shows...

21
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:04,751
...most recently, Miss Saigon.

22
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:07,348
"La la la la la, Miss Saigon

23
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,088
"La la la la la, Miss Saigon"

24
00:01:10,596 --> 00:01:13,258
Yes, I just heard. It's so sad.

25
00:01:13,966 --> 00:01:14,955
Really?

26
00:01:15,234 --> 00:01:18,431
They want me to be the new
artistic director of the Quahog Players!

27
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,505
- All right, Mom!
- Are you gonna do it?

28
00:01:20,606 --> 00:01:23,666
I don't know. It's such a big responsibility.

29
00:01:23,776 --> 00:01:25,300
I need a moment to think.

30
00:01:29,582 --> 00:01:31,209
Okay, I'll do it.

31
00:01:31,317 --> 00:01:35,947
This just in. Lois Griffin is named the new
artistic director of the Quahog Players.

32
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:38,888
All those years of paying my dues
as musical director...

33
00:01:38,991 --> 00:01:41,391
...under that old hack have finally paid off.

34
00:01:41,694 --> 00:01:43,059
Lois, congratulations.

35
00:01:43,162 --> 00:01:46,620
Our little theater group finally has
a committed visionary at its helm.

36
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,199
And such an attractive one.

37
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:50,997
Brian, you'll have to audition
just like everyone else.

38
00:01:51,103 --> 00:01:52,400
God, of course. I...

39
00:01:52,505 --> 00:01:54,996
You didn't think... You thought I was...

40
00:01:55,107 --> 00:01:56,096
Lois!

41
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:59,006
- I can paint scenery.
- Can I be in the show, Mom?

42
00:01:59,111 --> 00:02:02,410
Yes, you can be the dumpy teenager
who stays backstage and cries...

43
00:02:02,515 --> 00:02:04,540
...because nobody finds her attractive.

44
00:02:06,218 --> 00:02:08,880
- Hey, you guys.
- Peter, guess what? I am gonna...

45
00:02:08,988 --> 00:02:12,048
Me first! Mr. Weed said
whoever comes up with the best idea...

46
00:02:12,158 --> 00:02:14,888
...for the big Christmas toy this year
gets a huge bonus.

47
00:02:14,994 --> 00:02:17,326
Hey, Dad,
why don't you invent the Frisbee?

48
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,761
That's an awesome toy.

49
00:02:18,864 --> 00:02:22,027
- It's already been invented.
- Then how come I never heard of it?

50
00:02:22,234 --> 00:02:25,431
This is my chance to prove
how valuable I am to the company!

51
00:02:25,738 --> 00:02:27,399
Sorry, Lois. What's your news?

52
00:02:27,506 --> 00:02:28,598
Well, I...

53
00:02:33,245 --> 00:02:35,645
Mr. Weed,
distinguished members of the board...

54
00:02:35,748 --> 00:02:38,216
...may I present this year's hottest toy...

55
00:02:38,317 --> 00:02:39,978
...Mr. Zucchini Head.

56
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,188
He's got stupid cool hip-hop style
with his little hat and his Doc Martens.

57
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,823
Thank you, Peter, that's enough.

58
00:02:47,927 --> 00:02:50,657
Wait. This is the best part! He dances!

59
00:02:51,263 --> 00:02:53,163
I've seen enough.
Inappropriate.

60
00:02:53,265 --> 00:02:54,698
I haven't had sex in ages.

61
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,166
Gentlemen,
I apologize for wasting your time.

62
00:02:57,269 --> 00:02:59,567
Peter is an adequate
assembly-line worker...

63
00:02:59,672 --> 00:03:03,301
...but you'll be happy to know
our company does not pay him to think.

64
00:03:06,412 --> 00:03:07,674
I'll take this.

65
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:09,114
No calls.

66
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:14,614
Come on, kids!
The director can't be late for the auditions.

67
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,779
You should've heard them laughing at me.

68
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:20,086
I got great ideas, but they look at me,
and all they see is a loser.

69
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:23,684
Except that guy with the lazy eye.
He sees a loser and the snack machine.

70
00:03:23,796 --> 00:03:26,959
Peter, a lot of creative people
had mindless jobs.

71
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:29,591
Michelangelo worked in a marble quarry.

72
00:03:29,702 --> 00:03:32,227
Herman Melville was a customs agent.

73
00:03:32,605 --> 00:03:35,039
Albert Einstein
worked for the patent office.

74
00:03:35,941 --> 00:03:38,205
And what is it you want to patent,
Herr Smith?

75
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,676
I call it "Smith's Theory of Relativity."

76
00:03:41,814 --> 00:03:43,304
- Hey, look at this.
- What?

77
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:49,048
I think Lois is saying that...

78
00:03:49,155 --> 00:03:51,988
...you have to find a way
to express yourself creatively.

79
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:56,960
For example, Chris has his drawing,
Meg does her birdcalls, I sing beautifully.

80
00:03:57,463 --> 00:03:58,589
So I've heard.

81
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,426
And Lois has her theater group.

82
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:04,025
Yes. And for my first production,
I've chosen The King and I.

83
00:04:04,136 --> 00:04:07,105
It's a wonderful story
about a loving, patient woman...

84
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:11,404
...who introduces culture and civility
to a barbaric, patriarchal...

85
00:04:11,677 --> 00:04:14,202
Peter, please don't wipe your nose
on the couch.

86
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,447
Look, I have to go.

87
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:19,882
Part of being creative is figuring out
what you're good at.

88
00:04:19,985 --> 00:04:22,647
I know you can do it
if you put your mind to it.

89
00:04:22,755 --> 00:04:26,851
You're right. Man was meant to create.
That's why God invented Shrinky Dinks.

90
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,393
It works! Look how tiny they are!

91
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:40,569
"Oh, no not in springtime

92
00:04:40,673 --> 00:04:45,667
"summer, winter, or fall

93
00:04:49,348 --> 00:04:54,308
"No, never would I leave you

94
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:58,390
"at all"

95
00:04:58,557 --> 00:04:59,546
Bravo!

96
00:04:59,658 --> 00:05:03,116
Brian, that was beautiful!
Thank you!

97
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:04,719
No, thank you.

98
00:05:04,897 --> 00:05:09,095
And that note you gave me, "louder,"
I was thinking that, and then you said it.

99
00:05:09,201 --> 00:05:12,728
You're so intuitive. It's a pleasure...
Okay. Next!

100
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:17,475
Stewie, do you want to try out
for Mommy's play?

101
00:05:20,646 --> 00:05:25,606
"Now is the winter of our discontent
made glorious summer by this sun of York.

102
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:29,111
- "And all..."
- Why don't you sing Itsy Bitsy Spider?

103
00:05:29,722 --> 00:05:33,055
How dare you reduce
my finely hewn thespian stylings...

104
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,786
...to mere Mother Gooseries!

105
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:37,024
Sing Baa Baa Black Sheep!

106
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:41,327
Mother, as first lady of the American stage,
Helen Hayes, once said:

107
00:05:41,934 --> 00:05:43,799
"I'm going to kill you!"

108
00:05:43,903 --> 00:05:46,565
Hey, can somebody give me a hand
with all this talent?

109
00:05:46,672 --> 00:05:48,162
Peter, what are you doing here?

110
00:05:48,274 --> 00:05:51,266
Well, Lois, I tried finding my creativity,
like you said.

111
00:05:51,377 --> 00:05:52,776
First I took an art class.

112
00:05:53,913 --> 00:05:56,541
Am I supposed to draw the penis?

113
00:05:57,082 --> 00:05:58,549
Then I tried sculpting.

114
00:05:59,685 --> 00:06:02,586
Am I supposed to sculpt the penis?

115
00:06:02,688 --> 00:06:03,882
Then I tried music.

116
00:06:05,257 --> 00:06:08,158
Am I supposed to conduct with my penis?

117
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,751
I started to think
there was nothing I'd be good at.

118
00:06:10,863 --> 00:06:12,694
But then I realized that this is it.

119
00:06:12,865 --> 00:06:15,925
Lois, my penis belongs on stage.

120
00:06:16,035 --> 00:06:19,630
Wait, Peter, everyone has to audition.
You know, sing, dance.

121
00:06:20,873 --> 00:06:21,862
I get it.

122
00:06:24,109 --> 00:06:25,235
Hello, everybody.

123
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:28,711
This is just a formality,
since I happen to be doing the director.

124
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,517
Five, six, seven, eight.

125
00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:37,712
"Marshall, Will, and Holly,
on a routine expedition

126
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:41,953
"Met the greatest earthquake ever known

127
00:06:42,228 --> 00:06:46,392
"High on the rapids, it struck their tiny raft

128
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:51,728
"And plunged them down
a thousand feet below

129
00:06:52,137 --> 00:06:56,198
"to the Land of the Lost"

130
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:04,083
Before I post the cast list...

131
00:07:04,183 --> 00:07:07,812
...my choreographer and I
want to thank everyone for auditioning.

132
00:07:07,953 --> 00:07:10,251
- You were all great.
- Weren't they?

133
00:07:10,422 --> 00:07:13,050
I only wish the show was called
The King and Us...

134
00:07:13,158 --> 00:07:14,625
...so I could cast you all.

135
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:26,633
Anna! Baby, baby! I'm a star!

136
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:29,806
Wow. I've never hugged a celebrity before.

137
00:07:30,276 --> 00:07:32,938
Except for Pearl Bailey
at a book signing once...

138
00:07:33,145 --> 00:07:36,273
...but then we later found out
it wasn't actually her.

139
00:07:36,448 --> 00:07:40,282
Siamese baby?
Stewie Griffin does not play bit parts!

140
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,984
You wanted a bigger part,
didn't you, sweetie?

141
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,215
To hell with you!

142
00:07:45,524 --> 00:07:48,118
Perhaps I'll skip the stage
and go directly to films!

143
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:53,354
- Hello.
- What is that on your ear?

144
00:07:53,499 --> 00:07:55,626
Is that hair gel?

145
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:58,669
- Yeah.
- Great, 'cause I could use some.

146
00:07:58,771 --> 00:08:00,864
- No, don't!
- I just ran out.

147
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:08,208
Man! Chorus! Shoot, what a gyp!

148
00:08:08,314 --> 00:08:12,216
The King of Siam? Why,
that's the lead! This is so unexpected!

149
00:08:12,318 --> 00:08:13,683
Hey, shut up!

150
00:08:14,753 --> 00:08:17,483
The King of Siam? Why, that's the lead!

151
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:20,820
Lois, I think you made a mistake.
I'm not "The King."

152
00:08:20,993 --> 00:08:22,984
I'm not "I," I'm not anybody.

153
00:08:23,662 --> 00:08:26,597
- So, what? I had sex with you for nothing?
- No, Peter, I...

154
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:29,896
It's just that directing this show
is a big opportunity for me...

155
00:08:30,002 --> 00:08:32,129
...and I don't want anything to ruin it.

156
00:08:32,237 --> 00:08:33,670
- Ruin it?
- Yes.

157
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:36,468
By not using you to your full potential.

158
00:08:36,775 --> 00:08:39,107
You have too much talent for the stage.

159
00:08:39,211 --> 00:08:41,008
You should...

160
00:08:43,248 --> 00:08:44,738
You should be a producer.

161
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,784
A producer? Gee, I don't know.

162
00:08:48,921 --> 00:08:51,617
Great news, Edgar Bronfman, Jr.

163
00:08:51,757 --> 00:08:55,420
We made the deal.
We're richer and more powerful than ever!

164
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:57,294
I'm the king of the...

165
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:01,488
Damn it!

166
00:09:11,577 --> 00:09:13,807
I love Mexicans. I'll do it!

167
00:09:19,118 --> 00:09:21,814
Hang on, hang on!
You overextended the plié!

168
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,081
You screwed it all up.
Let me show you again.

169
00:09:24,923 --> 00:09:27,187
Okay, boys! Let's do it!

170
00:09:27,626 --> 00:09:29,651
And one, two, three.

171
00:09:29,762 --> 00:09:32,595
And just like this.
And watch my feet. And one, two, three.

172
00:09:33,332 --> 00:09:36,859
Peter, Chris says you told him
to build a set for the North Pole.

173
00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:40,630
Yeah, that's where Anna goes
to talk with her best friend, a penguin.

174
00:09:40,806 --> 00:09:43,366
There is no talking penguin
in The King and I.

175
00:09:43,475 --> 00:09:46,137
There is in
"Peter Griffin presents The King and I."

176
00:09:46,245 --> 00:09:47,212
What?

177
00:09:47,312 --> 00:09:49,906
Now we gotta think of
some funny stuff for him to say.

178
00:09:50,015 --> 00:09:53,746
Peter, the director decides
whether or not to add a character.

179
00:09:53,952 --> 00:09:55,681
You're the producer, remember?

180
00:09:55,788 --> 00:09:58,120
What am I supposed to do
with all my great ideas?

181
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,384
Put 'em in a tub
and clean myself with them?

182
00:10:00,492 --> 00:10:02,392
'Cause that's what soap is for, Lois.

183
00:10:02,494 --> 00:10:06,055
Good producers put their ideas to work
outside the theater.

184
00:10:06,165 --> 00:10:09,464
It's your job to make sure
we sell every seat in this house.

185
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:11,866
- And that's creative?
- Is it?

186
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,768
Well, it's just
the most creative job there is.

187
00:10:14,873 --> 00:10:17,171
Don't you worry, Lois. I'll get the word out.

188
00:10:17,276 --> 00:10:19,676
I'll tell two friends,
and they'll tell two friends...

189
00:10:19,778 --> 00:10:21,905
...and that's, like, 10 people right there.

190
00:10:26,718 --> 00:10:28,948
Hey, I recognize you from the television.

191
00:10:29,054 --> 00:10:31,614
You're Tom Tucker. I bet you can do this.

192
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,593
Excuse me?
You. Get out of here!

193
00:10:37,696 --> 00:10:40,460
Get out of here! Go on, get out of here!

194
00:10:43,802 --> 00:10:47,294
- Wow! Diane Simmons!
- You don't look anything like the ad.

195
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:52,106
- You better be huge.
- No, I'm Peter Griffin, producer.

196
00:10:52,211 --> 00:10:55,112
I'm presenting
"Peter Griffin presents The King and l"...

197
00:10:55,214 --> 00:10:58,615
...a Peter Griffin production,
and I'm giving you the exclusive story.

198
00:10:58,717 --> 00:11:01,743
Look, pal, some two-bit
community theater production isn't news.

199
00:11:01,854 --> 00:11:02,843
Who's the star?

200
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:06,186
For that matter, who the hell are you,
and why should I give a damn?

201
00:11:06,692 --> 00:11:09,490
Wow, I'm being interviewed
by Diane Simmons!

202
00:11:10,696 --> 00:11:12,960
Well, Lois,
you told me to produce, and I did.

203
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,395
I got us a story on the 11:00 news.

204
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:17,298
- Really?
- Peter.

205
00:11:17,436 --> 00:11:20,371
Our top story tonight.
I will be playing the role of Anna...

206
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:23,202
...in the Quahog Players production
of The King and I.

207
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,502
- Tom?
- Thanks, Diane.

208
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,102
In other news, I'm not going to the play
because I'm sure it'll be lousy.

209
00:11:28,213 --> 00:11:31,307
I'm getting late word
that you're a petty, jealous, closet case.

210
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:34,852
Bit of breaking news. We now go live
to Diane being a bitch. Diane?

211
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:39,018
But Loretta's playing Anna,
and she's doing a great job.

212
00:11:39,124 --> 00:11:41,888
Loretta's a nobody.
Diane Simmons is a star.

213
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:44,019
You wanted me to sell tickets, right?

214
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:47,689
People who've never been in a theater
will come see Diane Simmons.

215
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:50,393
I don't know, Peter, she's a news reporter.

216
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:53,903
Some of our greatest actors
started in news, like Sean Penn.

217
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:58,602
Today's weather calls for breezy skies
and sun, and there's gonna be a...

218
00:11:59,144 --> 00:12:01,044
Get that camera out of my face!

219
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,845
Hey, everybody, here's our star!

220
00:12:06,985 --> 00:12:08,213
This is so awkward.

221
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,084
You all know my name,
and I've never heard of any of you.

222
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:14,681
- You ever acted before, honey?
- I did an independent film in college.

223
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:48,048
Let's start with the scene where
Lady Thiang begs Anna to comfort the king.

224
00:12:48,694 --> 00:12:52,755
- Are you playing Lady Thiang?
- I was supposed to be Anna.

225
00:12:53,265 --> 00:12:56,996
They did an all-you-people version
of Hello, Dolly that was very successful.

226
00:12:57,102 --> 00:12:59,900
Okay, let's go from the top of Scene 7.

227
00:13:00,138 --> 00:13:01,127
Action!

228
00:13:01,273 --> 00:13:05,334
"Oh, Mrs. Anna, the king needs you.
You must go to him.

229
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:10,681
"Lady Thiang, if he needs me,
truly needs me, I will go to him."

230
00:13:10,782 --> 00:13:12,340
Cut! All wrong! No good!

231
00:13:12,451 --> 00:13:14,646
Peter, what are you doing?
She was wonderful.

232
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:15,617
My ass.

233
00:13:15,721 --> 00:13:17,382
Besides, I'm the director.

234
00:13:17,489 --> 00:13:19,389
It just doesn't feel real, you know?

235
00:13:19,491 --> 00:13:21,959
Anna and Miss Thing both love
the king, right?

236
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,858
On Springer yesterday,
they had "I won't share my husband"...

237
00:13:24,963 --> 00:13:28,228
...and these two women bitch-slapped
each other. The crowd went nuts.

238
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:31,461
- Loretta, why don't you try slapping Diane?
- I think I can do that.

239
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:34,197
Wait a minute.
Nobody's slapping anybody.

240
00:13:34,306 --> 00:13:37,434
This is Rodgers and Hammerstein,
not trash TV!

241
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:39,635
I think Peter may be onto something.

242
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:42,372
Springer is one of our station's
highest-rated shows.

243
00:13:42,514 --> 00:13:43,515
- I don't know.
- I thought you wanted to do a good show?

244
00:13:43,515 --> 00:13:45,449
- I don't know.
- I thought you wanted to do a good show?

245
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,383
If you want to do a bad show,
why don't we just do Rent?

246
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,815
I guess we can try that...
- Action!

247
00:13:52,224 --> 00:13:56,024
Come on, Lois. Those hoop skirts
make Diane look a little hippie, you know?

248
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:59,291
I thought we could dress her
in a pair of sequined capri pants.

249
00:13:59,398 --> 00:14:02,367
They didn't have capri pants in the 1860s.

250
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,264
They did now!

251
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:07,668
You! You are the worst thing
to happen to musical theater...

252
00:14:07,773 --> 00:14:09,400
...since Andrew Lloyd Webber!

253
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:13,039
And you! I just plain don't like you!

254
00:14:17,015 --> 00:14:18,243
What's going on?

255
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:21,547
We're just having a little pow-wow
to discuss my latest changes.

256
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:22,915
What changes?

257
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:26,552
The Siamese children. How about this?
They're not children.

258
00:14:27,025 --> 00:14:28,652
They're aliens!

259
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,155
That was great.
On the money.

260
00:14:31,263 --> 00:14:32,730
Isn't he brilliant?

261
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:36,767
No! He's not brilliant!
Rodgers and Hammerstein were brilliant!

262
00:14:36,868 --> 00:14:41,305
And I want to do the show they wrote!
We're not making any more changes!

263
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,498
We sold out!

264
00:14:42,607 --> 00:14:45,371
Yeah. The whole town's talking
about your show, Dad!

265
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:49,143
Your show? Peter, this is my show!

266
00:14:49,247 --> 00:14:51,841
What's the big deal?
You wanted to sell out, and we did.

267
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,383
I am through selling out.

268
00:14:53,485 --> 00:14:56,613
I took this job because
I wanted to create something beautiful...

269
00:14:56,722 --> 00:14:58,417
...and you've completely destroyed that!

270
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:01,287
You want to be the director? Fine! I quit!

271
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,691
Me, direct?

272
00:15:04,096 --> 00:15:07,088
I don't know what to say, except,
"I'm the king of the..."

273
00:15:10,502 --> 00:15:12,766
Morning, theater fans!

274
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:15,840
Good morning, Peter.
I made your favorite breakfast.

275
00:15:16,975 --> 00:15:19,034
- What the hell is this?
- French toast.

276
00:15:19,144 --> 00:15:22,011
I just made a few creative changes
to the recipe.

277
00:15:22,114 --> 00:15:23,911
I think it's a lot better now.

278
00:15:24,116 --> 00:15:27,108
Lois, if this is your idea of a joke,
you must write for Leno.

279
00:15:27,853 --> 00:15:30,822
It is so fashionable to take a shot
at Jay Leno.

280
00:15:30,922 --> 00:15:35,154
Look, the fact is the man is out there
every bloody night with fresh material...

281
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,522
...and he's charming.

282
00:15:36,628 --> 00:15:40,359
Face it, you're just jealous because
people like my ideas better than yours.

283
00:15:40,465 --> 00:15:42,865
I don't care
if the whole world loves your ideas.

284
00:15:42,968 --> 00:15:46,335
That doesn't make them good.
I was trying to make art.

285
00:15:46,872 --> 00:15:47,896
Art-schmart.

286
00:15:48,006 --> 00:15:50,201
Put enough monkeys in a room
with a typewriter...

287
00:15:50,308 --> 00:15:51,639
...they'll produce Shakespeare.

288
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:54,803
Let's see.
"A something by any other name..."

289
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:58,439
- "Carnation," "peony."
- No, they did that on last week's Marlowe.

290
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,814
- What about "daisy"?
- "Chrysanthemum"!

291
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,854
- "Iris," "rose"? What about "rose"?
- Did you say "rose"?

292
00:16:03,955 --> 00:16:05,582
- Yeah, "rose."
- "Rose" is good!

293
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:08,557
- "A rose by any other name." That works.
- I like that a lot.

294
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,560
- Moving on.
- What about "tulip"?

295
00:16:10,662 --> 00:16:12,095
"Rose" is fine. Moving on.

296
00:16:12,197 --> 00:16:14,893
Peter, you've never done a creative thing
in your life!

297
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,060
That's not true.
I wrote Bonfire of the Vanities.

298
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,535
No, you didn't.

299
00:16:21,173 --> 00:16:22,936
You win this round, Lois.

300
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:26,533
You're not being creative.
You're just destroying a wonderful show.

301
00:16:26,645 --> 00:16:31,514
I have more creativity in my whole body
than most people do before 9:00 a.m.

302
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,811
The only thing you create before 9:00 a. M...

303
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:36,183
...is exactly what you've turned
my show into.

304
00:16:36,354 --> 00:16:38,549
I think my work will speak for itself.

305
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:49,126
I just got that. A poop joke?
That's real creative, Lois.

306
00:16:49,434 --> 00:16:51,197
Okay, let's run this scene again.

307
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:55,205
Remember, Diane, you're playing Anna,
a steel-town girl on a Saturday night...

308
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:57,241
...looking for the fight of her life.

309
00:16:57,342 --> 00:16:59,936
- Where does it say that?
- In my noodle.

310
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:02,644
Okay, places. And action!

311
00:17:08,587 --> 00:17:12,387
Stop! All wrong! All wrong!
God, send me dancers.

312
00:17:12,557 --> 00:17:15,048
We've been rehearsing for hours.
I'm exhausted!

313
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,594
I'm sorry,
but we open this show in three hours...

314
00:17:17,696 --> 00:17:19,095
...and I don't think we're ready!

315
00:17:19,197 --> 00:17:21,495
No, we're not!
You keep changing everything!

316
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,830
You bet I do! Because theater is alive.

317
00:17:23,935 --> 00:17:26,802
It's a living, breathing creature
with wants and needs...

318
00:17:26,905 --> 00:17:29,897
...and you're not man enough
to satisfy her!

319
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:33,636
- I can't work this way. I quit!
- Fine.

320
00:17:33,745 --> 00:17:37,772
- We can't do The King and I without Anna.
- Yeah. This is a real snafu.

321
00:17:37,883 --> 00:17:41,478
We don't need Diane Simmons.
We've had someone better all along.

322
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,451
Someone radiant and sassy...

323
00:17:43,555 --> 00:17:45,750
...with the soul and passion
that can only come...

324
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:48,223
...from hundreds of years
of black oppression.

325
00:17:48,326 --> 00:17:50,658
Thank you, Peter. I'll do it.

326
00:17:50,762 --> 00:17:52,696
Get over yourself. I was talking about me.

327
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:57,633
Su-su-sudio. Su-su-sudio.

328
00:17:57,736 --> 00:17:59,761
Two minutes, everybody.

329
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:02,597
Jeez, full house.

330
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:06,310
Look who came crawling back.

331
00:18:06,745 --> 00:18:08,645
Peter, have you seen my wheelchair?

332
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,872
I don't get it, Mom.

333
00:18:09,981 --> 00:18:13,542
If you're mad at Dad for wrecking your
show, why'd you come to opening night?

334
00:18:13,652 --> 00:18:16,086
I came because I love the theater.

335
00:18:16,187 --> 00:18:19,350
If I just came here to enjoy
watching your father be humiliated...

336
00:18:19,457 --> 00:18:23,086
...when this asinine spectacle of his
is ridiculed by everyone in town...

337
00:18:23,194 --> 00:18:25,185
...what kind of person would I be?

338
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,797
A bitch.

339
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,828
Siam, 2015 AD.

340
00:18:31,336 --> 00:18:35,102
The city lies in ruins
after the ninth nuclear World War.

341
00:18:35,473 --> 00:18:39,637
It is a grim future with lots of explosions
and partial nudity.

342
00:18:39,844 --> 00:18:43,075
A future where an oppressive new king
has seized power.

343
00:18:43,181 --> 00:18:45,046
Only one man can stop him.

344
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,209
No, one machine.

345
00:18:48,053 --> 00:18:51,420
I am an Automaton
Nuclear Neo-human Android.

346
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,784
You may call me ANNA.

347
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,458
I am a robot ninja
from the planet England...

348
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,859
...who is here to destroy you
and free this land from your tyranny.

349
00:19:00,031 --> 00:19:04,331
I have been expecting you, ANNA.
Let me introduce my Siamese children.

350
00:19:07,472 --> 00:19:11,067
I will not be swayed by your attempts
to confuse my programming...

351
00:19:11,176 --> 00:19:13,610
...with your all-female sex orgy.

352
00:19:14,245 --> 00:19:16,736
- We must kung fu fight!
- So be it, ANNA.

353
00:19:23,054 --> 00:19:25,147
I have slain the evil emperor.

354
00:19:25,256 --> 00:19:29,590
I hereby proclaim Siam
the United States of America.

355
00:19:29,894 --> 00:19:31,657
"ANNA rules

356
00:19:31,863 --> 00:19:35,264
"Because I kicked all the bad guys
in their jewels

357
00:19:35,934 --> 00:19:37,629
"ANNA won

358
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:40,770
"Thanks to my gamma-ray atomic gun

359
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,202
"Dance and shout

360
00:19:43,775 --> 00:19:47,108
"'He's the world's greatest ninja,
there's no doubt

361
00:19:47,912 --> 00:19:49,743
"Though they tried to defeat me

362
00:19:49,848 --> 00:19:51,713
"they can all just freakin' eat me

363
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:55,616
"Because he blew all of us away

364
00:19:55,754 --> 00:19:59,520
"In the planet of Siam,
there's no one as tough as I am

365
00:19:59,624 --> 00:20:02,752
"Just as surely as Paul Lynde was gay"

366
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:10,399
Oh, my God! They liked it?

367
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:17,941
Stop it! Stop clapping right now!
What's wrong with you?

368
00:20:18,043 --> 00:20:21,012
These people shouldn't be encouraged!
They should be punished!

369
00:20:21,112 --> 00:20:23,637
That man has committed murder here
this evening...

370
00:20:23,748 --> 00:20:25,716
...and the victim's name is "theater."

371
00:20:25,817 --> 00:20:28,012
This is the kind of mind-numbing schlock...

372
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:30,849
...that's turning our society
into a cultural wasteland!

373
00:20:30,955 --> 00:20:33,788
This isn't art!
This isn't even entertainment!

374
00:20:33,892 --> 00:20:35,917
This blows!

375
00:21:03,588 --> 00:21:06,523
See? This is exactly the kind of thing
I was talking about.

376
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,785
- How was the cast party?
- We're a hit.

377
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:15,491
Man, what a night.
I got to see my ideas come to life.

378
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,625
It's the greatest feeling in the world.

379
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:20,761
- Yeah, I bet it is.
- And it's all thanks to you.

380
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:23,267
I never would've discovered
I could be creative...

381
00:21:23,374 --> 00:21:24,739
...if you hadn't believed in me.

382
00:21:24,843 --> 00:21:28,301
Actually I didn't really, not at first.

383
00:21:28,446 --> 00:21:32,974
But anyone who could take The King and I
and turn it into that is...

384
00:21:33,518 --> 00:21:35,782
...well, he's gotta be creative.

385
00:21:36,788 --> 00:21:40,019
Yeah, Lois,
sorry I took your show away from you...

386
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:43,925
...but I'll do whatever it takes to make sure
you get your chance next year.

387
00:21:44,028 --> 00:21:47,657
It'll be "Peter Griffin presents
a Lois Griffin production."

388
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:49,930
- Okay, honey?
- Deal.

389
00:21:54,072 --> 00:21:55,699
Were you there when I farted?
