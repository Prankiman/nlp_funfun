<i>Family Guy
The Tan Aquatic with Steve Zissou</i>

2
00:00:33,064 --> 00:00:36,514
Peter, are you sure you're allowed
to bring a baby onto the golf course?

3
00:00:36,515 --> 00:00:38,835
Well, Lois asked me to watch
Stewie for the afternoon.

4
00:00:38,836 --> 00:00:40,583
It's all right, I don't think
the club will mind.

5
00:00:40,584 --> 00:00:44,179
- It's Cleveland I'm worried about.
- Peter, is this really necessary?

6
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,020
- I can't hardly see anything.
- Hey, look, it's President Nixon.

7
00:00:48,088 --> 00:00:51,000
No, wait, it's a black guy.
No, it's Nixon.

8
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:52,940
Oh, boy, that was close.

9
00:00:52,943 --> 00:00:55,906
Will you please hurry up?
It's 100 degrees out here.

10
00:00:55,914 --> 00:00:58,563
You're a worse parent
than Britney Spears.

11
00:00:58,618 --> 00:01:00,503
I know, I know.

12
00:01:01,209 --> 00:01:05,192
Oh, the gift basket was not
worth the trip, not by a long shot.

13
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,942
Oh, I got to get that.
I'll talk to you later.

14
00:01:11,878 --> 00:01:14,263
- Hey, uh, Joe...
- Don't say it, Peter.

15
00:01:14,265 --> 00:01:17,351
- I was just wondering...
- Peter, I swear to God...

16
00:01:17,356 --> 00:01:19,041
What's your handicap?

17
00:01:20,628 --> 00:01:24,163
Every hole... that's a joke
that just doesn't get old!

18
00:01:26,985 --> 00:01:28,963
Damn it! Come on! Come on!

19
00:01:29,877 --> 00:01:33,410
Come on, Glen! Come on,
get your head in the damn game!

20
00:01:34,966 --> 00:01:37,893
Hey, do you think it's time
to talk to Quagmire

21
00:01:37,896 --> 00:01:39,953
about his anger issues with this game?

22
00:01:39,957 --> 00:01:43,272
A white man shouldn't play sports
in the first place.

23
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,352
Hey, hey, that's a stroke!

24
00:01:46,357 --> 00:01:48,660
I just tapped my ball, Quagmire. Relax.

25
00:01:48,665 --> 00:01:50,083
Oh, relax? Oh, okay.

26
00:01:50,215 --> 00:01:51,531
Look, I just tapped my ball.

27
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:52,820
Just tapped it again.

28
00:01:52,926 --> 00:01:53,911
Tap, tap, tap.

29
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:55,630
Where is it? Oh! It's in the hole.

30
00:01:55,635 --> 00:01:57,252
Eagle.
Yay, Quagmire.

31
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:01,162
Hey, Quagmire, you know it's
not fun when you're like this.

32
00:02:01,176 --> 00:02:03,402
You want fun? Go home and buy a monkey.

33
00:02:03,408 --> 00:02:05,612
- What does that even mean?
- I don't know.

34
00:02:05,616 --> 00:02:07,413
Boy, we've got a beautiful day for this.

35
00:02:11,085 --> 00:02:13,811
Hi, Mr. Herbert. Here's your paper.

36
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:18,932
Sorry, Chris, but I'm afraid I'm going
to have to cancel my subscription.

37
00:02:18,968 --> 00:02:21,170
Cancel? But you love this paper.

38
00:02:21,206 --> 00:02:23,742
Listen, I think you're a real nice guy,

39
00:02:23,746 --> 00:02:26,672
but I've just decided
to go with another paper.

40
00:02:26,728 --> 00:02:29,822
Hello, there, Kyle. You look nice today.

41
00:02:29,846 --> 00:02:34,140
I see you're wearing your big shorts
with the baggy leg holes that flutter

42
00:02:34,147 --> 00:02:37,653
- so carelessly in the breeze.
- Here's your paper.

43
00:02:37,686 --> 00:02:39,902
What are you doing here?
Beat it, nerd.

44
00:02:39,917 --> 00:02:42,363
Thank you.
Would you like to come inside

45
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:44,661
for a cupcake and a glass of wine?

46
00:02:44,676 --> 00:02:46,110
Shut up, old man.

47
00:02:47,807 --> 00:02:50,161
What's going on in my pants?

48
00:02:50,196 --> 00:02:53,272
Looks like we got six
more weeks of winter.

49
00:02:56,986 --> 00:03:00,350
<i>We now return to
Cutting in Line in Front of Italians.</i>

50
00:03:05,808 --> 00:03:09,151
Hey, Copernicus, why don't you navigate
yourself to the back of the line

51
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:11,282
with your feet and
stand there with your shirt?

52
00:03:11,537 --> 00:03:13,631
Hey, Peter, how was your golf game?

53
00:03:13,635 --> 00:03:16,742
Well, Lois, you tied my golf shoes
a little tight before I left the house.

54
00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:18,770
Had to deal with that all day.
Thank you very much.

55
00:03:18,777 --> 00:03:20,523
Oh, my God, look at Stewie!

56
00:03:20,528 --> 00:03:22,823
Peter, you took him out
without any sunscreen?

57
00:03:22,848 --> 00:03:23,691
Maybe.

58
00:03:23,695 --> 00:03:26,502
You know the sun is dangerous
for a baby's skin.

59
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:27,972
Peter, this is more irresponsible

60
00:03:27,976 --> 00:03:30,232
than when you fed your
mogwai after midnight.

61
00:03:30,397 --> 00:03:32,281
Peter, didn't the little Chinese man

62
00:03:32,286 --> 00:03:34,203
tell you not to feed him after midnight?

63
00:03:34,246 --> 00:03:36,193
Come on, Lois, he's so cute.

64
00:03:36,195 --> 00:03:38,601
And he's hungry. What could happen?

65
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:44,161
Hello, I'm Fran Drescher.

66
00:03:46,675 --> 00:03:47,882
Kill it! Kill it!

67
00:03:50,446 --> 00:03:52,212
What the deuce are you all staring at?

68
00:03:52,216 --> 00:03:53,822
Is there something wrong with me?

69
00:03:56,697 --> 00:03:58,663
Wow, look at me.

70
00:03:58,668 --> 00:04:00,330
I'm a young Eartha Kitt.

71
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:05,552
"President Johnson, bring our boys
home from Southeast Asia.

72
00:04:05,557 --> 00:04:07,582
It's an unwinnable war..."

73
00:04:10,896 --> 00:04:14,352
Dad, I was wondering
if I could borrow $17.

74
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:17,562
Chris, what do you need money for?
Isn't that why you have a paper route?

75
00:04:17,587 --> 00:04:21,681
No, this new kid named Kyle
keeps stealing all my customers.

76
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:25,251
Oh, that's terrible. You're a
wonderful paperboy, Chris,

77
00:04:25,255 --> 00:04:27,501
and you need to remind
your customers of that.

78
00:04:27,508 --> 00:04:29,611
She's right, you got to
stand up for yourself.

79
00:04:29,615 --> 00:04:33,712
Like my great-grandfather, Turn-Of
The-Century-Take-On-All-Comers Griffin.

80
00:04:33,826 --> 00:04:35,610
All right, put 'em up, put 'em up.

81
00:04:35,665 --> 00:04:37,940
Are you having a bully day?
I'm having a bully day.

82
00:04:37,976 --> 00:04:39,502
Is everyone having a bully day?

83
00:04:39,538 --> 00:04:41,241
- Bully.
- Bully.
- Yes, Bully.

84
00:04:41,295 --> 00:04:43,981
Oh, thank God we live in this time.

85
00:04:47,915 --> 00:04:51,710
- Stewie, what are you doing?
- Just getting my bronze on, baby.

86
00:04:51,757 --> 00:04:54,851
Hey, what do you think
of my recumbent tan pose?

87
00:04:54,908 --> 00:04:57,862
Legs probably spread a little wider
than they ought to be, but

88
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:01,543
who gives a damn? This is
just tan Stewie being tan Stewie.

89
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:03,243
Check me out, Brian.

90
00:05:12,137 --> 00:05:14,823
Hey, Mr. Herbert, I want you back.

91
00:05:14,828 --> 00:05:17,472
Please, will you be
my paper customer again?

92
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:21,063
Oh, uh, hey, Chris.
Oh, is that my phone?

93
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:28,911
- Oh, better go get that.
- Well, if it isn't King Lardass.

94
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:32,552
- Don't call me names, Kyle.
- Hi, Kyle.

95
00:05:35,258 --> 00:05:39,010
Well, listen, it was wrong of you
to steal my customer away from me.

96
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,471
- And I want him back.
- Oh, yeah?

97
00:05:43,327 --> 00:05:46,780
- Look, Griffin got his ass kicked.
- What a loser.

98
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:48,522
I have that shirt at home.

99
00:05:49,627 --> 00:05:51,923
You... you pushed me.

100
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:57,133
Boys, boys, we can settle this like
reasonable and sexy teenagers.

101
00:05:57,196 --> 00:06:01,300
Whoever can swallow
the most Tylenol PM wins.

102
00:06:07,138 --> 00:06:10,690
- Oh, my God, Chris, what happened?!
- Kyle beat me up.

103
00:06:10,697 --> 00:06:14,520
- You let that little punk beat you up?
- Peter, you should be more sympathetic.

104
00:06:14,528 --> 00:06:17,033
Remember, you had a bully, too,
when you were his age.

105
00:06:17,036 --> 00:06:20,991
Yeah, you're right. Randy Fulcher
used to pants me every chance he got.

106
00:06:21,845 --> 00:06:24,821
My book report is on The Giving Tree.

107
00:06:25,096 --> 00:06:26,152
Nerd!

108
00:06:27,947 --> 00:06:29,222
Randy!

109
00:06:30,588 --> 00:06:31,653
Nerd!

110
00:06:33,517 --> 00:06:34,901
Randy!

111
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:40,100
- Nerd!
- Randy!

112
00:06:40,278 --> 00:06:43,983
Peter, I think one of us should go over
and have a talk with Kyle's parents.

113
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:47,160
I'll do it, Lois. Right after
a healthy breakfast of juice,

114
00:06:47,168 --> 00:06:51,752
toast and store brand imitation frosted
flakes featuring Terry the Tiger.

115
00:06:51,806 --> 00:06:53,832
They'rrrre... food.

116
00:06:57,007 --> 00:07:00,910
Hey, ladies, you mind if I park here?
I'll only be a few minutes.

117
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:04,140
- Stewie, what is that on your lip?
- I drew a pencil mustache.

118
00:07:04,146 --> 00:07:06,030
I like it 'cause it's just above my lip.

119
00:07:06,035 --> 00:07:09,113
The kind of mustache that says, "Yeah,
I've been nude on camera. What of it?"

120
00:07:09,115 --> 00:07:11,353
Come here, I'll take care
of that, sweetie.

121
00:07:11,507 --> 00:07:13,853
Ew, ew, it's got spit all over it.

122
00:07:13,858 --> 00:07:17,132
Now I know what it feels like to
have dinner with Martin Landau.

123
00:07:17,198 --> 00:07:19,842
What people forget about Polanski is

124
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,230
Polanski wasn't a perfectionist.

125
00:07:22,337 --> 00:07:26,582
And pedophile or not, he,
he was a perfectly professional person.

126
00:07:26,635 --> 00:07:27,862
And punctual.

127
00:07:27,938 --> 00:07:30,770
Yeah, maybe we could talk
about something else?

128
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:34,951
You know my wife and I are very
involved in Planned Parenthood.

129
00:07:35,017 --> 00:07:39,463
Which provides possibilities for
people who are underprivileged.

130
00:07:39,518 --> 00:07:41,822
Maybe chew your food a little, champ.

131
00:07:49,108 --> 00:07:50,652
Who are all these people?

132
00:07:50,656 --> 00:07:53,503
Oh, just a few friends over to
enjoy this gorgeous weather,

133
00:07:53,508 --> 00:07:56,613
and maybe take a dip in the pool.
Hey, Devon, Devon, come here.

134
00:07:56,616 --> 00:07:57,893
Brian, this is Devon.

135
00:07:57,896 --> 00:07:59,823
Devon just finished directing a movie.

136
00:07:59,865 --> 00:08:03,442
Yeah, it, uh, stars a little actress
named Joan Van Ark.

137
00:08:03,506 --> 00:08:04,943
Maybe you've heard of her.

138
00:08:05,346 --> 00:08:07,970
- Right. Possibly.
- You're talking out of your ass.

139
00:08:07,976 --> 00:08:09,913
It doesn't matter, Brian, I'm tan.

140
00:08:09,965 --> 00:08:11,562
Hey, Brian, Brian, Brian,

141
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:13,320
look at my tan walk.

142
00:08:15,293 --> 00:08:17,186
- Devon, do you have a cigarette?
- Sure.

143
00:08:17,184 --> 00:08:18,913
And here's a copy of my last movie.

144
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:22,203
It's essentially Brokeback Mountain
from the point of view of the horses.

145
00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:25,663
Hey, the sun's been up for an hour.
Shouldn't we get riding?

146
00:08:25,668 --> 00:08:28,030
- Uh, are they still sleeping?
- I don't know. I'll check.

147
00:08:39,277 --> 00:08:42,453
- Hey, there. Are you Kyle's parents?
- Yes. Can we help you?

148
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:43,673
Yeah, I'm Peter Griffin.

149
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:47,400
Listen, apparently your son got
into a little scrape with my kid.

150
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:51,090
- Oh, dear, they're not getting along?
- Like an old guy and a midget.

151
00:08:52,847 --> 00:08:55,361
Sir, will you please stop staring at me?

152
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:56,750
Where's the rest of ya?

153
00:08:56,796 --> 00:08:59,183
So, listen, Chris is pretty upset
about what happened.

154
00:08:59,188 --> 00:09:01,132
Would you mind if I had
a word with your son?

155
00:09:01,137 --> 00:09:02,822
Not at all. He's up in his room.

156
00:09:03,618 --> 00:09:05,032
Hey, there. Kyle?

157
00:09:05,107 --> 00:09:08,592
- Hey, I'm Chris Griffin's father.
- Hey, I'm Chris Griffin's father.

158
00:09:08,606 --> 00:09:11,500
That's not very nice.
I don't sound like that at all.

159
00:09:11,508 --> 00:09:13,461
You're making me sound
like Michael Stipe.

160
00:09:13,508 --> 00:09:16,722
Listen, I just want you to know what
you did the other day was wrong.

161
00:09:16,738 --> 00:09:19,751
- What you did the other day was wrong.
- You're not making this easy, Kyle.

162
00:09:19,797 --> 00:09:22,472
You're not making this easy, Kyle.
My name's Peter Griffin.

163
00:09:22,517 --> 00:09:24,923
I'm a big, fat, dumb butt-face.

164
00:09:24,928 --> 00:09:26,841
- Shut up, Kyle.
- I'm Peter Griffin.

165
00:09:26,848 --> 00:09:30,071
- I'm a dorky, fat, numbnuts.
- Kyle, I said shut up.

166
00:09:30,106 --> 00:09:31,481
You're a poop-nose.

167
00:09:52,757 --> 00:09:54,633
- Hey, Peter.
- Hey, what's going on?

168
00:09:54,655 --> 00:09:56,121
- Is something wrong?
- No, no.

169
00:09:57,187 --> 00:09:58,691
Everything's cool right now.

170
00:09:59,446 --> 00:10:03,422
Might be some problems later, but we'll
cross that bridge when we come to it.

171
00:10:04,598 --> 00:10:05,572
<i>Hello.</i>

172
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,052
<i>Peter did what?!</i>

173
00:10:08,057 --> 00:10:11,031
- Well, I'd best be getting to work.
- It's nighttime.

174
00:10:11,056 --> 00:10:13,523
Boy, you said it.
All right, take it easy.

175
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:18,231
Peter, you get down from
that tree this instant!

176
00:10:18,258 --> 00:10:19,981
No! You're gonna yell at me!

177
00:10:20,005 --> 00:10:21,913
You're damn right I'm gonna yell at you.

178
00:10:21,938 --> 00:10:24,200
You beat up a 13-year-old boy!

179
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,513
He called me names!

180
00:10:25,538 --> 00:10:28,642
You're 43, and you just assaulted
our neighbor's child!

181
00:10:28,675 --> 00:10:30,783
This is a very serious situation.

182
00:10:30,805 --> 00:10:33,313
Well, maybe you should have
just had an abortion, Lois!

183
00:10:33,348 --> 00:10:35,762
Would that make you happy
if I was never born?!

184
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:36,401
What?

185
00:10:36,407 --> 00:10:37,943
I'm going to prison, aren't I?

186
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:44,920
- What are you doing?
- Got to keep the tan up.

187
00:10:44,947 --> 00:10:47,552
It's not a skin color,
it's a lifestyle, Brian.

188
00:10:47,597 --> 00:10:50,181
See, you wouldn't know that
because you're white as a ghost.

189
00:10:50,247 --> 00:10:53,113
You're haunting this house
with your whiteness, Brian.

190
00:10:53,176 --> 00:10:55,143
Hey, wake me up in 15, will ya, babe?

191
00:10:55,158 --> 00:10:55,890
Fine.

192
00:10:58,778 --> 00:11:00,761
<i>Key Largo, Montego</i>

193
00:11:00,825 --> 00:11:04,871
<i>Baby, why don't we go down to Kokomo?</i>

194
00:11:04,946 --> 00:11:09,241
<i>But not too fast 'cause
Stewie takes it slow...</i>

195
00:11:14,537 --> 00:11:15,993
Oh, crap! Stewie!

196
00:11:29,888 --> 00:11:33,543
Uh, hey, buddy. I was just coming
to tell ya it's time to get out.

197
00:11:33,577 --> 00:11:36,840
I've been in there for six and
a half hours, you son of a bitch!

198
00:11:36,848 --> 00:11:38,593
- Don't touch me!
- Well, how, how...?

199
00:11:38,628 --> 00:11:40,611
- Can, can you get up?
- I'll try.

200
00:11:49,998 --> 00:11:51,872
I can't do it! I can't do it!

201
00:11:51,917 --> 00:11:53,842
Get the lotion! Put the lotion on me!

202
00:11:56,157 --> 00:11:58,970
- Brian!
- Oh, uh, hi, Mr. Furley.

203
00:11:59,266 --> 00:12:01,563
Never mind! I'll come back later!

204
00:12:03,796 --> 00:12:05,292
Now be polite, Peter.

205
00:12:05,296 --> 00:12:08,573
Kyle's mother agreed not to
press charges if you apologize.

206
00:12:08,637 --> 00:12:10,670
- Hello, Lois.
- Hello, Claire.

207
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,730
We just came by
because there's something

208
00:12:12,737 --> 00:12:14,440
Peter would like to say to Kyle.

209
00:12:15,075 --> 00:12:16,612
- Go on.
- Slorry.

210
00:12:16,646 --> 00:12:19,153
- Say it right, Peter.
- Ow! Ow! Sorry!

211
00:12:19,225 --> 00:12:21,691
Thank you, Peter.
Now what do you say, Kyle?

212
00:12:21,695 --> 00:12:23,332
- Apology accepted.
- Good.

213
00:12:23,337 --> 00:12:27,552
Now why don't you patch things up with
Mr. Griffin by showing him your Legos?

214
00:12:27,597 --> 00:12:29,530
You got Legos? Aw, sweet!

215
00:12:29,568 --> 00:12:33,020
- Lois only buys me Mega Bloks.
- They're the same thing, Peter.

216
00:12:33,026 --> 00:12:35,250
You know what, Lois?
They are not the same thing.

217
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:37,300
And the sooner you get that
through your thick skull,

218
00:12:37,306 --> 00:12:39,501
the sooner we can get
this marriage back on track.

219
00:12:39,756 --> 00:12:42,163
Hey, listen, uh,
sorry about beating you up.

220
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,822
I felt pretty bad about it.

221
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:45,580
Hey, this look like a spaceship to you?

222
00:12:45,586 --> 00:12:46,361
Sorta.

223
00:12:47,127 --> 00:12:49,331
Well, I never was very good
at building things.

224
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:51,953
Like that time I built that
handmade electric razor.

225
00:12:52,096 --> 00:12:55,520
By gluing many razor blades
to this ordinary desk fan,

226
00:12:55,528 --> 00:12:57,712
I'll save time in my morning routine.

227
00:13:01,268 --> 00:13:03,713
Lois, I done it again.

228
00:13:08,486 --> 00:13:11,622
You don't have to apologize.
I would have done the same thing.

229
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:14,011
I mean, bullying makes
you feel pretty cool.

230
00:13:14,146 --> 00:13:16,371
Yeah, guess it was kinda cool.

231
00:13:16,408 --> 00:13:19,011
You know, I always used to be
the nerd getting bullied, but

232
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:21,140
doing it to someone else
was pretty sweet.

233
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:23,940
And the more you do it,
the sweeter it gets.

234
00:13:30,526 --> 00:13:31,631
Cook much?

235
00:13:32,648 --> 00:13:34,501
Peter, what the hell is wrong with you?!

236
00:13:34,507 --> 00:13:37,090
What's wrong with me? You're the
one punching yourself in the face.

237
00:13:37,718 --> 00:13:40,071
Hey, Lois, how come you keep
punching yourself in the face?

238
00:13:40,115 --> 00:13:42,173
- Knock it off!
- You're gonna hurt yourself.

239
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,491
- Ha! You're getting her good!
- Hey, Stewie, nice sunburn.

240
00:13:45,537 --> 00:13:47,440
God, you horse's ass!

241
00:13:55,256 --> 00:13:57,243
Hey, Brian, you want some Stewie jerky?

242
00:13:57,247 --> 00:14:00,362
- Oh, God, that is disgusting.
- I'm finally starting to peel.

243
00:14:00,398 --> 00:14:02,950
I'm telling you, Brian,
my tanning days are over.

244
00:14:02,978 --> 00:14:06,201
I'm just glad I stopped before I
did any real damage to my skin.

245
00:14:06,308 --> 00:14:07,563
I wouldn't be so sure.

246
00:14:07,578 --> 00:14:09,630
I don't remember you having
that mole before.

247
00:14:09,787 --> 00:14:11,681
What the devil?
Where did that come from?

248
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,613
- Brian, what is that?
- I don't know.

249
00:14:13,697 --> 00:14:16,630
Of course, your sunburn was
pretty bad. I suppose it could be...

250
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:18,310
the "C" word.

251
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,342
What the hell does that
have to do with anything?

252
00:14:20,345 --> 00:14:21,351
No, cancer.

253
00:14:22,388 --> 00:14:23,822
I-I thought you meant...

254
00:14:24,035 --> 00:14:26,182
It's not important...
Oh, no!

255
00:14:26,235 --> 00:14:27,371
Cancer!

256
00:14:30,615 --> 00:14:33,230
Well, the mole looks benign,
but we won't know for sure

257
00:14:33,238 --> 00:14:36,030
whether it's cancerous until the
tests come back in a few days.

258
00:14:36,048 --> 00:14:37,122
A few days?!

259
00:14:37,136 --> 00:14:39,313
- I could be dead by then!
- Relax, Stewie.

260
00:14:39,317 --> 00:14:41,752
He said it looks benign.
We'll just have to wait and see.

261
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:45,193
Jim Henson had a wait-and-see attitude
and look what happened to him.

262
00:14:45,225 --> 00:14:47,333
Now we've got wrong-sounding Muppets!

263
00:14:47,526 --> 00:14:50,521
- Hey, Swedish chef.
- Oh, hey, Kermit, what's going on?

264
00:14:50,545 --> 00:14:51,483
I'm hungry.

265
00:14:51,518 --> 00:14:54,600
Oh, that's no problem. I could cook
you something. You want some spaghetti?

266
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:56,652
That's, like, my specialty and junk.

267
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:07,203
Dad, what's wrong with you?!

268
00:15:07,227 --> 00:15:09,172
Why are you acting like such a bully?

269
00:15:09,195 --> 00:15:11,572
'Cause there are two kinds of
people in this world, Chris.

270
00:15:11,597 --> 00:15:13,532
There are bullies and there are nerds.

271
00:15:13,616 --> 00:15:15,550
And there are hot Asian chicks.

272
00:15:15,635 --> 00:15:17,933
They'll do what you want. Oh, yeah.

273
00:15:17,995 --> 00:15:21,472
Oh, yeah. You better believe it, buddy.
They will do what you want

274
00:15:21,557 --> 00:15:23,662
because they know,
they know what you want.

275
00:15:23,758 --> 00:15:26,720
Oh, oh, oh, don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you.

276
00:15:26,765 --> 00:15:27,933
I won't hurt you.

277
00:15:27,976 --> 00:15:29,870
Me big American man.

278
00:15:30,038 --> 00:15:32,381
My point being that I'm a bully,
not a nerd.

279
00:15:32,426 --> 00:15:34,011
Now, where was I? Oh, yeah.

280
00:15:35,116 --> 00:15:36,790
Dad, get away from me!

281
00:15:42,298 --> 00:15:44,292
Oh, in the kitchen, Meg?

282
00:15:48,126 --> 00:15:50,282
Brian, I may only have one week to live

283
00:15:50,287 --> 00:15:51,633
and I've got to make the most of it.

284
00:15:51,636 --> 00:15:54,291
Now, I've made a list of things
I want to do before I die

285
00:15:54,295 --> 00:15:56,663
and you've got to help me
since this is all your fault.

286
00:15:57,167 --> 00:15:59,603
"Visit Chicago Museum of Art."

287
00:15:59,617 --> 00:16:00,801
Okay, we can do that.

288
00:16:35,588 --> 00:16:39,111
Next on your list, you want
to learn to ballroom dance.

289
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:45,131
All right, if you're gonna make
me do this, at least let me lead.

290
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:46,861
- Fine, you lead.
- All right, then.

291
00:17:01,778 --> 00:17:02,752
I love you.

292
00:17:02,796 --> 00:17:05,111
- What? What'd you say?
- Uh, olive juice.

293
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:07,951
- Olive juice?
- Olive juice you, too.

294
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,422
Hey, you nerds wanna see a puppet show?

295
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:14,713
- Peter, put me down!
- I told you, not until you sing.

296
00:17:14,748 --> 00:17:17,283
<i>High on a hill was a lonely goat herd...</i>

297
00:17:17,298 --> 00:17:19,963
<i>Lay-hee-oh-da-lay-hee-oh
da-lay-hee-hoo!</i>

298
00:17:20,027 --> 00:17:22,703
Dad, what are you doing to Mr. Swanson?

299
00:17:22,707 --> 00:17:24,813
Peter, put him down right now!

300
00:17:24,815 --> 00:17:26,722
- Beat it, Lois.
- Peter, stop it!

301
00:17:26,765 --> 00:17:29,380
- Joe is your friend.
- Shut up, ya nerd!

302
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,562
Peter, look at yourself.

303
00:17:32,595 --> 00:17:35,543
You are no different than that
bully who used to pick on you.

304
00:17:35,575 --> 00:17:38,003
Are you kidding?
I'm nothing like Randy Fulcher.

305
00:17:38,026 --> 00:17:40,373
Oh, no? Does that look familiar?

306
00:17:42,768 --> 00:17:44,930
Oh, my God, you're right, Lois.

307
00:17:44,967 --> 00:17:47,450
I shouldn't be bullying
the people I care about.

308
00:17:47,587 --> 00:17:50,193
I should be bullying Randy Fulcher!

309
00:17:50,216 --> 00:17:51,863
He's the jerk in all this.

310
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,241
Like Dick Cheney when he was
a Wal-Mart greeter.

311
00:17:54,397 --> 00:17:55,652
Go fuck yourself.

312
00:17:55,905 --> 00:17:57,203
Go fuck yourself.

313
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:58,962
Go fuck yourself.

314
00:18:02,627 --> 00:18:05,092
- Well, that's it for the list.
- Not quite, Brian.

315
00:18:05,147 --> 00:18:08,051
There's one more thing
I need you to do before I die.

316
00:18:08,535 --> 00:18:11,203
- Write down my final thoughts.
- Oh, come on!

317
00:18:11,206 --> 00:18:13,631
I don't have much time!

318
00:18:15,525 --> 00:18:19,100
Oh, squiggly line in my eye fluid,

319
00:18:19,395 --> 00:18:23,880
I see you there lurking on
the periphery of my vision,

320
00:18:24,157 --> 00:18:26,472
but when I try to look at you,

321
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,270
you scurry away.

322
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,380
Are you shy, squiggly line?

323
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:36,893
Why only when I ignore you do
you return to the center of my eye?

324
00:18:37,797 --> 00:18:41,043
Oh, squiggly line, it's all right.

325
00:18:41,655 --> 00:18:43,192
You are forgiven.

326
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,372
Hello. Oh, hi, Dr. Hartman.

327
00:18:47,196 --> 00:18:49,443
All right, I'll tell him. Thanks. Bye.

328
00:18:49,476 --> 00:18:51,892
You don't have cancer.
You're gonna be fine.

329
00:18:51,928 --> 00:18:54,883
Really?! Oh, thank God! Oh, thank God!

330
00:18:55,488 --> 00:18:59,393
Wait, wait. Look, there's no reason
we can't finish the memoir anyway.

331
00:18:59,467 --> 00:19:01,193
Let's see what you've got so far.

332
00:19:03,448 --> 00:19:06,532
Oh, you are just the
worst type of person.

333
00:19:08,526 --> 00:19:10,252
Dad, what are we doing here?

334
00:19:10,285 --> 00:19:13,291
Chris, I'm gonna show you
how to stand up to a bully.

335
00:19:15,258 --> 00:19:16,493
Hey, Fulcher!

336
00:19:17,185 --> 00:19:18,072
Griffin?

337
00:19:18,126 --> 00:19:21,023
- The feeling's mutual.
- What are you doing here?

338
00:19:21,025 --> 00:19:23,243
I'm here to kick your ass, Fulcher.

339
00:19:23,268 --> 00:19:26,093
I'm gonna beat ya, and then
my son Chris is gonna beat ya.

340
00:19:26,096 --> 00:19:28,691
It's gonna be an old-fashioned
father-son beat-off.

341
00:19:28,697 --> 00:19:31,093
Wait a minute, Dad. You can't hit him!

342
00:19:31,116 --> 00:19:34,132
- Yeah, I have MS.
- Oh, you hear that, Chris?

343
00:19:34,137 --> 00:19:36,953
This guy's got a monkey scrotum
and he's bragging about it.

344
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:38,670
Now you really got me mad.

345
00:19:38,795 --> 00:19:40,003
No, Dad!

346
00:19:54,707 --> 00:19:57,080
Sorry I had to do that, Dad.

347
00:19:57,238 --> 00:20:00,181
But you wanted me to
learn to stand up to a bully.

348
00:20:00,238 --> 00:20:02,332
Well, I'm standing up to you.

349
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:05,083
Stop bullying people, Dad!

350
00:20:05,317 --> 00:20:07,620
My God, Chris, you're right.

351
00:20:07,835 --> 00:20:10,222
Look at me. Look what I've become.

352
00:20:10,256 --> 00:20:12,480
I thought it'd feel good
to be a bully, but

353
00:20:12,527 --> 00:20:16,303
all I did was make people feel
as bad as Randy made me feel.

354
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:20,843
- I'm just a big jackass.
- It's all right, Dad. I forgive you.

355
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:24,451
As long as you promise never
to bully anyone again.

356
00:20:24,488 --> 00:20:26,333
I promise, Chris.

357
00:20:26,405 --> 00:20:28,903
I mean, you know,
unless I get really stinkin' drunk,

358
00:20:28,906 --> 00:20:31,520
in which case all you got to do
is outrun your sister.

359
00:20:32,017 --> 00:20:35,731
Oh, I like that. That's nice.
That's a warm family moment.

360
00:20:35,738 --> 00:20:38,360
I agree. We can all learn
something from that.

361
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:41,842
Wocka, wocka...
Who wants to hear a funny-ass joke?
