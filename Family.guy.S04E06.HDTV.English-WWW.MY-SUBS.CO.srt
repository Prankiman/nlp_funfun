1
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:05,600
It seems today that all you see

2
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:08,799
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

3
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:12,639
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

4
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:15,476
On which we used to rely?

5
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:18,815
Lucky there's a family guy

6
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:22,345
Lucky there's a man
who positively can do

7
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:24,150
all the things that make us

8
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:25,918
Laugh and cry

9
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:30,827
He's a family guy

10
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,726
Peter, this game night was a great idea.

11
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:40,032
Yeah, this will be a lot more fun
than last Saturday...

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,732
when we went to see
The Vagina Monologues.

13
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:45,971
So, in international news,
no luck yet finding Osama bin Laden.

14
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,981
So the government is trying a new tactic.
They've hired Jeff Gillooly.

15
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:52,446
Gillooly.

16
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,587
Sorry, I guess that joke was not so fresh,
but you know...

17
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,092
Okay, Joe. Right foot, green.

18
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,255
all right, let's do it!

19
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,797
Yes! I am the king!

20
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:10,903
Thanks for including
my civil rights board game...

21
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,234
in the game night rotation, guys.

22
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:16,399
We're always happy to play
Two Decades of Dignity.

23
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:19,034
It makes us all feel a little less guilty.

24
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,006
For whistling at a white woman,
go directly to jall.

25
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:26,244
Man, does anyone ever win at this game?

26
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:30,049
You don't win.
You just do a little better each time.

27
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,518
Okay, everybody, time for paintball.

28
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:35,321
I forgot to pick up the paintball guns.

29
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,864
Well, we could use these.
I brought them from the office.

30
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:42,501
Peter, is it safe to be firing reaI guns
at each other in the house?

31
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,799
all right, all right, nobody fire at Lois.
She's scared.

32
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,969
all right, one, two, three, go!

33
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,218
Missed, you ass.

34
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:04,549
- Damn it, Peter, that hurt.
- Relax, Quagmire.

35
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:07,717
You're doing better than Peter Weller
from the opening scene of RoboCop.

36
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:14,028
Well, now that the mess is cleaned up and
we're back from the emergency room...

37
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,796
it's time for the last game of the night,
Trivial Pursuit.

38
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:20,498
Man, I hate Trivial Pursuit.
Always makes me feel so stupid.

39
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,269
More stupid than that time
you locked your keys out of the car?

40
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:24,643
Damn it!

41
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:28,345
Hey! Hey! Somebody! Hey!

42
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:31,507
Hey, sir! Sir, you see those keys there? Sir!

43
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,015
Oh, screw you!

44
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:44,252
all right, Brian, this one's for you.

45
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:48,926
"What naturally occurring element has
the highest melting point of all metals?"

46
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,328
- Cadmium?
- Sorry, tungsten.

47
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:52,900
Dumb ass. My turn. What do you got?

48
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,442
Okay, here we go.
"What color is a fire truck?"

49
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,706
Oh, God, I always get these.

50
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:00,937
Okay, all right, fire truck.

51
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:05,608
Fire truck, fire truck, fire truck, fire truck,
what color are those red fire trucks?

52
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:08,543
Oh, God, I can picture them now,
all red and everything.

53
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,953
That's right, Peter, they are red.

54
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:12,251
Lois, what are you doing?

55
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,986
I switched Peter's questions
to the pre-school edition.

56
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:16,561
Just to let him have his moment.

57
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:20,463
Good thing I just watched that
National Geographic special on fire trucks.

58
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:24,194
A solitary killer,
the fire truck stalks its prey.

59
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:44,345
The fire truck can consume
eight times its body weight.

60
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,326
The ambulances
will have to wait their turn.

61
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,666
Okay, Brian, "Name the 16th century
ecumenicaI body...

62
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:57,759
"that marked a major turning point
for Christianity in Europe. "

63
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,100
I think that was the CounciI of Trent.

64
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,238
You could not be more wrong.

65
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:05,205
The answer is Phyllis Diller.

66
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:07,438
- Peter, you're reading the pink-
- My turn.

67
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,538
Okay, Peter, this is for the win.

68
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,947
"Say the word 'what. "'

69
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,752
Wow. Okay.

70
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,851
This really separates the men
from the boys.

71
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,127
Peter, just say "what. "

72
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:29,167
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, now, Lois.
This is not a race.

73
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,131
Okay, I wanna say "who. "

74
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:35,000
Oh, boy.

75
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,808
Fantastic Four.

76
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:42,314
Fantastic Four, steak, steak, steak, steak,
a small amount of peas.

77
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,472
Is it "what?"

78
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:47,553
That's right. You win, Peter. You did it.

79
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,918
Oh, my God! I won. I won!

80
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,581
My dad's smarter than your dad.

81
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:55,559
- We have the same dad, idiot.
- Yeah, but mine's smarter.

82
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:56,890
What a feeling.

83
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:59,863
This is even better than that time
I met Timer the Cheese Guy.

84
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,992
I hanker for a hunk of
A slab or slice or chunk of

85
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:05,297
I hanker for a hunk of cheese

86
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:08,704
When your get-up-and-go
has got up and went

87
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:10,701
Howdy, pardner.

88
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,675
Pardon me, sir. I live next door.

89
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:16,111
It is 3:30 in the morning. I am very tired.

90
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:17,705
Look, a wagon wheeI.

91
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,011
What the hell is your problem?

92
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:20,779
I just smoked a whole bunch of crack.

93
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,652
Good night, losers.

94
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,084
Well, game night was a success.

95
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:28,058
Peter, you do know that all your questions
were incredibly easy.

96
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,789
Yeah, easy for me. Good night, morons.

97
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,958
You ever stop and think,
"Wow, I'm married to that guy"?

98
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,500
No, I just repress it.

99
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:38,434
- Is that healthy?
- What's the worst that could happen?

100
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:40,105
I'm a tumor, I'm a tumor

101
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,436
I'm a tumor, I'm a tumor, I'm a tumor

102
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,601
I'm a tumor, I'm a tumor, I'm a tumor

103
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:46,301
Oh, oh, oh, I'm a tumor.

104
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:52,177
The administration's plan for peace
in the Middle East is shallow and pedantic.

105
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:55,118
I agree. Shallow and pedantic.

106
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,082
I agree as well. Shallow and pedantic.

107
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:02,358
Everything all right. Peter?

108
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:05,920
Well, Lois, since you asked, I find
this meatloaf rather shallow and pedantic.

109
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,023
What is this,
you're gonna talk down to everyone...

110
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,068
just because you won a game
of Trivial Pursuit?

111
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,136
Perhaps.

112
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,432
Okay, you know what?
Fine, you are a genius, Peter.

113
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,063
As a matter of fact, let's make it official.

114
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,233
You ever heard
of the MacArthur genius grant?

115
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,310
Perhaps.

116
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,038
Well, if you quallfy as a genius...

117
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,580
the Foundation will give you
a $500,000 grant...

118
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,274
just to sit around
and do whatever you want.

119
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:28,150
Wow! Imagine what a genius like me
could do with all that money!

120
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:30,822
all right, Cloris Leachman,
I've bought you legally.

121
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,185
Now juggle these beanbags.

122
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,553
I don't know how to juggle-

123
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,251
God help you, Cloris!
Juggle the beanbags!

124
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,556
You may begin your exam now.

125
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,800
A dog says...

126
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:52,902
A cow says...

127
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:56,645
Of course, of course.

128
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:01,516
Well, here they are, Brian. My test results.
Read them and weep.

129
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,047
Peter, according to this,
you're not a genius.

130
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,148
In fact, you're mentally retarded.

131
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,951
Oh, yeah?
Well, would a mentally retarded guy...

132
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:12,087
have hired a bulldozer with a drunk driver
to leveI half of his house...

133
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,462
in celebration of his fantastic test results?

134
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:15,968
Maybe.

135
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:17,102
Uh-oh.

136
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,665
Congratulations.

137
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,944
So, as you can see, you are just
over the line of mentaI retardation.

138
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,447
Don't you mean, just under the line?

139
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,450
The day I'm corrected by a...

140
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:36,347
I'm sorry. Just please trust the analysis.

141
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,185
Hello. Sally?

142
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,782
Hey, it's Peter Griffin.

143
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:44,294
That's right, senior prom.
Yeah. Yeah, it's been a while, yeah.

144
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,362
So, listen.

145
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,395
I just found out I'm retarded.

146
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:51,664
And I'm just calling to let you know...

147
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,833
you might want to get yourself tested.

148
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:57,534
Hello?

149
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:00,677
Peter, mentaI retardation usually happens
before you're born.

150
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,840
It isn't something you can catch.
Don't you think you're overreacting?

151
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,282
Well, excuse me for being retarded.

152
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,410
My whole world
has been turned upside down.

153
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:10,011
Black is east, up is white.

154
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:14,252
You know, Peter, I hate to say "I told you
so" about not being a genius, but...

155
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,262
Yeah!!! In your fucking face, fuck wad!!

156
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,993
I'm sorry about that.

157
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:25,730
I can't believe this is happening to me.
I can never go back to schooI again.

158
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,237
Oh, yes, Meg, yes.

159
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,638
Yes, everything was going
swimmingly for you untiI this.

160
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:32,609
Yes, this is the thing
that will ruin your reputation.

161
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:36,239
Not your years of grotesque appearance
or awkward sociaI graces...

162
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,045
or that Felix Unger-ish way
you clear your sinuses.

163
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:40,448
No, no, no, it's this.

164
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,181
Do you hear yourself talk?
I might kill you tonight.

165
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:45,357
Peter, you're still you.

166
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,449
No piece of paper from the city
is gonna tell me...

167
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,790
you're any different
from the man I married.

168
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,659
And your life's not gonna change
because of it.

169
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,832
What is that?

170
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,797
Oh, my God, what are they doing?

171
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,771
Why are they trying
to publicly humiliate me like this?

172
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,535
I mean, what's the purpose...
Ooh, shiny red ball.

173
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,968
Peter, watch out!

174
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,410
So what can I do for you, Peter?

175
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:13,383
Well, Joe, I need to talk to you
about something kind of personal.

176
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:15,351
- Shoot.
- Well, you know, I took this test...

177
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:19,914
and it sort of turns out
that I'm technically mentally retarded.

178
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,888
And, you know, I just wanted to ask...

179
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,030
you know, how do you deaI with it?

180
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,758
- DeaI with what?
- You know, with being retarded.

181
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,233
Peter, I'm not retarded. I'm handicapped.

182
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,803
Now you're just splitting hairs.

183
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,935
Hi, Cleveland!

184
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,532
Hi, Joseph!

185
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:41,443
What's the story, morning glory?
What's the word, hummingbird?

186
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:43,538
Have you heard?
Peter Griffin is slow!

187
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:46,914
Can he still drive a car?
Can he drink at a bar?

188
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:50,284
Will they let him have kids?
Is his life on the skids?

189
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:53,825
Hello, Mrs. Griffin,
it's your neighbor, Quagmire!

190
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:57,623
Now that Peter's mentaI,
You probably have some needs!

191
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,430
He's retarded!
Peter is!

192
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,799
He's retarded!
Peter is!

193
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:09,534
He's retarded!
Peter is slow!

194
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,743
Griffin. Party of two.

195
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,076
Mr. Griffin, we've been expecting you.

196
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,980
Peter, relax. It's for liability reasons.

197
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,916
Now, let's just try to enjoy our meaI.

198
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,250
I kind of get the helmet.
But what's with the water wings?

199
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:24,687
Well, you did order the soup.

200
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,815
Like something could happen...

201
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:30,828
Get me out!

202
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:34,829
These water wings didn't help at all.

203
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,666
This is the worst day of my life.

204
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,364
Now, there are plenty of people
who have had worse days.

205
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,641
A parking ticket. I was gone five minutes.

206
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,974
How could this day get any worse?

207
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,047
Oh, my God.

208
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:57,647
Oh, no!

209
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:02,819
I wish I could just close my eyes
and make all this go away.

210
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,520
Peter, look out!

211
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:06,189
Holy crap!

212
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:07,990
Oh, my God!

213
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,431
Mr. Tucker, are you all right?

214
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:12,834
Do I look like I'm all right?
My back is broken and my leg is twisted!

215
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:15,168
Oh, my God! Your hooker's dead.

216
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,606
Well, she was already dead,
but that doesn't excuse...

217
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,974
Wait a minute.
You're Peter Griffin, the retarded fellow.

218
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,070
- Yeah.
- Well, then don't worry about it.

219
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,672
Wait a minute. You mean
you're not even gonna call the cops?

220
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:28,015
Oh, my God.
I could get away with anything.

221
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:32,084
"And on the sixth day, God said:

222
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,092
"'Let the Earth bring forth
the living creatures and-"'

223
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,593
Bible fight!

224
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,793
- Sorry. Retarded.
- That's okay then.

225
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,538
- Don't know any better.
- Bless your heart.

226
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,100
Jeez, didn't you hear me a second ago?
I'm retarded.

227
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,343
You're just curious.

228
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:55,003
Well, let me show you
how everything works down there.

229
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:58,984
Hey, everyone.

230
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:02,521
Say hello to my state-appointed
inspirationaI sociaI worker, Vern.

231
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,020
It's truly a pleasure to meet you all.

232
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:07,524
Hey, Peter, looks like you've got yourself
one super family.

233
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:10,094
High five! all right!

234
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:15,194
So, Vern, what exactly is it that you do?

235
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,997
I'm here to lend a hand
to my main man, Peter.

236
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,366
- Right, Peter?
- Right.

237
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,838
High five! all right!

238
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:23,942
Done.

239
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:26,474
- Peter!
- What? I don't know any better.

240
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,240
Peter, I don't like this.

241
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:31,111
You are really starting to take advantage
of this whole situation.

242
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:32,980
Peter's just expressing himself.

243
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,019
High five for expressing yourself, Peter.

244
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,918
High five! all right!

245
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:42,827
This man seems bent on diluting
the already watered-down significance...

246
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,259
of the elevated hand slap.

247
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,331
- Hey, Stewie, high five.
- Well, it's about time.

248
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,524
- Psych.
- Damn!

249
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:50,329
I look even more foolish
than when I was at that cocktall party.

250
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:53,663
all right, you're gonna love this. So...
Hang on a sec.

251
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,547
Okay, so these two black guys
walk into a bar, and the bartender looks-

252
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:11,918
Hey, what are you guys talking about?

253
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:14,049
I was just telling a joke.

254
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:17,457
So, the bartender looks around and says:

255
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,827
"What'll you two fine gentlemen have?"

256
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:24,468
And they paid their tab
and couldn't have been more courteous.

257
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:29,529
all right, my first trip to a fast-food joint
as a retarded guy.

258
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,940
Excuse me, pardon me, coming through.
SpeciaI needs.

259
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,604
Yeah, I'll have a... Is this thing on?

260
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:39,580
Attention, restaurant customers.
Testicles. That is all.

261
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:40,845
Give me that.

262
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:45,151
Sorry, folks. Oh, my God.
Is that what my voice sounds like?

263
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:48,121
It's all whiney and nasally.

264
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,024
You know what?
I'm just gonna get my own food.

265
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,098
- Peter, get back here.
- No freaking way.

266
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:56,428
The fryolator. I am so taking this.

267
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,474
Lois, you look worse than
that Rocky Dennis kid from Mask.

268
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,908
Rocky, I don't even know
what you look like.

269
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:09,008
- Can I touch your face?
- Of course, Diana.

270
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:10,741
Oh, God.

271
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:13,749
Oh, God. What is this?

272
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:16,578
What is all this?

273
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:19,121
Am I touching the outside of a house?

274
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,089
Oh, God! You're a monster.

275
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,821
I'm beautifuI on the inside.

276
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:26,022
Yeah, but, Rocky, there's a limit.

277
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:30,925
What is this now?
Does your face have a pelvis?

278
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:35,798
Oh, God, what have I done?
I'm the worst husband ever.

279
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,637
Make that the worst father ever.

280
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:40,906
Hi, I'm Agent Jessup from Child Services.
I'm here to take your kids away.

281
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,071
What? Why?

282
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,581
Because you're mentally unfit
to take care of them.

283
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:45,650
No way!

284
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:46,877
- Oh, my God.
- Finally.

285
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,547
I can't believe they took the kids away.

286
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,894
Well, at least Cleveland offered
to take care of them.

287
00:14:56,428 --> 00:15:00,990
Sorry you have to share a bed, boys.
I'm a little short on space.

288
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,590
Have a good sleep.

289
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:05,030
Hey, Chris...

290
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,305
whatever happened to Geena Davis?

291
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,872
She used to be in movies,
but she's not in movies anymore.

292
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,341
She's attractive enough...

293
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,935
but when she smiles,
you see too much gum.

294
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:17,377
Not a good tooth-to-gum ratio.

295
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,376
Chris?

296
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,849
I'll tell you tomorrow.

297
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:25,186
Thanks for letting my friends sleep over,
Mr. Brown.

298
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,417
No problem, Meg.

299
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:30,017
If y'all get hungry,
there's some cottage cheese in the fridge.

300
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:33,757
I'm gonna get me a spoonfuI now
before y'all have at it.

301
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,630
Oh, my God.
Craig Hoffman's new car is so cooI.

302
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:38,794
Oh, my God. Totally. I love the color.

303
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:40,394
Really? What color is it?

304
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:42,303
It's like blue, kind of blue-green.

305
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,606
It's the same color as his eyes.

306
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,645
Wow. I bet he looks so hot driving it.

307
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,179
I heard he bought it from his dad.

308
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,647
Yeah, I remember his dad
dropped him off at schooI in it...

309
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,240
one time when he was a freshman.

310
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,411
- Doesn't his dad live in Hartford?
- I think so.

311
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,045
My aunt Sheila lives in Hartford.

312
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,920
They have a mall there that's pretty cooI.
It's part underground.

313
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:01,356
That's awesome.

314
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,428
Damn it, you guys are boring
the crap out of me.

315
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,394
It's stupid, mindless chatter, is what it is.

316
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:06,521
You know what I'm gonna do?

317
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,157
I'm just gonna go back to my place
and rent a dirty movie.

318
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:10,963
This is ridiculous.

319
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,697
That was weird. Oh, well.
Hey, let's compare breasts.

320
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,302
Lois? Hey, how you doing, honey?

321
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,538
Listen, there's no toilet paper
in the bathroom...

322
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,137
so, I'm just gonna...

323
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:24,783
There we go.

324
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,715
Oh, God. Hang on!

325
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,951
The doctors still don't know how
much longer she's gonna have to be here.

326
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,321
I feeI horrible, Brian.

327
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:38,055
I put Lois in the hospitaI, and I lost the
kids.

328
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,927
This is turning out worse
than Stewie's iPod commerciaI.

329
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,810
Peter, you just need to show
what a good father you are.

330
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,710
Then you can get
the kids back from Cleveland.

331
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,646
Wait a second, Brian. You're right.

332
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:02,380
And the best way to do that is to show
what a terrible father Cleveland is.

333
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:05,480
This plan is so perfect, it's retarded.

334
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,352
Good evening. I'm Dan Rather.

335
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:12,896
And tonight on CBS News...

336
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:15,432
seven Saudi soldiers sodomize...

337
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:19,766
severaI of Saddam's
southern settlement squatters.

338
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:28,738
I'm Dan Rather.

339
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,274
all right, come on, ladies. Right this way.

340
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,749
This'll show them
that Cleveland's not fit to be a parent.

341
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:36,878
So, tell me, is there any tread left
on the tires at all?

342
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:40,254
Or at this point, would it be like
throwing a hot dog down a hallway?

343
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,224
Oh, my Lord. Look who's here.

344
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:45,023
Agent Jessup,
look at all these prostitutes.

345
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,224
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven

346
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,662
Seven. Seven prostitutes.

347
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,259
This is a shakedown.

348
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,100
Mr. Griffin, this isn't going to work.

349
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:57,573
Yeah. Peter, you and five
of those prostitutes, get out.

350
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:03,578
So, in conclusion, Peter Griffin,
you've inspired me...

351
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,113
to distrust
all mentally challenged parents.

352
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,207
Thank you, Your Honor.

353
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:10,720
And thank you, Agent Jessup,
for your comically misleading remarks.

354
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,815
Mr. Griffin, do you have anything to say
in your defense...

355
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,986
as to why this court should return custody
of your children to you?

356
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,065
Your Honor, I would like to call
to the stand my surprise witness...

357
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:22,133
The Ghost That Never Lies.

358
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:26,004
But I'm the only one
who can see him and hear him...

359
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,130
so I'll let everyone know
what he's saying and doing.

360
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,367
Objection, Your Honor. This is ridiculous.

361
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,171
Overruled. I'll allow it.

362
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,768
You better be going somewhere
with this, Mr. Griffin.

363
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,142
Thank you, Your Honor.

364
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:37,875
Ghost That Never Lies...

365
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:41,282
did you witness the events
that took place on that fatefuI day?

366
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,951
You did? Well, how interesting.

367
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:47,989
And, do you see the culprit or culprits
in this courtroom today?

368
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,420
You do?

369
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:53,525
Well, would you kindly
point him or them out for this court?

370
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,763
Don't point at me, you jackass!

371
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,598
Well, if there's nothing further,
I hereby sentence-

372
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:01,298
Wait, wait, wait.
Your Honor, there is something further.

373
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:03,601
Look, I know I screwed up big time.

374
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,973
But I only did it
so I could get my kids back.

375
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,045
I love them.

376
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,580
And I think it's a bum rap
that just because I'm retarded...

377
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:11,148
that makes me an unfit parent.

378
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,048
There are plenty of unfit parents out there
who aren't retarded...

379
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,279
but they get to keep their kids.

380
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:19,153
Bing Crosby, Joan Crawford.
I think the Ramseys still got one left.

381
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:22,421
I just want them back, Your Honor,
and you're the only one who can help me.

382
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:23,517
What do you say?

383
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,563
Are you kidding? You're a monster.

384
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,427
In fact, if I could...

385
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:31,466
I would put you in a place where you
would be removed from the generaI public.

386
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,903
Perhaps locked in a big, secure building
with other dangerous people...

387
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,907
for a pre-determined period of time...

388
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,307
based on the nature and degree
of your offense.

389
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:42,346
Unfortunately, as far as I know,
no such place exists.

390
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:45,075
So I have no choice but to set you free.

391
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,549
Does that mean I get my kids back?

392
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:48,586
Absolutely not. Case closed.

393
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,711
Oh, crap!

394
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,282
It was prison you were thinking of. Prison.

395
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:53,983
I already banged the hammer.

396
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,553
And now,
back to Jake and the Fatman.

397
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:01,690
Hey, look over here on the carpet.
That's a cigarette butt.

398
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,791
This is probably evidence.

399
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:09,406
What do you think was in that Danish?

400
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,476
You think it was cheese?

401
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,340
'Cause I got a little problem with cheese.

402
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:19,349
Hey, I'm talking about evidence here.
There's lipstick on it.

403
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:22,545
Yeah, well, can you bring it over to me?

404
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:25,054
I can't move it. This is a crime scene.

405
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:28,893
Well, can you describe it to me?

406
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:31,221
You know what? Forget it.
I'll take care of this, okay?

407
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,663
Oh, no. Just...

408
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:39,864
Just let me close my eyes for a minute.

409
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,167
Look, I know his wife is a smoker.

410
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:44,606
Just yesterday,
when we saw her at the country club...

411
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,270
she had a cigarette in her hand.

412
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,410
What, so that's it, Peter?
You're just giving up?

413
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,009
I don't know what else to do, Brian.

414
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:58,214
I guess we're never
gonna be a family again.

415
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:00,518
- Hi, Peter.
- Oh, my God, Lois.

416
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,388
- You're all better.
- That's right.

417
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:05,657
And the doctors say I'll smell like
French fries for the next six months.

418
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:06,753
I'll enjoy that.

419
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:09,425
And, Peter, I got a surprise for you.

420
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:10,660
You got the kids back.

421
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,261
I love you so much,
delicious French-fry wife.

422
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:17,809
Now we can live with you again
even though you're a dangerous retard.

423
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:21,310
Don't say "retard," Chris.
We prefer to be called "little people. "

424
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:24,075
Because there's nothing wrong
with being mentally challenged.

425
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:26,912
In fact, I've learned
that we are superior people.

426
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,317
Above all you dumb brainy smarties.

427
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:32,788
Someday, you will beg us for mercy
and we will consider it.

428
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:36,190
Isn't it wonderfuI
that everything's back to normaI?

429
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,262
Yeah.

430
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,056
Oh, God. Nobody move.

431
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,500
- What is it?
- Nothing. Nothing. I'll get it.
